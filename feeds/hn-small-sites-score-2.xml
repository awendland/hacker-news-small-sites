        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Like many people across the world, I’m using my quarantine effectively: by catching up on all the video games I wasn’t able to play while traveling. The game at the top of my list? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2018_video_game)">Spider-Man</a>, which was widely recognized as one of the top games of 2018. The game is features an open-world, which means you can travel around the game map as you see fit. And since Spider-Man, canonically, lives in real-life New York City, this means you’ll spend hours webbing around an incredibly detailed version of the city that never sleeps.</p>

<p>If you’ve spent any appreciable amount of time in New York, the in-game world will immediately feel familiar. The developers nailed the look and feel of the city. I found myself using real-world landmarks to orient myself as I slinged (slunged?) across Manhattan. The game leans into this realism—it even includes a challenge where you can take photos of in-game landmarks. While some are unique to the Marvel universe, like Avengers Tower and Uncle Ben’s grave, many exist in the real world and are faithfully reproduced within the game: Williamsburg/Brooklyn/Manhattan/Queensboro Bridges all make an appearance, as does Grand Central, Madison Square Garden, Saint Patrick’s Cathedral, Columbus Circle, the High Line and many more points of reference. As you’re swinging through the city, you’re treated to great views of Manhattan’s skyline, anchored by the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and Freedom Tower. Except, it’s <em>not</em> the Freedom Tower, despite being located in the exact same location as its real-life counterpart. Why are equally famous buildings like the Empire State Building accurately depicted, but the Freedom Tower isn’t?</p>

<p>Here’s what the “Freedom Tower” looks like in the game:
<img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/spiderman-1wtc.png" alt="In-Game 1WTC">
<em>(credit to Polygon because I was too lazy to get this off my PS4 myself)</em></p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the in-game design looks to be based on Libeskind’s original design for Freedom Tower (an interesting recap of the changes can be found <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/daniel-libeskinds-world-trade-center-change-of-heart">here</a>), lending further credence to the theory that this building is supposed to be 1WTC.</p>

<p>My curiosity was further piqued when I learned that the <em>real</em> One World Trade Center was actually in the game during a demo at E3 in June of 2018, less than 4 months before the final game was set to be released to the public!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/1wtc_e3.png" alt="Real-life 1WTC in Spider-Man demo from E3 2018"></p>

<p>This deadline is even closer than it appears at first glance as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#RTM">“gold master”</a> is finalized weeks before release date so manufacturers have time to make and distribute the game to retailers. This change must have been implemented at the 11th hour.</p>

<p>And even after swapping the model out, they featured the building prominently on the home screen in the released version of the video game!
<img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/spiderman-start.png" alt="Start screen">
<em>(<a href="https://www.noobfeed.com/features/1119/marvel-s-spider-man-how-do-you-access-new-game-plus-and-ultimate-difficulty">credit</a>)</em></p>

<p>So <em>why</em> isn’t the real-life 1 WTC featured? At this point, we can eliminate time and budget constraints because we know the model already existed and was implemented before launch. We know that the designers thought this building was important as it’s the first thing you notice when starting the game.</p>

<p>I wish to briefly introduce <strong>Buccini’s razor</strong>—if something fun disappears unexpectedly, the cause is litigation (real or imagined).</p>

<p>It turns out that just like an author can copyright their book and a musician can copyright a song, an architect can copyright a building. Sure enough, here’s the copyright record for One World Trade Center:
<img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/copyright_record.png" alt="Record from [copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/); can't deeplink the record but you can find it yourself by using the document record seen above"></p>

<p>At this point, I had a strong feeling copyright law was the reason for the change. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpidermanPS4/comments/9grnr8/freedom_tower/">internet</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpidermanPS4/comments/9d3paw/the_real_reason_for_the_redesigned_freedom_tower/">seems</a> <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/191635-marvels-spider-man/76988485">to</a> <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/one-world-trade-center-has-been-removed-from-spider-man-ps4.1465315/">agree</a>.</p>

<p>As luck<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> would have it, there was <a href="https://www.nexsenpruet.com/professionals/jeff-reichard">an expert in architectural copyright</a> right around the corner from my house here in Greensboro! Jeffrey was kind enough to spend a few minutes of his time thinking about this not-at-all-important question.</p>

<p>First, Jeffrey noted that <em>copyrights expire</em>. Just as music and books can pass into the public domain for anyone to replicate freely, you can also build an exact replica of the Empire State Building here in the United States if you so choose. Generally, any building constructed after December 1, 1990 is covered by the <a href="https://www.djc.com/news/ae/11151054.html">Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act</a>. This would explain why older structures are replicated faithfully but the Freedom Tower is not.</p>

<p>However, this doesn’t tell the full story. As Jeffrey noted, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/120">17 U.S. Code § 120(a)</a> “provides an exception related to pictorial representations of of buildings that are visible from a public place. Therefore, I am not sure exactly why they changed it in the video game.”</p>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle lies at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo5A_fuDgtk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2666">end of the credits</a>, where the creators of the game specifically thank the owners of certain famous buildings in New York, including the Empire State Building. I found this curious as the Empire State Building should be doubly safe: it was constructed long before 1990 so it is not covered under copyright law, and it is visible from a public place so it should be exempt from any potential copyrights. But look closer. You’ll see that they are acknowledging the <em>trademark</em> holders, NOT the <em>copyright</em> holders.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.photosecrets.com/buildings-copyright-and-trademarks">As this page</a> helpfully explains, applying a trademark to the building limits how the building’s image can be used in the sale of goods and services (like video games)! The credits hint that the video game creators obtained limited licenses to use the trademark, i.e. the distinctive design and appearance of the building, for certain buildings such as the Flatiron Building.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Therefore, the most likely answer is that the distinctive shape of 1 World Trade Center is either trademarked (although I could not find it within USPTO databases) or is so recognizable that it is easily defensible via a common law trademark and the game developers were unable to secure a license to use the trademark before their deadline.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzuHo80U2M">Sony just announced</a> an expansion to the Spider-Man video game, so perhaps the additional time and the demonstrated popularity of the first installment will help resolve this issue for the upcoming title.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          


<p>In this blogpost, we show how libFuzzer, the LLVM fuzz testing library part, can be employed with rev.ng in order to perform coverage-guided blackbox fuzzing of executable binaries.
We also show that our approach is fast, semantic-preserving and simply requires to implement the <a href="https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/tutorial/libFuzzerTutorial.md#hello-world-fuzzer">harness function</a>, as occurs for programs with source code available.</p>
<p>Note that this work is based on the rev.ng lifter, the open-source component at the core of the decompiler we're building.
The <a href="https://github.com/revng/revng">publicly available</a> version is a bit outdated, but we are in the process of pushing out new versions on a more regular basis.
<a href="https://twitter.com/_revng">Stay</a> <a href="https://rev.ng/newsletter.html">tuned</a>.</p>

          
          
            <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Fuzzing is a widespread technique for discovering software security vulnerabilities, where randomly mutated inputs are fed to a target program. It underwent a breakthrough around 2014, with the introduction of <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">AFL</a> and it has been gaining popularity steadly ever since.
Its success is in large part due to its effectiveness in identifying <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl#bugs">real world security vulnerabilities</a>. What makes it innovative is its <em>coverage-based</em> fuzzing approach, which prioritizes inputs that lead to traverse previously unexplored execution paths.
This coverage information is used to drive the fuzzing strategy, and the greater the coverage, the higher the chances of finding bugs. To collect coverage information, the input program is instrumented at compile-time. Then, at run-time, new inputs are continuously generated through a feedback-mechanism.</p>
<p>Other state-of-the-art coverage-guided fuzz testing frameworks include <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libFuzzer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/honggfuzz">Honggfuzz</a>.</p>
<p>While whitebox (source-available) fuzzing is a relatively consolidated research area, assessing the security of closed-source software is still largely an open challenge. Existing works primarily resort to <em>dynamic binary translation</em> which injects the instrumentation dynamically. Main examples comprise <a href="https://github.com/mirrorer/afl/blob/master/qemu_mode/README.qemu">AFL QEMU user-mode</a> and <a href="https://project.inria.fr/FranceJapanICST/files/2019/04/19-Kyoto-Fuzzing_Binaries_using_Dynamic_Instrumentation.pdf">Honggfuzz combined with QBDI</a>. This process is straightforward, but comes with a significant runtime overhead and, consequently, a reduced effectiveness.</p>
<p>Additionally, running a whole program can be sometimes very hard - if feasible at all.
For instance, booting a firmware image is not always manageable. In such situations, fuzzing only delimited portions of code might be a winning strategy.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>rev.ng features a static binary translator, that, given a Linux program compiled for architecture <em>A</em> (e.g., AArch64) can produce an equivalent program for another architecture <em>B</em> (e.g., x86-64), or even for the same architecture <em>A</em>. The input binary code is converted into a higher-level intermediate representation, LLVM IR, which makes it suitable for performing a wide range of analyses and transformations. We have been able to translate and properly execute programs of significant size and complexity such as <code>perl</code> and <code>gcc</code>.</p>
<p>Now, the intuition is that we can leverage the static binary translator to inject the necessary instrumentation to perform coverage-guided fuzzing.
This approach is purely <em>ahead-of-time</em>, since both the translation happens and the instrumentation take place offline.
This results in significantly reducing the run-time overhead.</p>
<p>More specifically, libFuzzer - which is usually employed in presence of the source code - can be combined with the recompilable LLVM IR module produced by rev.ng. The output is a standalone binary that keeps feeding new inputs to the translated program.</p>
<p>When fuzzing <em>less</em>, the terminal pager, we obtained the following results:</p>

<p>Compared with AFL in QEMU-mode, we got speedups ranging from 20× to 40×.
Check out <a href="https://rev.ng/downloads/iccst-18-paper.pdf">our previous paper</a> for a more detailed rundown on performance.</p>
<p>As a result, our approach supports <strong>in-memory coverage-guided fuzzing</strong> of individual functions even when the source code is not available.
Since, by design, one can fuzz, for instance, an ARM binary after translating it to x86-64, it is architecture-independent as well.
Moreover we can test distinct portions of code separately, without executing the whole program. This is particularly beneficial, for instance, for self-contained libraries and embedded firmwares.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the fuzzing process. At the last stage of our optimization passes, the fuzzing framework produces, among other things, a C header declaring all the collected functions for the user.
After creating the harness function, the compiler driver is called to build the fuzzer binary.</p>
<p><img alt="overview" src="https://rev.ng/blog/fuzzing/overview.svg"></p>
<h2>The fuzzing process</h2>
<p>Briefly, our fuzzing framework aims to:</p>
<ol>
<li>preserve functional correctness and achieve good performance;</li>
<li>enable fuzzing of individual functions;</li>
<li>enable hooking of functions;</li>
<li>reuse existing sanitizers.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this stage, these goals are achieved by implementing three LLVM passes that run over the recompilable unit of LLVM IR: an instrumentation pass (<em>PatchReturn</em>), a pass that generates helper stubs and C headers for every lifted function (<em>WrapperGen</em>), and a pass for function hooking when needed (<em>FuncHook</em>).</p>
<h3>Functional correctness and performance</h3>
<p>Two major challenges typical in static binary translation are preserving both semantics correctness and performance of the original program. To have both, we adopt a two-fold approach, which consists in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collecting all the basic blocks of the original program in a single LLVM function (known as <code>root</code>). While not extremely fast and prone to less optimizations, this guarantees functional correctness.</li>
<li>Identifying the start and end addresses of every function and isolating their code into distinct LLVM functions (so called <em>isolated functions</em>). This allows for more aggressive optimizations, but may be subject to inaccuracies in the CFG-recovering phase.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>root</code> function is intended to start the execution and migrate it to the appropriate isolated function, where it will stay for most of the time.
A caveat though: since function boundaries detection and data code separation boil down to be an undecidable problem, we need a way to continue flawlessly with the execution if, for instance, an unexpected jump target is met in an isolated function. 
Without such a mechanism, semantic correctness would not be guaranteed. To address this issue, we let the code run at full speed while inside an isolated function, and fall back to <code>root</code> only if an unforeseen jump, e.g., a misidentified return instruction, is encountered.</p>
<p>As a comparison, see how the <code>root</code> function and the isolated <code>main</code> (known as <em>revng translated block</em>) respectively look like in the LLVM IR:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>define</span> <span>void</span> <span>@root</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span>dispatcher:</span>
    <span>%1</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span> <span>i64</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span><span>*</span> <span>@pc</span>
    <span>switch</span> <span>i64</span> <span>%1</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>i64</span> <span>0x1000</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span> <span>%rtb_main</span>
        <span>i64</span> <span>0x2000</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span> <span>%rtb_func1</span>
        <span>i64</span> <span>0x3000</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span> <span>%rtb_func2</span>
    <span>]</span>

<span>rtb_main:</span>
    <span>; Load rdi and rsi</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>void</span> <span>@rtb_main</span><span>(</span><span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>rdi</span><span>)</span>
<span>rtb_func1:</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>void</span> <span>@rtb_func1</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>define</span> <span>i64</span> <span>@rtb_main</span><span>(</span><span>i64</span> <span>%rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>%rdi</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>; Push rbp on the stack</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>void</span> <span>@rtb_func1</span><span>()</span>

    <span>; Push rbx on the stack</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>void</span> <span>@rtb_func2</span><span>()</span>
    <span>ret</span> <span>void</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As shown in the snippet, the dispatcher inside <code>root</code> is responsible for redirecting the execution to the respective isolated function as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Fuzzing of individual functions</h3>
<p>All the isolated functions found are possible candidates for fuzzing. Now, we need a way to let the translated program run so that all the initialization routines (e.g., the memory allocator) can be carried out, and pause the execution of the <em>guest</em> (the translated program) when the user-defined entrypoint is met (be it <code>main</code> or whenever we need to back out of the program).</p>
<p>This is what the first instrumentation pass is meant to do, i.e., to allow to return from any isolated function to <code>root</code>. The migration is necessary to give control back to <code>LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput</code>, the function in charge of guiding the fuzzing process.
As an example, suppose we need to initialize the program and return to the fuzzing context only once a startup routine (<code>init_vars</code>) has been executed. The transition back would be the following one:</p>
<p><img alt="flow" src="https://rev.ng/blog/fuzzing/flow.svg"></p>
<p>The snippet below shows how we insert a sentinel variable to make such a transition before returning from <code>init_vars</code>.
As can be seen, the terminator block <code>rtb_init_vars.0x1d</code>, which is supposed to return to <code>main</code>, is no longer reachable - instead, we return to <code>root</code>, which ultimately returns to <code>LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>rtb_init_vars:</span>
    <span>store</span> <span>i1</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>i1</span><span>*</span> <span>@ReturnFromFuzzing</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>void</span> <span>@unwind_back</span><span>(</span><span>i32</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>     <span>; Stack unwinding mechanism is used here to return to root</span>
    <span>unreachable</span>

<span>rtb_init_vars.0x1d:</span>                                        <span>; Basic block to return to main is now unreachable</span>
    <span>ret</span> <span>void</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The second pass, on the other hand, generates a wrapper around each isolated function in the form of a C header (<code>generated_wrappers.h</code>), thus allowing normal function invocation without inspecting the ABI used by the original program.</p>
<p>Note, though, that we cannot invoke the isolated function directly: we still need to pass through <code>root</code> in order to maintain the functional correctness. 
So, for every isolated function, whose prototype is retrieved through dedicated analyses, we set up the emulated program counter (which points to the respective isolated function), the emulated stack pointer, and the function arguments. If the function is supposed to return, a struct with the possible arguments to be returned is filled.</p>
<h3>Hooking functions</h3>
<p>The third pass allows the user to easily replace existing functions (like <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, <code>send</code>, <code>recv</code> and so forth). This turns out to be useful when we want to add user-defined callbacks, logging or inject raw data, e.g., when a function expects data coming from a socket.</p>
<p>For every isolated function, we take the following steps to perform function hooking:</p>
<ol>
<li>make its symbol have <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#linkage-types">weak linkage</a>;</li>
<li>clone it;</li>
<li>wrap up the original implementation in a dedicated function.</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows us to bypass the <em>One Definition Rule</em>. Hence, if a symbol is redefined, it will override the original …</p></div></div>

September 17, 2020 | https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/09/16/toc-approves-kubeedge-as-incubating-project/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/09/16/toc-approves-kubeedge-as-incubating-project/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Today, the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) voted to accept <a href="https://kubeedge.io/en/">KubeEdge</a> as an incubation-level hosted project.</p>



<p>KubeEdge is an open source system for extending containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at the edge. It is built on top of Kubernetes and provides infrastructure support for network, application deployment, and metadata synchronization between the cloud and the edge.</p>



<p>“We designed KubeEdge to address three major challenges in edge computing – network reliability between the cloud and edge, resource constraint on edge nodes, and scalability challenges of highly distributed edge architectures,” said Zefeng Wang and Yin Ding, KubeEdge maintainers. “By extending cloud native technologies to the edge, KubeEdge forms a complete edge cloud computing ecosystem. We are very excited to continue to make the project more robust as it moves to incubation.”</p>



<p>KubeEdge was accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project in March 2019, and released version 1.0 in June 2019. The KubeEdge team now releases quarterly, timed with the release of upstream Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since joining CNCF, KubeEdge has added more than <a href="https://kubeedge.devstats.cncf.io/d/18/overall-project-statistics-table?orgId=1">395 Contributors</a> from 25 organizations. The project has 14 maintainers from 5 different organizations, including Arm, China Unicom, Huawei, infoblox.com, and inovex.de, and is used in production by <a href="https://huaweicloud.com/">Huawei Cloud</a>, <a href="https://kubesphere.io/">KubeSphere</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md#raisecom-technology-coltd">Raisecom</a>, <a href="https://cucc.wocloud.cn/">WoCloud</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md#xinghai-iot">Xinghai IoT</a>, and more.</p>



<p>“KubeEdge solves a complex and unique use case of running containerized applications on edge devices, which benefits the cloud computing ecosystem as a whole,” said Alena Prokharchyk, CNCF TOC member. “Its architecture meets the reliability, availability, and extensibility criteria needed for further growth and adoption. We look forward to seeing new and improved features as the project moves to this new level.”</p>



<p><strong>Main KubeEdge Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Cloud-Edge Reliable Collaboration: Ensure reliable messages delivery without loss over an unstable cloud-edge network.</li><li>Edge Autonomy: Ensure edge nodes run autonomously, and the applications on edge run normally, even when the cloud-edge network is unstable, or the edge is offline and restarted.</li><li>Edge Device Management: Managing edge devices through Kubernetes native APIs implemented by CRD.</li><li>Lightweight Edge Agent: Extremely lightweight Edge Agent&nbsp; (EdgeCore) to run on the resource-constrained edge.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Notable Milestones:</strong></p>



<ul><li>&gt; 2,500 Commits</li><li>&gt; 2,900 GitHub Stars</li><li>&gt; 780 Forks</li></ul>



<p>KubeEdge is an active participant in the CNCF community and contributes to the upstream Kubernetes project to solve common issues. The project is built on Kubernetes and integrates with other CNCF projects, including containerd and CRI-O as a lightweight container runtime, Prometheus for metrics on the edge, and Envoy for ingress. It also uses gRPC to offer cloud edge remote calls for applications.</p>



<p>The KubeEdge team also <a href="https://thenewstack.io/kubeedge-and-its-role-in-multi-access-edge-computing/">collaborated with LF Edge</a> in setting up the Akraino KubeEdge Edge Service Blueprint Family and Akraino Eliot Blueprint Family projects, which can be deployed at enterprise edges or as a cloud edge extension interfacing to the core telco network.</p>



<p>“Kubernetes is the de-facto orchestrator for cloud native services and is starting to evolve in future edge computing deployments,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO/COO of Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “KubeEdge plays an important role in bringing Kubernetes to the edge. We look forward to seeing how the project develops and pushes the Kubernetes community into new areas.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a CNCF-hosted project, joining incubating technologies Argo, CloudEvents, CNI, Contour, Cortex, CRI-O, Dragonfly, etcd, Falco, gRPC, Linkerd, NATS, Notary, OPA, OpenTracing, Operator Framework, Rook, SPIFFE, SPIRE, and Thanos, KubeEdge is part of a neutral foundation aligned with its technical interests, as well as the larger Linux Foundation, which provides governance, marketing support, and community outreach. For more information on maturity requirements for each level, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">CNCF Graduation Criteria</a>.</p>

					<h2>What, why &amp; who for ?</h2>
					<p>This document essentially contains an introduction to the relational algebra that is implemented in SIRA_PRISE. Depending on your background, you may already have some or very extensive knowledge about the subject, in which case you probably do not need to read this document.</p>
					<p>If, however, your knowledge of and about the Relational Model of Data was primarily/solely obtained through the usage of SQL-based systems, and terms such as "relvar", "relation" and "tuple" sound completely unfamiliar to you, then carefully studying this document is probably a sine qua non for you to
						understand and effectively use this new system you've got in your hands.</p>
					<p>This introduction is subdivided in several parts :&nbsp;</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The first part, "<a href="#Terminology">Terminology</a>", defines the components that lay the foundation for any relational database : type, value, tuple, relation, ... &nbsp;It is rather mathematical in nature and may therefore seem to be a bit alienating ("What the hell do IT&nbsp;professionals need
							mathematics for ?"), but let me assure you that understanding&nbsp;this part really is relevant and really is needed for you to understand part two properly.
						</li>
						<li>Part two, "<a href="#Relational_Algebra">Relational Algebra</a>", offers a detailed definition and discussion of all the operators of the algebra, which is the part of the relational model that every database user employs in every single query he/she writes and/or&nbsp;executes.
						</li>
						<li>Part two introduces the operators of the algebra, making abstraction of a very particular data type called the interval type. SIRA_PRISE offers support for interval types, and the third part, "<a href="#interval_types">The RA and interval types</a>", introduces how the operators of the algebra behave
							when faced with relations that hold interval-typed attributes.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>
						<a id="Terminology"></a>Terminology
					</h2>
					<p>You may have wondered, at some time, why "Relational databases" (and "Relational dbms's") are called how they are. You may have assumed that it must have had something to do with this thing called "Entity-Relationship modeling" that you may already have practiced at some point in your career. Your
						assumption was wrong. In fact, the first mention of the term "relational" in the context of data management even predates the invention of E/R modeling ... So where dóes the term come from ?</p>
					<p>Well, the term comes from something that we have presumably all been taught about in our math classes, somewhere between the age of 10 and 20, that thing being the "relation". The Relational Model of Data (RM for short) is no more or less than a mechanism to represent data in general, and which has that
						same mathematical concept of a relation as its key building brick. Before digging into the details of the algebra, it is first necessary to define a couple of terms that are frequently used when talking about the RM. That is where we will start this introduction of the relational algebra.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Set</i>
							</h3>
							<p>Lots of people collect things. Stamps, coins, rare books, art reproductions or even original art masterpieces, just name it and someone exists who collects it. You probably have spent some time in your life too, trying to build up some collection. If you have, doubtless that there have been some items
								that you have managed to collect more than once. It was problaby fun trading those "duplicates" with fellow collectors for items that you had not yet managed to collect. Well, a "collection" is a very fundamental concept in mathematics, one that is in fact needed to define what a "set" is.</p>
							<p>In mathematics, a "collection" is, loosely speaking, any possible gathering in any possible quantity of any possible things. The gathering of (chair, cloud, oak tree, chair) is a collection. Note that the collection has two chairs.</p>
							<p>Now, if a collection has the particular property that none of the items in the collection appear more than once, then we call this collection a "set". This property turns out to be a very useful and important one, and therefore sets, and set theory, are very important in mathematics. So important in fact
								that relational database technology could and would not even have been invented without them. Important enough also, to be repeated in bold :</p>
							<p>
								<b>A set is a collection that does not contain duplicates.<br> Something that does contain duplicates, is not a set.
								</b>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Type/Value</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>So {A,1,oak tree,patent} is a set. {A,patent,A} is not. Now, in the context of data management problems, which is what we're interested in, sets such as those&nbsp;are of course not very useful. In the context of data management, sets are mostly useful only if the items they contain are in some way
										"alike". In that context, we usually deal with sets that contain only numbers, only dates, or some such. Useful sets in data management are sets such as {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday} and {true, false}. Without attempting a formal and precise definition of the term, we can (and do) say that a
										Type is such a "useful" set. And a Value is one of the items contained in a Type. Which brings us to :</p>
									<p>
										<b>A Type is a set of Values.</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Additional remarks</i>
									</h4>
									<p>In data management, we will often need to speak about, or refer to, such Types. For that reason, it is customary that all the Types we use are assigned a name. The type {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday}, e.g. could be assigned the name 'Weekdays'. The type {true, false}, e.g. could be
										assigned the name 'Boolean'. Such that we can say :</p>
									<p>
										<b>A Type is a named set of Values.</b>
									</p>
									<p>You might wonder at the mutual dependency in the definition here. A type is a set of values, and a value is an item in a type. In the end, that doesn't really define much, does it ? Shouldn't we have some other definition of what a 'Value' is ? Well, for the purpose of this introduction, that isn't
										really necessary. The reason for this is that the RM (and the algebra) can work with just any set of types. The RM does not "fall apart" if the set of integers is not defined as a type, nor does the algebra. (It would be difficult to build a useful database without that type, but that's another issue.) And
										the most important consequence is that this observation is equally valid "the other way round" : the RM does not stop you from defining whatever type you like. The RM gives you no answer to the question when or why something is a value, and when or why not. As far as the RM is concerned, a value is whatever
										you want it to be, and a type is whatever set you define it to be. It only depends on whether you have a useful purpose for the type or not. A set such as {Em, C, G, ...} might look pretty insane and useless to most readers, but a guitar player would certainly have some good uses for a type holding the guitar
										chords as values ...</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Cartesian product</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>Looking at our example types Weekday and Boolean, it's not difficult to see how one can "pick a value from the first type, then pick a value from the second one, then arrange those two picked values to form a pair.". One example of such a pair would be (Monday, false). There are 10 such pairs possible,
										and those 10 pairs can be gathered into a set. Such a set turns out to be a very important concept in mathematics too, so important in fact that the concept of such a set is given a name : the "Cartesian Product".</p>
									<p>
										<b>The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all possible pairs formed from the items in those two sets.</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Remarks</i>
									</h4>
									<p>The term "Cartesian product" is not often encountered in the world of RM. The reason for&nbsp;this will become clear in the next few sections. Nevertheless it is worthwhile to reiterate in a more informal manner : A Cartesian product is a set, and the things that we find in that set are "pairs of other
										things", and those "other things" are precisely the things that are part of one of the sets that were used to form the Cartesian product.</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Relation (Traditional mathematics version)</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>Traditional set theory then goes on to define the concept of a "Relation" :</p>
									<p>A Relation is a subset of a Cartesian product of two sets.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Remarks</i>
									</h4>
								</li>
								<p>Examples of such relations are then : {(Monday, false),(Monday, true)}, {}, {(Tuesday, false),(Thursday, true)}, ...</p>
								<p>Once again it is worthwhile to reiterate in a more informal manner : A Relation is a set, and the things that we find in that set are "pairs of other things", and those "other things" are precisely the things that are part of one of the sets that were used to form the Cartesian product of which the
									Relation happens to be a subset.</p>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Generalized product</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>Following this definition, a relation can be (and is indeed) defined as being a set of pairs. For the context of data management problems, this definition isn't so useful, however. Indeed, when recording data about our customers, sales, ..., we usually record a lot more things than just two. So for the
										specific purpose of data management, the concept of a relation had to be "adapted" somewhat ("generalised" is the correct word, actually) to cater for that problem. It is not difficult to see how this can be done : instead of "picking values from two types and arrange those", one can also "pick one value from
										each of any number of types, and arrange those". The set that is formed by …</p></li></ol></li></ol></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 16 January 2015</em></p><p>It’s easy to view yourself as “not a <em>real</em> programmer.”  There are programs out
there that everyone uses, and it’s easy to put their developers on a pedestal.
Although developing large software projects isn’t easy, many times the basic
idea of that software is quite simple.  Implementing it yourself is a fun way to
show that you have what it takes to be a real programmer.  So, this is a
walkthrough on how I wrote my own simplistic Unix shell in C, in the hopes that
it makes other people feel that way too.</p>

<p>The code for the shell described here, dubbed <code>lsh</code>, is available on
<a href="https://github.com/brenns10/lsh">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><strong>University students beware!</strong> Many classes have assignments that ask you to
write a shell, and some faculty are aware of this tutorial and code.  If you’re
a student in such a class, you shouldn’t copy (or copy then modify) this code
without permission.  And even then, I would <a href="https://brennan.io/2016/03/29/dishonesty/">advise</a> against heavily relying on this tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="basic-lifetime-of-a-shell">Basic lifetime of a shell</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a shell from the top down.  A shell does three main things in its
lifetime.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Initialize</strong>: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its
configuration files.  These change aspects of the shell’s behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret</strong>: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be
interactive, or a file) and executes them.</li>
  <li><strong>Terminate</strong>: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any
shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps are so general that they could apply to many programs, but we’re
going to use them for the basis for our shell.  Our shell will be so simple that
there won’t be any configuration files, and there won’t be any shutdown command.
So, we’ll just call the looping function and then terminate.  But in terms of
architecture, it’s important to keep in mind that the lifetime of the program is
more than just looping.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// Load config files, if any.
</span>
  <span>// Run command loop.
</span>  <span>lsh_loop</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// Perform any shutdown/cleanup.
</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you can see that I just came up with a function, <code>lsh_loop()</code>, that will
loop, interpreting commands.  We’ll see the implementation of that next.</p>

<h2 id="basic-loop-of-a-shell">Basic loop of a shell</h2>

<p>So we’ve taken care of how the program should start up.  Now, for the basic
program logic: what does the shell do during its loop?  Well, a simple way to
handle commands is with three steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read</strong>: Read the command from standard input.</li>
  <li><strong>Parse</strong>: Separate the command string into a program and arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Execute</strong>: Run the parsed command.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I’ll translate those ideas into code for <code>lsh_loop()</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>lsh_loop</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>line</span><span>;</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>args</span><span>;</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>

  <span>do</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"&gt; "</span><span>);</span>
    <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>lsh_read_line</span><span>();</span>
    <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>lsh_split_line</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
    <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>lsh_execute</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>

    <span>free</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
    <span>free</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>status</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s walk through the code.  The first few lines are just declarations.  The
do-while loop is more convenient for checking the status variable, because it
executes once before checking its value.  Within the loop, we print a prompt,
call a function to read a line, call a function to split the line into args, and
execute the args.  Finally, we free the line and arguments that we created
earlier.  Note that we’re using a status variable returned by <code>lsh_execute()</code> to
determine when to exit.</p>

<h2 id="reading-a-line">Reading a line</h2>

<p>Reading a line from stdin sounds so simple, but in C it can be a hassle.  The
sad thing is that you don’t know ahead of time how much text a user will enter
into their shell.  You can’t simply allocate a block and hope they don’t exceed
it.  Instead, you need to start with a block, and if they do exceed it,
reallocate with more space.  This is a common strategy in C, and we’ll use it to
implement <code>lsh_read_line()</code>.</p>

      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first part is a lot of declarations.  If you hadn’t noticed, I prefer to
keep the old C style of declaring variables before the rest of the code.  The
meat of the function is within the (apparently infinite) <code>while (1)</code> loop.  In
the loop, we read a character (and store it as an <code>int</code>, not a <code>char</code>, that’s
important!  EOF is an integer, not a character, and if you want to check for it,
you need to use an <code>int</code>.  This is a common beginner C mistake.).  If it’s the
newline, or EOF, we null terminate our current string and return it.  Otherwise,
we add the character to our existing string.</p>

<p>Next, we see whether the next character will go outside of our current buffer
size.  If so, we reallocate our buffer (checking for allocation errors) before
continuing.  And that’s really it.</p>

<p>Those who are intimately familiar with newer versions of the C library may note
that there is a <code>getline()</code> function in <code>stdio.h</code> that does most of the work we
just implemented.  To be completely honest, I didn’t know it existed until after
I wrote this code.  This function was a GNU extension to the C library until
2008, when it was added to the specification, so most modern Unixes should have
it now.  I’m leaving my existing code the way it is, and I encourage people to
learn it this way first before using <code>getline</code>.  You’d be robbing yourself of a
learning opportunity if you didn’t!  Anyhow, with <code>getline</code>, the function
becomes easier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>lsh_read_line</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ssize_t</span> <span>bufsize</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>// have getline allocate a buffer for us
</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>getline</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>bufsize</span><span>,</span> <span>stdin</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>){</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>feof</span><span>(</span><span>stdin</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span>  <span>// We recieved an EOF
</span>    <span>}</span> <span>else</span>  <span>{</span>
      <span>perror</span><span>(</span><span>"readline"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_FAILURE</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>line</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not 100% trivial because we still need to check for EOF or errors while
reading. EOF (end of file) means that either we were reading commands from a
text file which we’ve reached the end of, or the user typed Ctrl-D, which
signals end-of-file. Either way, it means we should exit successfully, and if
any other error occurs, we should fail after printing the error.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-the-line">Parsing the line</h2>

<p>OK, so if we look back at the loop, we see that we now have implemented
<code>lsh_read_line()</code>, and we have the line of input.  Now, we need to parse that
line into a list of arguments.  I’m going to make a glaring simplification here,
and say that we won’t allow quoting or backslash escaping in our command line
arguments.  Instead, we will simply use whitespace to separate arguments from
each other.  So the command <code>echo "this message"</code> would not call echo with a
single argument <code>this message</code>, but rather it would call echo with two
arguments: <code>"this</code> and <code>message"</code>.</p>

<p>With those simplifications, all we need to do is “tokenize” the string using
whitespace as delimiters.  That means we can break out the classic library
function <code>strtok</code> to do some of the dirty work for us.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define LSH_TOK_BUFSIZE 64
#define LSH_TOK_DELIM " \t\r\n\a"
</span><span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>lsh_split_line</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>line</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>tokens</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this code looks suspiciously similar to <code>lsh_read_line()</code>, it’s because it
is!  We are using the same strategy of having a buffer and dynamically expanding
it.  But this time, we’re doing it with a null-terminated array of pointers
instead of a null-terminated array of characters.</p>

<p>At the start of the function, we begin tokenizing by calling <code>strtok</code>.  It
returns a pointer to the first token.  What <code>strtok()</code> actually does is return
pointers to within the string you give it, and place <code>\0</code> bytes at the end of
each token.  We store each pointer in an array (buffer) of character
pointers.</p>

<p>Finally, we reallocate the array of pointers if necessary.  The process repeats
until no token is returned by <code>strtok</code>, at which point we null-terminate the
list of tokens.</p>

<p>So, once all is said and done, we have an array of tokens, ready to execute.
Which begs the question, how do we do that?</p>



<p>Now, we’re really at the heart of what a shell does.  Starting processes is the
main function of shells.  So writing a shell means that you need to know exactly
what’s going on with processes and how they start.  That’s why I’m going to take
us on a short diversion to discuss processes in Unix.</p>

<p>There are only two ways of starting processes on Unix.  The first one (which
almost doesn’t count) is by being Init.  You see, when a Unix computer boots,
its kernel is loaded.  Once it is loaded and initialized, the kernel starts only
one process, which is called Init.  This process runs for the entire length of
time that the computer is on, and it manages loading up the rest of the
processes that you need for your computer to be useful.</p>

<p>Since most programs aren’t Init, that leaves only one practical way for
processes to get started: the <code>fork()</code> system call.  When …</p></div></div>

    <p>The rise of tooling for vulnerability detection combined with pressure driven by Vendor Due Diligence is causing a massive enterprise freezeout for non-mainstream technologies across the board. Of particular concern is the impact this will have on the adoption of functional programming in enterprise and small business B2B development.</p>

<p>I see now that the last 10 years were “easy mode” for the growth of new programming tools and infrastructure, with many new breakthrough technologies seeing rapid adoption. Languages like Node, Go and to some degree Scala saw breakaway success, not to mention all of the new cloud tech, NoSQL tech, containerization and data processing platforms along with their custom query DSLs. Other languages like Haskell saw success in small companies and skunkworks style teams solving very difficult problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-rise-of-vulnerability-scanning">The Rise of Vulnerability Scanning</h3>

<p>Just this past year I’ve come to see we’re in the middle of a massive change across the industry. There are new forces at play which will calcify current software stacks and make it extremely hard for existing or new entrants to see similar success without a massive coordinated push backed by big enterprise companies. This force is the rise of InfoSec and vulnerability detection tooling.</p>

<p>Tools like <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools">Blackduck, WhiteSource, Checkmarx, Veracode</a> are exploding in popularity, there are too many to list and many variations on the same theme. In the wake of so many data leaks and hacking events enterprises no longer trust their developers and SREs to take care of security, and so protocols are being implemented top down. This isn’t just on the code scanning side, there is a similar set of things going on with network scanning as well which impacts programming languages less, but similarly will calcify server stacks.</p>

<p>These tools are quickly making their way into SOC2 and SDLC policies across industry, and if your language or new infrastructure tool isn’t supported by them there’s little chance you will get the previously already tenuous approval to use them. This sets the already high bar for adoption much higher. As you might expect, vendors will only implement support for languages that meet some threshold for profitability of their tools. Not only do you need to build a modern set of tools for your language to compete, now you also need support from external vendors.</p>

<h3 id="vendor-due-diligence">Vendor Due Diligence</h3>

<p>Maybe we just cede this territory to enterprise tools with big backers like Microsoft and Oracle, we never more than a few small inroads anyway. The use of these tools is arguably a good thing overall for software security. Unfortunately, the problem cannot be sidestepped so easily, and I’m afraid this is where things look very bleak. The biggest new trend is in enforcement of these tools through Vendor Due Diligence.</p>

<p>You may not be familiar with Vendor Due Diligence if you aren’t in a manager role. The basic idea is your customer will send you a long list of technical questions about your product which you must fill out to their satisfaction before they buy your product or service. In the B2B space where I work these lists are nothing new, but have been getting longer and longer over the last 10 years, now often numbering in the hundreds of questions.</p>

<p>Most recently I’ve seen more and more invasive questions being asked, some even going into how teams are organized, but important to this article is that across the board they now all ask about vulnerability scanning and now often request specific outputs for well-known vulnerability scanning tools. The implication being that if you’re not scanning with these tools they won’t buy your software, and the list of supported languages is small.</p>

<p>Any experienced technology manager sees the natural tradeoff here. When it comes down to making money versus using cool tech, cool tech will lose every time. You’re just burning money if you’re building cool things with cool tech if you know no one will buy it.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-now">So What Now?</h3>

<p>Potentially we will see a resurgence of “compile-to” functional programming with mainstream language targets to sidestep the issue. I suppose though that the extra build complexity and problems debugging will prevent this from ever being mainstream, not to mention that the vulnerability tools look for specific patterns and likely won’t behave well on generated code.</p>

<p>There is some hope in the form of projects like SonarCube which enables users to come together and <a href="https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-custom-plugin-example">build custom plugins</a>. Will functional programming communities come together to build and maintain such boring tech? I somewhat doubt it. This kind of work is not what most programmers would choose to do in their off time. Similarly, vulnerability detection is unlikely to be a good target to be advanced a little at a time with academic papers. It would take true functional programming fanatics to build companies or tools dedicated to the cause. If you are interested in helping out, pay attention to the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top 10</a> as this list drives focus for many infosec teams.</p>

<p>Where does this leave us? If our communities do nothing then smaller B2B software operations focused mom and pop shops or consumer focused web applications likely won’t see any impact unless static analysis makes it into data protection law. Beyond these use cases FP will be relegated to tiny boxes on the back end where vulnerabilities are much less of a concern and the mathematical skills of functional programmers can bring extreme amounts of value.</p>

<p>I know there are many deeper facets I didn’t cover here, if you want to continue the discussion <a href="https://twitter.com/rickasaurus/status/1300487826782420995">join the thread on twitter</a>.</p>

we'd like it to be. As part of the article, Tratt discusses how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent parsers</a> have a
number of issues in practice and recommends using other things,
such as a LR parser generator.</p>

<p>I have a long standing interest in parsing, I'm reasonably well
aware of the annoyances of recursive descent parsers (although some
of the issues Tratt raised hadn't occurred to me before now), and
I've been exposed to parser generators like Yacc. Despite that, my
normal approach to parsing any new little language for real is to
write a recursive descent parser in whatever language I'm using,
and Tratt's article is not going to change that. My choice here is
for entirely pragmatic reasons, because to me recursive descent
parsers generally have two significant advantages over all other
real parsers.</p>

<p>The first advantage is that almost always, a recursive descent parser
is the only or at least easiest form of parser you can readily create
using only the language's standard library and tooling. In particular,
parsing LR, LALR, and similar formal grammars generally requires you to
find, select, and install a parser generator tool (or more rarely, an
additional package). Very few languages ship their standard environment
with a parser generator (or a lexer, which is often required in some
form by the parser).</p>

<p>(The closest I know of is C on Unix, where you will almost always
find some version of lex and yacc. Not entirely coincidentally,
I've used lex and yacc to write a parser in C, although a long time
ago.)</p>

<p>By contrast, a recursive descent parser is just code in the language.
You can obviously write that in any language, and you can build a
little lexer to go along with it that's custom fitted to your
particular recursive descent parser and your language's needs.  This
also leads to the second significant advantage, which is that if
you write a recursive descent parser, you don't need to learn a new
language, the language of the parser generator, and also learn how
to hook that new language to the language of your program, and then
debug the result. Your entire recursive descent parser (and your
entire lexer) are written in one language, the language you're
already working in.</p>

<p>If I was routinely working in a language that had a well respected
de facto standard parser generator and lexer, and regularly building
parsers for little languages for my programs, it would probably be
worth mastering these tools. The time and effort required to do so
would be more than paid back in the end, and I would probably have
a higher quality grammar too (Tratt points out how recursive descent
parsers hide ambiguity, for example). But in practice I bounce back
and forth between two languages right now (Go and Python, neither
of which have such a standard parser ecology), and I don't need to
write even a half-baked parser all that often. So writing another
recursive descent parser using my standard process for this has
been the easiest way to do it every time I needed one.</p>

<p>(I've developed a standard process for writing recursive descent
parsers that makes the whole thing pretty mechanical, but that's a
discussion for another entry or really a series of them.)</p>

<p>PS: I can't comment about how easy it is to generate good error
messages in modern parser generators, because I haven't used any
of them. My experience with my own recursive descent parsers is
that it's generally straightforward to get decent error messages
for the style of languages that I create, and usually simple to
tweak the result to give clearer errors in some specific situations

<hr>





<p>I value transparency a lot, especially when it comes to the bug bounty space. Bug bounty hunters all around the world are submitting a range of reports where the issues found span across multiple domains, often leveraging numerous techniques and methodologies. However, if you’re not already an active bug bounty hunter who has a good understanding of what a bounty program expects, or will pay out for, you have a major disadvantage compared to someone who does have this knowledge. I hope through this blog post, I can demystify the sort of issues bug bounty programs pay for.</p>

<p>The last blog post I did in this series was around four years ago, <a href="https://shubs.io/high-frequency-security-bug-hunting-120-days-120-bugs/">120 days, 120 bugs</a>. In the last four years, a lot has happened. I moved to Europe for six months, I moved interstate in Australia twice, I won a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VojwIY4GL-4">live hacking event</a>, I co-founded a company and helped build an <a href="https://assetnote.io/">attack surface management platform</a> with a team of people I consider family.</p>

<p>Unlike my previous blog post, I did not set myself a goal to find a bug a day. Instead, I participated in bug bounties whenever time allowed. There were many months where I found nothing at all, which often terrified me when it came to evaluating my self worth as a hacker. I also admitted to myself, that I might be a good hacker, but there is always going to be a better hacker out there, and I’ve made my peace with that as a hyper-competitve person.</p>

<p>If you don’t have an excellent understanding of fundamental application security <a href="http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246978/Threat%20Classification">attacks and weaknesses</a> before you approach bug bounties, in my opinion, you are wasting your time. <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security">Practice and learn more here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a paid, more extensive resource, check out and practice with <a href="https://pentesterlab.com/">PentesterLab</a>.</p>

<p>Participating so heavily in bug bounties has given us the knowledge at Assetnote about what security teams <em>actually</em> care about. It’s the reason we can maintain high signal when we are continuously finding exposures.</p>

<p>My primary motivation for this blog post is to educate the masses on what bug bounty programs are paying out for.</p>

<p>For example, would you know that you could submit a dangling EC2 IP (subdomain pointing to an EC2 IP that is no longer owned by the company) as a bug report without reading the proof in the pudding below? I’ve been paid for this by programs, so clearly they value this sort of information.</p>

<p>Below are all of my findings for the last four years. I’ve redacted information where necessary, but by reading the titles, it should give you a good understanding of what I was reporting to programs.</p>

27 Mar 2017

</span></p><p>It’s been about almost two years since we shipped the first version of <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2015/06/create-all-new-worlds-with-smooth-terrain/">smooth voxel terrain</a> at <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a>, and with it being live for a while and seeing a lot of incremental improvements I wanted to write about the internals of the technology - this feature required implementing serialization, network replication, collision detection, ray casting, rendering and in-memory storage support and within each area some implementation details ended up being quite interesting. Today we’ll talk about voxel definition and storage.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-voxel">What’s in a voxel?</h2>

<p>Whenever you design a voxel system you have to answer a basic question - what defines a voxel? We wanted our terrain to implicitly define a mostly smooth surface with each point on the surface having a material value, so we could use some kind of contouring algorithm to generate polygons from the surface. Since it was important to have control over the surface in 3 dimensions (heightfield would not cut it), we needed to define the data that represents the surface. During a prototyping phase a few options became clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Material. In this model we’d store just a material (an enum value) per voxel, and rely on neighboring voxels to construct the surface.</li>
  <li>Signed distance field. In this model we’d store the distance to the surface from the center of the voxel, with sign determining whether the center is outside or inside. This is a very well known model that’s frequently used to drive algorithms like Marching Cubes. We would also store the material per voxel.</li>
  <li>Hermite data. In this model instead of storing data about voxels, you store data about the intersections between surface and grid edges. Assuming the surface only intersects each voxel edge at most once, you have to store a bit for every edge that defines whether surface intersects this edge, an intersection point (which is defined by a 0..1 scalar), surface normal at the intersection point and the material at the vertices.</li>
  <li>Occupancy. In this model we’d store a material and the occupancy which defines the amount of matter around the voxel center - 0 meaning roughly that the voxel is completely empty and 1 meaning that the voxel is full.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://zeux.io/images/voxstorage_1.png" alt="Voxel models"></p>

<p>We experimented with the material model and rejected it because it did not give us enough flexibility for tools - our voxels had to be pretty big for the solution to be practical for low end platforms, and thus we needed to be able to represent sub-voxel information (for example, to have a tool that can “erode” terrain on a scale much finer than a voxel size).</p>

<p>Hermite data was very interesting - you could build pretty rich tooling based on boolean operations and allow a fine control over smoothness of the surface. However, what wasn’t clear was how we would present this to developers in a form of API. We felt like CSG-based API such as “subtract a sphere out of terrain” was not sufficient - how do you implement a smoothing tool if this is all you have? - and we wanted to give our developers an API that allows full control over the terrain data such that you can implement any tool with it (in fact, all our existing terrain manipulation tools are using the public terrain API and are written in Lua). We didn’t feel like exposing raw Hermite data was an option due to its complexity so we had to discard this approach.</p>

<p>Signed distance field was more expressive than occupancy model, but ultimately resulted in similarly looking content and ended up having a more complicated mental model (how do I fill voxels that are far away from the surface? Does it even matter? How is the distance clamped? etc.) so we did not feel like it was worth the tradeoff.</p>

<p>Thus we settled on the occupancy model, where every voxel would be defined by a material and occupancy pair. Our definition of occupancy is a bit peculiar because due to how our meshing algorithm works matter “overflows” from one voxel to another - occupancy 1 does not mean that the voxel looks like a cube, rather it just means that the voxel has as much matter as it can possibly contain. By discarding the Hermite model we lost an ability to precisely define sharp edges on the surface, which we decided to reclaim by using the material value - in addition to the texture that is applied the material also defines how terrain is shaped around the voxel; thus what defines geometry is the material and occupancy in the voxel and in voxel’s neighborhood. A screenshot from an early prototype shows how different materials with the same occupancy data can produce very different results:</p>

<p><img src="https://zeux.io/images/voxstorage_2.jpg" alt="Material based shaping"></p>

<h2 id="memory-format">Memory format</h2>

<p>To represent a voxel, you need a material (which is an enum) and occupancy (which is a floating-point value in 0..1 range). Material storage is straightforward - we just store an index into the material table, which currently has 23 entries. To conserve space, we store occupancy as a quantized 8-bit value, which adds up to two bytes per voxel.</p>

<p>In a material-occupancy definition there is inherent ambiguity in terms of empty voxel representation - you can define it as occupancy = 0 but then the material choice does not matter; or you can define it as material = air but then the occupancy does not matter. We chose the model with an explicit <code>Air</code> material, and we decode occupancy as <code>(value + 1) / 256.0</code> for non-air materials and 0.0 for air materials (which means that the occupancy is precisely represented in a floating point number which is not true for decoding methods like <code>value / 255.0</code>). Voxels with material = <code>Air</code> and occupancy != 0 are not valid; we make sure they never appear in the grid with simple branchless code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// make sure occupancy is always 0 for Air material (0)</span>
<span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>material</span><span>;</span>
<span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>occupancy</span> <span>=</span> <span>occupancy</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span><span>static_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>material</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>31</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we originally developed the system, we decided to settle on a simple sparse storage format: all voxels would be stored in chunks 32x32x32 with each chunk represented as a linear 3D array (since each voxel needs two bytes for storage, this adds up to 64 KB per chunk; we also experimented with 16x16x16 chunks but the difference wasn’t very noticeable), and the entire voxel grid is simply a hash map, mapping the index of the chunk to the chunk contents itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Vector3int32</span><span>,</span> <span>Chunk</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>chunks</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s worth noting that we needed a sparse unbounded storage because our worlds do not have set size limits and you can use voxel content at any point; of course, voxel access in a local region needed to be very fast. A simple two-level storage scheme (hash map + 3D array) turned out to work really well for this - it’s simple to implement and reason about, and provides an easy way to trade “sparseness” for increased locality by adjusting chunk size. We ended up using this way of storing voxel data throughout the entire engine, with individual systems adjusting the chunk size to match the expected workload better (storage uses 32^3 chunks, network uses 16^3 chunks for initial replication and 4^3 chunks for updates, physics uses 8^3 chunks, rendering first used 32x16x32 chunks and later switched to chunks that increase in size from 16^3 up to 256^3 voxels).</p>

<p>Inside the chunk we ended up storing several 3D arrays - we call a 3D array of voxels “box” - of different sizes, forming a mipmap pyramid for our voxel content. We have 32^3 Box for the original content, and 16^3, 8^3 and 4^3 mipmaps that contain downsampled voxel data. The extra storage cost of mipmaps ends up being negligible, and the small penalty that we take for updating the mip levels when writing voxels to the voxel grid is well worth it considering that we are using them for Level Of Detail which allows us to render a lot fewer triangles in the distance, as well as for some other optimizations. The downsample algorithm that we use guarantees that if a voxel at a certain level of mip pyramid is filled with <code>Air</code>, all voxels corresponding to this area in the upper levels of the pyramid are also filled with <code>Air</code> - for example, if the bottom mip level has all 64 voxels empty then the entire chunk is empty.</p>

<h2 id="disk-format">Disk format</h2>

<p>When it comes to storing voxels on disk, we wanted a more compact representation than a 3D array. There are a lot of ways to store voxels - we needed an encoding scheme that stored voxels as bytes (without any cross-byte bit packing to avoid efficiency loss of a byte-level lossless compressor - we usually take the encoded voxels and compress them further with LZ4), was reasonably efficient on the types of content we see frequently, and was simple - we could always upgrade the format later if we needed to spend more time doing it.</p>

<p>Our previous experiments in voxel technology suggested that if you take each chunk and do RLE compression on it, efficiently representing runs of voxels with the same contents, it resulted in pretty good compression rates and pretty efficient compression code. Remember, we don’t need to be optimal - we need to compress data to reduce it in size for storage efficiency, but we do frequently have a LZ codec running on top of that. Running RLE before LZ may seem counter-intuitive, but it significantly reduces the size of data making LZ faster, and in some cases means you don’t even need to do LZ compression because RLE on its own is enough - voxel data is frequently very regular.</p>

<p>An additional quirk is that each voxel in our system occupies two bytes; we wanted to have a more compact baseline representation so that even if RLE can’t find runs of sufficient length we still end up with a smaller file. A key realization is that many voxels are completely solid - if you imagine a mountain built from voxels, usually all interior voxels in the mountain only carry material information (that is still meaningful in case you want to dig a hole through the mountain later) - occupancy is usually 1 for these cells. Similarly, for <code>Air</code> we <em>never</em> need to store occupancy - it’s always zero! With this and RLE in mind, here’s the encoding we came up with:</p>

<p>Each run of voxels starts with a byte that …</p></div></div>

<p>It is 2020, and we can say for sure, that <em>ssh-server</em> is still one of the most popular services on Linux systems. During various meetings, I was often asked: <em>How to secure SSH?&nbsp; </em>Even though this question seems trivial, it is not. There are a lot of things to remember to accomplish well-designed service security. Secure shell is used not only for a remote-shell, <em>per se</em>. Many other technologies depend on it, for various reasons. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Git to download and push the code.&nbsp;<span id="eb462557-2983-4179-9c24-ea9a947c5da3" data-items="[&quot;2050246254&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[1]​</span></li><li>Ansible to apply tasks. <span id="d575a00a-c8b1-4fb1-89ce-1e71d53d95d8" data-items="[&quot;2756985050&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[2]​</span></li><li>Cloudera for installation procedures. <span id="51d860cf-fd45-4b09-b73b-ca4df154d347" data-items="[&quot;1280041206&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[3]​</span><br>(Do not ask us, we do not understand it too.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>I have decided to answer the above question once and forever, and always refer to this document, trying to keep it up-date and consistent with current security practices. The purpose of this post is to answer the question: <em>How to secure SSH?</em> It is a comprehensive document for <em>infosec</em> and <em>devops</em> teams, that will guide them through all known best-practices and hardening rules.</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>This paragraph focuses on secure-shell server risks assesment, hardening practices and configuration best-practices. The server configuration is mostly put at <code>/etc/sshd/sshd_config</code>. </p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Contest the need&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The first and the most basic question the Reader should ask himself: <em>Is there even a need for an OpenSSH server at all, for my specific use-case?</em> At the time of writing this article, it is not uncommon to build fully declarative, golden-image infrastructures. We have a wide set of serverless services and technologies that only run a process inside the container. I would say, for sure, that the majority of the infrastructures we, as @sysdogs, provision for our customers, do not have <em>OpenSSH</em> enabled at all. (You can always <a href="https://sysdogs.com/contact/">contact us</a>, if you want to know, how we do it.) </p>
<p>Another perfect example for disabled ssh-server is a local-workstation.<br>There is no need for a secure-shell server on a local laptop, for instance.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Management interfaces-only</h3>
<p>While reading a variety of resources, like <em>Security Technical Implementation Guidelines</em>, they always mark&nbsp; access management as the most crucial part, and top priority. It is required to bind the server only to the interface that is trusted.</p>
<ul><li>For Enterprise infrastructures virtual-machines can have their own management interface with proper <code>firewalld</code> rules. <span id="ff61a54c-2d19-493d-a01c-883274db1866" data-items="[&quot;3975247616&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[4]​</span></li><li>For virtual private servers, we can align this rule to the trusted subset of public addresses that are whitelisted in the firewall.&nbsp;</li><li>In the Cloud environments, we can build a specific security group that defines the access to the server or use other cloud services, like DigitalOcean Firewall. ​<span id="bbb71312-611f-4a8e-9184-57aaeccfafcd" data-items="[&quot;1459351913&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[5]​</span> <span id="8a1875df-b48b-4a34-ad28-5c296e754e33" data-items="[&quot;4020271495&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[6]​</span></li></ul>

<h3>Mandatory Access Control – SELinux</h3>
<p>I am the guy, that would do <code>setenforce 1</code> even if it was already set to <code>1</code>.<br>Just in case. To be sure. Being absolutely honest, I strongly believe SELinux is one of the most helpful services in the Linux world to improve and harden your operating system.</p>
<p>I have read a lot of documentations and tutorials that recommend the end-user to disable SELinux or AppArmor. I completely understand their authors. They told you to do that, because it simplifies the process of software installation and removes the burden of hardening. On the other hand, I fully believe it is like getting your house alarm wrongly configured, getting upset because of the false-positives, then disabling it for the good feeling of yourself.</p>

<h3>Use <code>Protocol 2</code></h3>
<p>Sincerely, I have never seen any <em>secure-shell</em> server with enabled <code>Protocol&nbsp;1</code>. To maintain the state of the art and comprehensiveness of this article, it is important to note it here, that it is insecure and it is not recommended to use <code>Protocol 1</code>.&nbsp; It has a set of vulnerabilities and problems with security. <code>Protocol 1</code> support was removed in RHEL7.4.</p>

<h3>Use <code>tcp/22</code></h3>
<p>I have seen a lot of write-ups that recommend using a different port than <code>tcp/22</code>. I completely disagree with this argument.&nbsp; It is not very difficult to scan all possible ports on the target.&nbsp; Secondly, security by obscurity <strong>always</strong> leads to something weird. By definition, OpenSSH always presents itself first. Last, but not least; using SELinux, you are forced to run the secure-shell server on <code>tcp/22</code>.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Do not use <code>tcpwrapperd</code></h3>
<p>A set of known Linux websites still recommend using tcp-wrappers as another security layer for sshd. I think it is wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The very first argument for that is that <code>tcpwrappers</code> seems to be a deprecated technology. <span id="974356e0-6dbc-4a2e-8917-dbf1fd443e41" data-items="[&quot;2776761352&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[7]​</span> It was released over 20 years ago (8 April 1997) and does not seem to be developed anymore. Another factor is that, through this deprecation, maintenance of another security layer, may in paradox add another attack vector for the system and networking.&nbsp; The modern firewalls, intrusion detection systems and possibilities of isolation may completely replace tcp-wrappers functionalities. In the end, fresh operating systems do not link <code>libwrapd</code> to <code>sshd</code>.</p>
<p><code><strong>Listing.</strong></code> No <code>tcpwrappersd</code> library linked to <code>sshd</code> binary on <code>Centos/8</code>.</p>

<p>Port-forwarding is the functionality that allows the client to bind local-port to a remote address. It is a very straight and easy way to omit and skip firewall-rules and break compliance.</p>
<p>Agent forwarding is a mechanism of pass</p>
<p><code><strong>Listing.</strong></code> Configuration parameters to disable forwarding.</p>

<h3><strong>Minimize <code>MaxSessions</code> and <code>MaxAuthTries</code></strong></h3>
<p>The authorised user should not have any difficulties with logging in successfully.. Of course, there are exceptions to that statement, but, in general, it is safe to assume it should be completely sufficient to have two tries during one connection session. In contrast, the attacker trying to apply brute-force attacks needs as much login tries as possible. Therefore, i think we can all agree, minimizing <code>MaxAuthTries</code> is a good way of hardening.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A lot of thanks goes to <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/about">Amos</a> for inspiring this article with <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust">A half-hour to learn Rust</a>. I thought I'd try it out, but instead of Rust, this article will try to explain Go in half an hour.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on one or two concepts, I'll try to go through as many Go snippets as I can, and explain what the keywords and symbols they contain mean. This article can be used as a cheat sheet for developers familiar with Go, or a tutorial for developers new to Go, but familiar with other languages.</p>
<p>Ready? Go!</p>
<h4 id="packages"><a href="#packages" aria-label="packages permalink"></a><strong>Packages</strong></h4>
<p>Every Go program is made up of packages,</p>
<p>Programs start by running in package <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>You can use external packages by importing them:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can use exported names in an imported package by using the package name as a qualifier:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>"fmt"</span>
  <span>"math/rand"</span>
<span>)</span>

fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"My favorite number is"</span><span>,</span> rand<span>.</span><span>Intn</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can create a local alias for any import:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
  formatter <span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

formatter<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Or use a dot to access it without any qualifier:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>.</span> <span>"math/rand"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>Intn</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>A name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. This is similar to <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> in other languages:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>x <span>:=</span> <span>"hello"</span> 
A <span>:=</span> <span>"hello"</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Packages can have an <code>init</code> function. This will be executed as soon as the package is imported:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>performSideEffects</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="scope"><a href="#scope" aria-label="scope permalink"></a><strong>Scope</strong></h4>
<p>A pair of brackets declares a block, which has its own scope:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  x <span>:=</span> <span>"out"</span>
  <span>{</span>
    
    x <span>:=</span> <span>"in"</span>
    <span>println</span><span>(</span>x<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>x<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A variable defined outside of any function is considered "global". If capitalized, it can be accessed by other packages:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>package</span> mypackage

<span>var</span> Global <span>string</span> <span>=</span> <span>"I am a global variable!"</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="variables"><a href="#variables" aria-label="variables permalink"></a><strong>Variables</strong></h4>
<p><code>var</code> declares a variable of a given type:</p>

<p>This can also be written as a single line:</p>

<p>You can specify a variable's type implicitly:</p>

<p>Inside of a function body, this can also be written in short form:</p>

<p>You can declare many variables at the same time:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> x<span>,</span> y <span>int</span>
x<span>,</span> y <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>20</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you declare a variable without initializing it, it will implicitly be assigned to the zero value of its type:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> b <span>bool</span>
<span>var</span> x <span>int</span>
<span>var</span> y <span>string</span>
<span>var</span> z <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>int</span>

<span>println</span><span>(</span>b<span>)</span> 
<span>println</span><span>(</span>x<span>)</span> 
<span>println</span><span>(</span>y<span>)</span> 
<span>println</span><span>(</span>z<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<h4 id="type-conversions"><a href="#type-conversions" aria-label="type conversions permalink"></a><strong>Type Conversions</strong></h4>
<p>You can convert values between different types:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> f <span>float64</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> 
i <span>:=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span>f<span>)</span>       </code></pre></div>
<p>Note that this must be done explicitly. Unlike other languages, you cannot pass an <code>int</code> as a <code>float</code> argument and depend on an implicit conversion by the compiler.</p>
<h4 id="constants"><a href="#constants" aria-label="constants permalink"></a><strong>Constants</strong></h4>
<p>Unchanging values can be declared with the <code>const</code> keyword. Constants can be characters, strings, booleans, or numeric values:</p>

<p>You can group the declaration of multiple constants or variables:</p>

<h4 id="iota"><a href="#iota" aria-label="iota permalink"></a><strong>Iota</strong></h4>
<p>The <code>iota</code> keyword represents successive integer constants:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>(</span>
  zero <span>=</span> <span>iota</span>
  one  <span>=</span> <span>iota</span>
  two  <span>=</span> <span>iota</span>
<span>)</span>
fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>zero<span>,</span> one<span>,</span> two<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This can be written in short form:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>(</span>
  zero <span>=</span> <span>iota</span>
  one
  two
<span>)</span>
fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>zero<span>,</span> one<span>,</span> two<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>You can perform operations on an iota:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>(</span>
  four <span>=</span> <span>iota</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span>
  five
  six
<span>)</span>

fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>four<span>,</span> five<span>,</span> six<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>And use the blank identifier to skip a value:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>(</span>
  zero <span>=</span> <span>iota</span>
  <span>_</span>    
  two
  three
<span>)</span>
fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>zero<span>,</span> two<span>,</span> three<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Iota's are most commonly used to represent enums, which Go does not support natively.</p>
<h4 id="the-blank-identifier"><a href="#the-blank-identifier" aria-label="the blank identifier permalink"></a><strong>The Blank Identifier</strong></h4>
<p>The blank identifier <code>_</code> is an anonymous placeholder. It basically means to throw away something:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
<span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>42</span>



<span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>getThing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can use it to import a package solely for its <code>init</code> function:</p>

<p>Or to avoid compiler errors during development:</p>

<h4 id="looping"><a href="#looping" aria-label="looping permalink"></a><strong>Looping</strong></h4>
<p>Go has only one loop, the <code>for</code> loop. It has three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The init statement: executed before the first iteration</li>
<li>The condition: evaluated before every iteration</li>
<li>The post statement: executed at the end of every iteration</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>sum <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span> <span>{</span>
  sum <span>++</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The init and post statements are optional:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
yup <span>:=</span> <span>true</span>
<span>for</span> yup <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"yup!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>An infinite for loop can also be written like this:</p>

<p>You can use break to <code>break</code> out of a loop:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>shouldBreak</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>break</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And <code>continue</code> to skip to the next iteration</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>for</span> i <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>if</span> i <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>continue</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="control-flow"><a href="#control-flow" aria-label="control flow permalink"></a><strong>Control Flow</strong></h4>
<p>Go's <code>if</code> statements have a similar syntax to its loops:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
<span>if</span> <span>1</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>if</code> conditions can also have an init statement:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
<span>if</span> x <span>:=</span> <span>"hello"</span><span>;</span> x <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>x<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Go also has <code>else</code> and <code>else if</code> statements:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>if</span> something <span>{</span>
  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> somethingElse <span>{</span>
  <span>doSomethingElse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If your <code>if - else</code> statement is getting long, switch to a <code>switch</code> statement :)</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>switch</span> <span>{</span>
<span>case</span> something<span>:</span>
  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>case</span> somethingElse <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span><span>:</span>
  <span>doSomethingElse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>default</span><span>:</span>
  <span>return</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also switch on a condition:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>switch</span> x <span>:=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span> x <span>{</span>

<span>case</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span>
  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

<span>case</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span>
  <span>doSomethingElse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

<span>default</span><span>:</span>
  <span>return</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can use <code>fallthrough</code> to fall through to the case below the current case:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>switch</span> <span>1</span> <span>{</span>
<span>case</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"1"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>fallthrough</span>
<span>case</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"2"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>In a switch statement, only the first matched case is executed.</p>
<p>Go also has <em>labels</em> to help manage control flow:</p>

<p>You can jump to a specific label with the <code>goto</code> keyword:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>


<span>goto</span> Three
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>

Three<span>:</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Labels have a very specific use case. They can make code less readable and should be avoided most of the time.</p>
<h4 id="arrays"><a href="#arrays" aria-label="arrays permalink"></a><strong>Arrays</strong></h4>
<p>In Go, arrays have a fixed length:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> a <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>string</span> 
a<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>
a<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>println</span><span>(</span>a<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>You create arrays using <em>array literals</em>:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>helloWorld <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>,</span> <span>"World"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You cannot increase an array beyond its capacity. Doing so will panic:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>helloWorld <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>,</span> <span>"World"</span><span>}</span>
helloWorld<span>[</span><span>10</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Space"</span>


</code></pre></div>
<p>To get around this issue, Go provides slices.</p>
<h4 id="slices"><a href="#slices" aria-label="slices permalink"></a><strong>Slices</strong></h4>
<p>Slices are more common than arrays. They do not have a fixed length, and are therefore more flexible:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Slices can also be created with the built-in function <code>make</code>:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>make</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> initialLength<span>)</span>


<span>make</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> initialLength<span>,</span> initialCapacity<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also create a slice by <em>slicing</em> an existing array:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>}</span>
s <span>:=</span> nums<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>:</span><span>4</span><span>]</span>

fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>s<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can omit the start or end index when slicing an array, so for this array:</p>

<p>These expressions are equivalent:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>a<span>[</span><span>:</span><span>]</span>
a<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>:</span><span>]</span>
a<span>[</span><span>:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
a<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Modifying the elements of a slice will modify its underlying array:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>}</span>

s <span>:=</span> nums<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>:</span><span>4</span><span>]</span>
s<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>999</span>

fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>nums<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Slices are just a fancy way to manage an underlying array. You cannot increase a slice beyond its capacity. Doing so will panic, just like with an array:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>}</span>
nums<span>[</span><span>20</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>9</span>


</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Go has built-in functions to make slices feel like arrays, such as the <code>append</code> function, which can be used to add items to the end of a slice:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>}</span>
nums <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span>nums<span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>)</span>

fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>nums<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can iterate over slices and arrays with <code>range</code>:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>names <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>"john"</span><span>,</span> <span>"joe"</span><span>,</span> <span>"jessica"</span><span>}</span>
<span>for</span> index<span>,</span> name <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> names <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>index<span>,</span> name<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>



</code></pre></div>
<p>We can use the blank identifier to omit the index or the value from <code>range</code>:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> name <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> names


<span>for</span> index<span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> names
<span>for</span> index <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> names</code></pre></div>
<p>Slices are more complicated than they seem. To understand the inner workings of slices and arrays in detail, check out: <a href="https://blog.golang.org/slices-intro">Go Slices: Usage and Internals</a></p>
<h4 id="maps"><a href="#maps" aria-label="maps permalink"></a><strong>Maps</strong></h4>
<p>Maps are like hashes in ruby or dictionaries in python. You create them like this:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> m <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span>
m<span>[</span><span>"key"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"value"</span>

x <span>=</span> m<span>[</span><span>"key"</span><span>]</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Or with a <em>map literal</em>:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>m <span>:=</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"one"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"two"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or the <code>make</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>m <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can delete map keys:</p>

<p>Check whether a key is present:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> m <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span>
m<span>[</span><span>"key"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"value"</span>

x<span>,</span> ok <span>=</span> m<span>[</span><span>"key"</span><span>]</span> 
x<span>,</span> ok <span>=</span> m<span>[</span><span>"doesnt-exist"</span><span>]</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>And range over their keys and values:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> m <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"one"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"two"</span><span>}</span>
<span>for</span> key<span>,</span> value <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> names <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>key<span>,</span> value<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>


</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="functions"><a href="#functions" aria-label="functions permalink"></a><strong>Functions</strong></h4>
<p><code>func</code> declares a function.</p>
<p>Here's a void function:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hi there!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And here's a function that returns an integer:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>fairDiceRoll</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>4</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Functions can return multiple values:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>oneTwoThree</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>They can also take specified arguments:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>sayHello</span><span>(</span>name <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  fmt<span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"hello %s"</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or an arbitrary number of arguments:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>variadic</span><span>(</span>nums <span>...</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>nums<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These are called <em>Variadic Functions</em>. They can be called just like regular functions:</p>

<p>Or you can pass in a slice directly:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>}</span>
<span>variadic</span><span>(</span>nums<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>If a function takes two or more arguments of the same type, you can group them together:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>multiply</span><span>(</span>x<span>,</span> y <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> x <span>*</span> y
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>defer</code> statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>defer</span> fmt<span>.</span><span>Print</span><span>(</span><span>"world"</span><span>)</span>
fmt<span>.</span><span>Print</span><span>(</span><span>"hello "</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Defer is often used with an anonymous function:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>defer</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"I'm done!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="anonymous-functions"><a href="#anonymous-functions" aria-label="anonymous functions permalink"></a><strong>Anonymous Functions</strong></h4>
<p>Go supports anonymous functions. Anonymous functions are useful when you want to define a function inline without having to name it:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>printNumber</span><span>(</span>getNum <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  num <span>:=</span> <span>getNum</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>num<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

one <span>:=</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>return</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>}</span>
<span>printNumber</span><span>(</span>one<span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>A function can also return an anonymous function:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>getOne</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

one <span>:=</span> <span>getOne</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>println</span><span>(</span><span>one</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> 

</code></pre></div>
<p>Anonymous functions allow us to dynamically change what a function does at runtime:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>DoStuff <span>:=</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Doing stuff!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>DoStuff</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

DoStuff <span>=</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Doing other stuff."</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>DoStuff</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>


</code></pre></div>
<p>Anonymous functions can form <em>closures</em>. A closure is an anonymous function that references a variable from outside itself:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>n <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>
counter <span>:=</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  n <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>return</span> n
<span>}</span>
<span>println</span><span>(</span><span>counter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>println</span><span>(</span><span>counter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>


</code></pre></div>
<p>Note how <code>counter</code> has access to <code>n</code>, even though it was never passed as a parameter.</p>
<h4 id="pointers"><a href="#pointers" aria-label="pointers permalink"></a><strong>Pointers</strong></h4>
<p>Go has pointers. A pointer holds the memory address of a value.</p>

<p>The <code>&amp;</code> operator generates a pointer to its operand:</p>

<p>The <code>*</code> operator denotes the pointer's underlying value:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>i <span>:=</span> <span>42</span>
p <span>:=</span> <span>&amp;</span>i     
<span>println</span><span>(</span><span>*</span>p<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>You can use <code>*</code> to modify the original value:</p>

<h4 id="custom-types"><a href="#custom-types" aria-label="custom types permalink"></a><strong>Custom Types</strong></h4>
<p>You can create a type with the <code>type TypeName SourceType</code> syntax:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>This week I found myself at yet another dinner party that mysteriously contained only two people who were not involved with the tech industry in some way.</p><p>As I looked around and realized for the hundredth time that I was surrounded by people exactly like me, something inside me snapped. I downloaded the latest <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/public_use_microdata_sample/" target="_blank">American Community Survey microdata</a>, fired up R and started calculating feverishly.</p><p>It turns out that among people who</p><ul><li>are under 35</li><li>live in San Francisco, Berkeley or Oakland</li><li>and have at least a bachelor’s degree</li></ul><p>about 10% have a computer-related occupation. An additional 5% are employed in some other capacity by a strongly computer-related industry.</p><p>That’s not <em>nearly</em> large enough to explain how saturated with coders my social groups are. I have plenty of social circles that are (at least nominally) totally different from my work: contra dancers, people interested in effective altruism, folk musicians, friends from college, and so on. And yet I keep finding myself in the middle of a programmer monoculture. Why?</p><p>As <a href="http://xkcd.com/1480/" target="_blank">Randall Munroe recently suggested</a>, suggests, maybe taking up a sport would help expose me to a broader range of people. But which one? Obviously not football, since I’m barely 150 pounds and don’t like traumatic brain injuries. Preferably a more elegant sport that doesn’t require a bunch of awkward equipment. Maybe Ultimate or rock climbing–</p><p>Wait, crap.</p><p>Part of the problem is that my taste in hobbies is influenced by class lines and subculture in ways that I hadn’t realized before.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It turns out that even when it’s totally up to me, most of the things I’m interested in are strongly associated with a very particular band of socioeconomic status—a much smaller band than the set of “all bachelor’s degree holders” in my ACS analysis.</p><p>This stronger selection sneaks in when I try to pick a sport based on things like “elegance,” instead of “size of community” or “what I’ve been playing since I was five years old” or whatever other things people might pick sports for. In fact, just the fact that I’m interested in doing sports for leisure is associated with class, since it’s not something that would be so easy for, say, manual laborers or shift workers.</p><p>But I don’t think socioeconomic selection explains all of it. My parents’ friends were similarly selected, but they didn’t all have <em>literally the same job</em>, and the ones that did were usually coworkers—not people they had met socially who bizarrely all happened to work on the same stuff. My friends in other occupations with similar base rates—say, school teachers—don’t wonder where all the non-teachers are at social events. And I don’t even feel like I’m from a similar subculture to many programmers. What else could be going on?</p><ul><li><p>Maybe that crackpot-sounding stuff about the “programmer’s brain” actually has something to it. Maybe programmers are all drawn to the same activities because those activities are friendly to the programmer’s innately logical, systematizing and abstract habits of thought.</p></li><li><p>Programmers could talk about programming too much, or smell bad, or something, so people from other professions are less likely to put up with them at social events.</p></li><li><p>Perhaps the various subcultures of programmers are closer together, and more distinct from other subcultures, than I perceive. Maybe “programmer culture” is less analogous to other single professions and more analogous to “academic culture” or “hippie culture,” where it would be more reasonable to have that be your entire social group.</p></li><li><p>Maybe I miscalculated from the ACS data and there are actually way more programmers than the 10% number suggests.</p></li></ul><p>Unless I’ve miscalculated pretty badly, though, it’s clear that these social bubble effects are way stronger and more tenacious than I would have expected. And this is just one of the axes where it’s <em>obvious</em> that all the variance is being selected out. I wonder what more subtle facts are being selected for this strongly in my social groups?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>When I lived in Boston, the people I associated with were determined mostly by my parents or my private high school/college, which is plenty enough to explain a monoculture without getting into class effects. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>YADB (Yet Another Database Benchmark)</h3>
<p>The world has a plethora of database benchmarks, starting with the <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dewitt/includes/benchmarking/vldb83.pdf">Wisconsin Benchmark</a> which is my favorite. Firstly, that benchmark was from Dr David Dewitt, who taught me Database Internals when I was a graduate student at University of Wisconsin. Secondly, it is probably the earliest conference paper (circa 1983) that I ever read. And thirdly, the results of this paper displeased Larry Ellison so much that he inserted a clause in newer Oracle releases to prevent researchers from benchmarking the Oracle database.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin paper clearly describes how a benchmark measures very specific features of databases, so it follows that as database capabilities evolve, new benchmarks are needed. If you have a database that has new behavior not found in existing databases, then it is clear that you need a new benchmark to measure this new behavior of the database.</p>
<p>Today, we are introducing a new benchmark, RockBench, that does just this. RockBench is designed to measure the most important characteristics of a real-time database.</p>
<h3>What Is a Real-Time Database?</h3>
<p>A real-time database is one that can sustain a high write rate of new incoming data, while at the same time allowing applications to make queries based on the freshest of data. It is different from a transactional database where the most significant characteristic is the ability to perform transactions, which is why TPC-C is the most cited benchmark for transactional databases.</p>
<p>In typical database ACID parlance, a real-time database provides Atomicity and Durability of updates just like most other databases. It supports an eventual Consistency model, where updates show up in query results as quickly as possible. This time lag is referred to as data latency.  A real-time database is one that is designed to minimize data latency.</p>
<p>Different applications need different data latencies, and the ability to measure data latency allows users to choose one real-time database configuration over another based on the needs of their application. RockBench is the only benchmark at present that measures the data latency of a database at varying write rates.</p>
<p>Data latency is different from query latency, which is what is typically used to benchmark transactional databases. We posit that one of the distinguishing factors that differentiates one real-time database from another is data latency. We designed a benchmark called <a href="https://github.com/rockset/rockbench">RockBench</a> that can measure the data latency of a real-time database.</p>
<h3>Why Is This Benchmark Relevant in the Real World?</h3>
<p><strong>Real-time analytics use cases.</strong> There are many decision-making systems that leverage large volumes of streaming data to make quick decisions. When a truck arrives at a loading dock, a fleet management system would need to produce a loading list for the truck by examining delivery deadlines, delay-charge estimates, weather forecasts and modeling of other trucks that are arriving in the near future. This type of decision-making system would use a real-time database. Similarly, a product team would look at product clickstreams and user feedback in real time to determine which feature flags to set in the product. The volume of incoming click logs is very high and the time to gather insights from this data is low. This is another use case for a real-time database. Such use cases are becoming the norm these days, which is why measuring the data latency of a real-time database is useful. It allows users to pick the right database for their needs based on how quickly they want to extract insights from their data streams.</p>
<p><strong>High write rates.</strong> The most critical measurement for a real-time database is the write rate it can sustain while supporting queries at the same time. The write rate could be bursty or periodic, depending on the time of the day or the day of the week. This behavior is like a streaming logging system that can take in large volumes of writes. However, one difference between a real-time database and a streaming logging system is that the database provides a query API that can perform random queries on the event stream. With writing and querying of data, there is always an inherent tradeoff between high write rates and the visibility of data in queries, and this is precisely what RockBench measures.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-structured data.</strong> Most of real-life decision-making data is in semi-structured form, e.g. JSON, XML or CSV. New fields get added to the schema and older fields are dropped. The same field can have multi-typed values. Some fields have deeply nested objects. Before the advent of real-time databases, a user would typically use a data pipeline to clean and homogenize all the fields, flatten nested fields, denormalize nested objects and then write it out it to a data warehouse like Redshift or Snowflake. The data warehouse is then used to gather insights from their data. These data pipelines add to data latency. On the other hand, a real-time database eliminates the need for some of these data pipelines and simultaneously offers lower data latency. This benchmark uses data in JSON format to simulate more of these types of real-life scenarios.</p>
<h3>Overview of RockBench</h3>
<p>RockBench comprises a Data Generator and a Data Latency Evaluator. The Data Generator simulates a real-life event workload, where every generated event is in JSON format and schemas can change frequently. The Data Generator produces events at various write rates and writes them to the database. The Data Latency Evaluator queries the database periodically and outputs a metric that measures the data latency at that instant.  A user can vary the write rate and measure the observed data latency of the system.</p>

<em>Multiple instances of the benchmark connect to the database under test</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://rockset.com/Evaluating_Data_Latency_for_Real_Time_Databases.pdf">Evaluating Data Latency for Real-Time Databases</a> white paper provides a detailed description of the benchmark. The size of an event is chosen to be around 1K bytes, which is what we found to be the sweet spot for many real-life systems. Each event has nested objects and arrays inside it. We looked at a lot of publicly available events streams like Twitter events, stock market events and online gaming events to pick these characteristics of the data that this benchmark uses.</p>
<h3>Results of Running RockBench on Rockset</h3>
<p>Before we analyze the results of the benchmark, let’s refresh our memory of Rockset’s <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/aggregator-leaf-tailer-an-architecture-for-live-analytics-on-event-streams/">Aggregator Leaf Tailer</a> (ALT) architecture. The ALT architecture allows Rockset to scale ingest compute and query compute separately. This benchmark measures the speed of indexing in Rockset’s <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/converged-indexing-the-secret-sauce-behind-rocksets-fast-queries/">Converged Index™</a>, which maintains an inverted index, a columnar store and a record store on all fields. The benefit of building all indices is that queries are fast because it can leverage any of these pre-built indices. The data latency that we record in our benchmarking is a measure of how fast Rockset can index streaming data. Complete results can be found <a href="https://rockset.com/Evaluating_Data_Latency_for_Real_Time_Databases.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/1d31s1aajogl/1q7BFjCAsnbWNb10jzBnlo/3c56104981e2e264b7a788c36962270c/rockbench-rockset-4xl-50.png" alt="rockbench-rockset-4xl-50">
<em>Rockset p50 and p95 data latency using a 4XLarge Virtual Instance at a batch size of 50</em></p>
<p>The first observation is that a Rockset 4XLarge Virtual Instance can support a billion events flowing in every day (approx. 12K events/sec) while keeping the data latency to under 1 second. This write rate is sufficient to support a variety of use cases, ranging from fleet management operations to handling events generated from sensors.</p>
<p>The second observation is that if you have to support a higher write rate, it is as simple as upgrading to the next higher Rockset Virtual Instance. Rockset is scalable, and depending on the amount of resources you dedicate, you can reduce your data latency or support higher write rates. Extrapolating from these benchmark results: an online gaming system that produces 40K events/sec and requires a data latency of 1 second may be satisfied with a Rockset 16XLarge Virtual Instance. Also, migrating from one Rockset Virtual Instance to another does not cause any downtime, which makes it easy for users to migrate from one instance to another.</p>
<p>The third observation is that if you are running on a fixed Rockset Virtual Instance and your write rate increases, the benchmark results show that there is a gradual and linear increase in the data latency until CPU resources are saturated. In all these cases, the compute resource on the leaf is the bottleneck, because this compute is the resource that makes recently written data queryable immediately. Rockset delegates compaction CPU to <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/remote-compactions-in-rocksdb-cloud">remote compactors</a>, but some minimum CPU is still needed on the leaves to copy files to and from cloud storage.</p>
<p>Rockset uses a specialized <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/optimizing-bulk-load-in-rocksdb/">bulk-load</a> mechanism to index stationary data and that can load data at terabytes/hour, but this benchmark is not to measure that functionality. This benchmark is purposely used to measure the data latency of high-velocity data when new data is arriving at a fast rate and needs to be immediately queried.</p>
<h3>Futures</h3>
<p>In its current form, the workload generator issues writes at a specified constant rate, but one of the improvements that users have requested is to make this benchmark simulate a bursty write rate. Another improvement is to add an overwrite feature that overwrites some documents that already exists in the database. Yet another requested feature is to vary the schema of some of the generated documents so that some fields are sparse.</p>
<p>RockBench is designed to be extensible, and we hope that developers in the database community would contribute code to make this benchmark run on other real-time databases as well.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to see the results of RockBench on Rockset. It demonstrates the value of real-time databases, like Rockset, in enabling real-time analytics by supporting streaming ingest of thousands of events per second while keeping data latencies in the low seconds. My hope is that RockBench will provide developers an essential tool for measuring data latency and selecting the appropriate real-time database configuration for their application requirements.</p>

            <h2>Why is 10,000 written in Roman Numerals as <label>X</label>?</h2>
            <p>Roman Numerals are an ancient way of writing numbers that originated in ancient Rome.</p>
            <p>It is still used today, but mainly for date purposes (like with Super Bowl L for Super Bowl 50) or for movie
                series (Star Wars IV - A New Hope).</p>

            <p>Here are the main symbols that are used:</p>

            <p>To convert 10,000 to Roman Numerals we need to split it up into place values (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.), like this:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this tutorial, we'll learn how to test complex data structures in Python. Examples of such data include images, nested dictionaries, dictionaries of <em>numpy</em> arrays and even file contents. Learning how to test complex data is a very helpful skill, especially if you work in Data Science, Machine Learning or other kinds of scientific programming.</p>

<li><a href="#testing-files">Testing Files</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>For this tutorial we'll use <em>Python 3.6+</em>, <em>pytest</em>, <em>poetry</em>, <em>pandas</em>, <em>numpy</em>, <em>PIL</em> and <code>pytest-regressions</code>.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To create a new project, we’ll use poetry. If you don’t know what poetry is and how to use it, please the amazing <a target="_blank" href="https://python-poetry.org/">official docs</a>.</p>
<p>The first step is to create a new directory and initialize the project.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p complex_data/app
mkdir -p complex_data/tests
<span>cd</span> complex_data
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can install all the dependencies required from the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file. </p>
<pre><code>$ cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "complex_data"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Sample project to learn how to test complex data in Python"
authors = ["miguendes"]
license = "MIT"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.7"
pytest = "^6.0.1"
pytest-regressions = "^2.0.1"
numpy = "^1.19.1"
pandas = "^1.1.2"
pillow = "^7.2.0"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core&gt;=1.0.0a5"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have all setup, let's install the packages. Poetry will take care of the <em>virtualenv</em> creation for you and will install everything there.</p>
<pre><code>poetry install
</code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-a-demo-app">Creating a Demo App</h2>
<p>Now, let’s create a demo app so we can build tests for it. This demo will be very basic and enough to demonstrate how to test complex data. The concepts can be applied to any domain that deals with a similar type of data.</p>
<p>To start with, we’ll create two files. The first one will be the actual demo implementation. The next one will hold all the test case we are going to build. Alternatively, you can also clone the  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/miguendes/tutorials/tree/master/complex_data">project from github</a> .</p>
<pre><code>touch app/__init__.py
touch app/complex_app.py
touch tests/__init__.py
touch tests/<span>test</span>_complex_app.py
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-nested-dictionaries">Testing Nested Dictionaries</h3>
<p>A public REST API is a popular way to get data from third party entities. They usually return the data in a <em>json</em> format. And sometimes the data is organized in a deep nested structure. In Python this data will most likely be represented as a dictionary. To exemplify a function that returns a deep dictionary, consider the following example.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>config_data</span><span>(verbose_desc: str, simple_desc: str)</span> -&gt; dict:</span>
    <span>return</span> {
        <span>"agg_results"</span>: {
            <span>"t1"</span>: [<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>, <span>True</span>, <span>False</span>],
            <span>"nums"</span>: [<span>1.3</span>, <span>3.4</span>, <span>23.456</span>, <span>21.3456</span>],
            <span>"count"</span>: <span>120</span>,
        },
        <span>"sample"</span>: {<span>"desc"</span>: {<span>"verbose"</span>: verbose_desc, <span>"simple"</span>: simple_desc}},
    }
</code></pre>
<p>This function takes two parameters, <code>verbose_desc</code> and  <code>simple_desc</code>, and set it under sample -&gt; desc.
Now, how can we test this function? One way is to test it by inspecting each key-&gt;value pair.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_config_data</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    actual = config_data(verbose_desc=<span>"first experiment"</span>, simple_desc=<span>"first"</span>)
    <span>assert</span> actual[<span>"agg_results"</span>][<span>"t1"</span>] == [<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>, <span>True</span>, <span>False</span>]
    <span>assert</span> actual[<span>"agg_results"</span>][<span>"nums"</span>] == [<span>1.3</span>, <span>3.4</span>, <span>23.456</span>, <span>21.3456</span>]

    <span>assert</span> actual[<span>"sample"</span>][<span>"desc"</span>][<span>"simple"</span>] == <span>"first"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If we run the test, we can see that it works, but... You know, it’s too verbose and error-prone. For example, if we add new keys we will need to update the test to add more <em>assert</em> statements. Also, it doesn’t scale at all if the dictionary contains large data. So what is the alternative?</p>
<h4 id="pytest-regressions">pytest-regressions</h4>
<p>It turns out there’s a very interesting <em>pytest</em> plugin that makes this kind of test very easy and simple. With just a few lines of code, you can test this config data.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_config_data_with_pytest_regressions</span><span>(data_regression)</span>:</span>
    actual = config_data(verbose_desc=<span>"first experiment"</span>, simple_desc=<span>"first"</span>)
    data_regression.check(actual)
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! The only step needed is using the <code>data_regression</code> fixture and check the actual data returned. <code>pytest-regressions</code> will create a <code>yaml</code> file with the expected data the first time you run the test. Then it will use this file when you call the test again. As a result, if a regression is introduced, the plugin will detect the diff and the test will fail.</p>
<p>When you run the test for the first time, the test will fail and <code>pytest-regressions</code> will store the output in a directory with the name of the test file.</p>
<pre><code>test_complex_app.py::test_config_data_with_pytest_regressions FAILED     [100%]
test_complex_app.py:23 (test_config_data_with_pytest_regressions)

</code></pre>
<p>If you run it again, the test pass.</p>
<pre><code>test_complex_app.py::test_config_data_with_pytest_regressions PASSED     [100%]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-images">Testing Images</h3>
<p>Image manipulation is a very common task in AI. In order to train Machine Learning algorithms, images must be pre-processed. For instance, some algorithms require the image to be in gray-scale. Sometimes, images must be scaled down, or up. In other occasions you might want to do image augmentation, which usually consists in rotating or skewing the image.</p>
<p>Now, let’s say that we need to resize down an image to 100x100 and convert it to gray as a pre-processing step. We can write a very simple function called <code>convert_image_to_gray</code>. To test this function, we can rely on the great fixture called <code>image_regression</code> provided by <code>pytest-regressions</code>. The following example illustrates that.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>convert_image_to_gray</span><span>(
    input_path: str, output_path: str, size: Tuple[int, int] = <span>(<span>200</span>, <span>200</span>)</span>
)</span>:</span>
    image = Image.open(input_path)
    gray_image = image.convert(<span>"L"</span>)
    gray_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    gray_image.save(output_path, <span>"PNG"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p> The test for it is just like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_convert_image_to_gray</span><span>(image_regression)</span>:</span>
    output_file = Path(<span>"tests/resources/python_logo_gray.png"</span>)
    convert_image_to_gray(
        <span>"tests/resources/python_logo.png"</span>, str(output_file), size=(<span>100</span>, <span>100</span>)
    )
    image_regression.check(output_file.read_bytes(), diff_threshold=<span>1.0</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it again! No extra setup steps, no complex asserts, just one line.</p>
<h3 id="testing-dictionaries-of-numpy-arrays">Testing Dictionaries of Numpy Arrays</h3>
<p>Another common practice in Data Science is to manipulate <em>numpy</em> arrays. It’s very usual to have dictionaries composed of string keys and <em>numpy</em> arrays as values. Testing that is just as annoying as testing nested dictionaries. It tends to get worse when the arrays are made up of float numbers.</p>
<p>Again, as our previous examples, let's consider a function that returns a dictionary of <em>numpy</em> arrays.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>element_wise_mult</span><span>(a: np.array, b: np.array)</span> -&gt; Dict[str, np.array]:</span>
    res = a * b
    <span>return</span> {<span>"res"</span>: res}
</code></pre>
<p>This function just multiplies two 1D <em>numpy</em> arrays and stores the result in a dictionary. To test that we can use <code>num_regression</code> fixture. As you may have guessed, the interface is the same as the other fixtures using the <code>check</code> method. A full test definition goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_elemwise_multi_calculation</span><span>(num_regression)</span>:</span>
    np.random.seed(<span>0</span>)
    a = np.random.randn(<span>6</span>)
    b = np.random.randn(<span>6</span>)
    result = element_wise_mult(a, b)
    num_regression.check(result)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-files">Testing Files</h3>
<p>Python can represent a file object in three categories: raw binary files, buffered binary files and text files.
A binary file can be used to store any kind of binary data such as images, mp3s, videos and so on. A text file, on the other hand, can be a simple <code>.txt</code> or a <code>.html</code>, <code>.md</code> or just your gold old <code>.py</code> script.</p>
<h4 id="binary-file-example">Binary File Example</h4>
<p>The simplest example of binary file would be a function that takes a path string and loads a binary file from disk and returns its bytes. <code>pytest-regression</code> comes with a fixture <code>file_regression</code> that helps a lot when testing file contents.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>read_from_file</span><span>(path: str)</span> -&gt; bytes:</span>
    <span>with</span> open(path, <span>"rb"</span>) <span>as</span> f:
        <span>return</span> f.read()
</code></pre>
<p>The test goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_read_from_file</span><span>(file_regression, datadir)</span>:</span>
    contents = read_from_file(<span>"tests/resources/data.bin"</span>)
    file_regression.check(contents, binary=<span>True</span>, extension=<span>".bin"</span>)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="text-file-example">Text File Example</h4>
<p>Like I said before, an <code>.html</code> file is just a text file. In this example we'll consider a function that converts an dictionary to a HTML table.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>dict_to_html</span><span>(data: dict)</span> -&gt; str:</span>
    html = <span>"&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;"</span> + <span>"&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;"</span>.join(data.keys()) + <span>"&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"</span>

    <span>for</span> row <span>in</span> zip(*data.values()):
        html += <span>"&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;"</span> + <span>"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;"</span>.join(row) + <span>"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"</span>

    html += <span>"&lt;/table&gt;"</span>

    <span>return</span> html
</code></pre>
<p>And the test...</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_dict_to_html</span><span>(file_regression)</span>:</span>
    data = {
        <span>"Heights"</span>: [<span>"30"</span>, <span>"12"</span>, <span>"12"</span>],
        <span>"IDs"</span>: [<span>"XXDDUBAB"</span>, <span>"LOPSKSKSS"</span>, <span>"KIOTGGAGA"</span>],
        <span>"Download Count"</span>: [<span>"123"</span>, <span>"34"</span>, <span>"2"</span>],
    }

    html = dict_to_html(data)
    file_regression.check(html, extension=<span>".html"</span>)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Well... We could just assert the string returned, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might be asking. We could just assert the string returned. Yes, that’s a fair point, however if the string is too big, the test setup will become polluted and overly verbose. As an alternative, we could store it as a file and then load it. Well, that’s actually what <code>pytest-regressions</code> does, with the benefit of hiding that complexity.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Testing complex data can be tricky and cumbersome. Fortunately, <code>pytest</code> allows great extensibility as plugins. <code>pytest-regression</code> is a non popular but very useful plugin that makes …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html">SQL window functions</a> are one of those topics that never quite clicked for me
in the abstract, but I’ve been able to take advantage of them on a few recent
projects and wanted to share some of what I’ve learned.</p>

<p>As context for this particular example, I’ve been in the habit of weighing
myself daily for the past ~11 years. Aside from providing a <em>very</em> interesting
data set, it just ends up being a lot of data to query, serialize, transmit, and
then render on the client. I’ve got just over 4000 records currently, and I
recently wanted to add an overview chart that would show the full history
below the normal chart that shows a smaller subset of the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1276cbb84af72431a462be52b35a6f9fe821c691/4d390/assets/images/downsample-example-1276cbb8.png" alt="Downsample example"></p>

<p>This image shows the overview graph (the one on the bottom) as it exists now, downsampled to
include every 10th record, but I initially implemented the overview using the
full weigh-in history. I found that including them all added around 250kB of
data and a few seconds downloading the page content (on a “fast 3G” network
setting). I liked the functionality but realized I could likely get by with only
a subset of the records. So I looked into how I could downsample the data, and a
window function turned out to be the perfect tool.</p>

<h2 id="basic-downsampling-example">Basic Downsampling Example</h2>

<p>If I just wanted to grab all the weigh-in records, ordered by date, I could
use:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>date</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In order to downsample this data, I can use a window function to add a
<code>ROW_NUMBER</code> value for the records ordered by date:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span><span>,</span> <span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>()</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now I had the computed row number but in order to use it to filter the records
I had to include it as a sub-query and then filter in the outer query:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span><span>,</span> <span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>()</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span><span>;</span>
<span>)</span> <span>x</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I only want to return the <code>id</code>, <code>date</code>, and <code>weight</code> fields, but I’m able to
use the <code>ROW_NUMBER</code> in our <code>WHERE</code> clause to grab every 10th record using
<code>mod(ROW_NUMBER, 10) = 0</code> filter.</p>

<p><em>Note</em> - the <code>x</code> here is a name I’m giving to the sub-query. Postgres requires a
name, but I’m not actually using it in the rest of the query.</p>

<p><em>Other Note</em> - you’ll likely want to have an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/indexes-ordering.html">index on the <code>date</code>
column</a> to make that
<code>ORDER BY</code> clause efficient.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-user-specific">Make It User Specific</h2>

<p>Let’s say I have the same setup as above, but the records in the
table I want to downsample are user-specific and I want to provide a similar
overview graph for each user. Some users will have long histories with
thousands of records, but others will only have a handful, and I’d like to
return a consistent number of records for the overview graph for all users.</p>

<p>In this case I can use another sub-query to determine the relevant downsample
rate on a per-user basis. Let’s say I want to show a maximum of 300 data points
in the overview graph; I can use a query like the following to get the
downsample rate:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>300</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, rather than using the fixed value <code>10</code> as in the first query (aka, grab
every 10th record), we’ll have a value that will vary for each user to ensure
we get ~300 records in the returned data set.</p>

<p>I can then combine that with the original query to efficiently grab the
downsampled overview with the desired ~300 records:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span><span>,</span> <span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>()</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>date</span><span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span>
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span>
<span>)</span> <span>x</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>300</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Note</em> - you’ll likely already have this, but just as a reminder, you’ll want to
have an index on <code>user_id</code> for the relevant table to make sure the sub-query
won’t slow things down too much.</p>

<h2 id="a-final-tweak-for-very-large-tables">A Final Tweak for Very Large Tables</h2>

<p>There’s one last trick that has helped in the
case of a very large table where <code>COUNT(*)</code> is slow enough to be noticed. In
this case I don’t actually care about getting an <em>exact</em> count, so I can take
advantage of postgres metadata to get an approximate count:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>reltuples</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>relname</span> <span>=</span> <span>'weighins'</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A bit cryptic, but this query gets the approximate record count for the table.
It lags a bit behind the actual value as it’s only updated when postgres runs
<code>VACUUM</code> or <code>ANALYZE</code> or similar housekeeping operations, but it’s more than
sufficient for our needs. I’ve tacked <code>::int</code> to explicitly typecast the
result to allow us to use this in our <code>WHERE mod(ROW_NUMBER, ...)</code> filter.</p>

<p>I can combine this as a sub-query to get a reasonably performant downsampled
version of our data, even for very large tables:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span><span>,</span> <span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>()</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span>
<span>)</span> <span>x</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>reltuples</span> <span>/</span> <span>300</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>relname</span> <span>=</span> <span>'weighins'</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html">Postgres Documentation on Window Functions</a> is, unsurprisingly, very
solid. The <a href="https://sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html">SQLite Introduction to Window Functions</a> is also quite good, and
<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/postgres-window-functions">thoughtbot has a great article on using window functions</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This is an attempt to understand Raph Levien’s <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/audio/2019/02/14/parallel-iir.html">IIR filters can be evaluated in parallel</a> by a person with no particular knowledge of DSP, filtering or relevant mathematics, just an interest in evaluating an IIR filter in parallel and a good deal of programming experience! The goal is to produce an implementation of this article demonstrating in code the approach Raph describes. The code won’t be optimal by any means, but should serve as a sufficient base for building something much better.</p>

<p>Right from the get go we get an inkling this might not be as straight-forward as we might hope:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Author’s note: I got slightly stuck writing this, so am publishing a somewhat unfinished draft</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the article focuses on a simple RC-lowpass filter, given by the equation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>y[i] = x[i] * c + y[i - 1] * (1 - c)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Raph also points out that this formulation of an IIR filter, while easy to understand has been superseded by the state space approach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rather than writing it it in direct form, which emphasizes the serial evaluation strategy, it’s better to use matrices. Basically, y becomes a state vector, and a becomes a matrix. This is known as the state space approach to filters and has many advantages. I’d go so far to say that direct form is essentially obsolete now, optimizing for the number of multiplies at the expense of parallelism, numerical stability, and good modulation properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The state space approach will become important later. It is worth taking a little detour to clear it up.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="state-space-detour">State Space Detour</h2>

<p>All IIR filters are difference equations, which for our purposes are recursive equations that rely on one or more outputs from previous steps. Simply speaking, the deeper the recursion (more previous outputs), the more “powerful” it can be. This recursive level is the <code>order</code> of the filter. For example, to create a low-pass filter with a steeper cut-off, like a brick-wall filter, it will need more than just the single level of recursion of the RC-lowpass filter – it will have a higher order.</p>

<p>A possible building block of such high-order IIRs is the biquad. A biquad is a second order (order = 2) filter. Biquads can be chained together to create even higher-order filters, a representation called second order sections.</p>

<p>This gets us to the <code>direct form</code> referenced in the quote above. Direct Form is a way to represent a biquad. One of the Direct Forms uses the following equation:</p>

<p><code>y[n] = b0 * x[n] + b1 * x[n - 1] + b2 * x[n - 2] - a1 * y[n - 1] - a2 * y[n - 2]</code></p>

<p>This is a second order filter because it relies on two historical values (<code>y[n - 1]</code> and <code>y[n - 2]</code>.) Thinking of the RC-lowpass filter in this way tells us that <code>b0</code> is <code>c</code> and <code>a1</code> is <code>c - 1</code> and the other constants are zero (our filter is first-order.)</p>

<h3 id="conversion-to-state-space">Conversion to State Space</h3>

<p>All IIR filters can be representated by a transfer function, written as <code>H(z)</code>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter">Wiki’s</a> introduction to biquads shows the transfer function. Mapping it to the direct form is trivial, so it is omitted here.</p>

<p>We want to convert the biquad form to a state space form. More generally it would be useful to be able to convert any IIR filter that can be written in terms of <code>H(z)</code> to state space form. This can be done by hand, but fortunately it can be done easily via GNU Octave’s or Matlab’s <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/tf2ss.html">tf2ss</a> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c = 0.44
num = [c]
den = [1 c-1]
[A, B, C, D] = tf2ss(num, den)
A: 0.56
B: 1
C: 0.44
D: 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally we can write the filter in state-space form. State-space form is generally written as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = Ax[n] + Bu[n]
y[n] = Cx[n] + Du[n]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So far our equations have had <code>y</code> as the output (i.e the filtered signal) and <code>x</code> as the input (i.e. the signal to be filtered.) State-space changes this, the signal to be filtered is <code>u</code> and <code>x</code> is the <em>state vector</em>. Generally, <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> are matrices and <code>B</code> and <code>D</code> are vectors. Since our filter is first-order, each of these values are simply numbers. <code>D</code> is zero so it can be removed entirely and <code>B</code> is one so it can be simplified to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = Ax[n] + u[n]
y[n] = Cx[n]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>substituting the constant <code>C</code> from the RC-lowpass filter equation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = (1 - C)x[n] + u[n]
y[n] = Cx[n]`
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="monoid-homomorphism-time">Monoid Homomorphism Time</h2>

<p>This is where the meat of the approach lies. Quoting from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic insight is that the target monoid is a function from input state to output state, and represents any integral number of samples. The monoid binary operator is function composition, which is by nature associative and has an identity (the identity function).
In general, the amount of state required to represent such a function, as opposed to a single state value, is intractable, but in [this case] it works […] because the function is linear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is going to require some unpacking.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="what-is-a-monoid">What is a monoid?</h3>

<p>A monoid is a triplet of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a set being operated on</li>
  <li>an associative binary operator</li>
  <li>an identity element</li>
</ul>

<p>The set might be the set of real numbers, for example. A binary operator is a function that takes two parameters that are elements of the set. Associativity is the property <code>(a op b) op c = a op (b op c)</code>, i.e. you can place the brackets arbitrarily. An identity element is an element <code>e</code> such that <code>e op x = x op e = x</code>. It is a no-op element.</p>

<p>For example, you might have a monoid representing addition: <code>(f64, +, 0)</code> meaning the set being operated on are the 64-bit floats, the binary operation is addition and the identity is <code>0</code> because <code>0+x = x+0 = x</code>. Similarly you could have a monoid representing multiplication: <code>(i32, *, 1)</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Back to the article. Before tackling the homomorphism and what it means, we’ll try to understand what Raph gives us as the path forward:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The target monoid is a function of this form:
<code>y_out = a * y_in + b</code>
This can obviously be represented as two floats, we can write the representation as simply <code>(a, b)</code>. The homomorphism then binds a single sample of input into a function. Given the filter above, an input of <code>x</code> maps to <code>(c, x * (1 - c))</code>.
Similarly, we can write out the effect of function composition in the two-floats representation space. Given <code>(a1, b1)</code> and <code>(a2, b2)</code>, their composition is <code>(a1 * a2, a2 * b1 + b2)</code>. Not especially complicated or difficult to compute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have to understand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is a monoid homomorphism?</li>
  <li>How does the input mapping result in <code>(c, x * (1 - c)</code>?</li>
  <li>Why is <code>y_out = a * y_in + b</code> our target monoid?</li>
  <li>Why is our target monoid represented as <code>(a , b)</code>?</li>
  <li>How is the binary operation (function composition) applied?</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll do it backwards, from easiest to hardest to understand.</p>

<h3 id="how-is-the-binary-operation-function-composition-applied">How is the binary operation (function composition) applied?</h3>

<p>Raph makes the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given <code>(a1, b1)</code> and <code>(a2, b2)</code>, their composition is <code>(a1 * a2, a2 * b1 + b2)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is function composition? Say we have two functions, <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code>, composition is simply <code>f2(f1(x))</code>. In our case the two functions are:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>f1: y[n] = a1 * y[n-1] + b1
f2: y[n] = a2 * y[n-1] + b2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The function composition, <code>f2(f1(x))</code> is thus:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>y[n] = a2 * (a1 * y[n-1] + b1) + b2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which multiplies out to:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>y[n] = a2 * a1 * y[n-1] + a2 * b1 + b2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is clearly still of the form <code>y[n] = a * y[n-1] + b</code>, with <code>(a, b)</code> now being <code>(a2 * a1, a2 * b1 + b2)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-our-target-monoid-represented-as-a--b">Why is our target monoid represented as <code>(a , b)</code>?</h3>

<p>This is now easier to understand. To represent the history of all prior invocations of the monoid, all we need are the <code>(a, b)</code> pair of the most recent function.</p>

<p>In other words, the history <code>fn(fn-1(fn-2(fn-3(...f0(0)...))))</code> can be represented as simply <code>fn(0)</code> provided we know the <code>(a, b)</code> pair.</p>

<p>Why do we know the initial input is zero? This chain of functions starts with <code>y[0] = ...</code>. But <code>y[0]</code> cannot be defined by a prior <code>y[-1]</code>; by definition there is nothing before the first element. Therefore the initial value for <code>y[n-1]</code> must be zero.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-y_out--a--y_in--b-our-target-monoid">Why is <code>y_out = a * y_in + b</code> our target monoid?</h3>

<p>The state space representation for our filter was written as two equations:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = (1-C)x[n] + u[n]
y[n] = Cx[n]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our goal is to evaluate the filter in parallel, so we want to get rid of recursion. The equation for the <em>state vector</em>, <code>x[n]</code> is recursive, so that’s our target. We already know we can evaluate this equation without requiring the prior values provided we can compute values for <code>(a, b)</code>.</p>

<p>Also, from the introduction to this section, we’re told:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The basic insight is that the target monoid is a function from input state to output state</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>x[n]</code> is the <em>state vector</em> so our target monoid is evaluating the state of the filter at any <code>n</code> and producing the corresponding output state.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-input-mapping-result-in-c-x--1---c">How does the input mapping result in <code>(c, x * (1 - c)</code>?</h3>

<p>All the pieces are in place, now we just need to compute those <code>(a, b)</code> values. We’ve got our target monoid:</p>

<p><code>x[n+1] = (1 - C) * x[n] + u[n]</code></p>

<p>let’s write it as:</p>

<p><code>y_out = (1 - C) * y_in + b</code></p>

<p>Remember <code>u[n]</code> is the signal, so when we feed in a single sample <code>x</code>, it takes the place of <code>u[n]</code> which is <code>b</code> in our target form:</p>

<p><code>y_out = (1 - C) * y_in + x</code>.</p>

<p>Pretty clearly, <code>(a, b)</code> is <code>(1 - C, x)</code>. That’s not what we expected. There are two reasons for this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, there’s a mistake in the article. The mapping should result in <code>(1 - C, x * C)</code>. That’s still not the result we have.</li>
  <li>Second, we are computing the state, not the final output. Once we have the state we still need to apply <code>y[n] = Cx[n]</code> to compute the final filtered result. Since that’s not a recursive function it is trivial to compute in parallel. It turns out that <code>(1 - C, x * C)</code> will both compute the state and apply the <code>y[n]</code> equation. I’m not sure how to derive this result, I stumbled upon it by accident. Furthermore, in the general case I’m not sure <code>y[n]</code> can be computed in one step along with the state vector (consider the case where <code>D</code> is non-zero.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-a-monoid-homomorphism">What is a Monoid Homomorphism?</h3>

<p>A per usual, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#Monoid_homomorphisms">Wiki</a> is a good source for this.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, if you have two monoids with binary operators <code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code> and a function <code>f</code> that translates inputs for <code>M1</code> into <code>M2</code>, then you have a homomorphism if:</p>

<p><code>f(M1(x, y)) = M2(f(x), f(y))</code> and given identity elements for the monoids <code>I1</code> and <code>I2</code> <code>f(I1) = I2</code>.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the homomorphism is in this case since it requires two …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

</header>

<p>For some time now (since the 1.26 release, to be precise), Rust has a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46882">very powerful machinery for CTFE</a>, or compile-time function evaluation.
Since then, there have been various discussions about which operations should be allowed during CTFE, which checks the compiler should do, how this all relates to promotion and which kinds of guarantees we should be able to expect around CTFE.
This post is my take on those topics, and it should not be surprising that I am going to take a very type-system centric view.
Expect something like a structured brain dump, so there are some unanswered questions towards the end as well.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<h2 id="some-background">Some Background</h2>

<p>CTFE is the mechanism used by the compiler, primarily, to evaluate items like <code>const x: T = ...;</code>.
The <code>...</code> here is going to be Rust code that must be “run” at compile-time, because it can be used as a constant in the code – for example, it can be used for array lengths.</p>

<p>Notice that CTFE is <em>not</em> the same as constant propagation: Constant propagation is an optimization pass done by compilers like LLVM that will opportunistically change code like <code>3 + 4</code> into <code>7</code> to avoid run-time work.
Being an optimization, constant propagation must, by definition, not change program behavior and will not be observable at all (other than performance).
CTFE, on the other hand, is about code that <em>must</em> be executed at compile-time because the compiler needs to know its result to proceed – for example, it needs to know the size of an array to compute how to lay out data in memory.
You can statically see, just from the syntax of the code, whether CTFE applies to some piece of code or not:
CTFE is only used in places like the value of a <code>const</code> or the length of an array.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>demo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span> <span>// CTFE</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span> <span>// no CTFE (but maybe constant propagation)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We say that the <code>3 + 4</code> above is in <em>const context</em> and hence subject to CTFE, but the <code>4 + 3</code> is not.</p>

<h2 id="const-safety">Const Safety</h2>

<p>Not all operations can be used in const context.
For example, it makes no sense to compute your array length as “please go read that file from disk and compute something” – we can’t know what will be on the disk when the program actually runs.
We could use the disk of the machine compiling the program, but that does not sound very appealing either.
Things get even worse when you consider letting the program send information to the network.
Clearly, we don’t want CTFE to have actually observable side-effects outside of compilation.</p>

<p>In fact, just naively letting programs read files would also be grossly unsafe:
When computing the length of an array twice, it is important that we obtain the same result.
<strong>Update:</strong> As @eddyb points out, things get even worse once you consider const generics, traits, and coherence: At that point, you have to <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/mir-constant-evaluation/3143/47">rely on evaluating the same expression in different crates to produce the same result</a>. <strong>/Update</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>CTFE must be deterministic.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If not, the compiler could end up thinking that two arrays have the same length, but then later compute different layouts.
That would be a disaster.
So, any kind of external input and any kind of non-determinism is a complete no-go for CTFE.
This does not just concern I/O, even converting a reference to a <code>usize</code> is not deterministic.</p>

<p>The compiler will throw a CTFE error if such an operation is ever attempted to be executed.
Those programs that <em>are</em> executable in const context are called <em>const safe</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A program is const safe if it can be executed by CTFE without hitting an error (panics are allowed).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very much in analogy with the idea that a <em>safe</em> (or <em>run-time safe</em>, to distinguish it from const safe) program is a program that does not cause any memory errors or data races.
In fact, we will see that this analogy between “programs that are well-behaved under CTFE” (const safety) and “programs that do not cause UB” (run-time safety) can carry us very far.</p>

<p>One very interesting question now is whether some given function <code>foo</code> should be allowed to be called in const context.
We could just always say “yes”, and rely on the fact that CTFE will throw an error when <code>foo</code> does anything fishy.
The problem with this approach is that, if <code>foo</code> is in a library, updating the library might change <code>foo</code> in a way that makes it no longer const-safe.
In other words, making <em>any</em> function not const-safe any more would be a semver violation because it could break downstream crates.</p>

<p>The typical mechanism to solve that problem is to have an annotation that explicitly marks a function as “usable in const context”.
In Rust, the proposed mechanism for this purpose is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111"><code>const fn</code></a>; in C++ it is called <code>constexpr</code>.
The compiler can now reject calling non-<code>const</code> functions in const context, so library authors can add non-const-safe operations without breaking semver.</p>

<h2 id="const-type-system-and-const-soundness">Const Type System and Const Soundness</h2>

<p>This leads us to the interesting situation that the compiler will reject code in const context that it would accept just fine outside of const context.
In particular, the body of a <code>const fn</code> is <em>also</em> considered to be in const context – otherwise, if we allowed calling arbitrary functions, we would have the same problem again.
One useful way to think about this is that we have a second type system, a “const type system”, that is used to type-check code in const context.
This type system does not allow calls to non-<code>const</code> functions.</p>

<p>It should probably also not allow casting a reference to an integer, because (as discussed above) that is a non-deterministic operation which cannot be performed during CTFE.
What else?</p>

<p>Before we go on and add random additional checks, let us step back and think about what our goals are here.
Typically, the purpose of a type system is to establish some sort of guarantee for a well-typed program.
For Rust’s “main” (“run-time”) type system, that guarantee is “no undefined behavior”, which means no memory errors and no data races.
What is the guarantee for our new const type system?
We have already talked about it above: It’s const safety!
This leads us to the definition of const soundness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Our const type system is sound if well-typed programs are const-safe.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, notice how this is very similar to the correctness statement for the run-time type system, which guarantees run-time safety.</p>

<p>However, we have to be a bit careful here.
Consider the following piece of code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>const</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_eight_mod_256</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>256</span> <span>==</span> <span>8</span> <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We will definitely want to allow this code.
Why should <code>==</code> or <code>%</code> not be const-safe?
Well, we could call our function as follows:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>is_eight_mod_256</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>into_raw</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That statement is certainly <em>not</em> const-safe as the result depends on where exactly the allocator puts our <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box</code></a>.
However, we want to blame the <code>as usize</code> for this issue, not the <code>is_eight_mod_256</code>.</p>

<p>The solution is for the const type system to not just have separate rules about which operations are allowed, we also must change our notion of which values are “valid” for a given type.
An integer obtained from a pointer is valid for <code>usize</code> at run-time, but it is <em>not</em> valid for <code>usize</code> in const mode!
After all, there are basic arithmetic operations that we expect all <code>usize</code> to support, that CTFE cannot support for pointers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A function is const-safe if, when executed with const-valid arguments, it does not trigger a CTFE error and returns a const-valid result (if it returns at all).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under this definition, <code>is_eight_mod_256</code> is const-safe because whenever <code>x</code> is an actual integer, it will evaluate without any error.
At the same time, this shows that converting a reference into <code>usize</code> is <em>not</em> const-safe, because the input of this operation is const-valid, but the output is not!
This provides a solid justification for rejecting such casts in const context.</p>

<h2 id="ctfe-correctness">CTFE correctness</h2>

<p>In Rust, CTFE is performed by miri, a MIR interpreter that used to be a <a href="https://github.com/solson/miri/">separate project</a> but whose core engine has been integrated into rustc.
miri will execute the code in const context step-by-step and just complain and fail with an error when an operation cannot be performed.
This does not just concern non-determinism; miri does not support everything it could support because @oli-obk is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5ba21844f6c85a0cd55c8ea0250d5cd758134f84/src/librustc_mir/interpret/const_eval.rs#L199">super careful</a> about not accidentally stabilizing behavior that should undergo an RFC.</p>

<p>In fact, right now miri will reject all operations on raw pointers.
They all raise a CTFE error and hence must all be rejected by the const type system.
The plan is to change miri so that it can support more operations, but we have to be careful in doing so.
I have already mentioned that miri must be deterministic, but there is another point to consider that you might have expected to play a much more prominent role:
CTFE, at least if it succeeds, should match run-time behavior!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>CTFE is correct if, when it loops forever, completes with a result, or panics, that behavior matches the run-time behavior of the same code.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We clearly do not want code to behave differently when it lives in const context and is run by CTFE, and when it is compiled to machine-code and executed “for real”.</p>

<p>Or, do we?
Don’t get me wrong, I am not advocating for deliberately breaking that property, but it sure is worth considering what would go wrong if miri was <em>not</em> CTFE-correct.
Maybe surprisingly, it turns out that this would not be a soundness issue!
All we care about for the purpose of soundness is for CTFE to be deterministic, as already discussed.
We don’t re-run the same code at run-time and rely on it still doing the same, so nothing actually breaks if CTFE behavior diverges from run-time behavior.</p>

<p>That said, not being CTFE correct is surely very surprising and we should avoid it best we can.
However, I am told that actually predicting the result of floating-point operations deterministically <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/floating_point_determinism/">is extremely hard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111#issuecomment-386765720">LLVM isn’t exactly helping</a>.
So, we will likely have to live with either considering floating point operations to be const-unsafe (raising a CTFE error), or not having CTFE correctness when floating point operations are …</p></article></div>

<p>Published Feb. 12, 2012</p>
<p>Belatedly, the world has learned that Roger M. Boisjoly, the whistleblower who tried to prevent the <em>Challenger</em> space shuttle explosion, passed away recently in Nephi, Utah.</p>

<p>Roger M. Boisjoly, the son of a mill worker, was born April 25, 1938, in Lowell, Massachusetts. &nbsp;From childhood, he was known for his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lowellsun.com/news/ci_19902357?source=rss#ixzz1mDSiN0rn">honesty</a>&nbsp;and “would not back down from what he believed in,” say family members. After earning a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lowellsun.com/news/ci_19902357?source=rss#ixzz1mDOGMpcw">mechanical engineering</a>&nbsp;degree from the University of Lowell, he began working in the aircraft industry. After a move to California, then to Utah, he took a job with&nbsp; Morton Thiokol, working on solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle program.</p>
<p>In 1985, he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html">warned</a>&nbsp;managers that 0-rings used to seal joints in the booster rockets could fail at freezing temperatures. ‘The result would be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html">a catastrophe of the highest order</a>&nbsp;— loss of human life,’ he wrote in a memo.&nbsp; But, the problem had not been resolved when the space shuttle&nbsp;<em>Challenger</em>&nbsp;was prepared for launch on January 28, 1986.</p>
<p>On the night of January 27, temperatures fell below freezing.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/9067491/Roger-Boisjoly.html">Boisjoly and four other engineers</a>&nbsp;tried desperately to convince management that the launch should be scrubbed.&nbsp; They warned that the cold would cause rubber o-rings to become brittle and fail, allowing hot gases to leak at the joints. Morton Thiokol and NASA managers dismissed the arguments, and decided to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/roger-boisjolys-death-goes-unnoticed-predicted-1986-nasa-rocket-explosion-68897/">go ahead</a>&nbsp;with the launch.</p>
<p>The next day, Challenger lifted off from its pad at Kennedy Space Center.&nbsp; At first, the launch appeared normal, but 73 seconds into flight the shuttle exploded, sending fragments arcing across the bright Florida sky.&nbsp; In view of a horrified public, including thousands of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/reagan-challenger.htm">schoolchildren</a>&nbsp;watching a live broadcast, seven astronauts plummeted to their deaths in the Atlantic ocean.</p>
<p>NASA’s actions following the disaster were typical for a government agency with a scandal on its hands: it impounded documents and told employees and others connected with the program&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SwuCxfZn_kEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22NASA+Had+Warning+of+a+Disaster+Risk+Posed+by+Booster%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PxrIMhhWBM&amp;sig=8jGg4rLQy4_dX4_bloIqwa5NW8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9RE4T5nfLaTb0QHw6tnhAg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22NASA%20Had%20Warning%20of%20a%20Disaster%20Risk%20Posed%20by%20Booster%22&amp;f=false">not to talk to reporters</a>, even off the record.</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan established a commission, known as the “Rogers Commission,” to search for the cause of the explosion and, initially, NASA managers were successful in &nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SwuCxfZn_kEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22NASA+Had+Warning+of+a+Disaster+Risk+Posed+by+Booster%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PxrIMhhWBM&amp;sig=8jGg4rLQy4_dX4_bloIqwa5NW8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9RE4T5nfLaTb0QHw6tnhAg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22NASA%20Had%20Warning%20of%20a%20Disaster%20Risk%20Posed%20by%20Booster%22&amp;f=false">diverting attention</a>&nbsp;from the o-rings. &nbsp;But, the dissenting engineers refused to let an important truth be swept under the carpet.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was clear to the engineers that NASA was bent on minimizing the pre-launch concern over the cold. Boisjoly was sufficiently concerned that he took his&nbsp;personal files&nbsp;into a sort of protective custody. He emptied his desk and took the critical memos with him to Huntsville. He slept with them in his motel room. He hid them in the locked trunk of his rented car when he went to work at the Marshall Space Flight Center. He sent copies home to Roberta. And still he worried that someone might try to lose or destroy them. –&nbsp;William C. Rempel, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-28/news/mn-1361_1_engineers/3">Los Angeles Times</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The investigation took a new direction after February 9, when the New York Times published a&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6f6LrdOXO6wC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=new+york+times+february+9+challenger+closed+session&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycL-vpTDJY&amp;sig=poGvZlXOiWbefMO3NCP8jvXlbyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jlo4T5SNOuPu0gHU5MHfAg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20york%20times%20february%209%20challenger%20closed%20session&amp;f=false">front-page story</a>&nbsp;(“NASA Had Warning of a Disaster Risk Posed by Booster”) citing concerns about o-ring failure expressed in documents it had obtained from an “anonymous solid fuel rocket analyst.”&nbsp; Afterward, the commission held three&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6f6LrdOXO6wC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=new+york+times+february+9+challenger+closed+session&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycL-vpTDJY&amp;sig=poGvZlXOiWbefMO3NCP8jvXlbyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jlo4T5SNOuPu0gHU5MHfAg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20york%20times%20february%209%20challenger%20closed%20session&amp;f=false">closed sessions</a>&nbsp;where personnel from Morton Thiokol and Marshall Space Flight center were questioned, including participants in the teleconference that took place on the eve of Challenger’s launch.&nbsp; As a result, the o-ring issues became a major focus of the investigation.</p>
<p>Boisjoly, who had been known as a “crackerjack troubleshooter,” was re-branded a “<a href="http://www.ocregister.com/news/boisjoly-248703-boyd-chapman.html">whistleblower</a>.” “After he finally passed [his] files personally to Major Gen. Donald J. Kutyna of the presidential commission, Boisjoly was&nbsp;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-28/news/mn-1361_1_engineers/3">accused</a>&nbsp;of ‘airing the company’s dirty laundry’ in front of the whole country,” wrote the LA Times.</p>
<p>In June 1986, the commission confirmed that the o-rings and cold weather led to the disaster.&nbsp; But, it did not attach blame to any of the individuals who ignored the engineers’ warnings.&nbsp; Instead, the commission criticized the “flawed”&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EP9D_30SpkMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA9&amp;lpg=RA1-PA9&amp;dq=NASA+HAD+WARNING+OF+A+DISASTER+RISK+POSED+BY+BOOSTER&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZsOwDSnG83&amp;sig=YgXOJqYLqYNITsW9iFk8pvKbEEg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3BQ4T-_vBqL50gG43JDTBQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=NASA%20HAD%20WARNING%20OF%20A%20DISASTER%20RISK%20POSED%20BY%20BOOSTER&amp;f=false">process</a>&nbsp;of decision-making.</p>
<p>The pre-launch effort by Boisjoly and others to stop the launch did not qualify as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/EthicsResources/Otherresources/whistle.html">whistleblowing</a>, some experts say, because the engineers did not go outside approved channels. But, that legal definition is unrealistically narrow.</p>
<blockquote><p>If it is a distinguishing mark of actions labeled whistleblowing that the agent intends to&nbsp;force attention to a serious moral problem, both Boisjoly’s and MacDonald’s responses qualify. This feature is the foundation of the public’s interest in whistleblowing. By bringing such serious problems to light, whistleblowers contribute to protecting the public’s welfare.&nbsp;<em>– Vivian Weill, <a href="http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/EthicsResources/Otherresources/whistle.html">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> (1996)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We now know that Boisjoly&nbsp;<a href="http://keranews.org/post/remembering-roger-boisjoly-he-tried-stop-shuttle-challenger-launch">met secretly</a>&nbsp;with an NPR reporter shortly after the shuttle disaster to provide information about the problems at Morton Thiokol — clearly not an approved channel. Unquestionably, that was an act of whistleblowing, but Boisjoly’s request for&nbsp;<a href="http://keranews.org/post/remembering-roger-boisjoly-he-tried-stop-shuttle-challenger-launch">anonymity</a>&nbsp;prevented it from becoming public knowledge.</p>
<p>The clearest evidence of whistleblowing, writes Weill, may be its most predictable consequence:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://whistleblowing.us/2012/02/remembering-roger-m-boisjoly-challenger-disaster-whistleblower-1938-2012/Weil%20nevertheless%20suggests%20that%20Boisjoly%20was%20a%20whistleblower,%20under%20different%20standards.%20Retaliation%20may%20be%20the%20most%20predictable%20feature%20of%20whistleblowing,%20perhaps%20enough%20to%20make%20it%20a%20defining%20feature.writes">retaliation</a>. There was no shortage of that after the engineers exposed the truth of o-ring failures. &nbsp;Along with Allan MacDonald, another engineer who tried to stop the Challenger launch, Boisjoly was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.standard.net/topics/atk/2011/01/27/two-men-fought-prevent-challenger-launch">taken off the investigation team</a>&nbsp;by Morton Thiokol management. The environment, he said, was hostile.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Thiokol managers] were extremely angry when I turned in my documentation and that anger increased as I continued to testify,” says Boisjoly. During testimony at a committee hearing, he publicly refuted a manager’s assertion that Thiokol engineers weren’t unanimous in recommending that the launch be canceled. “When I finished they were so damn mad&nbsp;that I think if they had guns they would have shot me on the spot,” he says. – Molly Gavin, Engineering Times (August, 1995), <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/blogs/nspe-blog/pe-warned-space-shuttle-disaster">republished</a> by NSPE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later, in “Truth, Lies and O-Rings,” MacDonald wrote that “Roger and I already felt like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.standard.net/topics/atk/2011/01/27/two-men-fought-prevent-challenger-launch">lepers</a>, but when we returned to Utah following the May 2 session our colleagues treated us as if we had just been arrested for child sexual abuse.”</p>
<p>Colleagues and even neighbors&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10084988">shunned</a>&nbsp;Boisjoly. Thiokol “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/us/roger-boisjoly-73-dies-warned-of-shuttle-danger.html">cut him off</a>&nbsp;from space work,” and NASA “tried to&nbsp;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/07/local/la-me-roger-boisjoly-20120207">blackball him</a>&nbsp;from the industry.” “Managers isolated him in his position and “<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">made life a living hell</a>&nbsp;on a day-to-day basis.”</p>
<p>“When I realized what was happening, it absolutely destroyed me,” Boisjoly told The Associated Press in a 1988 telephone interview. “<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10084988">It destroyed my career, my life, everything else.</a>”&nbsp; Boisjoly hung on for six months before deciding to take&nbsp;<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">long-term disability</a>&nbsp;leave, having been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He would not return to Thiokol.</p>
<p>Boisjoly filed lawsuits against Thiokol and NASA, including a&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam">qui tam</a></em>&nbsp;claim that Morton Thiokol had defrauded the public. The&nbsp;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-04/news/mn-4921_1_justice-department-spokeswoman">Justice Department refused</a>&nbsp;to join the suit as expected, and the lawsuits were&nbsp;<a href="http://ut.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19880831_0000002.DUT.htm/qx">dismissed</a>.&nbsp; The chilling spectacle of a whistleblower’s fall from grace sent a powerful message to others in the industry to stay silent about the next disaster in the making.</p>
<p>Boisjoly viewed the lawsuits as “<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">an exercise in total futility</a>.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think [the court system was]&nbsp;afraid of what they’d find.” The suits never even made it to the discovery process, he says. Boisjoly decided not to pursue the lawsuits further. “I tried to get on with my life,” he says. – Gavin, 1995</p></blockquote>
<p>Boisjoly’s moral courage earned him multiple&nbsp;<a href="http://www.onlineethics.org/cms/12717.aspx">awards</a>, including one from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1988, and another from the Cavallo Foundation in 1990. Despite the awards, Boisjoly saw no hope of returning to his former career.&nbsp; Like many other blacklisted whistleblowers, he decided to&nbsp;<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">go into business for himself</a>.&nbsp; He obtained a professional engineering license and began consulting as a forensic engineer. In additon, he wrote papers and lectured to engineering students on a subject dear to him:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html#ixzz1locDb6ls">ethical decision making.</a></p>
<p>NASA’s management culture failed to preserve the costly lessons of the&nbsp;<em>Challenger&nbsp;</em>disaster. In January 2003, NASA launched&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">another space shuttle</a>&nbsp;under circumstances that worried engineers. &nbsp;Foam insulation broke off during&nbsp;<em>Columbia’s&nbsp;</em>lift-off and punched a hole in a wing, leaving it vulnerable to the extreme forces of reentry. On February 1, as it re-entered earth’s atmosphere,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">Columbia disintegrated</a></em>&nbsp;in the skies above Texas, sending another seven astronauts to their deaths.</p>
<p>The space shuttle program&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html">ended</a>, several flights later, on July 21, 2011.&nbsp; Less than six months after, on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html#ixzz1locDb6ls">January 6, 2012</a>, Roger Boisjoly finally found peace.&nbsp; At the age of 73 — one year for every second of Challenger’s last flight — he died in his sleep of cancer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>This is the first in a series of posts describing how we can debug applications in production using eBPF, without recompilation/redeployment. This post describes how to use <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/gobpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gobpf</a> and uprobes to build a function argument tracer for Go applications. This technique is also extendable to other compiled languages such as C++, Rust, etc. The next sets of posts in this series will discuss using eBPF for tracing HTTP/gRPC data, SSL, etc.</p><p>When debugging, we are typically interested in capturing the state of a program. This allows us to examine what the application is doing and determine where the bug is located in our code. A simple way to observe state is to use a debugger to capture function arguments. For Go applications, we often use Delve or gdb.</p><p>Delve and gdb work well for debugging in a development environment, but they are not often used in production. The features that make these debuggers powerful can also make them undesirable to use in production systems. Debuggers can cause significant interruption to the program and even allow mutation of state which might lead to unexpected failures of production software.</p><p>To more cleanly capture function arguments, we will explore using enhanced BPF (<a href="https://ebpf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBPF</a>), which is available in Linux 4.x+, and the higher level Go library <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/gobpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gobpf</a>.</p><p>Extended BPF (eBPF) is a kernel technology that is available in Linux 4.x+. You can think of it as a lightweight sandboxed VM that runs inside of the Linux kernel and can provide verified access to kernel memory.</p><p>As shown in the overview below, eBPF allows the kernel to run BPF bytecode. While the front-end language used can vary, it is often a restricted subset of C. Typically the C code is first compiled to the BPF bytecode using Clang, then the bytecode is verified to make sure it's safe to execute. These strict verifications guarantee that the machine code will not intentionally or accidentally compromise the Linux kernel, and that the BPF probe will execute in a bounded number of instructions every time it is triggered. These guarantees enable eBPF to be used in performance-critical workloads like packet filtering, networking monitoring, etc.</p><p>Functionally, eBPF allows you to run restricted C code upon some event (eg. timer, network event or a function call). When triggered on a function call we call these functions probes and they can be used to either run on a function call within the kernel (kprobes), or a function call in a userspace program (uprobes). This post focuses on using uprobes to allow dynamic tracing of function arguments.</p><p>Uprobes allow you to intercept a userspace program by inserting a debug trap instruction (<code>int3</code> on an x86) that triggers a soft-interrupt . This is also <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/01/27/how-debuggers-work-part-2-breakpoints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how debuggers work</a>. The flow for an uprobe is essentially the same as any other BPF program and is summarized in the diagram below. The compiled and verified BPF program is executed as part of a uprobe, and the results can be written into a buffer.</p><div><figure>

  </figure></div><p>Let's see how uprobes actually function. To deploy uprobes and capture function arguments, we will be using <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/app.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> simple demo application. The relevant parts of this Go program are shown below.</p><p><code>main()</code> is a simple HTTP server that exposes a single <em>GET</em> endpoint on <em>/e</em>, which computes Euler's number (<strong>e</strong>) using an iterative approximation. <code>computeE</code> takes in a single query param(<em>iters</em>), which specifies the number of iterations to run for the approximation. The more iterations, the more accurate the approximation, at the cost of compute cycles. It's not essential to understand the math behind the function. We are just interested in tracing the arguments of any invocation of <code>computeE</code>.</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>To understand how uprobes work, let's look at how symbols are tracked inside binaries. Since uprobes work by inserting a debug trap instruction, we need to get the address where the function is located. Go binaries on Linux use ELF to store debug info. This information is available, even in optimized binaries, unless debug data has been stripped. We can use the command <code>objdump</code> to examine the symbols in the binary:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>From the output, we know that the function <code>computeE</code> is located at address <code>0x6609a0</code>. To look at the instructions around it, we can ask <code>objdump</code> to disassemble to binary (done by adding <code>-d</code>). The disassembled code looks like:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>From this we can see what happens when <code>computeE</code> is called. The first instruction is <code>mov 0x8(%rsp),%rax</code>. This moves the content offset <code>0x8</code> from the <code>rsp</code> register to the <code>rax</code> register. This is actually the input argument <code>iterations</code> above; Go's arguments are passed on the stack.</p><p>With this information in mind, we are now ready to dive in and write code to trace the arguments for <code>computeE</code>.</p><p>To capture the events, we need to register a uprobe function and have a userspace function that can read the output. A diagram of this is shown below. We will write a binary called <code>tracer</code> that is responsible for registering the BPF code and reading the results of the BPF code. As shown, the uprobe will simply write to a perf-buffer, a linux kernel data structure used for perf events.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/9f8b26f88f9b132440ef1b9d48b5a341/app-tracer.svg"><figcaption>High-level overview showing the Tracer binary listening to perf events generated from the App</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now that we understand the pieces involved, let's look into the details of what happens when we add an uprobe. The diagram below shows how the binary is modified by the Linux kernel with an uprobe. The soft-interrupt instruction (<code>int3</code>) is inserted as the first instruction in <code>main.computeE</code>. This causes a soft-interrupt, allowing the Linux kernel to execute our BPF function. We then write the arguments to the perf-buffer, which is asynchronously read by the tracer.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/87301c7282e8f8270fee2afb9fe85c81/app-trace.svg"><figcaption>Details of how a debug trap instruction is used call a BPF program</figcaption></figure></div><p>The BPF function for this is relatively simple; the C code is shown below. We register this function so that it's invoked every time <code>main.computeE</code> is called. Once it's called, we simply read the function argument and write that the perf buffer. Lots of boilerplate is required to set up the buffers, etc. and this can be found in the complete example <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/trace_example/trace.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Now we have a fully functioning end-to-end argument tracer for the <code>main.computeE</code> function!

Many aspects of Go, such as nested pointers, interfaces, channels, etc. make this process challenging, but solving these problems allows for another instrumentation mode not available in existing systems. Also, since this process works at the binary level, it can be used with natively compiled binaries for other languages (C++, Rust, etc.). We just need to account for the differences in their respective ABI's.</p><p>BPF tracing using uprobes comes with its own set of pros and cons. It's beneficial to use BPF when we need observability into the binary state, even when running in environments where attaching a debugger will be problematic or harmful (ex. production binaries). The biggest downside is the code required to get even trivial visibility into the application state. While BPF code is relatively accessible, it's complex to write and maintain. Without substantial high-level tooling, it's unlikely this can be used for generic debugging.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/12645e1cb582041085ede1877e97c812/wavingnaut.svg"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Go dynamic logging is something we are working on at Pixie.

<div><p>Welcome to Signals &amp; Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack, from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.  </p><p>Today, I’m going to have a conversation with Andrey Mokhov about build systems. Build systems are an important but I think poorly understood and often unloved part of programming. Developers often end up with only a hazy understanding of what’s going on with their build system learning just enough to figure out what arcane invocation they need to get the damn thing working and then stop thinking about it at that point, and that’s a shame because build systems matter a lot to our experience as developers.  </p><p>A lot of what underlies a good developer experience really comes out of the build system that you use and also there’s a lot of beautiful ideas and structure inside of build systems. Sadly, a lot of that beauty is obscured by a complex thicket of messy systems of different kinds and a complicated ecosystem of different build systems for different purposes, and I’m hoping that Andrey can help us see through some of that thicket down to some of the elegance of all of this underneath.  </p><p>Andrey is a great person to have that conversation with because he’s had a long and interesting experience with build systems having done some work on Hadrian, which is the build system for the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a> and having written a few important papers that try and analyze and break down the ecosystem of build systems and help you understand kind of what’s going on fundamentally underneath, and finally, in the last few years, Andrey has been working here working on Jane Street build systems.  </p><p>So, thanks Andrey for joining me, and maybe to start with, you can start by explaining to us a little bit about what a build system is.</p></div>

<h2 id="140">1:40</h2>


<div><p>Hi, Ron. It’s great to be on the podcast. So what is a build system?  Build systems automate the execution of various tasks of individual developers like me and whole companies like Jane Street. So, as a software developer, what are the kind of tasks that I need to do every day? I need to compile and recompile source files. I need to run some tests. I need to keep my documentation up to date. There are lots of tasks like this.  </p><p>Every task is pretty simple and straightforward on its own, but there are a lot of them, and they are tedious and I need to remember to do them in the right order, so it’s great to have some automation that does it for me. In the old days, like, how would you do this without automation, you would just write a script, and the script was your build system. And that’s how I worked myself when I used to work on projects with just a few files. And it works perfectly fine in those settings.</p></div>

<h2 id="223">2:23</h2>


<p>Beyond just using simple scripts, what’s the next step up available to developers in terms of automation?</p>

<h2 id="227">2:27</h2>


<div><p>Well, before, I don’t know, 1976 when Make was developed, there was nothing else and people were just writing scripts. And projects were getting bigger and bigger, it became difficult and at some point Make was developed to automate this. So Make was a huge breakthrough. It’s very simple. It allows you to write down the tasks that you need to execute and each task has some inputs and some outputs and the task itself, so what kind of command line you need to run to execute this task.  </p><p>And this very simple approach worked very well and it’s still being used these days. So these days I would say Make is still the most popular build system out there. If you go to a random open source project you will find a Makefile there.</p></div>

<h2 id="308">3:08</h2>


<p>Which on some level is kind of astonishing, just given how old Make is.</p>

<h2 id="311">3:11</h2>


<p>I’m amazed at how successful Make was and still is.</p>

<h2 id="314">3:14</h2>


<p>What was the thing that made Make such a big step forward?</p>

<h2 id="316">3:16</h2>


<p>Well, it was easy to use, right? You just write a few rules and the format for specifying those rules is pretty straightforward. It’s just a text file. And Make is available to you on pretty much any system. You type Make and it works. I guess it’s that kind of conceptual simplicity which attracted a lot of people to it, and of course also the pain that they had experienced before when they had to run all those tasks manually and they kept forgetting to run things in the right order. And I think this was one of the direct motivations of creating Make.</p>

<h2 id="345">3:45</h2>


<p>So, you talk about having a simple conceptual model, and what is that model on some level when you configure a job in Make, what you’re doing is specifying a collection of rules. Each rule says what you do, what’s the command you run to execute that rule, what it depends on and what it produces, and now Make has what is essentially a graph like model representing what are the things you need to do and what are the dependencies. Given that simple model, what are the services that Make now provides to you that you didn’t have before?</p>

<h2 id="412">4:12</h2>


<div><p>The main benefit of using Make compared to a script is that Make only reruns the tasks that need to be rerun. So how does it figure it out?  When you have like 1000 files in your project and you edit a single source file, if you run the script, it will basically recompile all 1000 files and then maybe relink some executables and rerun all the tests. And obviously that’s very wasteful. If you’ve only edited one file, only one file need to be recompiled.  </p><p>Make figures this out by just looking at timestamps. So, it just looks at the time of the file that you’ve just edited and it’s newer than the file that depends on it, so that files that depends on it needs to be recompiled and then its timestamp is updated, and so this wave of changes propagates through the build graph that you have and at the end for every task that you have in your description, you have the simple rule that everything that all the inputs of the task produced before the task, the outputs of the task have reproduced. This is before/after relationship is enforced everywhere in the build graph.</p></div>

<h2 id="511">5:11</h2>


<p>Right. Service number one that’s provided is incrementality. Small changes require small amounts of work in response to them.</p>

<h2 id="519">5:19</h2>


<p>That’s right. Yeah.</p>

<h2 id="520">5:20</h2>


<div><p>And this is important to developers kind of for obvious reasons, which is to say a key thing you want from your tools is responsiveness. You want to do something, see the results, think about whether that was the right thing to do and go back and make other changes, and so having tools that are responsive is enormously helpful. There’s a couple of the things that come to mind for me in terms of what Make helps out with. One of them is, it helps get the build right. One of the tricks with rebuilding your software is making sure that you’ve done all the things that you need to do. Like you could imagine that you changed a file and then you remember to rebuild that but you didn’t remember to rebuild everything that depended on it.  </p><p>And so having a simple language where you can express the dependencies and then once you get it right, you have a system that takes care of running things in the right order. There’s just a whole class of errors that you can make either in manual construction of a script or a manual kicking off of build tasks that just go away. I guess another thing is parallelism. There’s the incrementality of only having to do a small amount of work, but having this graph structured representation of the build also helps you kick off things in parallel.</p></div>

<h2 id="620">6:20</h2>


<p>Yeah. Absolutely. Like trying to maintain this parallelism by hand in a build script would be pretty annoying, right? You add a new file and suddenly you have a new dependency and need to rearrange the parallelism. Having some automation here is great as well.</p>

<h2 id="633">6:33</h2>


<p>Okay. This all sounds like a very short story. We had this problem, how to build things. A nice system like Make came out. It has a clean way of expressing dependencies and giving you some services off the back of that specification. All done, problem solved. What’s missing?  Why is the story of Make from 1976 not enough?</p>

<h2 id="651">6:51</h2>


<div><p>There are few things that are missing in Make. One of them as I mentioned, the way Make determines that a task needs to be rebuilt, is by looking at timestamps but very often this is too limiting. Let me give you a common example. You edit a source file by just adding a comment and as a result, you recompile that file and the result doesn’t change, but the timestamp does change anyway.  </p><p>It means that everything that depended on that file needs to be recompiled if you’re using Make. This is one of the problems that basically sometimes you want what we call “early cutoff” in build systems. If you recompile a file and the result is the same, you don’t want to recompile everything else that depends on it, so this is one feature that was missing.</p></div>

<h2 id="729">7:29</h2>


<p>Right. Essentially the problem is that the heuristic that Make uses for figuring out what needs to be redone is overly conservative, right? It will refire when it doesn’t strictly speaking need to refire.</p>

<h2 id="738">7:38</h2>


<p>That’s right. It’s overly conservative, at the same time I like it a lot because it basically just repurposes existing information. It’s just the information that is out there. The file system records modification times. Make itself doesn’t store anything at all, which is a very nice property to have. But if you want to support things like early cutoff you now need to start storing some information.</p>

<h2 id="757">7:57</h2>


<p>Right. I guess in addition Make’s timestamp-based recomputation is, as you say, overly conservative. It’s also under conservative, isn’t it?  I.e., it will fail to rebuild in some cases where it should.</p>

<h2 id="808">8:08</h2>


<p>Yeah and it’s fairly common for example, that various like backup software, for example, would mess up modification times, which would basically cause your project not to compile correctly and then you would have to go for the so-called “clean build” to just get around that limitation. Yes. Make’s reliance on timestamps is problematic.</p>

<h2 id="825">8:25</h2>


<p>Something goes wrong with Make, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>In our tumultuous</strong> present, mindfulness and meditation can seem like attractive ways to process difficult feelings and emotions. Meditative practices have long been a support strategy for traditional cultures facing collective trauma, and a method for bringing individuals and communities into mutual solidarity. Tibetan refugees, who have lived through cultural genocide, use meditation and ritual to join with their spiritual ancestors. In this way, they experience their own suffering as a doorway into compassion for others.</p>
<p>Tibetan culture, through its resilience, kindness, intelligence and joy, has inspired millions of people in the West to take up meditation. But are the practices that many of us turn to the same in substance as the rituals that other communities have relied upon for centuries? In most cases, the answer is no: they have a profoundly different orientation and, significantly, they lack the crucial communal features that make traditional meditation so vital and nurturing for the brain and body. In fact, modern meditation can often work against us â€“ reinforcing our separation from others, rather than strengthening the social bonds that are needed to overcome adversity and barriers to compassion.</p>
<p>The traditional and modern approaches to meditation are shaped by two distinct visions of the person. Those in traditional contemplative cultures typically understand persons to be constituted by their relationship to others, as the historian David McMahan <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195183276.001.0001/acprof-9780195183276">notes</a> in <em>The Making of Buddhist Modernism</em> (2008). As a consequence, practitioners first learn to experience themselves in meditation as empowered and supported by the care, compassion and wisdom of their spiritual ancestors and community. By contrast, citizens of the modern West often see persons as individual selves that exist prior to the community â€“ atomistic individuals who choose whether or not to enter into relationships.</p>
<p>These different conceptions of the person have important consequences for meditation. In the modern view, practitioners tend to think of meditation as an autonomous project of self-help: through their own efforts, they try to foster beneficial states of mind. Socially conditioned in this way, Westerners enter into â€˜lovingkindness meditationâ€™ (<em>metta</em>) as a way of summoning up a sense of love for themselves and those they feel close to; then, for those theyâ€™re neutral towards; and, finally, for people they dislike.</p>
<p>For traditional Buddhist communities, any such meditation wouldnâ€™t begin with an atomistic self who is trying to generate a positive mindset from scratch. In such cultures, practitioners begin meditation with rituals and prayers that remind them that they are part of a connected community, blessed and supported by a lineage of spiritual ancestors that spans many generations. This starting point is shared by contemplative and ritual forms of Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and many indigenous religions. In Tibetan Buddhism, for example, meditators envision a field of refuge that includes buddhas, bodhisattvas, spiritual teachers and other inspiring figures, who bless and sustain them and their world within qualities of unconditional love, compassion and wisdom. Practitionersâ€™ efforts to cultivate those same qualities begin not with self-help, but with the support and empowerment of their teachers and communities. In this way, the person meditating learns to become an extension of that field of love and compassion in which they are held, by progressively extending love and compassion to others.</p>
<p>Modern meditation and mindfulness, beginning with an atomistic sense of self, can reinforce an individualâ€™s sense of disconnection</p>
<p><strong>This kind of</strong> deeply supportive framework, found in all contemplative traditions, is mostly absent from modern meditation programmes. Because these communal dimensions of blessing and empowerment are embedded in premodern, ritualised cosmologies, they are often deemed an unneeded byproduct of â€˜primitive culturesâ€™, which can be jettisoned in order to â€˜moderniseâ€™ the practice. However, these cosmologies serve a valuable function that maps directly onto attachment theory, one of the most influential approaches to developmental and social psychology.</p>
<p>Attachment theory is based on the idea that the care that children receive in infancy stays with them through their lifespan â€“ for better or worse. Infants who receive sensitive and responsive care go on to develop a self that they feel is worthy of love. In turn, this supports their curiosity and courage to explore the world, because they trust that a source of security and support is available when needed. Sporadic or unreliable care, on the other hand, fosters insecurity and a distrust in support from others in times of need.</p>
<p>But the experience of security and insecurity is not locked in at infancy. Feelings of security and insecurity accrue throughout oneâ€™s life from relationships with peers, mentors, romantic partners and so on. This means that we all have traces of security and insecurity in different relational contexts. Through the lens of attachment theory, the ritual and devotional practices of traditional contemplative cultures, which are repeated many thousands of times throughout a personâ€™s life, offer a powerful field of care in which practitioners experience themselves as recipients of love, compassion and wisdom. From this secure base, they are empowered to extend sustainable, inclusive and unconditional care to others.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, humans come prepared with capacities for care and compassion. But without the experience of actually receiving care, people can develop inner psychological blocks to compassion â€“ including a lack of inner security, courage and confidence. Lack of security can foster aversion to othersâ€™ suffering, a sense of isolation and biases against others. These psychological barriers interact with and are reinforced by systemic inequities such as racism, classism, sexism and homophobia.</p>
<p>Modern meditation and mindfulness, by beginning with an atomistic sense of self, can increase an individualâ€™s sense of disconnection. They can present meditation as a passive source of comfort for the self, instead of a practice that uses discomfort to create solidarity with other sufferers. In her <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300215809/american-dharma">book</a> <em>American Dharma</em> (2019), the Buddhist scholar Ann Gleig documents how communally oriented meditation can help people to become conscious of socially conditioned traumas, to heal internalised racism, and to tolerate the discomfort that conversations about race and privilege can generate.</p>
<p>Traditional cultures of compassion training strive to dismantle barriers to compassion by bringing to mind a field of care in which practitioners are held and supported, and from which they can learn to hold and support others. This relational starting point promotes resilience and connectivity, and bolsters the psychological and social resources we need today to confront systemic injustice. But how might secular people in modern individualistic cultures gain access to such communal benefits?</p>
<p>By reinhabiting moments of supportive caring connection, we can establish a core of inner safety that can be returned to again and again</p>
<p><strong>Research findings in psychology</strong> show that feelings of security can be temporarily increased, including among people who have predominantly insecure attachment histories. Social psychologists developed a method called <em>attachment security priming</em>, in which participants are asked to visualise a moment of receiving care from a loving figure, a trusted friend, or simply by thinking of words such as â€˜loveâ€™, â€˜safetyâ€™ or â€˜careâ€™ for a moment. These simple priming <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16351370/">exercises</a> temporarily increase feelings of security, safety and courage. In turn, participants are more likely to offer help to others, have more patience listening to othersâ€™ difficult emotions, and possess less bias against other groups. This research suggests that attachment security priming could be integrated into meditation to recover the relational basis of the practice.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://mindrxiv.org/dmxj7/">article</a> forthcoming in the journal <em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em>, we introduce a relational starting point of support for meditation, derived from traditional Tibetan practice, and informed by research on attachment security priming. There are various ways to engage a relational starting point for meditation, depending on oneâ€™s own life experience, background and worldview:</p><ul>
<li>You can recall a simple moment of supportive caring connection with another person, from any time in your life, and re-inhabit that caring moment as if itâ€™s happening now â€“ evoking a rich experience of loving qualities and energies in mind and body. For example, Paul can call to mind playing cards with his loving grandmother at her kitchen counter, and John can recall a moment visiting a joyfully welcoming aunt as a young child.</li>
<li>A second option is to bring to mind someone to whom you feel grateful for their impact on your life, and experience the uplifting quality of imagining that person as present with you now.</li>
<li>A third option, if you practise in any spiritual tradition, is to bring to mind a saint, divine figure or field of spiritual ancestors, with whom you feel a deep connection.</li>
<li>If none of those options resonate, you might recall a time you spent somewhere special to you in the natural world â€“ a place that felt deeply welcoming or peaceful. Or recall a loving moment with a pet. Or bring vividly to mind a moment when you were a loving presence to another person.</li>
</ul><p>According to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/78/embodied-and-grounded-cognition#overview">theories</a> of embodied cognition, when we recall any such caring moment, it is simulated and re-enacted in multiple systems of the brain and body, including perceptual, motor, visual and affective systems. During the caring moment practice, we can visualise and simulate a felt sense of security, by experiencing that moment as if it were happening now, along with …</p></div></div></div>

  <div dir="auto">
    <p>I don’t like how modern web applications are built. Many of the web applications
are too unstable, That you can’t imagine having the system running without a
team supporting it. The fact that we try to automate manual processes then the
automation needs manual intervention defies the purpose. Some companies has an
army of developers if they were to do the business by hand they would make a
better job than the programmed system. There are many reasons for this
situation. One of the reasons is the excessive use of third party dependencies.</p>

<p>Lets take a look on a basic modern web based system, There are several layers
on software running on the machine, starting from firmware to your business
logic.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_212438.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_212438.jpg"></p>

<p>I don’t think this is very helpful to understand the gravity of the situation.
There are many actors that are not considered in this picture. Layers are also
missing because they are implicit in other layers. Lets expand these hidden
layers and actors. It will help us understand better why that small Nodejs or
RubyOnRails application we wrote isn’t just one layer in this picture.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_214548.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_214548.jpg"></p>

<p>Here are the layers we added this time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>System core utilities</li>
  <li>Other processes your application depends on like “memcached, Redis, MySQL,
Postgres…etc”</li>
  <li>Third party code your application depends on an ORM, Template engine,
pagination library, a library that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/">pads your string with
spaces</a> just
because.</li>
  <li>Server applications that sits in front of your code handling HTTP and response
compression…etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of these layers there is <strong>at least</strong> one team responsible for
maintaining it.</p>

<p>Again, We missed other layers and people in this picture. Most of the
applications are using external SAAS providers for logs or monitoring or bug
reporting or provide parts of the system functionality that can take more time
to build by the company team. lets add them to the picture along with their
teams.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_221047.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_221047.jpg"></p>

<p>This picture is for one application, I won’t expand it to a whole system with
different services and programs that is the reality of all companies.
Lets stick to one application for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>So here is the first point I want to make: With every service you use you’re not
just a user, This service is now part of your application, You are held
responsible for it’s behavior and misbehaving. You will inherit bugs in their
system. When this service team is affected by COVID-19 and get reduced to the
point where they can’t fix issues you will be affected too. When They get slower
your application will get slower too. When their service is down your
application will experience malfunction too, Your system and theirs is now
connected. So add external services integration cautiously. By adding an
external system you’re putting your trust in this service team and their ability
in delivering what the service is promising now <strong>and</strong> in the future. This is not
an easy decision and it should be treated as such.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_224907.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_224907.jpg"></p>

<p>Now lets move to the direct dependencies of your application. If you’re using
any modern programming language it’ll have a way to package code into reusable
format that could be reused by other applications. one package can use code from
other packages, these packages can use other packages and so on like a tree.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_231326.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_231326.jpg"></p>

<p>With every package in this tree we depend on the code inside this package and
the team that maintains it. A freshly generated rails project depends on 74
packages for ruby and <code>Yarn list</code> that lists JavaScript dependencies output 3102
lines, that’s 3176 packages with teams maintaining them and bugs and new
versions all the time.</p>

<p>This is wrong for many reasons. I will list some of them here for the sake of
clarity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have put your trust in at least 3176 other developers. You have never met
them, never talked to them, there are no guarantee they will continue to
maintain this package. There are no guarantee they won’t put code in their
package to show <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/npm-bans-terminal-ads/">ads in your
terminal</a> or <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/dk/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hacker-infects-node-js-package-to-steal-from-bitcoin-wallets">code that
steals your bitcoin wallets
</a>.</li>
  <li>You are not really using all of this code. When someone is writing an open
source package it will suffer sooner or later from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">feature
creeping</a> You are probably using
couple features of this package and don’t need the rest, but you wanted the
banana and got the whole forest now.</li>
  <li>With every package update you’re inventing unnecessary work for yourself. New
versions of packages are released all the time. Updating your project to <strong>get
the latest bug fixes and features</strong> is usually what people do. Most of the
time because of feature creeping these versions changes are not relevant to
you at all, but you won’t know until you read the change log. If it’s relevant
to your project you’ll need to do an update. if something is deprecated or
changed you’ll need to change your code. So suddenly someone somewhere is
telling you to change your code. That’s part of the control you have over your
code handed over to someone you never talked to or knew.</li>
  <li>When your programming language has a new release you can’t update unless all of
your dependencies are up to date. For ruby 2.7.0 for example some language syntax is
now deprecated and shows warning when you run your project. So to fix that you
either fix it in the package and open a PR with the change or wait for the
maintainer to update it.</li>
  <li>When you encounter a bug in a dependency you will have to understand this
package code, fork, branch, fix rinse and repeat. That requires a some
cooperation from the library maintainer which is most of the time isn’t
possible because most of the open source projects are voluntarily maintained.</li>
  <li>Developing new features or modifying existing features are ordre of magnitude
harder. You’ll need to dig into the documentation of the dependencies looking
for support for this little feature you want to add. That is if there is any
documentation at all for that part of the code. Otherwise you’ll have to dig
in to the library code.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the second point I want to make: Using external library implies that you
trust the maintainer and you also inherit his decisions about using other
libraries and so forth. This decision should be weighed based on the benefit of
the library and how many of it’s features you’re going to use and other factors
like the maturity and how responsive is the maintainer, please don’t use GitHub
stars as a factor in your decision it’s misleading. And if the part you use from
the library isn’t too big I recommend using the library to save some time and
effort upfront but make sure you get rid of it and implement the part you need.
An example of that is a pagination library like rails “Kaminari” if you’re using
it to save you some time then sure. But keep on your todo list a task to remove
it and implement the feature yourself. An example of libraries that’s hard to
get rid of it “OpenCV” This is something that reimplementing the part you need
probably will be a huge task so it can stay. You’ll need to use your best
judgment to decide between these 2 sides of the spectrum.</p>

<p>I like to think of what I do as building an automated system, I would like this
system to run by itself, keep itself clean and healthy, doesn’t need manual
intervention. If the whole team disappeared out of existence I would like that
system to work for a very long time without any supervision.</p>

<p>More code means more bugs for me to fix, by extension more code that I didn’t write
means more bugs that I probably can’t solve. This is dangerous and shouldn’t be
taken lightly. Extending your code with external libraries or systems can cut
down effort hence the cost of development. But when this is taken lightly it
backfires badly.</p>

<p>Distributed cloud applications (aka microservices) have introduced an enormous
amount of complexity into the design and operation of cloud software. What used
to manifest itself as complexity hidden within a single process or runtime now
finds itself spread across tens or hundreds of loosely coupled services. While
all of these services can use different languages and can scale independently
from one another, the distributed nature can often make the app as a whole hard
to navigate, hard to deploy, and hard secure.</p>
<p>This new complexity makes it increasingly difficult to manage and contribute to
cloud-native applications, and beckons questions as to how we can maintain
healthy cloud software. How can we take advantage of the benefits of
service-oriented design without introducing friction and cost elsewhere?</p>
<p>Fortunately we've run into this problem before. Microservices aren't the first
pattern that has forced developers to figure out how to collaborate and
contribute to endless webs of interconnected components. For the last few
decades the solution has been the same: <strong>dependency management</strong>.</p>
<p>We use dependency managers every day to re-use public and private software
packages, build upon the work of others, and gracefully encapulate the details
of our own work into consumable formats. There are a number of reasons why
dependency management is the key to unlocking the power of distributed software,
and it's high time we learn from the past to power the future of cloud-native
development.</p>
<h2 id="1-developer-collaboration"><a href="#1-developer-collaboration" aria-label="1 developer collaboration permalink"></a>1. Developer collaboration</h2>
<p>One of the most important functions of dependency managers like
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>, <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/">Pip</a>,
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html">Maven</a>, and others, is to broker
collaboration amongst developers. By providing a consistent packaging mechanic
that seamlessly enables code to be extended, dependency managers have enabled
otherwise unrelated teams to consume each other's work. While these tools can be
used within the walls of enterprises to enable teams to publish and collaborate
on their work, we've seen dependency managers used at a much grander scale to
broker collaboration within the open-source community. The consistency of the
tooling and width of adoption has enabled the creation of enormously powerful
and freely accessible libraries for all to use and continue to build upon.</p>
<p>While this level of collaboration has been realized within the communities for
individual languages (NPM for Javascript, Pip for Python, etc.), it has yet to
be fully realized within the cloud-native community. We fortunately have Docker
to create consistency in how cloud services are packaged, but containers don't
have enough information about the relationships between services to resolve and
extend dependencies. Adding proper dependency management to index and resolve
relationships to peer apps and services is critical if we want to realize for
microservices what others already do with libraries in individual languages.</p>
<h2 id="2-self-service-environments"><a href="#2-self-service-environments" aria-label="2 self service environments permalink"></a>2. Self-service environments</h2>
<p>The collaborative effects of dependency managers don't happen by magic. The main
reason consistent dependency resolvers are so powerful is because developers all
around the world are able to reproduce their effects using the same commands and
processes. Reproducibility is a key element of dependency managers. Without it,
no one would be able to download and operate libraries and packages created by
others without complex, custom bootstrapping logic – the creation of which would
be an enormous barrier to adoption and distribution.</p>
<p>Service-oriented applications are no different from language-specific libraries
in this regard. Our ability to extend the work of others is predicated on our
ability to run or otherwise access the services and applications we hope to make
calls to. Teams have been able to make due by operating centralized QA or
sandbox environments, but the inability to reproduce these environments creates
a new set of problems. Engineers can't operate their own development
environments, services that depend on others can't be easily shipped, developers
are forced to write their own scripts to run their app locally and remotely, and
every team needs to about production-grade tools, networking, and network
security. By leveraging a consistent, dependency management solution, teams need
only to assert the network dependencies for their services to give everyone in
the org a consistent way to spin up services in their stack along with its
dependencies – allowing everyone to operate their own environments.</p>
<h2 id="3-automation"><a href="#3-automation" aria-label="3 automation permalink"></a>3. Automation</h2>
<p>The self-service benefits of consistent dependency management doesn't just mean
that developers can operate their own environments. It also means that
environments can be provisioned and torn down through automation. The
consistency of a single command or process to resolve dependencies, enrich
networking, and automate security is the perfect recipe for integration into
CI/CD pipelines!</p>
<p>If every service can be run consistently (e.g. with container platforms) and is
aware of its own dependencies, new environments can be provisioned for each
merge request and changes can be seamlessly promoted into staging and production
when merged into relevant branches. This means that every team can achieve
scalable
<a href="https://thenewstack.io/what-is-gitops-and-why-it-might-be-the-next-big-thing-for-devops/">GitOps</a>
for every developer and every new service added to the application.</p>
<h2 id="4-security"><a href="#4-security" aria-label="4 security permalink"></a>4. Security</h2>
<p>One of the risks introduced by microservice architectures is the need for each
service to expose APIs that broker access to their functionality. Since these
services live as separate processes, communication over a network is one of the
only ways for them to connect to each other and receive requests for processing.
This means that each new service exposes an interface that can be accessed by
others, and if developers aren't careful they can accidentally expose it to the
wrong parties.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.architect.io/images/blog/why-distributed-apps-need-dependency-management/declare-data-breach.webp" alt="Cloud Security"></p>
<p>Preventing accidental exposure of network interfaces is yet another area where
dependency management can provide support. With developers providing a
structured index of their own service's network dependencies, not only can we
automatically resolve those dependencies, but we can also enrich the environment
with the corresponding network policies required to lock it down – only services
that depend on each other can access each other. This structured approach
drastically reduces the need for developers to understand network security
tooling, and opens them up to create new services more freely.</p>
<h2 id="5-flexibility"><a href="#5-flexibility" aria-label="5 flexibility permalink"></a>5. Flexibility</h2>
<p>Another benefit of dependency management with respect to microservices and
distributed applications is flexibility. With developers capturing the details
of their immediate dependencies and associating them with their own services,
the resolver itself is free to instrument the relationships in unique ways in
each environment that gets deployed. Want to try out a different API gateway or
service mesh? Want to instrument distributed tracing by capturing ingress and
egress traffic from each service? With automation that can hook into the
dependency resolver, operators are free to experiment with new tools and configs
without any code changes to existing services or distractions for developers.</p>
<h2 id="why-doesnt-it-already-exist"><a href="#why-doesnt-it-already-exist" aria-label="why doesnt it already exist permalink"></a>Why doesn't it already exist?</h2>
<p>Dependency resolution would be an enormously powerful tool solution to enable
developers to collaborate and contribute to cloud-native applications, but can't
we use the vast number of package managers that already exist to help with
instrumentation? While it would be nice to use existing tools, resolving
dependencies for networked applications isn't the same as resolving the
relationships between libraries and binaries.</p>
<p>The download of code artifacts that fulfill dependency requirements for
libraries all happens at build-time to create one master binary/library.
Microservices however don't get bundled into single binaries and instead need to
be run as independent services and then connected to over a network. This means
that the resolution strategy has additional steps, and happens at an entirely
different lifecycle stage than regular libraries. Turns out, the earliest point
in an application lifecycle that we can properly resolve dependencies for
distributed applications is at deploy-time. It is at this point that we know
both the relationships between all services in the stack as well as the tooling
and details of the target environment needed to properly provision and connect
services.</p>
<p>To sum it up, it's hard to create a large scale resolver for network
dependencies, but doing so would provide enormous benefits to engineering teams
and the cloud community as a whole. If we're to properly navigate the growing
landscape of cloud-native tools, we'll need to learn from dependency management
practices of the past.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>A couple of years ago, while I was still working at Apollo, <a href="https://github.com/leebyron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee Byron</a>, <a href="https://github.com/robzhu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Zhu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dotansimha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dotan simha</a> and <a href="https://github.com/urigo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I</a> worked on the GraphQL Subscriptions spec and the reference implementation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>During that work, we created and merged the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference implementation into graphql-js</a> and created two supporting libraries: <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graphql-subscriptions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subscriptions-transport-ws</a>. Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/Wi7P39sF2nw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk with deep dive into all the details</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Since leaving Apollo, <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/issues/777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not a lot of work has been gone into those libraries</a>.
That's why I was so thrilled that <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Denis</a> decided to pick up that important work and create a new library for the WebSocket Protocol.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We will support his work of maintaining the library and standardizing it with the GraphQL over HTTP working group.
This is a part of a lot of exciting work coming up about GraphQL and real-time, so follow us for new things in this space!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Denis will take it away from here!</p></blockquote><h3>Introduction</h3><p>At some point in time during your web development journeys, you may’ve been faced with the challenge to add a real-time component. The synonym for realtime in the browser is the WebSocket API. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is how MDN’s describes it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user’s browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.</p></blockquote><p>Google Chrome was the first browser to support the WebSocket Protocol, adding support in 2009 - two years before it was officially standardised in 2011. As the need for full-duplex server-client communications rose, other browsers followed suit.</p><p>As of today, all major browsers support the WebSocket Protocol - see the <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=Web%20Sockets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can I Use table</a>.</p><h3>WebSockets ❤️ GraphQL</h3><p>Okay, so, how do I use WebSockets to add support for the <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Subscription" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL <code>subscription</code> operation</a>? Doing a basic Google search, you’d be faced with a single solution, namely <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>subscriptions-transport-ws</code></a>. Looking through the repository, checking recent comments, reading through the issues and open PRs - might have you notice the abundance of bugs and their security implications. <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-transport-ws/issues/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A summary can be found here</a>.</p><p>The authors have done a brilliant job, but unfortunately other projects and needs have reduced their disposable time for maintaining and nurturing this well accomplished, yet needy, idea. But, it did indeed inspire me to take up their legacy and revitalised it! Having faced various WebSocket challenges with GraphQL myself - I jumped in writing a new library from scratch.</p><p>With no further ado - I humbly introduce <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-transport-ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>graphql-transport-ws</code></a>. A coherent, feature-full, zero-dependency, plug-n-play, lazy, simple, server and client implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new, security first GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol</a> with full support for all 3 GraphQL operations: <code>Queries</code>, <code>Mutations</code> and <code>Subscriptions</code>. The protocol aims to be standardised and become a part of GraphQL with the help of the foundation’s <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL over HTTP work group</a>.</p><p>The library is written in TypeScript and the full implementation totals merely ~1000 lines of well formatted, commented, code. It leverages modern JavaScript primitives and the well established presence of WebSockets.</p><h3>How do I get started?</h3><p>I am glad you asked!

With this launch,  developers using Twilio's Programmable Voice get an <a href="https://www.voicegain.ai/post/speech-to-text-accuracy-benchmark-september-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>accurate</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://www.voicegain.ai/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>affordable</u></a>, and easy to use ASR/Speech-to-text platform to build speech-IVRs or Voice Bots.</p><h2 id="viewer-3b1oa">Key Features of Twilio Media Streams support</h2><p id="viewer-2dncc">Voicegain Twilio Media Streams support gives developers the following features:</p><ol><li id="viewer-aa64c"><p><strong>Grammar Support: </strong>Developers can now write speech IVR applications that use <strong>grammars</strong>. Many traditional VoiceXML IVRs are built using grammars. However, until now Twilio TwiML did not support use of speech grammars as the &lt;Gather&gt; command supports only text capture. This made it hard to migrate existing VoiceXML IVR applications to the Twilio platform. Mapping of text to semantic meaning had to be done separately, plus large vocabulary recognizer was more likely  to return spurious recognitions. Voicegain solves these problems by supporting both <strong>GRXML </strong>and <strong>JSGF </strong>speech grammars at the core speech-to-text (ASR) engine level. This delivers higher accuracy compared to an ASR that uses a large vocabulary language model to recognize text and then applies grammars to the recognized text. </p></li><li id="viewer-2lkid"><p><strong>90% Savings on ASR Licensing costs: </strong>Build <strong>low cost</strong> speech IVR application. -- A big advantage for developers of the Twilio Programmable Voice platform has been its affordable pricing. However, that was not necessarily true for existing ASR options like &lt;Gather&gt; that is priced at 2 cents for 15 seconds (with 15 second minimum) or 8 cents per minute. With Voicegain the <a href="https://www.voicegain.ai/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>price</u></strong></a><strong> is 1.25 cents per minute</strong> measured at 1 second increments.  Including the billing increment, <strong>we are 90% cheaper. </strong></p></li><li id="viewer-df1pl"><p><strong>Better Timeout Support: </strong>Voicegain supports configurable timeouts for no-input, <strong>complete timeout</strong> and incomplete timeout. Because the grammar is integrated with the recognizer, Voicegain ASR is able to deliver accurate complete timeout response which is not possible with &lt;Gather&gt; command for which the only way to tell if the caller stopped speaking is a large enough pause. </p></li><li id="viewer-7mckv"><p>Simplify <strong>dynamic prompt playback</strong>. -- In order to make use of &lt;Connect&gt;&lt;Stream&gt; as easy as possible, we support passing prompts when invoking &lt;Stream&gt;. Prompts can be provided either as text or as URLs. If provided as text then Voicegain will either use TTS or perform dynamic concatenation of prerecorded prompts.  A prompt manager for such prerecorded prompts is provided as part of Voicegain Web Portal. 
Configurable <strong>barge-in </strong>is supported for the prompts.</p></li><li id="viewer-auc98"><p><strong>Fine-tune and test grammars</strong>. -- Voicegain Web Portal includes a tool for reviewing and fine tuning grammars. The tool also supports regression tests. With this functionality you will never have to deploy grammars without knowing how well they are going to perform after changes.</p></li></ol><h2 id="viewer-9t19d">How Twilio Media Streams works with Voicegain </h2><div id="viewer-f0q42"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.voicegain.ai/post/announcing-twilio-twiml-connect-stream-support" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e90723_efa9609d4fc345188b98e3e91f4dd19d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_901,h_509,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e90723_efa9609d4fc345188b98e3e91f4dd19d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-f3v81">TwiML &lt;Stream&gt; requires a websocket url.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Consider this incomplete snippet of Rust code:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3

</pre></td><td><pre><span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span>

   <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I want to see an LR parser which produces the following syntax tree
(from <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#show-syntax-tree"><strong>Show Syntax Tree</strong></a> rust-analyzer command, with whitespace nodes elided for clarity):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

    PARAM_LIST@6..7
      L_PAREN@6..7 "("
  STRUCT@9..31
    STRUCT_KW@9..15 "struct"

      R_CURLY@30..31 "}"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The most error-resilient LR-style parser I know, <a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter">tree sitter</a>, produces this instead (tree sitter is GLR, this is <strong>not</strong> the style of parsing advocated by the article):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
</pre></td><td><pre>source_file [0, 0] - [5, 0])
  ERROR [0, 0] - [4, 1])
    identifier [0, 3] - [0, 6])
    struct_pattern [2, 0] - [4, 1])
      type: type_identifier [2, 0] - [2, 6])
      ERROR [2, 7] - [2, 8])
        identifier [2, 7] - [2, 8])
      field_pattern [3, 3] - [3, 9])
        name: field_identifier [3, 3] - [3, 4])
        pattern: identifier [3, 6] - [3, 9])
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note two things about the rust-analyzer’s tree:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There’s an (incomplete) “function” node for <code>fn foo(</code>.
Unclosed parenthesis doesn’t preclude the parser from recognizing parameter list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incomplete function does not prevent struct definition from being recognized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are important for IDE support.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that the cursor is just after <code>(</code>.
If we have rust-analyzer’s syntax tree, than we can figure out that we are completing a function parameter.
If we are to get fancy we might find the calls to the (not yet fully written) <code>foo</code>, run type inference to figure out the type of the first argument, and than suggest parameter name &amp; type based on that (not currently implemented — there’s soooooo much yet to be done in rust-analyzer).
And correctly recognizing <code>struct S</code> is important to not break type-inference in the code which uses <code>S</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of literature about error recovery for LR parsers, how come academics haven’t figured this out already?
I have a bold claim to make: error-recovery research in academia is focusing on a problem irrelevant for IDEs.
Specifically, the research is focused on finding “minimal cost repair sequence”:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a set of edit operations is defined (skip, change or insert token),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a “cost” metric is defined to distinguish big and small edits,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an algorithm is devised to find the smallest edit which makes the current text parse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This is a very academia-friendly problem — there’s a precise mathematical formulation, there’s an obvious brute force solution (try all edits), and there’s ample space for finding polynomial algorithm.</p>
<p>But IDEs don’t care about actually guessing &amp; repairing the text!
They just need to see as much of (possibly incomplete) syntax nodes in the existing text as possible.
When rust-analyzer’s parser produces</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>  PARAM_LIST@6..7
    L_PAREN@6..7 "("
STRUCT@9..31
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>it doesn’t think “Oh, I need to insert <code>)</code> here to complete the list of parameters”.
Rather, it sees <code>struct</code> and thinks “Oh wow, didn’t expect that! I guess I’ll just stop parsing parameter list right here”.</p>
<p>So, here’s</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Important"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>First Challenge</p>
Design error <em>resilient</em> (and not just error <em>recovering</em>) LR parsing algorithm.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Note that error resilience is a topic orthogonal to error reporting.
I haven’t payed much attention to error reporting (in my experience, synchronous reporting of syntax errors in the editor compensates for bad syntax error messages), but it might be the case that MCRS are a good approach to there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>By Pau Alcalá - Co-founder of Palabra</em></p><p>While finding product-market fit for <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=direct-sales-tips-startups&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a>, our marketing strategy was exclusively organic and our first sales came from 1-1 conversations with potential users. After a month of difficult conversations and failed demos, I learned a very new and innovative approach to direct sales: actually listening to what people are saying. In this post I'll share my experience and some tips to listen to users, in the hopes of saving founders &amp; early startup teams some time and energy.</p><h2>What we mean by direct sales</h2><p>As the name suggest, direct sales means you talk directly to your prospect and try to sell them your solution via a 1-1 conversation. This conversation usually starts by reaching the prospect you think your product would work for, and sharing why you think your solution would be good for them.</p><p>Taking a direct approach is more common for B2B businesses, because the decision to purchase is strategical and the price is higher, which means you get a bigger return for each user you convert. But I think it's a good strategy to follow for any early stage SaaS, because it's an easy and direct way of learning about your users and implementing solutions that work for them.</p><p>The biggest challenges to direct sales is finding the right prospects and knowing how to show them value as quickly as possible. With direct conversations you'll probably get a higher conversion rate than self-served sales, but at a much slower rate.</p><h2>Why direct sales in a SaaS startup?</h2><p>When we launched <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=direct-sales-tips-startups&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a> we had no audience and not enough user data to understand who we should be targeting or how to convert them into paying users. We had two possible paths to follow:</p><ol><li>Awareness-first: Experimenting with low-budget ads or organic strategies in different channels, with different messages to see which stick better. This approach is the startup playbook, feeding the top of the funnel with as many prospects as possible assuming most of them will not end up buying, and learn how to convert them better later on.</li><li>Conversion-first: Spending almost no time to feed the top of the funnel (keep a low stream of leads and prospects) but improving that funnel to have better conversions. Leads would be scarce, but we'd learn how to qualify them and provide value so they are willing to buy and stay around.</li></ol><p>The first path was the riskier for us. First, because we had little experience with paid acquisition, and wouldn't know if our misses would be due to lack of experience or just wrong channels.</p><p>Second, we wanted to engage in deep conversations with users as soon as possible. We didn't really care about general trends, we wanted to actually understand what people were struggling with in email automation, and where to take our product so that it worked for them. That's why we decided to take the second path.</p><p>Our initial strategy was to ask a bunch of questions about people's current email automation strategies and try to turn the initial conversation into a sales pitch. We'd learn fast and get a few sales in the meantime.</p><p>Sounds easy, right? Well, it was not.</p><h2>What a failed sales conversation looks like</h2><p>After my first couple of calls I knew I was doing something wrong, but didn't know what it was. Sign ups were rarely because of my "sales" 1-1s, and every conversation left me with a sour feeling.</p><p>What usually happened was that I got to a call, asked the person a couple of questions about their strategies, and at some point I'd get nervous and start talking a lot. People are usually nice and would listen to what I had to say, but I could feel they weren't really interested, and felt like I was wasting time.</p><p>So what was I doing wrong?</p><p>After talking with my co-founder and a couple of friends in the SaaS industry, I found that I wasn't really paying attention to what prospects were saying. My team would ask questions about our prospects that I didn't know how to answer.</p><p>That meant I wasn't really selling, but I also wasn't learning about our users. I found I had to learn how to listen first, and sell later.</p><h2>How to talk less and sell more</h2><p>Listening to prospects is not at easy as it sounds when you are worried about selling them your solution. Specially if you're in early stage and don't have much experience selling software, it'll be hard to keep a clear mind and letting the user take the conversation where they want to.</p><p>But here's the thing: selling isn't about convincing people to try your product, it's about identifying how your product can solve a problem for them.</p><p>In a direct sales conversation, you should have two take outs:</p><ol><li>Identifying if the person you're talking to has a problem you could solve (the more details the better)</li><li>Communicating clearly how your product is a solution to their problem.</li></ol><p>If you fail at #1, you'll end up trying to convince people who don't actually have a problem you could help them with. Those are not your users, and there's nothing you can do today to make their life easier. Even if you somehow convince them to sign up, they'll probably cancel their subscription, making your churn go up.</p><p>Failing at #2 is usually connected to #1, because the only way of communicating a solution clearly is to understand the problem perfectly. You have to <strong>listen really carefully</strong> to understand what those problems are.</p><p>Most of your conversations with prospects should be about #1. Make a lot of questions. Listen closely and follow up on what isn't clear. Make the other person feel listened to. Worst case scenario, you end up with valuable insights about what problems people have. As an early stage startup, this information is crucial to find product-market fit.</p><p>Here are some lessons I learned while taking a direct sales approach to SaaS. Most of them came from reading <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">The Mom Test</a>, talking to awesome people and experimenting on my own.</p><h2>3 direct sales tips to listen to your users</h2><h3>Writing down what you want to get from the conversation</h3><p>This list should be really short. My initial conversation guide had 15+ questions to get to understand the problem, and then a short demo. It worked kinda fine, but I usually got lost by question 5, and then started thinking about what to ask next instead of listening to the answer.</p><p>The Mom Test suggests you should "prepare your list of 3". Three things you want to get from each conversation, depending on who you'll be talking to. And that was magic.</p><p>In early Palabra demos, when I asked to have a quick chat to someone in a startup, I usually had three different scenarios:</p><ul><li>The founder talked to me directly, who had no details about the email automation strategies his/her team was using but could provide context.</li><li>I talked to a marketer in the startup, who usually had many years of experience and had tried a bunch of other email automation tools.</li><li>I talked to a technical co-founder or dev, who had a lot of questions about technical aspects of Palabra and had tried different integrations before.</li></ul><p>I prepared three different notes to look at before each conversation, one for each "buyer" persona, and wrote down my list of three.</p><p>I started asking questions that came to mind from listening to what people were saying, and spend almost no time looking at my notes. If I ever felt I was starting to get lost, I just glanced to my list of three for that particular person to check if I was missing something. Freedom.</p><h3>Having a structured set of questions</h3><p>This advice came from a great friend and the <a href="http://sofandrade.com/">best UX designer I've met</a>. She knows all about user interviews, and since I was also trying to learn from our prospects, I knew it would help. Her advice was to divide my questions into chunks or topics I wanted to know about.</p><p>Having differentiated topics gives you flexibility to follow the conversation and not worry about what to ask after each answer. If you ask a question from the first topic and your user's answer goes to a slightly different topic, you can go to that part of your guide and then come back after that's done.</p><p>As an example, this was the structure I ended up using for each guide:</p><ul><li>About them/their job/their goals</li><li>About their emails, what they were using them from</li><li>About their email automation tools, what they were using and how</li><li>About their pains, what was missing from their current tools?</li></ul><p>What usually happened is that my email questions got answers related to tools. So I just moved over to the "tools" set of questions and then looked to see if I was missing something important at the end.</p><p>A smart move was to leave questions about pains for last. By then I usually had enough information about their problem and could offer a clear solution with <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=direct-sales-tips-startups&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a>.</p><p>If we had a solution, I'd briefly tell people why I thought this would work, and offered to show them in a demo. By focusing on their specific solution in the demo, I only showed one feature and not the whole product, which was a much better use of everyone's time.</p><h3>Doing some background research - but still ask people</h3><p>You can't go into a sales pitch without knowing who you're talking to. For B2B sales you need to know about the company and the person you're actually going to talk to. The key here is to use that information wisely.</p><p>I used to start conversations on what I'd learned from their landing page, to let people know I had done my homework. But his was actually making me start with the wrong foot -by talking too much.</p><p>Asking about their company and what they do there gives you inside information you wouldn't get from LinkedIn or a landing page. And it also helps break the ice, since it's an easy answer for anyone.</p><p>My solution was full transparency. I started each conversation by saying I had done a bit of research about them but still wanted to hear from themselves. Then I would ask what they usually do.</p><p>This was incredibly effective. Being honest took away all of my nervousness and allowed me to relax into the conversation. I felt like I had no secrets, I was just telling the truth and asking questions. And I think this works both ways: the person you're talking to will probably trust you more if you're …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Friends are a treasure. In an uncertain world, they provide a comforting sense of stability and connection. We laugh together and cry together, sharing our good times and supporting each other through the bad. Yet a defining feature of friendship is that itâ€™s voluntary. Weâ€™re not wedded together by law, or through blood, or via monthly payments into our bank accounts. It is a relationship of great freedom, one that we retain only because we want to.</p>
<p>But the downside of all this freedom, this lack of formal commitment, is that friendship often falls by the wayside. Our adult lives can become a monsoon of obligations, from children, to partners, to ailing parents, to work hours that trespass on our free time. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Febs0000046">study</a> of young adultsâ€™ social networks by researchers at the University of Oxford found that those in a romantic relationship had, on average, two fewer close social ties, including friends. Those with kids had lost out even more. Friendships crumble, not because of any deliberate decision to let them go, but because we have other priorities, ones that arenâ€™t quite as voluntary. The title of the Oxford paper summed up things well: â€˜Romance and Reproduction Are Socially Costlyâ€™.</p>
<p>Such is the pace and busyness of many peopleâ€™s adult lives that they can lose contact with their friends at a rapid rate. For instance, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873313001056?via%3Dihub">study</a> by the Dutch sociologist Gerald Mollenhorst found that, over a period of seven years, people had lost touch with half of their closest friends, on average. Whatâ€™s especially alarming is that many of us seem to be losing friends faster than we can replace them. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-13785-001">meta-analysis</a> by researchers in Germany published in 2013 combined data from 177,635 participants across 277 studies, concluding that friendship networks had been shrinking for the preceding 35 years. For example, in studies conducted between 1980 and 1985, participants reportedly had four more friends on average, compared with the participants whoâ€™d taken part in studies between 2000 and 2005.</p>
<p>If weâ€™re not careful, we risk living out our adulthoods friendless. This is a situation thatâ€™s worth avoiding. Friends are not only a great source of fun and <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2018/11/20/where-americans-find-meaning-in-life/">meaning</a> in life, but studies <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/74/2/222/3760165">suggest</a> that, without them, weâ€™re also at greater risk of feeling more depressed. Itâ€™s telling that in their <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00415">study</a> â€˜Very Happy Peopleâ€™ (2002), the American psychologists Ed Diener and Martin Seligman found that a key difference between the most unhappy and most happy people was how socially connected they were. Friends give us so much, which is why we need to invest in making them. Hereâ€™s how.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>Making more friends in adulthood is going to take some deliberate effort on your part. Itâ€™s an exciting challenge in theory, but one of the first obstacles youâ€™ll encounter is having enough confidence. Especially if you are shy by nature, putting yourself out there can seem scary, triggering fears of rejection. These fears might lead you to engage in two types of avoidance that will inhibit your ability to make friends. First, you might practise â€˜overt avoidanceâ€™, by not putting yourself in situations where itâ€™s possible to meet new people. Instead of going to your friendâ€™s movie night, with the chance to meet others, you end up staying at home. Second, you might find yourself engaging in â€˜covert avoidanceâ€™, which means that you show up but donâ€™t engage with people when you arrive. You go to the movie night, but while everyone else is analysing the film after itâ€™s over, you stay silent in the corner, petting someoneâ€™s pet corgi and scrolling through Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Assume that people like you</strong></p>
<p>Both these forms of avoidance are caused by understandable fears of rejection. So imagine how much easier it would be if you knew that, were you to show up in a group of strangers, most of them would love you and find you interesting. This mindset actually has a self-fulfilling quality â€“ an American <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.51.2.284">study</a> from the 1980s found that volunteers who were led to believe that an interaction partner liked them began to act in ways that made this belief more likely to come true â€“ they shared more about themselves, disagreed less, and had a more positive attitude. This suggests that if you go into social situations with a positive mindset, assuming people like you, then itâ€™s more likely that this will actually turn out to be the case.</p>
<p>Of course, you might still be reluctant to assume others like you because you donâ€™t believe itâ€™s true. If this is you, you might take comfort from research that found, on average, that strangers like us more than we realise. The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618783714">paper</a>, by Erica J Boothby at Cornell University and colleagues, involved having pairs of strangers chat together for five minutes, to rate how much they liked their interaction partner, and to estimate how much their partner liked them. Across a variety of settings and study durations â€“ in the lab, in a college dorm, at a professional development workshop â€“ the same pattern emerged. People underestimated how much they were liked, a phenomenon that Boothby and her colleagues labelled â€˜the liking gapâ€™.</p>
<p>What wisdom should we take from this research? It can remind us to go into new social events assuming that people will like us. It can keep us from being paralysed by fears of rejection, pushing us to question some of these fears. Try working on your internal dialogue, your inner voice that perhaps makes overly negative assumptions about how people will respond to you. Doing this will help give you the confidence to go out there and start initiating friendly contact with strangers.</p>
<p><strong>Initiate</strong></p>
<p>In <em>We Should Get Together: The Secret to Cultivating Better Friendships</em> (2020), Kat Vellos describes being inspired to write her book after a moment of feeling utterly alone. She was looking for a friend to hang out with, so she posted on Facebook: â€˜Who wants to go eat French fries and talk about life with me?â€™ Everyone who responded lived in another state; her local San Francisco Bay Area friends were all booked up. As she put it:</p>
<blockquote>I didnâ€™t just want to eat snacks and talk about life. I was craving a different kind of life â€“ one that would give me abundant access to friends who wanted to see me as much as I wanted to see them.</blockquote>
<p>This experience made Vellos realise that she needed more friends, so she created and executed a plan to make some. Eventually, she was running two successful meetup groups, and had established friendships with people she liked and wanted to get closer to. How did she change her life? She initiated. Vellos set aside time to reach out to people regularly, to revitalise old relationships and to awaken new ones, to check in, to find time to hang out. Her story reveals how initiative can change the course of our friendships.</p>
<p>To embrace the importance of initiating, you must to let go of the myth that friendship happens organically. You have to take responsibility rather than waiting passively. Science backs this up. Consider a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0265407509106718">study</a> of older adults in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The participants who thought friendship was something that just happened based on luck tended to be less socially active and to feel lonelier when the researchers caught up with them five years later. By contrast, those who thought friendship took effort actually made more effort â€“ for example, by showing up at church or at community groups â€“ and this paid dividends, in that they felt less lonely at the five-year follow-up.</p>
<p>But itâ€™s not just showing up that matters, itâ€™s saying â€˜helloâ€™ when you get there. This means introducing yourself to other people, asking them for their phone numbers, following up and asking them to hang out. Initiating is a process, one that we must do over and over again to make new friendships.</p>
<p>Initiation is particularly important for people who find themselves in new social settings â€“ such as people who have moved to a new city, started a new school or job. In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-97266-009">study</a> of first-year undergraduates at the University of Denver in 1980, it was those students who rated themselves as having superior social skills who managed to develop more satisfying social relationships. Moreover, in the Fall, when everyone was new, it was specifically â€˜initiation skillâ€™ that was most important. Once friendships were more stable, it didnâ€™t matter as much.</p>
<p>Although we might fear that other people will turn us down if we initiate with them, the research finds that this is a lot less likely than we might think. When the American psychologists Nicholas Epley and Juliana Schroeder <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-28833-001">asked</a> research participants to open up conversations with their fellow train commuters, can you guess how many of them were shot down? None! Epley and Schroder concluded that: â€˜Commuters appeared to think that talking to a stranger posed a meaningful risk of social rejection. As far as we can tell, it posed no risk at all.â€™</p>
<p><strong>Keep showing up</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve initiated some new contacts, the challenge of turning them into genuine friendships begins. I learned this lesson when I moved to Atlanta to start a job as assistant professor. At first, I was proactive at making friends. I showed up to events, asked my friends if they knew anyone in the area, and went to some meetup groups. I met a few people, but most of these friendships fizzled. I was good at sparking a connection but struggled to sustain it.</p>
<p>According to Rebecca G Adams, professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, sociologists have long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html">recognised</a> that friendships thrive when we have continuous interaction. My problem with sustaining connection was that I lacked the opportunity for repeated encounters. Going to a lecture, or a happy hour, or a networking event afforded me only one opportunity to connect. If you can, itâ€™s a better idea to sign up for activities that give you multiple opportunities to connect, such as a language class, a writing course, an …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<!-- <img src="/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/header.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Fixing AWS Architecure Diagrams: Distributed Load Testing"> -->

<p><em>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a vast library of practical solutions to common business problems. In this series, we focus on the architecture diagrams included in these solutions and attempt to expand and improve on them. Read the previous entry <a href="https://blog.ilograph.com/posts/fixing-aws-architecture-diagrams-vod/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Below is AWS’s architecture diagram for their <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/distributed-load-testing-on-aws">Distributed Load Testing on AWS solution</a>. It comes directly from the linked repository. While the solution is excellent, the architecture diagram accompanying it exhibits a number of problems that limit its use as a technical resource.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/original.png" alt="An AWS diagram"></p>

<p>This diagram has some common issues (see the <a href="https://blog.ilograph.com/posts/fixing-aws-architecture-diagrams-vod/">previous entry</a> in this series) and a few new ones:</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> The diagram lacks a clear purpose. It is referred to simply as an “Architecture Overview” in the solution.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> There are no named resources; only AWS Services (e.g. <em>Amazon S3</em>) are shown. Looking at this diagram, a viewer has no way of knowing <em>what</em> buckets, lambdas and other resources exist or how they are related.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> All of the arrows are unlabeled. The exact nature of the relations between these resources is a mystery.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> The diagram mixes run-time and deployment-time concerns.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> The diagram is missing critical details about security and access management.</p>

<p><strong>In short, this diagram makes an <em>impression</em>, but fails to truly <em>inform</em> the viewer</strong>. This would be acceptable for a decorative element in a blog post or presentation, but as a technical resource, it can be much better. In this article, we remake this diagram with an aim toward creating a valuable source of information in its own right.</p>

<p>Like last time, we split the original into multiple perspectives, each focused on a single goal. We’ll have <strong>nine</strong> perspectives in total. Four will show static relations between the solution’s resources. The remainder show sample workflows (e.g. creating a new test, or canceling a test) with detailed control flows between the resources. We’ll start with one of the most important perspectives, run-time dependency:</p>

<h4 id="perspective-1-run-time-dependency">Perspective 1: Run-time Dependency</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-which-resources-depend-on-which-resources-at-run-time">Goal: Show which resources depend on which resources at run-time</h6>

<p><strong>Original</strong>
<img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/old_1.png" alt="Run-time dependency (old)"></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>
<a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Runtime%2520Dependency"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/new_1.png" alt="Run-time dependency">
</a></p>

<p>We address the issues in the original head-on. The perspective uses real resource names, and the relationship arrows are labeled. We’ve removed deploy-time concerns (e.g. <em>CodeBuild</em>) to focus on run-time concerns. And we’ve added detail about the testing console, including screen names and their API dependencies.</p>

<p>At first blush the diagram is much busier than the original; however, we can select a resource and see both what resources depend on it and what resources it depends on:</p>



<p>The aforementioned deploy-time dependencies are not <em>truly</em> gone, we’ve just moved them to a different perspective:</p>

<h4 id="perspective-2-deploy-time-dependency">Perspective 2: Deploy-time Dependency</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-which-resources-depend-on-which-resources-at-deploy-time">Goal: Show which resources depend on which resources at deploy-time</h6>

<p><strong>Original</strong>
<img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/old_2.png" alt="Deploy-time dependency (old)"></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>
<a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Deployment%2520Dependency"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/new_2.png" alt="Deploy-time dependency">
</a></p>

<p>This perspective’s goal is identical to the last one, only it is focused on deploy-time dependencies. Note that this includes external dependencies (a <em>Docker Hub</em> image and a <em>PyPi</em> library). It also shows source code dependencies for the lambdas. Once the solution is successfully deployed, the dependencies described in this perspective are no longer relevant to the solution run-time.</p>

<h4 id="perspective-3-security-and-access-management">Perspective 3: Security and Access Management</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-which-resources-can-access-which-resources-and-how">Goal: Show which resources can access which resources, and how</h6>

<p><strong>Original</strong>
<img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/old_3.png" alt="Security (old)"></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>
<a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Access%2520Management"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/new_3.png" alt="Security">
</a></p>

<p>This perspective describes something the original doesn’t fully attempt to address: security and access management. For the solution to work, resources need to get data from, send data to, and sometimes (in the case of lambdas) invoke other resources. This is all managed through roles, policies, and permissions governed primary through IAM.</p>

<p>Obviously, this perspective goes into considerably more detail than the original diagram does. Like earlier, we can select individual resources to see what resources it can access and be accessed by (and how).</p>





<h4 id="perspective-4-vpc-egress">Perspective 4: VPC Egress</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-how-vpc-based-resources-access-the-internet">Goal: Show how VPC-based resources access the internet</h6>

<p><strong>Original</strong>
<img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/old_4.png" alt="VPC Egress (old)"></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>
<a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/VPC%2520Egress"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/new_4.png" alt="VPC Egress">
</a></p>

<p>Naturally, the load testing cluster requires internet access to work. This simple diagram shows the resources allowing the cluster to access the internet from within the VPC.</p>

<h4 id="perspectives-5-9-example-control-flow-sequences">Perspectives 5-9: Example control-flow sequences</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-detailed-interactions-between-resources-for-common-workflows">Goal: Show detailed interactions between resources for common workflows</h6>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Create%2520Test"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/sequences.png" alt="Sequences">
</a></p>

<p>All of the previous perspectives are <em>static</em> perspectives. There is no notion of time; the relations they describe are continuously in effect. They do not have steps showing how the resources actually interact. To help the viewer better understand <em>how</em> the resources interact (and how complex those interactions can get), we include five <strong>sequence</strong> perspectives for this solution:</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Create%2520Test">Create Test</a> - Shows how new tests are created</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Execute%2520Test">Execute Test</a> - Shows how new tests are executed after being created</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Write%2520Test%2520Results">Write Test Results</a> - Shows how test results are written to DynamoDB</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/List%2520tests">List tests</a> - Shows how all running tests are fetched</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Cancel%2520test">Cancel Test</a> - Shows how a running test is canceled</p>

<p>Other workflows that could be documented include getting individual tests and getting test results.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The conclusion of the <a href="https://blog.ilograph.com/posts/fixing-aws-architecture-diagrams-vod/">previous entry</a> listed guidelines for better architecture diagrams, all of which we followed here. We benefited greatly from breaking up the original diagram into multiple perspectives and using real resource names, for example. By making these and other improvements, we hopefully made this diagram much more useful as a technical resource.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <p>Just a note about nomenclature before we start; I’ll use “functor” to represent the <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2015/01/20/functors/">categorical meaning</a> of the concept:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A functor is a mapping between categories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and <code>Functor</code> and <code>Contravariant</code> to specify the typeclass encodings of functors.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s begin!</p>
<p>Contravariant functors are odd aren’t they? Covariant functors (which are modelled by the <code>Functor</code> typeclass) are quite straightforward but <strong>contra</strong>variant functors as their name implies seem to be the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Before we get into what a contravariant functor is, it’s useful to look at the <code>Functor</code> <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">typeclass</a> which we know and love.</p>
<h2 id="functor">Functor</h2>
<p>A <code>Functor</code> is defined as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>where</span>
<span>  fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b</code></pre></div>
<p>We often understand a <code>Functor</code> to be a “container” or a “producer” of some type, where the function supplied to <code>fmap</code> is applied to the elements that are “contained” or “produced” in some type constructor<a href="#type-constructor-1"><sup>1</sup></a> <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>A simple example would be the list (<code>[]</code>) type, that can represent zero or more values. Given a <code>[a]</code> we can turn it into a <code>[b]</code> when given a function <code>a -&gt; b</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> [] a <span>=</span> [] <span>|</span> a <span>:</span> [a]  <span>-- an approximation of the [] data type</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> [] <span>where</span>
  fmap _ [] <span>=</span> []
  fmap f (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> f x <span>:</span> fmap f xs</code></pre></div>
<p>In the example below we convert a <code>[Int]</code> into a <code>[String]</code> given a function <code>Int -&gt; String</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>import </span><span>Data.Semigroup</span> ((&lt;&gt;))

<span>myInts ::</span> [<span>Int</span>]
myInts <span>=</span> [<span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>5</span>]

<span>emptyInts ::</span> [<span>Int</span>]
emptyInts <span>=</span> []

<span>intToString ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
intToString n <span>=</span> (show n) <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>"!"</span>

<span>myStrings ::</span> [<span>String</span>]
myStrings <span>=</span> fmap intToString myInts <span>-- ["1!","2!","3!","4!","5!"]</span>

<span>myEmptyString ::</span> []
myEmptyString <span>=</span> fmap intToString emptyInts  <span>-- []</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another example would the <code>Maybe</code> data type, that represents a value that may or may not exist.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span> <span>|</span> <span>Just</span> a

<span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>where</span>
  fmap _ <span>Nothing</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
  fmap f (<span>Just</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> (f x)</code></pre></div>
<p>In the example below we convert a <code>Maybe Int</code> into a <code>Maybe String</code> given a function <code>Int -&gt; String</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>import </span><span>Data.Semigroup</span> ((&lt;&gt;))

<span>maybeInt ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>
maybeInt <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>10</span>

<span>notInt ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>
notInt <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>

<span>intToString ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
intToString n <span>=</span> (show n) <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>"!"</span>

<span>maybeString ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span>
maybeString <span>=</span> fmap intToString maybeInt <span>-- Just "10!"</span>

<span>notString ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span>
notString <span>=</span> fmap intToString notInt <span>-- Nothing</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Functor</code> typeclass has laws, that ensure <code>Functor</code> instances behave in a predictable way.</p>
<h3 id="laws">Laws</h3>
<h4 id="identity">Identity</h4>

<p>Essentially if you do nothing to the value of a <code>Functor</code>, you get the same <code>Functor</code> you started with.</p>
<h4 id="composition">Composition</h4>
<div><pre><code>fmap (f <span>.</span> g) <span>==</span> fmap f <span>.</span> fmap g</code></pre></div>
<p>If you convert the result of a Functor by <code>fmap</code>ing with a function <code>g</code> and then <code>fmap</code>ing that result with a subsequent function <code>f</code>, it’s the same as composing functions <code>g</code> and <code>f</code> (<code>f . g</code>) and then <code>fmap</code>ing once.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/functor-laws-ct.png" alt="Functor Laws"></p><p>Functor Laws</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-wrong-type-of-fmap">The Wrong Type of fmap</h3>
<p>Now let’s look at something a little different. Let’s create a data type to wrap a predicate of some sort. A predicate is something that will evaluate to a <code>Bool</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>Predicate</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> {<span> getPredicate ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> }</code></pre></div>
<p>An example of a Predicate is <code>greaterThanTen</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>greaterThanTen ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>Int</span>
greaterThanTen <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\n <span>-&gt;</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>that tests whether a number is greater than ten.</p>
<p>We can run with it <code>getPredicate</code> and an <code>Int</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>getPredicate greateThanTen <span>5</span>  <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate greateThanTen <span>11</span> <span>-- True</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It could be useful to define a <code>Functor</code> instance for Predicate - say if we have a <code>Predicate Int</code> and we want to convert it into a <code>Predicate String</code> when we have a <code>Int -&gt; String</code> function. Let’s try and implement that:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>-- fmap (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Predicate a -&gt; Predicate b</span>
  fmap f (<span>Predicate</span> p) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\b <span>-&gt;</span> undefined)
  fmap f (<span>Predicate</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\b <span>-&gt;</span> undefined)  <span>-- expanding p</span>
  fmap (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) (<span>Predicate</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\b <span>-&gt;</span> undefined) <span>-- expanding f</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we’ve run into a small problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we compose (a -&gt; Bool) and (a -&gt; b) to give us a (b -&gt; Bool) ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are given a <code>b</code> but we don’t have access to any functions that actually use a <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>The problem is that we can’t. It’s because of something called “polarity” of the type variable <code>a</code>. No <code>Functor</code> instance for you <code>Predicate</code>.</p>

<h2 id="polarity">Polarity</h2>
<p>Polarity is a way of representing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)">variance</a> using the position of type variables. Let’s take a simple function <code>a -&gt; b</code> as an example.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/function-polarity.png" alt="Function Polarity"></p><p>Function Polarity</p>
</div>
<p>If a type variable is in <strong>input</strong> position like <code>a</code> it is given a <strong>negative</strong> polarity. If it is in an <strong>output</strong> position like <code>b</code> then it is given a <strong>positive</strong> polarity.</p>
<p>These polarities map directly to variant types.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Polarity</th>
<th>Variance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Positive</td>
<td>Covariant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Negative</td>
<td>Contravariant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Both</td>
<td>Invariant</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>What this means is that <code>Functor</code>s (which are actually covariant functors) require a type constructor in a covariant position in order for you to define a <code>Functor</code> instance for that type.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a type that we know has a <code>Functor</code> instance like <code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/maybe-polarity.png" alt="Polarity of the Maybe data type"></p><p>Polarity of the Maybe data type</p>
</div>
<p>We can see that the type variable <code>a</code> occurs in a covariant (or output) position within the definition of the <code>Just</code> constructor.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the definition of <code>Predicate</code> data type:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/predicate-polarity.png" alt="Polarity of the Predicate data type"></p><p>Polarity of the Predicate data type</p>
</div>
<p>We can see that the type variable <code>a</code> occurs in a contravariant (or input) position. This indicates that we can’t create a (covariant) <code>Functor</code> instance for this data type.</p>
<p>But we want to map things! What do we do?</p>
<h2 id="contravariant">Contravariant</h2>
<p>Welcome the <code>Contravariant</code> typeclass to the stage! It’s defined as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Contravariant</span> f <span>where</span>
<span>  contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f b <span>-&gt;</span> f a</code></pre></div>
<p>Snazzy! <code>Contravariant</code> also takes some kind of type constructor <code>f</code> just like <code>Functor</code> but it has this weirdly named <code>contramap</code> function instead of <code>fmap</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>     fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b <span>-- Functor</span>
<span>contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f b <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-- Contravariant</span>
                         <span>^^^</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we read <code>fmap</code> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have an <code>a</code> in some context and a function that takes that <code>a</code> and converts it to a <code>b</code>, I can give you a context with a <code>b</code> in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we can then read <code>contramap</code> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a context that needs an <code>a</code> and a function that can convert <code>b</code>s to <code>a</code>s, I can give you a context that needs <code>b</code>s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that probably doesn’t make much sense. So let’s try and look at this in terms of our non-<code>Functor</code>: <code>Predicate</code>. <code>Predicate</code> has a <strong>need</strong> for an <code>a</code>, which it then uses to tell if something about that <code>a</code> is True or False.</p>
<p>Let’s try and write a <code>Contravariant</code> instance for <code>Predicate</code> given that we know that the type <code>a</code> in <code>Predicate</code> occurs in an input position.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Contravariant</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>-- contramp (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f b -&gt; f a</span>
  contramap (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> a <span>-- substituting for `f` for Predicate</span>
  contramap aToB (<span>Predicate</span> bToBool) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\a <span>-&gt;</span> undefined)</code></pre></div>
<p>Given that we have a function <code>a -&gt; b</code> and essentially a function of type <code>b -&gt; Bool</code> (wrapped inside a <code>Predicate b</code>), we can if given an <code>a</code>, convert it to a <code>b</code> using <code>aToB</code> and then give that <code>b</code> to <code>bToBool</code> to give us a <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s a slightly long-form implementation of the <code>Contravariant</code> instance for <code>Predicate</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Contravariant</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
<span>  contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> a
  contramap aToB (<span>Predicate</span> bToBool) <span>=</span>
    <span>Predicate</span> <span>$</span> \a <span>-&gt;</span>
      <span>let</span> b    <span>=</span> aToB a
          bool <span>=</span> bToBool b
      <span>in</span> bool</code></pre></div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/contramap-predicate.png" alt="contramap on Predicate"></p><p>contramap on Predicate</p>
</div>
<p>or more succinctly:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Contravariant</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
<span>  contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> a
  contramap f (<span>Predicate</span> b) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>$</span> b <span>.</span> f</code></pre></div>
<p>We can see from the definition of <code>Predicate a</code> that all we are doing is running the supplied function <code>f</code> <strong>before</strong> the function within <code>Predicate b</code>. The reason we do that is to adapt a new input type to match an existing input type to gain some functionality.</p>
<p>If we revisit the (covariant) <code>Functor</code> instance for <code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>where</span>
  fmap _ <span>Nothing</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
  fmap aToB (<span>Just</span> a) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> (aToB a)</code></pre></div>
<p>we can see that the function <code>aToB</code> is run <strong>after</strong> we have a value of <code>a</code>. We do that to convert a result of some type to another type.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/fmap-maybe.png" alt="fmap on Maybe"></p><p>fmap on Maybe</p>
</div>
<p>These are the essential differences between covariant and contravariant functors:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Typeclass</th>
<th>Function runs</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Functor</td>
<td>after</td>
<td>Convert results</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contravariant</td>
<td>before</td>
<td>Adapt inputs</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now that we know the essential difference between <code>Functor</code> and <code>Contravariant</code>, let’s look at how we can use <code>contramap</code> with our <code>Predicate</code> class.</p>
<p>Given that we already have a <code>Predicate</code> that determines whether a number is greater than ten:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>numGreaterThanTen ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>Int</span>
numGreaterThanTen <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\n <span>-&gt;</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>say we want to write another <code>Predicate</code> that verifies that the length of String is greater than ten characters.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>strLengthGreaterThanTen ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>String</span>
strLengthGreaterThanTen <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\s <span>-&gt;</span> (length s) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Sure, that’s pretty contrived but bear with me. Let’s also say we have a <code>Person</code> data type and we want to know if a person’s name is over ten characters long - if so we consider that to be a long name.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Person</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span> {<span> personName ::</span> <span>String</span>,<span> personAge ::</span> <span>Int</span> }

<span>personLongName ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>Person</span>
personLongName <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\p <span>-&gt;</span> (length <span>.</span> personName <span>$</span> p) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>And we can run these <code>Predicate</code>s as:</p>
<div><pre><code>getPredicate numGreaterThanTen <span>5</span> <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate numGreaterThanTen <span>20</span> <span>-- True</span>

getPredicate strLengthGreaterThanTen <span>"hello"</span>       <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate strLengthGreaterThanTen <span>"hello world"</span> <span>-- True</span>

getPredicate personLongName <span>$</span> <span>Person</span> <span>"John"</span> <span>30</span>        <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate personLongName <span>$</span> <span>Person</span> <span>"Bartholomew"</span> <span>30</span> <span>-- True</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And this is fine, but there’s some duplication across each of the <code>Predicate</code>s - namely the part where we compare a number to ten:</p>
<div><pre><code>(\n <span>-&gt;</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)  <span>-- Int</span>
(\s <span>-&gt;</span> (length s) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>) <span>-- String</span>
(\p <span>-&gt;</span> (length <span>.</span> personName <span>$</span> p) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>) <span>-- Person</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It would be nice if we didn’t have to repeat ourselves.</p>
<p>If we look at the differences between <code>numGreaterThanTen</code>, <code>strLengthGreaterThanTen</code> and <code>personLongName</code> we can see that the only difference is that one works on an <code>Int</code> and the others work on <code>String</code> and <code>Person</code> respectively. <code>strLengthGreaterThanTen</code> and <code>personLongName</code> each convert their input types to an <code>Int</code> and then do the same comparison:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>Predicate</span> (\(<span>n ::</span> <span>Int</span>) <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>let</span> num <span>=</span> id n
  <span>in</span> num <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>-- (1)</span>
) <span>-- numGreaterThanTen</span>


<span>Predicate</span> (\(<span>s ::</span>…</code></pre></div></article></div>

<p><em>A new way of operating.</em></p>



<p>This is one of the books every creator should read. It is full of information for those trying to build an online audience. In this new world where information is abundant, it’s hard to be spotted. How to get people to notice your work? How can you get your stuff out there? And how you can get an audience?</p>



<p>Austin starts by this quote:</p>



<blockquote><p>Be so good they can’t ignore you.</p><cite>Steve Martin</cite></blockquote>



<p>And while it’s true, it’s not enough to be good. In order to be found, you have to be findable. This book goes into details on how sharing your work with the world can help you build an audience. The same audience that will help you get your word out once you’re ready.</p>



<p>The book helps you think about your work as a never-ending process and how to share it in a way that attracts people who might be interested in what you do.</p>



<h2>You don’t have to be a genius</h2>



<p>We see a genius as an individual with superhuman talents, free of the influence of a precedent, and with a direct connection to God. When inspiration comes, it strikes like a lighting bolt and then he spends the rest of his time in his studio turning this idea into a masterpiece.</p>



<p>But that’s not true.</p>



<p>Creative work is done in a group. All group members are contributing ideas, stealing from each other, copying, etc. It’s not about how smart you are, but about what you have to contribute, the ideas you share, the quality of connections you make, and the conversations you start. Austin calls this group a <strong>scenius</strong>.</p>



<p>Find your scenius, and be a good contributor.</p>



<hr>



<p>Austin then moves to talk about being an “expert”. He explains how the world is changing at such a rapid pace that it’s turning us all to amateurs. So instead of fighting it, embrace being an amateur.</p>



<p>An amateur is someone following something in the spirit of love. Because they have little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything and share results.</p>



<blockquote><p>In the beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities. In the expert’s mind, there are only few.</p></blockquote>



<p>On the spectrum of creative work, the difference of mediocre and good is vast. But mediocrity is still on the spectrum, you can move up in increments. The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something. Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing.</p>



<p>The best way to start in the path of sharing you work is to commit to learning in front of others. Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note. Look for voids you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first.</p>



<hr>



<p>On doing what we love, Austin explains how we’ve always been told to find our voice, but we never really know what this means. You can’t find your voice if you don’t use it. So talk about the things you love. Your voice will follow.</p>



<p>When talking about your work, make sure you do it online. In this day and age, if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist. We all have the opportunity to use our voices, to have our say, but so many of us are wasting it. If you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about, you have to share them.</p>



<h2>Think process, not product</h2>



<p>In a pre-digital world, the only way an artist could connect with an audience was through a gallery show or art magazine. But today, with social media, an artist can share whatever she wants, whenever she wants, at almost no cost. By sharing her day-to-day process, she can form a unique bond with her audience. <strong>Take people behind the scenes</strong>.</p>



<blockquote><p>People really want to see how sausages get made</p></blockquote>



<p>Become a documentarian of what you do. Let your audience see the person behind the products.</p>



<p>A lot of us go about our work and feel like we have nothing to show for it at the end of the day. But whatever the nature of your work, there is an art to what you do, and <strong>there are people who would be interested in that art</strong>. If only you presented it to them in the right way!</p>



<p>How can you show your work even when you have nothing to show? You need to make stuff (also see my post on <a href="https://elazzabi.com/2020/05/12/how-to-create-a-public-portfolio-when-what-you-do-is-private-or-proprietary/">how to create a public portfolio when your work is private</a>). No one will give a damn about your résumé, they want to see what you have made with your little fingers. Start a journal and write your thoughts, or speak in an audio recorder. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages. Shoot videos. etc. This is not about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. When you are ready to share, you’ll have a surplus of material to choose from.</p>



<h2>Share something small every day</h2>



<p>Every success needs decades worth of hard work and perseverance. But thankfully, you don’t need that time all in one big chunk. And speaking about chunks, forget big chunks. Forget years, months, weeks… Focus on something small. Focus on days.</p>



<p>Once a day, after you finish your work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece you can share. If you’re just starting, share your influencers and what’s inspiring you. If you’re in the middle, share your process or methods of work. If you completed the project, share the final result. If you have multiple projects in the wild, report how they are doing or share stories about how people are interacting with your work.</p>



<p>The form you use for sharing doesn’t matter. Blog, tweet, video, it doesn’t matter. There’s no one-size-fits-all plan for everybody. Pick what works for you, and stick to it.</p>



<p>Produce and share a lot. <em>Theodore Sturgeon</em>, a fiction author, states that 90% of what we produce is crap, the other 10% is good work. But the problem is we don’t know which is which until we share it with others. So make sure to share a lot, but keep in mind anything you share will be there forever. So don’t share something you don’t want your boss or mom to see.</p>



<hr>



<p>You daily updates will construct what Austin calls the <strong>Flow</strong>. But you need another part to achieve results, and it’s called the <strong>Stock</strong>. If the <em>flow</em> is the daily stream of updates, the <em>stock</em> is the content that will be still interesting in months and years from publication.</p>



<p>Stock is what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time. And the magic formula is to <strong>maintain your flow, while working on your stock in the background</strong>.</p>



<p>Your stock is made by collecting, organizing, and expanding upon your flow. Social media is a public notebook where we share our ideas and invite others to share their voice with us. But the thing with notebooks is you need to revisit them in order to make the most out of them.</p>



<p>Social networks are good, but they come and go. If you’re really interested in sharing your work and expressing yourself, nothing beats owning your own space online, a place that you control. Buy a good domain name, and create your blog.</p>



<p>A blog is the perfect machine to turn flow into stocks. One blog post is nothing on its own. But publish a thousand blog posts over a decade, and it turns into your life’s work. This sounds technical, but a few Google searches will show you the way.</p>



<h2><strong>Open your cabinet of curiosities.</strong></h2>



<p>If you happened to be wealthy and educated in the 16th-17th century, chances are you had a cabinet of curiosities. A room filled with rare objects that served as a kind of external display. Books, skeletons, jewels, shells… were all part of the cabinet.</p>



<p>Before we are ready to take the leap of sharing our own work with the world, we can share our tastes in the work of others. Where do you get your inspiration? What do you read? Do you subscribe to anything? What movies do you see?…</p>



<p>When you share this online, always credit people and include a link pointing to the website of the creator.  The number one rule of the Internet is <strong>people are lazy</strong>. If you don’t include a link, no one will bother searching.</p>



<h2>Tell good stories</h2>



<blockquote><p>You might think that the pleasure you get from a painting depends on its color, its shape, and its pattern. And if that’s right, it shouldn’t matter if it’s an original or a forgery. But our brains don’t work like that. When shown an object, a face… people’s assessment -how much they like it- is deeply affected by what you tell them about it</p><cite>Paul Bloom – Psychology Professor</cite></blockquote>



<p>Words matter. Your work doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Whether you realize it or not, you’re already telling a story about your work. Every email you send, tweet, video, comment… they are all contributing to the narrative you’re constantly constructing.  If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one.</p>



<p>To tell a story, you need structure. But sadly, our life is messy. A good pitch has 3 acts: The first act is the past, where you’ve been, what you want, how you came to want it… The second act is the present, where you are now, how you’ve worked hard and used up most of your resources. The third act is the future, where you’re going, and how exactly is the person you’re pitching can help you get there.</p>



<p>Whether you’re telling a finished or unfinished story, always keep your audience in mind. Speak to them directly in plain language. Be brief. Learn to speak. Lear to write. Use spell-check…</p>



<h2>Teach what you know</h2>



<p>Think about what you can share from your process that would benefit your audience. What are your techniques? Are you skilled at using certain tools/materials? The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online. Use pictures, words, and videos. Make people better at something they want to be better at.</p>



<h2>Don’t turn into human spam</h2>



<p>There is a category of humans called human spam. They’re everywhere, and they exist in every profession. They don’t want to pay their dues, they want their piece right away. They don’t listen to your ideas, they tell you theirs. You should …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Searching for an open-source Google Analytics alternative?</em></p><p><em>Our guest has your back. Uku Täht is the founder of <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, an open-source web analytics project built with Elixir. For the last couple of months, his project has attracted a lot of attention through <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics">informative blog posts</a> and very positive user reviews.</em></p><p><em>In this interview, we talk about his use of Elixir in production: the benefits, the downsides, the specifics, and why Elixir is so good for projects like Plausible Analytics.</em></p><h2 id="interview-with-uku-t%C3%A4ht">Interview with Uku Täht</h2><p><strong>Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</strong></p><p>Plausible Analytics is an open-source project dedicated to making web analytics more privacy-friendly. Our mission is to reduce corporate surveillance by providing an alternative web analytics tool that doesn’t have any links to AdTech.</p><p>I started building Plausible almost two years ago as a side project. I’ve been working on it full-time since the beginning of this year and I’ve also partnered up with Marko who handles the marketing and communication side of things.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/uj/ujixp3oy.2_(22)_(1).jpg" alt="ujixp3oy.2_(22)_(1).jpg"></p><hr><center><i>Uku Täht, the founder of Plausible Analytics.</i></center><p><strong>What is the key feature or set of features that make using Plausible Analytics a feasible replacement over Google Analytics?</strong></p><p>Google Analytics is overkill for most website owners. Plausible cuts through the noise by presenting all the important website traffic insights and metrics on one single page. You don’t need training or experience in web analytics to get started.</p><p>Keeping the script lightweight is also a priority. Our script is more than 17 times smaller than the Google Analytics script and more than 45 times smaller than the recommended Google Analytics integration using the Google Tag Manager.</p><p>But the biggest reason to choose Plausible is the fact that we’re committed to building open source software. The code behind our service is freely available for anyone. By using Plausible you help build software that everyone can benefit from, not just the corporations.</p><p><strong>How did Elixir as the language of choice work for you when implementing these features?</strong></p><p>I think Elixir is perfect for our use-case. It’s a very productive language once you learn it and it can also handle tons of traffic. Last month we processed 60 million pageviews with absolutely no issues.</p><p>Elixir really shines when you have stateful requirements for the app server. For example, we keep all the active sessions in memory so we don’t have to look a session up from the database on every event. It was a joy to build this part of the app using the GenServer primitives.</p><p><strong>How much did the fact that your product is not only self-hosted but also a SaaS inform your decision to go with Elixir? Did you choose it to scale a SaaS?</strong></p><p>I do believe that using Elixir allows us to make self-hosting a bit easier. In other languages, it’s common to use tools like Redis and external message queues but in Elixir we can often avoid these extra tools and keep the infrastructure requirements simple.</p><p>Plausible is currently designed to run on just one node. Once we start building out support for multi-node deployments, things will get really interesting. I feel like Elixir and the BEAM are designed perfectly for our use-case where we need multiple nodes to share state about visitors sessions.</p><p>Hopefully, we can evolve the architecture without needing extra infrastructure bits and pieces. The goal is to keep the requirements as simple as possible so everyone can run the code on their own server. By relying on BEAM fundamentals, we can probably avoid in-memoy stores, external message queues, and cluster managers altogether, making Plausible easy to self-host.</p><p><strong>Could you tell us more about your deployment: where do you host, how do you deploy, do you use the hot code reload functionality?</strong></p><p>We <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/made-in-eu">recently moved</a> from Heroku to using Digital Ocean. I wanted to eat our own dog food when it comes to the Docker infrastructure we built for self-hosting. So now we have a Digital Ocean droplet pre-configured with Docker and we just pull new images from our <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/plausible/analytics">DockerHub</a>.</p><p>Since we have a single node deployment, we do have around 30 seconds of downtime on each deploy and we don’t have auto-scaling support. We will deal with these issues as we scale, I just wanted to be upfront about the downsides of how we’re running it.</p><p>We don’t use hot code reloading since it doesn’t play well with the Docker flow.</p><p><strong>What was the biggest challenge while developing Plausible Analytics with Elixir?</strong></p><p>We use a database called Clickhouse for storing our stats. It’s a fairly new and cutting-edge database and it doesn’t have a robust integration with Elixir yet. We use a low-level connection library which gives us random errors sometimes.</p><p>I’m thinking about taking the time to write a proper Ecto adapter for Clickhouse so we can run migrations and have better error handling. It’s easy to complain about the lack of libraries in the Elixir ecosystem but I’d like to do my part in helping the ecosystem thrive.</p><p><strong>Are you satisfied with the result?</strong></p><p>Definitely. If I could go back and do it all over, I would choose the same stack again. Elixir+Phoenix is really fun to work with and it performs even better than I expected.</p><p><strong>Any key takeaways that you would like to share with our audience?</strong></p><p>Elixir is a wonderful language and its ecosystem is really coming along. I would encourage everyone to give it a try and contribute back to the ever-growing list of libraries and frameworks to make it even more powerful.</p><hr><p>I’d like to thank Uku for the interview! If you want to see more examples of Elixir used in production, check out <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-in-production-venu">our interview</a> with one of the Venu co-founders or read our post about <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-companies">companies that use Elixir</a>.</p><p>Additionally, if you have your own Elixir in production story to tell (both good and bad), we definitely want to hear it!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p><b>Corto</b> is a library for compression and decompression meshes and point clouds (C++ and Javascript).
</p><p>Source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/corto">Github</a></p>

<p>Corto supports point clouds and meshes with per vertex attributes: normals, colors, texture coordinates and custom attributes.</p>


<p>The main focus of this work is on decompression speed, see performances, both for C++ lib and javascript, while still providing good compression rates.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#corto">corto</a> is program to compress .ply and .obj models
</li><li><a href="#libcorto">libcorto</a> is a C++ compression/decompression library
</li><li><a href="#corto.js">corto.js</a> a javascript library for .crt decompression
</li><li><a href="#cortoloader">CORTOLoader</a>, a threejs loader.
</li></ul>

<p>This work is based on the compression algorithm developed for the <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/nexus">Nexus</a> project for creation and visualization of multiresolution models. This approach has many advantages for large models in term of streaming and adaptive rendering.<br>
See <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publications/2015/PD15/">Fast decompression for web-based view-dependent 3D rendering</a>.</p>

</div> <!--row -->

<h2><a name="corto"></a>Corto</h2>

<p>A small executable to convert <em>.ply</em> and <em>.obj</em> into compressed format <em>.crt</em></p>

<pre>Usage:

corto [options] FILE

FILE is the path to a .ply or a .obj 3D model.

	-o &lt;output&gt;: filename of the .crt compressed file.
						if not specified the extension of the input file will be replaced.
	-e &lt;key=value&gt;: add an exif property, or more than one.
	-p : treat the input as a point cloud.
	-v &lt;bits&gt;: vertex bits quantization. If not specified an euristic is used
	-n &lt;bits&gt;: normal bits quantization. Default 10.
	-c &lt;bits&gt;: color bits quantization. Default 6.
	-u &lt;bits&gt;: texture coordinate bits. Default 10.
	-q &lt;step&gt;: quantization step unit (float) instead of bits for vertex coordinates
	-N &lt;prediction&gt;: normal prediction can be:
						delta: use difference from previous normal (fastest)
						 estimated: use difference from compute normals (cheaper)
						border: store difference only for boundary vertices (cheapest)
	-A : compute and add normals to the model.
	-P &lt;file.ply&gt;: decompress and save as .ply for debugging purpouses
</pre>

<p>Material groups for obj (newmtl) and ply with texnumbers are preserved into the crt model, additional properties can be stored in the file using the <em>-e</em> option.</p>

<p><em>-v 12</em> will result in the quantization of the coordinates to 1/4096th of the largest dimension in the bounding box. If not specified the quantization step is set to 1/20th of the average edge.</p>

<p><em>-n 10</em> normals are stored using the octahedron parametrization to a square of 1024x1024 positions, resulting in a better sample distribution than quantization in 3D.</p>


<h2><a name="cortoloader"></a>CORTOLoader</h2>

<p>CORTOLoader.js is similar to THREE.OBJLoader in functionality, and can easily replace it in three.js.</p>

<pre>var loader = new THREE.CORTOLoader({ path: "models/" });  
//materials autocreated, pass otherwise option loadMaterial: false

loader.load("bunny.crt", function(mesh) {
	//needed to render on texture load
	mesh.addEventListener("change", render);

	if(!mesh.geometry.attributes.normal)
		mesh.geometry.computeVertexNormals();

	scene.add(mesh); 
	render();
});
</pre>

<p>CORTOLoader is pretty self-explanatory in how to create a THREE.Mesh:</p>

<pre>var decoder = new CortoDecoder(blob); //where blob is an ArrayBuffer
var model = decoder.decode();

var geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
if(model.nface)
	geometry.setIndex(new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.index, 1));

if(model.groups.length &gt; 0) {
	var start = 0;
	for(var i = 0; i &lt; model.groups.length; i++) {
		var g = model.groups[i];
		geometry.addGroup(start*3, g.end*3, i);
		start = g.end;
	}
}

geometry.addAttribute('position', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.position, 3));
if(model.color)
	geometry.addAttribute('color', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.color, 3, true));
if (model.normal)
	geometry.addAttribute('normal', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.normal, 3, true));
if (model.uv)
	geometry.addAttribute('uv', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.uv, 2));

var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry);
</pre>



<h2><a name="corto.js"></a>Corto.js</h2>

<p>CortoDecoder class decodes a .crt as an arraybuffer and returns an objects with attributes (positions, index, colors etc).</p>

<pre>&lt;script src="js/corto.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'bunny.crt');
request.responseType = 'arraybuffer';
request.onload = function() {
	var decoder = new CortoDecoder(this.response);
	var model = decoder.decode();
	console.log(model.nvert, model.nface, model.groups);
	console.log('Index: ', model.index);
	console.log('Positions: ', model.position);
	console.log('Colors: ', model.color);
	console.log('Nornmals: ', model.normal);
	console.log('Tex coords: ', model.uv);
	//custom attributes can be encoded, see cortolib below for details.
}
request.send();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h2><a name="libcorto"></a>Libcorto</h2>

<p>Interface is not entirely stable, no mayor change is expected. See src/main.cpp for an extensive example.</p>

<pre>#include &lt;corto/encoder.h&gt;
#include &lt;corto/decoder.h&gt;

std::vector&lt;float&gt; coords;
std::vector&lt;uint32_t&gt; index;
std::vector&lt;float&gt; uv;
std::vector&lt;float&gt; radius;

//fill data arrays...

crt::Encoder encoder(nvert, nface);

//add attributes to be encoded
encoder.addPositions(coords.data(), index.data(), vertex_quantization_step);
encoder.addUvs(uvs.data(), pow(2, -uv_bits));

//add custom attributes
encoder.addAttribute("radius", (char *)radiuses.data(), crt::VertexAttribute::FLOAT, 1, 1.0f);

const char *compressed_data = encoder.stream.data();
const uint32_t compressed_size = encoder.stream.size();
Decoding

crt::Decoder decoder(size, data);

//allocate memory if needed
coords.resize(decoder.nvert*3);
index.resize(decoder.nface*3);

//tell the decoder where to decompress data
decoder.setPositions(coords.data());

if(decoder.data.count("uv")) {
	out.uvs.resize(decoder.nvert*2);
	decoder.setUvs(out.uvs.data());
}
//actually decode
decoder.decode();
</pre>

<h3><a name="encoder"></a>Encoder</h3>

<pre>Encoder(uint32_t _nvert, uint32_t _nface = 0, Stream::Entropy entropy = Stream::TUNSTALL);
</pre>

<p>The Encoder class assume the input is an indexed mesh, specify the number of vertices and faces (0 for point clouds). For debug or entropy compression test Stream supports lzip and lz4, they can be enabled defining ENTROPY_TESTS in the makefile.</p>

<p>Vertex coordinates, attributes and indices are passed to the encoder (assuming they respect the nvert, nface paramenters: 3*nvert for positions and normals, 4*nvert for colors, 2*nvert for uv, 3*nface for indices)</p>

<h4>Coordinates</h4>

<pre>bool addPositions(const float *buffer, float q = 0.0f, Point3f o = Point3f(0.0f)); //for point clouds
bool addPositions(const float *buffer, const uint32_t *index, float q = 0.0f, Point3f o = Point3f(0.0f));
bool addPositions(const float *buffer, const uint16_t *index, float q = 0.0f, Point3f o = Point3f(0.0f));
</pre>

<p><em>q</em> specify the quantization parameter, while <em>o</em> the origin of the quantization (v[i*3+k] = (buffer[i*3+k] - o[k])/q</p>
<p>If q is not specified the quantization step is estimated as 1/20th of the average edge length (or a function of the volume and number of the points
for point clouds).</p>

<pre>bool addPositionsBits(const float *buffer, int bits);
bool addPositionsBits(const float *buffer, uint32_t *index, int bits);
bool addPositionsBits(const float *buffer, uint16_t *index, int bits);
</pre>

<p>It might be more convenient to specify quantization step in term of the bits needed per coordinate</p>

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<pre>bool addNormals(const float *buffer, int bits, NormalAttr::Prediction no = NormalAttr::ESTIMATED);
bool addNormals(const int16_t *buffer, int bits, NormalAttr::Prediction no = NormalAttr::ESTIMATED);

bool addColors(const unsigned char *buffer, int rbits = 6, int gbits = 7, int bbits = 6, int abits = 5);

bool addUvs(const float *buffer, float q = 0);
</pre>

<p>Normal quantization is expressed in bits, referring to the octahedron parametrization space.</p>
<p>Prediction for normal attribute can be</p>
<ul>
<li>DELTA: difference from previous normal, it's fast but provide less compression
</li><li>ESTIMATED: difference from normal estimated from the vertex coordinates (and wont apply to point clouds)
slower than DELTA, but especially when coordinates are saved with high precision will provide better compression
</li><li>BORDER: will only preserve boundary normals. This is especially useful if the model is split into pieces
(for example in <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/nexus">Nexus</a> multiresolution viewer.
</li></ul>
<p>Color quantization for red, green, blue, alpha. Internally the color is stored as 
poor man YCbCr color space (where G estimates Y!), might be changed to something better and quantization refer to the internal space</p>

<h4>Generic attributes</h4>

<pre>bool addAttribute(const char *name, const char *buffer, VertexAttribute::Format format, 
	int components, float q, uint32_t strategy = 0);
bool addAttribute(const char *name, char *buffer, VertexAttribute *attr);
</pre>

<h4>Groups</h4>

<pre>void addGroup(int end_triangle);
void addGroup(int end_triangle, std::map<std::string, std::string=""> &amp;props);
</std::string,></pre>

<h4>Result</h4>

</div><p>to control context cancelation using Unix signals, simplifying handling operating system signals in Go for certain common cases. This is my first contribution to the Go standard library, and I am very excited!</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>When writing <abbr title="command-line interface">CLI</abbr> code, I often needed to handle cancellation – for instance, when a user presses CTRL+C producing an interrupt signal. Another possible use case is to handle graceful termination of HTTP servers using <code>http.*Server.Shutdown(ctx)</code>.</p>
<p>I had to write code using the signal package often and in multiple places. I didn’t want that, so I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/henvic/ctxsignal">ctxsignal</a> package to solve this common problem two years ago.</p>
<p>However, I kept finding it in other places and noticing people would often not handle proper termination correctly or at all, so I got motivated to submit a proposal and try to improve this situation.</p>

</div><p>This program will print <code>"missed signal"</code> after 10 seconds or will print <code>"signal received"</code> when the user sends an interruption signal, such as by pressing CTRL+C on a keyboard.</p>
<p>Please note that the second returned value of the <code>signal.NotifyContext</code> function is a function called <code>stop</code> instead of <code>cancel</code>. Once you’re done handling a system signal, you should call <code>stop</code>. We call it <code>stop</code> instead of <code>cancel</code> because you need to call it to stop capturing any further system signal you registered with <code>NotifyContext</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stop function unregisters the signal behavior, which, like signal.Reset, may restore the default behavior for a given signal.</p>

<li>I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37255">proposal</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/cl/219640">implementation</a> on 17 February (as WithContext in the signal package)</li>
<li>After some discussions, a somewhat modified proposal was accepted on 1 April as a WithCancelSignal in the context package</li>
<li>It was moved back to the proposal stage on 15 April after some concerns were presented about having it in the context package</li>
<li>After more discussions, it was accepted again on 20 May as NotifyContext in the signal package</li>
<li>A couple of days ago, I restarted working on it.</li>
<li>Today it got merged and is available in the tip</li>

<ul>
<li>I delayed working on it and missed the Go 1.15 release due to its <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle">code freeze window</a></li>
<li>Go uses <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a> to track changes and code reviews.</li>
<li>I found Gerrit’s patchsets better over GitHub’s pull-requests to keep track of changes without losing context (pun intended).</li>

                <div>
                    <h3>Here's my best practice guidelines for form design. </h3>
                    <p>Working on a design system for a bank has taught me a lot about forms. I've watched testing in our labs. I've worked alongside experts from specialist accessibility organisations. I've seen forms tested by disabled people and users of assistive technology. I've also read a lot of research.</p> 
                    <p>From all this learning I've formed my own forms best-practice guidelines. I thought it would be useful start recording it. Here's my work in progress. I do UI/UX so I'm coming at this from a designer's perspective.               
              
    </p><h2 id="principles"> First, some principles</h2>
                    
                    <hr>
					<p>It's important to start with with a set of principles. It's easy to become swayed by design trends and I have to bring myself back to the user.</p><p>I aspire to the <a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/">Inclusive Design Principles</a>. Designing forms for people experiencing permanent, temporary or situational disabilities improves the experience for everyone. I also look to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility">WCAG</a> principles. Your website or app must be: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>perceivable</li>
	<li>operable</li>
	<li>understandable</li>
	<li>robust and compatible</li>

	</ul>
	<p>In summary, think of your user and keep things as simple and as functional as possible. But don't overvalue simplicity and style at the <a href="https://uxmyths.com/post/115783813605/myth-34-simple-minimal">cost of clarity</a>. In the words of Luke Wroblewski "<a href="https://aneventapart.com/news/post/obvious-always-wins-by-luke-wroblewski-aea-video">obvious always wins</a>".</p>

        <p>Buttons trigger an action or event such as continuing to the next stage or submitting a form. Use them purposely.</p>        
        
		<div>        
        	<h3>My guidelines</h3>  
        
       		 <ul>
        	<li>Button text should describe the action the button performs and be consistent through the journey.</li>
        	<li>Don't overload the user with choices. Use only one primary button on each page for the main action.</li>
        	<li>Place the submit button where users look for it. In a standard form journey this is usually to the left edge of the form, directly below the final field.</li>
        	<li>Make destructive buttons like cancel or previous harder for the user to find. A back button or link often works well above the form.</li>
        	<li>Avoid disabled buttons. They have poor contrast and can cause confusion.</li>

        	<li>Once an option has been selected the user can't unselect it without refreshing their browser. Consider adding a 'none' option.</li>
        	<li>Order radios from most to least common options. If this will cause an unwanted bias, order options alphabetically.</li>
			<li>Place hint text under the form label.</li>  
			<li>Make radio buttons easy to tap, with a target height of at least 44 pixels.</li>

	<time datetime="2020-09-16">September 16, 2020</time>
  
	<p>These are my thoughts on ageism - discriminating people, and more importantly, ideas, just because of someone’s age.</p>

<p>I’m 22 years old. If you’re older than me, don’t hang up. Give me a chance. Sure, I may not have as much experience as you, and a lot of what I say may be wrong and uninformed, but that’s fine. Mistakes are good because that means decisions are being made - and I can fix those mistakes, but I have to start somewhere - and that’s where this post comes in.</p>

<p>I’m going to pitch this idea in two ways. First, to someone younger than me, and then, to someone older. You’ll want to read them both to fully understand my view</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>To someone younger,<br>
When I disregard an idea you have - it might be because it’s a terrible idea - but more often than not, it’s because I’m jealous. I see a better version of myself when I look at you. You bring with you so much enthusiasm and potential, that I often wonder “What the f*** am I doing with my life?”. My feedback doesn’t come from a good place, and I certainly don’t have your best interests at heart. I feel like you might out-achieve me, and that’s terrifying. I too had big dreams 10 years ago that I haven’t achieved - so why should you? </p>

<p>I’m shutting you down because it makes me feel better. If anyone can understand that - it’s got to be you. Why? Well, you’re really ambitious, and you’ll do anything to leave your mark on this world, including preventing others from stealing your limelight. You came to me because you saw someone you respected and could look up to - and because I’m similar to you. If I am indeed similar to you, then I’m doing exactly what you would do too.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll walk away from a conversation with me the same way I did with my elders - with disdain, and a burning passion to prove them wrong. </p>

<p>More importantly, if I tell you that you’re doing a good job - be terrified. Approval from someone you respect is a dangerous drug. Your goal isn’t to get my approval - it’s to get me to be terrified of you and for me to do anything I can to shut you down. It’s so easy to get trapped relying on the approval of an elder.</p>

<p>Honestly, at the end of the day, I blame you. You look up to us, as elders, to be your mentors and you expect us to be mature and have your best interests at heart. Why is that? Because we’re older? That’s aegist.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>To my elders,<br>
I do look up to you. Not because you’re older than me, or have more experience. No. I look to you as a worthy opponent - someone I can still beat. I’ve already failed my younger self by not hitting the goals I had, but when I see you - I’m not there yet, and that means I can still do better. </p>

<p>At first, I try to figure out what you were like at my age. Sure, I’m interested in your life, but more importantly, I’m pacing myself. I try to figure out what metrics I’m doing better than you on, and on what metrics I’m doing worse. If you’re within a reasonable band, then I’ll treat you as an equal. If you were significantly ahead when you were my age, then I’ll try my best to catch up. You can’t change your past, but I can change my future, and that means I have potential. I will still see you as an equal though - because anything more, and I’m bound to your approval. If I’m bound to your approval, then I can never beat you. I can only ever be good enough.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your advice, and yes, even your stories and experiences. Learning what you did right and wrong is really valuable. After all, passing knowledge between generations is what brought humanity this far. While spewing words of wisdom is great for your self esteem - don’t ever forget the golden rule. You’re giving me advice, not orders. Don’t be disappointed when I don’t do what you say. I value your opinions, the same way I value the opinions of a peer or someone younger than me. Would you like me to weigh your words more highly? Why? Because you’re older than them? That’s aegist.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Ageism is an unfortunate fact of life in our society. We all experience it, but we also all contribute to it. Instead of trying to fix society, it’s far easier to adjust your own worldview so you’re less affected by it. I hope this essay helps you do just that</p>

Quality of software is driven by both the talent of its creators and how they feel while theyâ€™re crafting it. Teams that have the time and energy to be focused on the work itself can build magical, high quality software. Our tools and practices need to do their best to nurture this, not take it away.</p><p>To bring back the right focus, these are the foundational ideas Linear is built on.</p></header><section><h2>Principles</h2><h3>Build for the creators</h3><p>Software project management tools should build with the end users â€“ the creators â€“ in mind. Keeping individuals productive is more important than generating perfect reports.</p><h3>Opinionated software</h3><p>Productivity software should be opinionated. It's the only way the product can truly do the heavy lifting for you. Flexible software lets everyone invent their own workflows, which eventually creates chaos as teams scale.</p><h3>Create momentum â€“ don't sprint</h3><p>We should find a cadence and routine of working. In cycles, we decide priorities and assign responsibilities. Our goal is to maintain a healthy momentum with our teams, not rush towards the end.</p><h3>Meaningful direction</h3><p>Our daily work might be filled with tasks but we should understand and remind our teams of the purpose and long term goals of our work. Roadmaps, projects and milestones are all important to keep in mind as we plan our weekly schedules.</p><h3>Aim for clarity</h3><p>Donâ€™t invent terms if possible, as these can confuse and have different meanings in different teams. Projects should be called projects.</p><h3>Say no to busy work</h3><p>Our tools should not make us the designers and maintainers of them. We should throw away or automate the busy work so you can focus on the more important work.</p><h3>Simple first, then powerful</h3><p>Teams at different sizes have different needs. Tools should be simple to get started with and grow more powerful over time.</p><h3>Decide and move on</h3><p>There isn't always a best answer. The important thing is to make a decision, and move on.</p></section><section><h2>Practices</h2><h3>Set monthly, quarterly or/and annual roadmaps</h3><p>Ambitious goals are the only way to make a significant impact. Companies should focus on them when they define their high level direction. Reserve some space on your roadmaps for unexpected and reactive work that always comes up and allow your roadmap to change if needed.</p><h3>Connect daily work to larger goals with projects</h3><p>All projects and work should directly correlate to these goals. Review projects and their target dates during roadmap meetings and pull from projects as you plan cycles.</p><h3>Work in <i>n-week</i> cycles</h3><p>Cycles create healthy routine and focus teams on what needs to happen next. 2-week cycles are the most common in software building. They're short enough to not lose sight of other priorities but long enough to build significant features. Cycles should feel reasonable. Don't overload cycles with tasks and let unfinished items move to the next cycle automatically.</p><h3>Keep a manageable backlog</h3><p>You don't need to save every feature request or piece of feedback. Important ones will resurface and low priority ones will never get fixed. A more focused backlog makes it easier and faster to plan cycles, and ensures the work will actually get done.</p><h3>Mix feature and quality work</h3><p>All software has bugs, more than we can ever fix. Include bugs and other fixes as part of your cycles. Invest in tooling as it is a force multiplier if done right.</p><h3>Specify project and issue owners</h3><p>Each project should have a named owner responsible to own delivery and write the project brief. The same goes for issues. Others should collaborate but responsibility should lie with a single person.</p><h3>Write project specs</h3><p>Aim for brevity. Short specs are more likely to be read. The purpose of a spec is to briefly communicate the "why", "what" and "how" of the project to the rest of the team. Ideally these short documents force teams to scope out work so priorities are clear and teams avoid building the wrong thing.</p><h3>Understand your users</h3><p>The more popular your product, the more feedback you'll get. Overflowing inboxes are a good sign unless they're bug reports. Donâ€™t worry too much about organizing all the feedback. Collect it and use it as a research library when developing new features. Try to spot trends. Use feedback, even complaints, as an opportunity to get to know your users and ask them to explain why they want a specific feature so you find out their needs. Solve the problem â€“ donâ€™t just build the feature.</p><h3>Scope issues to be as small as possible</h3><p>It's hard to see visible progress when working on large tasks, which can be demotivating. Break down work into smaller parts and create an issue for each one when possible. Ideally you can complete several concrete tasks each week. It feels great to mark issues as done.</p><h3>Measure progress with actual work</h3><p>The clearest way to see whether something is complete or not is to show the diff in the code or design file. When the tasks are scoped small, your changes will be small and easier to review, too. Avoid massive pull requests or large design changes.</p><h3>Run cross-functional teams</h3><p>Designers and engineers should work together on projects, creating a natural push and pull. Designers bring their skills to explore ideas and push your team's thinking. Engineers can challenge thinking around implementation and will bring the winning ideas to reality. The best creators often have talent for both. Directly loop in other teams when building features they'll use or ask customers they interact with to use.</p><h3>Write a changelog</h3><p>Itâ€™s important to look back and celebrate what you achieved as a team. Consistent changelogs also communicate to the user new features, the value they get from your product, and your commitment to improving it. It's also an easy way to connect your team's individual work to the collective value they create.<!-- --> <a href="https://medium.com/linear-app/startups-write-changelogs-c6a1d2ff4820">Read more</a> on how we write ours.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<p>Repl is a great window into a running program, but the textual nature of its output limits developer’s ability to inspect the program: a text is not an object, and we are dealing with objects in the VM.</p>

<p>Reveal aims to solve this problem by creating an in-process repl output pane that makes inspecting values as easy as selecting an interesting datum. It recognizes the value of text as a universal interface, that’s why its output looks like a text: you can select it, copy it, save it into a file. Unlike text, reveal output holds references to printed values, making inspecting selected value a matter of opening a context menu.</p>

<p>Unlike datafy/nav based tools, Reveal does not enforce a particular data representation for any given object, making it an open set — that includes datafy/nav as one of the available options. It does not use datafy/nav by default because in the absence of inter-process communication to datafy is to lose.</p>

<p>Not being limited to text, Reveal uses judicious syntax highlighting to aid in differentiating various objects: text <code>java.lang.Integer</code> looks differently depending on whether it was produced from a symbol or a class.</p>



<p>The easiest way to try it is to run a Reveal repl:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {vlaaad/reveal {:mvn/version "1.0.130"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-m</span> vlaaad.reveal repl
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Executing this command will start a repl and open Reveal output window that will mirror the evaluations in the shell.</p>



<h2 id="tap-support"><code>tap&gt;</code> support</h2>

<p>Clojure 1.10 added <code>tap&gt;</code> function with the purpose similar to printing the value for debugging, but instead of characters you get the object. Reveal repls show tapped values in their output windows — you won’t need <code>println</code> anymore!</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/tap.gif" alt="Tap demo"></p>

<h2 id="eval-on-selection">Eval on selection</h2>

<p>You can evaluate code on any selected value by using text input in the context menu. You can write either a single symbol of a function to call or a form where <code>*v</code> will be replaced with selected value.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/eval-on-selection.gif" alt="Eval on selection demo"></p>

<h2 id="inspect-object-fields-and-properties">Inspect object fields and properties</h2>

<p>Any object in the JVM has class and fields, making them easily accessible for inspection is extremely important. With <code>java-bean</code> contextual action you get a debugger-like view of objects in the VM. Access to this information greatly improves the visibility of the VM and allows to explore it. For example, for any class you have on the classpath you can get the place where it’s coming from:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/java-bean.gif" alt="Java bean demo">
I learned about it after implementing this feature :)</p>

<h2 id="look-and-feel-customization">Look and feel customization</h2>

<p>Reveal can be configured with <code>vlaaad.reveal.prefs</code> java property to use different font or theme:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/light-theme.png" alt="Light theme"></p>

<h2 id="url-and-file-browser">URL and file browser</h2>

<p>You can open URL-like things and files: both internally in Reveal and externally using other applications in your OS e.g. file explorer, browser or text editor.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/browse.gif" alt="Browse demo"></p>

<h2 id="doc-and-source">Doc and source</h2>

<p>Reveal can show you documentation and sources for various runtime values — namespaces, vars, symbols, functions, keywords (if they define a spec). Like <a href="https://cljdoc.org/">cljdoc</a>, it supports <code>[[wikilink]]</code> syntax in docstrings to refer to other vars, making them accessible for further exploration.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/doc-and-source.gif" alt="Doc and source demo"></p>

<h2 id="ref-watchers">Ref watchers</h2>
<p>Reveal can watch any object implementing <code>clojure.lang.IRef</code> (things like atoms, agents, vars, refs) and display it either automatically updated or as a log of successors.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/watchers.gif" alt="Ref watchers demo"></p>

<h2 id="charts">Charts</h2>

<p>Reveal can show data of particular shapes as charts that are usually explorable: when you find an interesting data point on the chart, you can then further inspect the data in that data point.</p>

<p>The simplest shape is labeled numbers. Labeled means that those numbers exist in some collection that has a unique label for every number. For maps, keys are labels, for sequential collections, indices are labels and for sets, numbers themselves are labels.</p>

<p>A pie chart shows labeled numbers:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/pie-chart.gif" alt="Pie chart demo"></p>

<p>Other charts support more flexible data shapes — both because they can show more than one data series, and because they can be explored, where it might be useful to attach some metadata with the number. Since JVM numbers don’t allow metadata, you can instead use tuples where the first item is a number and second is the metadata. Bar charts can display labeled numbers (single data series) or labeled numbers that are themselves labeled (multiple data series):</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/bar-chart.gif" alt="Bar chart demo"></p>

<p>Line charts are useful to display progressions, so Reveal suggests them to display sequential numbers (and labeled sequential numbers):</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/line-chart.gif" alt="Line chart demo"></p>

<p>Finally, Reveal has scatter charts to display coordinates on a 2D plane. A coordinate is represented as a tuple of 2 numbers and as with numbers, you can use a tuple of coordinate and arbitrary value in the place of coordinate. Reveal will suggest scatter charts for collections of coordinates and labeled collections of coordinates.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/scatter-chart.gif" alt="Scatter chart demo"></p>

<h2 id="table-view">Table view</h2>

<p>There are cases where it is better to make sense of the value when it is represented by a table: collections of homogeneous items where columns make it easier to compare corresponding parts of those items, and big deeply nested data structures where it’s easier to look at them layer by layer.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/table.gif" alt="Table view demo"></p>

<h2 id="and-more">…and more</h2>

<p>Reveal was designed to be performant: it can stream syntax-highlighted output very fast. In addition to that, there are various helpers for data inspection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>text search that is triggered by <kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl F</kbd>;</li>
  <li>out of the box <a href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/deep-diff2">lambdaisland’s deep-diff</a> output highlighting: all you need to do is have it on the classpath;</li>
  <li>various contextual actions:
    <ul>
      <li>deref derefable things;</li>
      <li>get meta if a selected value has some meta;</li>
      <li>convert java array to vector;</li>
      <li>view the color of a thing that describes a color (like <code>"#fff"</code> or <code>:red</code>);</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="ui-concepts-and-navigation">UI concepts and navigation</h2>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/concepts.png" alt="Concepts"></p>

<p>Reveal UI is made of 3 components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>output panel that contains data submitted to reveal window (e.g. repl output);</li>
  <li>a context menu that can invoke actions on selected values;</li>
  <li>results panel that has 1 or more tabs with action results produced from the context menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Navigation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd> or right mouse button to open a context menu on selection;</li>
  <li>Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch focus between output and results panel;</li>
  <li>In results panel:
    <ul>
      <li>Use <kbd>Ctrl ←</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl →</kbd> to switch tabs in results panel;</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the tab</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In a context menu:
    <ul>
      <li>Use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move focus between available actions and input text field;</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute selected action or form written in the text field;</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the context menu.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>

<p>Reveal can be customized using <code>vlaaad.reveal.prefs</code> java property that contains an edn map of UI preferences. Supported keys (all optional):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>:theme</code> — color theme, <code>:light</code> or <code>:dark</code>;</li>
  <li><code>:font-family</code> — system font name (like <code>"Consolas"</code>) or URL (like <code>"file:/path/to/font.ttf"</code> or <code>"https://ff.static.1001fonts.net/u/b/ubuntu.mono.ttf"</code>) — reveal only supports monospaced fonts;</li>
  <li><code>:font-size</code> — font size, number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>clj <span>-A</span>:reveal <span>\</span>
<span>-J-Dvlaaad</span>.reveal.prefs<span>=</span><span>'{:font-family "Consolas" :font-size 15}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-m</span> vlaaad.reveal repl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="user-api">User API</h2>

<p>The main entry point to Reveal is <code>vlaaad.reveal</code> ns that has various repls and lower-level functionality for data inspection.</p>

<h3 id="repl"><code>repl</code></h3>

<p>It is a repl wraps <code>clojure.main/repl</code> with additional support for <code>:repl/quit</code> and <code>tap&gt;</code>. It is as simple as it gets. I use it all the time. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>clj <span>-A</span>:reveal <span>-m</span> vlaaad.reveal repl
<span># Reveal window appears</span>
Clojure 1.10.1
<span>user</span><span>=&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="io-prepl"><code>io-prepl</code></h3>

<p>This prepl works like <code>clojure.core.server/io-prepl</code>. Its purpose is to be run in a process on your machine that you want to connect to using another prepl-aware tool. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>clj <span>-A</span>:reveal <span>\</span>
<span>-J-Dclojure</span>.server.reveal<span>=</span><span>'{:port 5555 :accept vlaaad.reveal/io-prepl}'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now you can connect to this process using any socket repl and it will show a Reveal window for every connection:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>nc localhost 5555
<span># reveal window appears</span>
<span>(</span>+ 1 2 3<span>)</span> <span># input</span>
<span>{</span>:tag :ret, :val <span>"6"</span>, :ns <span>"user"</span>, :ms 1, :form <span>"(+ 1 2 3)"</span><span>}</span> <span># output</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="remote-prepl"><code>remote-prepl</code></h3>

<p>Reveal is the most useful when it runs in the process where the development happens. This prepl, unlike the previous two, is not like that: it connects to a remote process and shows a window for values that arrived from the network. It can’t benefit from easy access to printed references because these references are pointing to values deserialized from bytes, not values in the target VM. It’s still nice and performant repl, and it’s useful when you want to use Reveal to talk to another process that does not have Reveal on the classpath (e.g. production or ClojureScript prepl).</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start a prepl without Reveal on the classpath:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.764"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-J-Dclojure</span>.server.cljs-prepl<span>=</span><span>'{:port 50505 :accept cljs.server.browser/prepl}'</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Connect to that prepl using Reveal:
    <div><div><pre><code>$ clj -A:reveal -m vlaaad.reveal remote-prepl :port 50505
# at this point, 2 things happen:
# 1. Browser window with cljs prepl appears
# 2. Reveal window opens

# input
js/window

# output
{:tag :ret, 
 :val #object [Window [object Window]], 
 :ns "cljs.user", 
 :ms 25, 
 :form "js/window"}
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ui"><code>ui</code></h3>

<p>Calling this function will create and show a Reveal window. It returns a function that you can submit values to — they will appear in the output panel. All built-in visual repls are thin wrappers of other repls that submit values to a window created by this generic function. You can use it to create custom Reveal-flavored repls, or, instead of using it as a repl, you can configure Reveal to only show tapped values.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>require</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>[</span><span>vlaaad.reveal</span><span> </span><span>:as</span><span> </span><span>reveal</span><span>])</span><span>

</span><span>;; open a window that will show tapped values:</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>add-tap</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>reveal/ui</span><span>))</span><span>

 </span><span>;; submit value to the window:</span><span>
</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div></div>

        <p>Today Apple announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2020/">at their media event</a> that the final public release of iOS 14 ships tomorrow, which came as quite a shock to all third-party developers.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>This unwelcome surprise comes against the backdrop of dozens of controversies around the App Store — most recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust">Hey.com</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games-account">Epic</a>, but more generally its <a href="https://marco.org/2020/09/11/app-review-changes">painfully confusing</a> and <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/05/10/heads_up_to_rss_reader_authors">arbitrarily applied</a> rules, its incomprehensible <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/rejection/">app rejections</a> and their often sudden retractions, app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/07/flexbright-adjust-display-temperature/">approvals followed by sudden removals</a> without explanation, and the general unequal treatment of developers where <a href="https://gizmodo.com/researchers-uber-s-ios-app-had-secret-permissions-that-1819177235">big companies</a> or favorites <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/02/27/bbedit-12-6-to-return-to-the-mac-app-store/">get special treatment</a>. It leaves me wondering, what the hell is Apple’s strategy here? This is not a flurry of bad PR for the sake of it. There are serious problems here that need to be addressed — in particular, Developer Relations.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p>Historically, these events announce new hardware and the upcoming release of the next major version of iOS, which is typically made public a few days later or the following week. For as long as I can remember it goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple hosts a media event on a Tuesday in September.</li>
  <li>Announcements include new iPhones, iPads, and Watches. Or, at least some combination of those. Maybe something about Apple TV.</li>
  <li>All of the new hardware will run the latest version of iOS (or watchOS, or tvOS).</li>
  <li>The next major release of iOS is announced to be shipping on Friday (in a few days) or sometime the following week, like the next Tuesday.</li>
</ul>

<p>But today, Apple announced that iOS 14 is shipping <strong>tomorrow</strong>. This was near the end of the event — at roughly 11:00 AM Pacific time. This means West Coast developers have half a day to put the final touches on their app updates for iOS 14 <strong>AND</strong> get their apps submitted with the just-released Xcode 12 GM <strong>AND</strong> get through App Store review. None of those tasks are trivial, and no one familiar with them would agree that this is a sufficient amount of time to complete them. If you happen to be working on the East Coast, this means you were given just a few hours before the working day was over to get your app ready and submitted. And if you live in Europe or anywhere else in the world, well, go fuck yourself and good luck tomorrow!</p>

<p>On top of this, critical bugs still exist in the latest releases of the SDKs, Xcode 12, and iOS 14. It seems they will not be addressed.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p>Given the increasingly tenuous relationship that Apple has with developers, I do not understand how it could be in their interest to act like such an asshole right now. Not to mention, it is unlikely that they will even be able to review all of these app submissions in time. We already do not feel valued due to the aforementioned issues, and this is an outright negligent response to developer relationships the company has damaged over the past few years. Announcing that iOS 14 ships tomorrow with virtually no notice to developers is yet another breach of trust, another disappointment, and quite frankly feels like a big ‘fuck you’ to developers. What purpose does it serve to place this last-minute, unnecessary stress on third-party developers?</p>

<p>Who is in charge of iOS releases at Apple that thought this was a good idea? Who is the head of Developer Relations that thought this was a good idea?</p>

<p>To whomever made these decisions: <strong>y’all fucked up. Again.</strong></p>

September 15, 2020 | https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt12/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt12/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt11">last post</a> I ended by saying we
would be able to use <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a> to generate some simple tunes.
In this post we will actually put that to the test. Click the video to hear the end result :)</p><p>Brother John / Frère Jacques is a popular nursing rhyme, and also one of the few things I was taught
to play on the piano as a kid. As such, I thought it’d be fitting to try to code this song this time.
The notes for playing this are taken from <a href="https://www.true-piano-lessons.com/frere-jacques.html">true-piano-lessons.com</a>.
The code takes the notes starting in the key of C. (Maybe since it’s in Go, I should have started in G. Feel free to change it).</p><p>In the previous posts, we actually ignored the problem of turning notes into frequencies.
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a> works with given frequencies. So we’ll need to
first implement a way to turn the notes into frequencies. For this, I came up with a somewhat
hackish solution but I didn’t know a better way other than hardcoding it.</p><p>As we’re making the music using the equal-tempered scale we can calculate the frequencies for each
note given a reference frequency. I’m using <code>middle C</code> as the reference frequency, which can be
derived from <code>concert A (A440</code>) in this way: <code>middleC = (concertA * math.Pow(2, 3/12)) / 2</code>.</p><p>To follow along with how we derive the frequencies for each note, I suggest taking a look at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">wikipedia</a>. The basic idea however is that we have
12 semitones in an octave, so for each octave we have to generate the 12 semitones based off a
reference frequency. Confusingly however, an octave starts at <code>C</code> and not at <code>A</code>. (it does loop
around) so we get: <code>C D E F G A B</code>. Each time we loop around and get back to C, we move up one
octave (meaning higher frequency, thus higher pitch).</p><p>You can view a table of all frequencies from C0 (C at octave 0) up to B8 (B at octave 8)
<a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html">here</a>.</p><p>The code for this is a bit hacky, so if you have a better way please let me know! :-)</p><p>Here I am generating in both the fourth and fifth octave, from C4 -&gt; B5. If we print the map
generated by this code we get (abbreviated)</p><p>Also note that I have added <code>WAIT</code> with frequency 0 in there. This is a bit hacky (and unnecessary
in Go). I’ve added this so we can have some more wait time between playing different sections of the song.
As the default-zero value of a float is zero, and because you can access a map safely even when a
key is missing, this was not necessary. We could just call the map with the <code>WAIT</code> key even if it
wasn’t inserted and our result would still be correct.</p><p>If you’re reading this, there’s a pretty good chance you know this. But I wanted to highlight it, as
I think this is a pretty cool feature of Go! Yet, in this case, I chose to be explicit about the
intend of the <code>WAIT</code> note.</p><p>Alright, so we have our notes and our frequencies associated with them. We still need to actually
generate a wave. For this I’ve introduced the convenience function “play” which takes a few
parameters and returns a frame:</p><p>This is quite similar to the past about
<a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io.posts/audio-from-scratch-pt10.md">ADSR</a>, and just as in that post we
will apply the ADSR envelope to the signal here as well. Notice that ‘play’ takes a <code>LookupOscillator</code>.
In the previous post we’ve build a few of these for generating sine waves, triangle, square, etc.</p><p>This function tells us, play a note for a certain duration (in seconds) with a given oscillator, and
return a slice of frames. This function allowed me to quickly change the type of wave, and play
around with the result of playing different notes for different timespans.</p><p>Getting the ADSR envelope to sound like I wanted to was honestly the goold old way of trial and error. 😅.</p><p>Finally we have everything ready to compose the song. The below code is definitely not pretty, but it gets the job done!
First we generate the notes, then we create a wave table of a shape that we’d like. We
plug this into an Oscillator, and then we start calling the <code>Play</code> function with the notes that we
need.</p><p>For convenience I’ve added some variables to easily adapt the duration of sections of the song.
Variables, yeah!</p><div><div>

September 15, 2020 | https://www.ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    
<p>After several posts discussing different aspects of IT as a whole, I would like to start discussing another thread of thinking: software architecture. This is a huge topic and I pondered for quite a while where to start. Finally, I decided to start with debunking the long-lived architectural myth of reusability because this makes it easier to understand some of the ideas that I will discuss in later posts.</p>
<p>Reusability is a recurring topic that I discuss for lots of years meanwhile:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of my first public talks discussed reusability <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>I wrote an article about reusability for a (German) IT journal at the same time.</li>
<li>Some years later I published a <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2015/10/the-broken-promise-of-re-use/">post</a> discussing reusability on the blog of <a href="https://www.codecentric.de/">codecentric AG</a>.</li>
<li>I discuss this topic in many of my talks and workshops, especially in the context of service design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, all these places only discuss selected aspects of the reusability fallacy. Here I try to brings those aspects together and discuss reusability in a more comprehensive way – probably still missing some relevant facets.</p>
<h2 id="the-fallacy">The fallacy</h2>
<p>Reusability is sort of a holy grail in software architecture and design for many years. The discussion about reusable software modules <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> gained momentum in the early 1970s. E.g., the seminal computer science paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5388187">“Structured design”</a> by Stevens, Myers and Constantine from 1974 already discussed reusability as one of the goals of structured design. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>This discussion persists until today. And admittedly, the idea is intriguing: I create a software module once and as there are basically no reproduction costs in software, I can reuse it at no cost in as many places as I want. Invest once, harvest forever. What an efficiency lever! What a cost saver!</p>
<p>Hence, it is not surprising that generations of IT managers demand reusability as essential design goal, and their high priests, the architects in return try hard to deliver reusability. Over time this yearning for reusability has become independent. Nobody asks anymore if reusability makes sense in the given context. Reusability is important. Period!</p>
<p>Eventually, it even turned around: architects discovered that they can use reusability as a powerful sales argument for the introduction of new architectural paradigms. It was not necessary that they proved their claim. Simply arguing with reusability was enough to convince IT managers of the new paradigm. The typical reasoning was (and still is) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We definitely need to invest in implementing &lt;shiny new paradigm&gt;. I know this does not create any business value now, but it allows to create <strong>reusable</strong> &lt;building blocks of paradigm&gt;! This way, we will have to pay a lot less for future projects, they will be a lot faster and we will be a lot more flexible. <em>The investment will pay for itself in no time!</em>â€�</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From all that I have seen in my IT career, it never worked this way – and I am very sure, it also never will work in the future.</p>
<h2 id="a-deeply-industrial-belief">A deeply industrial belief</h2>
<p>The reason why it never works this way, has several facets. First of all, reusability is a deeply industrial belief. In the physical world, reusability is mostly interchangeable with standardization. Standardized parts support building the product at a lower price and can easily be reused in multiple products. On the other hand, any part that is designed with reusability in mind is a candidate for becoming a standardized part.</p>
<p>The key aspect of reusability/standardization in the physical world is that it helps to save costs over time. You need to spend the efforts to design the part only once. The production process needs to be designed and set up only once. The required tooling needs to be created and installed only once. Afterwards you can produce as many copies of the part as you like without having to repeat the design and setup investments.</p>
<p>This way, reusability helps satisfying the key success criterion of <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/markets/#industrial-markets">industrial markets</a>: scale production in a cost-efficient way. A big part of the cost savings comes from the production of the parts, that you can produce lots of them without having to design and set up the production process and tooling over and over again.</p>
<p>If you additionally create the part in a way that it can be (re)used in different contexts, you can produce an even higher quantity which helps spreading the fixed costs for design and setup even further, i.e., the part becomes even cheaper (in terms of costs, not quality).</p>
<p>Thus, consistently aiming for reusability makes a lot of sense in the physical world where you create houses, bridges, furniture, electronic devices, etc. from reusable parts. But transferring this idea of cost savings via reusability to software development is riddled with several caveats.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-is-part-of-design-not-production">Implementation is part of design, not production</h2>
<p>The first persistent misunderstanding is that writing code can be compared to building a house or assembling a car. The idea is that software architecture and design work can be compared to designing a car or house and writing code is executing the plan, i.e., assembling the final product.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this perception is completely wrong. The final product in software development is the executable program. We usually create it by compiling the source code <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. In other words: IT has the probably most efficient production process imaginable for more than 60 years meanwhile – so efficient, that we usually completely forget about it.</p>
<p>Today, this production process typically is a step in a CI/CD pipeline, but it does not change the fact that we build our products in an extremely efficient way without any human intervention.</p>
<p>Writing code on the other hand is completing the design. The product design is only completed after the last line of source code is written. Writing code is like adding the details of a car design, designing the details of the shape, the interior design, the power transmission and so on – everything that needs to be done <em>before</em> a car can be produced. Producing the actual product, the executable program from the code is negligible in terms of time, costs and effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing code is completing the design.</p>
<p>Building the product from the completed design is just issuing a command (and has nothing to do with writing code).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, all those metaphors that compare writing code with assembling a car or building a house are wrong.</p>
<p>This also means that the assumption derived from the physical world breaks that we can save lots of money in the production process by using reusable parts. The production process in IT is already unbelievable cheap compared to any physical domain. Additionally, we can produce as many copies of a part at basically zero cost: it is called the copy command.</p>
<p>Accordingly, all considerations that are based on the value of reusability in the physical world do not work in IT as reusability in software development does not help to save money in the production process.</p>
<h2 id="the-inherent-lack-of-standardization-in-it">The inherent lack of standardization in IT</h2>
<p>This still leaves room for efficiency gains through reusability in the design process. To (mis)use the metaphor of automobiles once more: Many car manufacturers use a platform strategy these days, i.e., they reuse a lot of standardized base parts in their car designs. E.g., they do not design the engines or chassis from scratch for every new model they design, but reuse engines or chassis from their platform, complementing them with parts individually designed for the specific model.</p>
<p>While this platform approach of reusing parts again primarily targets cost savings on the production side (which is not relevant in IT, as we have seen in the last section), it probably also helps to reduce time, costs and effort in the design process.</p>
<p>We can apply this idea to software development: The more reusable parts we can use in our design, i.e., software development process, the more time, costs and effort we can probably save.</p>
<p>This is where another peculiarity of IT strikes.</p>
<p>In his famous essay <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220477127_No_Silver_Bullet_Essence_and_Accidents_of_Software_Engineering">“No silver bullet”</a> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, Fred Brooks reasons about essential and accidental complexity in software development. One of the drivers of essential complexity he lists is “complexity”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complexity. Software entities are more complex for their size than perhaps any other human construct, because no two parts are alike (at least above the statement level). If they are, we make the two similar parts into one, a subroutine, open or closed. In this respect software systems differ profoundly from computers, buildings, or automobiles, where repeated elements abound. […] Likewise, a scaling-up of a software entity is not merely a repetition of the same elements in larger size; it is necessarily an increase in the number of different elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, Brooks clearly rejects the idea that we can design a software solution from a set of higher-level standardized building blocks in the same way as we can design a wall by arranging the same type of brick multiple times. Each part we use will be different from all other parts.</p>
<p>Yet, while making the case against standardized building blocks, Brooks still leaves room for reuse: he states each part in our solution will be different, but we may use a part several times from higher-level contexts. Following this idea, we reuse lower-level functionalities to support higher-level functionalities.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-left-for-reusability">What is left for reusability</h2>
<p>In this post, I tried to deconstruct a part of the reusability fallacy: the fallacy that we can save lots of money from a more efficient production process by using standardized, reusable parts. Software development is all about design. The design is only completed after the last line of code is written.</p>
<p>The actual production process, i.e., creating the executable program, is so efficient and cheap that there is nothing left to save. Thus, all the reusability approaches that take concepts from the physical world and try to apply them to software development do not work.</p>
<p>We are left with efficiency gains in the design process itself due to the use of reusable parts. In the <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_2/">next part of this little series</a> …</p></div></div>

  <section><p>Kontrast is a contrast checker available for desktop and mobile devices. You can
use Kontrast to choose background and text color combinations for your website or
app that your users will find easy to read. Kontrast can help you improve the
accessibility for your site or app for people with vision problems.</p>

<p>Kontrast won’t catch all the problems, but it should still be very helpful to catch
many issues early on, when designing your interface.</p>

<p>I released the first version of Kontrast earlier this month.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kde.org/screenshots/kontrast/kontrast.png" alt="Kontrast main page"></p>

<p>Another big feature of Kontrast is the possibility to generate random color
combinations with good contrast. These colors can be saved in the application itself,
so that you can keep a particularly good color combination for later use.</p>

<p>Kontrast is available for the Linux desktop, <a href="https://plasma-mobile.org/">Plasma Mobile</a> and
there is also a Beta version for Android.</p>

<p>This application is built using the excellent <a href="https://develop.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami">Kirigami</a>
framework.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kde.org/screenshots/kontrast/kontrat_mobile.png" alt="Kontrast mobile view"></p>

<p>You can download and install Kontrast from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.kde.kontrast">Flathub</a> and
a nightly build is also available <a href="https://binary-factory.kde.org/job/Kontrast_android/">in binary factory</a>.</p>

<p>The tarball is available <a href="https://download.kde.org/stable/kontrast/kontrast-1.0.2.tar.xz">here</a>
and is signed with my gpg key <a href="https://carlschwan.eu/gpg.html">14B0ED91B5783415D0AA1E0A06B35D38387B67BE</a>.</p>

<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>

<p>Future plans include improving the Android build, possibly release a stable
build of the Android version and also create a QtQuick-based color picker
that is better integrated with the application.</p>

September 15, 2020 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-5/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-5/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-4/">previous</a></em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. Last time, we added some
primitive unary instructions like <code>add1</code> and <code>integer-&gt;char</code>. This time, we’re
going to add some primitive <em>binary</em> functions like <code>+</code> and <code>&lt;</code>. After this
post, we’ll be able to compile programs like:</p>



<p>Note that these expressions may look like function calls but, like last
chapter, they are not opening new stack frames (which I’ll explain more about
later). Instead, the compiler will recognize that the programmer is directly
applying the symbol <code>+</code> and generate special code. You can think about this
kind of like an inlined function call.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that the compiler has a certain internal contract:
the result of any given compiled expression is stored in <code>rax</code>. This isn’t some
intrinsic property of all compilers, but it’s one we’ve kept so far in this
series.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is similar to but not the same as the calling convention that I
mentioned earlier, where function results are stored in <code>rax</code>. That calling
convention is for interacting with other people’s code. Within your own
generated code, there are no rules. So we could pick any other register,
really, for storing intermediate results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we’re building primitive functions that can take two arguments, you
might notice a problem: our strategy of storing the result in <code>rax</code> won’t work
on its own. If we were to naïvely write something like the following to

<p>We could try and work around this by adding some kind of register allocation
algorithm and take advantage of <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, etc. Or, simpler, we could decide
to allocate all intermediate values on the stack and move on with our lives. I
prefer the latter. It’s simpler.</p>

<h3 id="stack-background-info">Stack background info</h3>

<p>Since we can’t yet save our compiled programs to disk, there’s some amount of
setup that has to happen before they’re run. Right now, the C programs I’m
providing along with this series compile to binaries that just run the test
suites for the compiler. They don’t actually run full programs. For this
reason, there are already some call frames on the stack by the time our
generated code is run.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the stack at the moment we enter a compiled Lisp program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>|                  | High addresses
+------------------+
|  main            |
+------------------+ |
|  ~ some data ~   | |
|  ~ some data ~   | |
+------------------+ |
|  compile_test    | |
+------------------+ |
|  ~ some data ~   | |
|  ~ some data ~   | v
+------------------+
|  Testing_exe...  | rsp (stack pointer)
+------------------+
|                  | &lt;-- Our frame!
|                  | Low addresses
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this diagram, we have the C program’s <code>main</code> function, which has its own
local variables and so on. Then the <code>main</code> function calls the <code>compile_test</code>
unit suite. This in turn calls this <code>Testing_execute_expr</code> function
(abbreviated in the diagram), which is responsible for calling into our
generated code. Every call stores the return address (some place to find the
next instruction to execute) on the stack and adjusts <code>rsp</code> down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Refresher: the call stack grows <em>down</em>. Why? Check out this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54391533/569183">StackOverflow
answer</a> that quotes an architect
on the Intel 4004 and 8080 architectures. It’s stayed the same ever since.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this diagram, we have <code>rsp</code> pointing at a return address somewhere inside
the function <code>Testing_execute_expr</code>, since that’s what called our Lisp
entrypoint. We have some data “above” (higher addresses) <code>rsp</code> that we’re not
allowed to poke at, and we have this empty space “below” (lower addresses)
<code>rsp</code> that is in our current <em>stack frame</em>. I say “empty” because we haven’t
yet stored anything there, not because it’s necessarily zero-ed out.  I don’t
think there are any guarantees about the values in this stack frame.</p>

<p>We can use our stack frame to write and read values for our current Lisp
program. With every recursive subexpression, we can allocate a little more
stack space to keep track of the values. When I say “allocate”, I mean
“subtract from the stack pointer”, because the stack is already a contiguous
space in memory allocated for us. For example, here is how we can write to the
stack:</p>



<p>This puts the integer <code>4</code> at displacement <code>-8</code> from <code>rsp</code>. On the stack diagram
above, it would be at the slot labeled “Our frame”. It’s also possible to read
with a positive or zero displacement, but those point to previous stack frames
and the return address, respectively. So let’s avoid manipulating those.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that I used a multiple of 8. Not every store has to be a to an address
that is a multiple of 8, but it is natural and I think also <em>faster</em> to store
8-byte-sized things at aligned addresses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s walk through a real example to get more hands-on experience with this
stack storage idea. We’ll use the program <code>(+ 1 2)</code>. The compiled version of
that program should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move <code>compile(2)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>rax</code> into <code>[rsp-8]</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>compile(1)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Add <code>[rsp-8]</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So after compiling that, the stack will look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>|                  | High addresses
+------------------+
|  Testing_exe...  | RSP
+------------------+
|  0x8             | RSP-8 (result of compile(2))
|                  | Low addresses
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the result will be in <code>rax</code>, per our internal compiler contract.</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but at some point we’ll need our compiled programs
to emit the <code>push</code> instruction or make function calls of their own. Both of
these modify the stack pointer. <code>push</code> writes to the stack and decrements
<code>rsp</code>. <code>call</code> is roughly equivalent to <code>push</code> followed by <code>jmp</code>.</p>

<p>For that reason, x86-64 comes with another register called <code>rbp</code> and it’s
designed to hold the Base Pointer. While the stack pointer is supposed to track
the “top” (low address) of the stack, the base pointer is meant to keep a
pointer around to the “bottom” (high address) of our current stack frame.</p>

<p>This is why in a lot of compiled code you see the following instructions
repeated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>myfunction:</span>
<span>push</span> <span>rbp</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>rsp</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span>  <span>; optional; allocate stack space for locals</span>
<span>; ... function body ...</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>rsp</span><span>,</span> <span>rbp</span>  <span>; required if you subtracted from rsp above</span>
<span>pop</span> <span>rbp</span>
<span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first three instructions, called the <em>prologue</em>, save <code>rbp</code> to the stack,
and then set <code>rbp</code> to the current stack pointer. Then it’s possible to maintain
steady references to variable locations on the stack even as <code>rsp</code> changes.
Yes, the compiler could adjust its internal table of references every time the
compiler emits code that modifies <code>rsp</code>, but that sounds much harder.</p>

<p>The last three instructions, called the <em>epilogue</em>, fetch the old <code>rbp</code> that we
saved to the stack, write it back into <code>rbp</code>, then exit the call.</p>

<p>To confirm this for yourself, check out this <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/qPM8Mh">sample compiled C
code</a>. Look at the disassembly following the
label <code>square</code>. Prologue, code, epilogue.</p>

<h3 id="stack-allocation-infrastructure">Stack allocation infrastructure</h3>

<p>Until now, we haven’t needed to keep track of much as we recursively traverse
expression trees. Now, in order to keep track of how much space on the stack
any given compiled code will need, we have to add more state to our compiler.
We’ll call this state the <code>stack_index</code> — Ghuloum calls it <code>si</code> — and we’ll
pass it around as a parameter. Whatever it’s called, it points to the first
writable (unused) index in the stack at any given point.</p>

<p>In compiled functions, the first writable index is <code>-kWordSize</code> (<code>-8</code>), since
the base pointers is already at <code>0</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_function</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Buffer_write_arr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kFunctionPrologue</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>kFunctionPrologue</span><span>);</span>
  <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>node</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>kWordSize</span><span>));</span>
  <span>Buffer_write_arr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kFunctionEpilogue</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>kFunctionEpilogue</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve also gone ahead and added the prologue and epilogue. They’re stored in
static arrays. This makes them easier to modify, and also makes them accessible
to testing helpers. The testing helpers can use these arrays to make testing
easier for us — we can check if our expected code is book-ended by this code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>byte</span> <span>kFunctionPrologue</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// push rbp</span>
    <span>0x55</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// mov rbp, rsp</span>
    <span>kRexPrefix</span><span>,</span> <span>0x89</span><span>,</span> <span>0xe5</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>byte</span> <span>kFunctionEpilogue</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// pop rbp</span>
    <span>0x5d</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// ret</span>
    <span>0xc3</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For <code>Compile_expr</code>, we just pass this new stack index through.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_pair</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Compile_call</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>AST_pair_car</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>),</span> <span>AST_pair_cdr</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>),</span>
                        <span>stack_index</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And for <code>Compile_call</code>, we actually get to use it. Let’s look back at our stack
storage strategy for compiling <code>(+ 1 2)</code> (now replacing <code>rsp</code> with <code>rbp</code>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move <code>compile(2)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>rax</code> into <code>[rbp-8]</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>compile(1)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Add <code>[rbp-8]</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For binary functions, this can be generalized to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compile <code>arg2</code> (stored in <code>rax</code>)</li>
  <li>Move <code>rax</code> to <code>stack_index</code></li>
  <li>Compile <code>arg1</code> (stored in <code>rax</code>)</li>
  <li>Do something with the results (in <code>[rbp-stack_index]</code> and <code>rax</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The key is this: for the first recursive call to <code>Compile_expr</code>, the compiler
is allowed to emit code that can use the current <code>stack_index</code> and anything
below that on the stack. For the <em>second</em> recursive call to <code>Compile_expr</code>, the
compiler has to bump <code>stack_index</code>, since we’ve stored the result of the first
compiled call at <code>stack_index</code>.</p>

<p>Take a look at our implementation of binary add:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_call</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span>

September 15, 2020 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/bazel-for-libraries-distribution-an-open-source-library-author-perspective/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/bazel-for-libraries-distribution-an-open-source-library-author-perspective/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past a few days, I’ve been experimenting with Bazel as a library distribution mechanism for <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a>.</p>

<p>I am pretty familiar with hermetic build systems at this point. My main knowledge comes from Buck dating 8 years back. At that time, it never occurred to me such a build system could eventually be a library distribution mechanism. During the same 8 years, NPM has taken over the world. New language-dependent package managers such as Go module, Cargo and Swift Package Manager popularized the concept of using the public repositories (GitHub) as the dependency references. Languages prior to this period, mainly C / C++ are moving to this direction, slowly.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a> has a simple autoconf based feature detection / configuration system. You would expect the package to work when <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code>. However, it never made any serious attempt to be too smart. My initial experience with monorepos at companies strongly influenced the decision to have a simple build system. I fully expect that serious consumers will vendor the library into their monorepo using their own build systems.</p>

<p>This has been true for the past a few years. But as I am finishing up <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> and increasingly using that for other closed-source personal projects, maintaining a closed-source <em>monorepo</em> setup for my personal projects while upstreaming fixes is quite an unpleasant experience. On the other hand, <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> from the beginning meant to be a low-level implementation. I am expected to have high-level language bindings at some point. Given that I am doing more application-related development with <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> in closed-source format now, it feels like the right time.</p>

<p>Although there is no one-true library distribution mechanism for C / C++, there are contenders. From the good-old apt / rpm, to Conan, which has gained some mind-share in the open-source world in recent years.</p>

<p>The choice of Bazel is not accidental. I’ve been doing <a href="https://liuliu.me/eyes/migrating-ios-project-to-bazel-a-real-world-experience/">some Swift development with Bazel</a> and the experience has been positive. Moreover, the choice of high-level binding language for <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a>, I figured, would be Swift.</p>

<h2 id="configure">Configure</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a>’s build process, as much as I would rather not, is host-dependent. I use autoconf to detect system-wide libraries such as libjpeg and libpng, to configure proper compiler options. Although <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a> can be used with zero dependency, in that configuration, it can sometimes be slow.</p>

<p>Coming from the monorepo background, Bazel doesn’t have many utilities that are as readily available as in autoconf. You can write automatic configurations in Starlark as <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/repository_rules.html">repository rules</a>, but there is no good documentation on how to write robust ones.</p>

<p>I ended up <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/blob/unstable/WORKSPACE#L25">letting whoever use ccv to decide how they are going to enable certain features</a>. For things like CUDA, such configuration is not tenable. I ended up copying over <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/rules_cuda">TensorFlow’s CUDA rules</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>Good old C / C++ libraries are notoriously indifferent to libraries dependencies v.s. toolchains. Autoconf detects both toolchain configurations as well as available libraries. These types of host dependencies make cross-compilation a skill in itself.</p>

<p>Bazel is excellent for in-tree dependencies. For out-tree dependencies however, there is no established mechanism. The popular way is to write a <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/protobuf_deps.bzl#L5">repository rules to load relevant dependencies</a>.</p>

<p>This actually works well for me. It is versatile enough to handle cases that <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/blob/unstable/config/ccv.bzl#L103">have Bazel integrations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/dflat/blob/unstable/deps.bzl#L17">have no Bazel integrations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="consume-bazel-dependencies">Consume Bazel Dependencies</h2>

<p>Consumption of the packaged Bazel dependencies then becomes as simple as adding <code>git_repository</code> to the <code>WORKSPACE</code> and call proper <code>&lt;your_library_name&gt;_deps()</code> repository rule.</p>

<p>After packaging <a href="https://libccv.org/">ccv</a> with Bazel, now <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/WORKSPACE#L3">Swift for nnc can consume the packaged dependency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-versioning-challenges">Semantic Versioning Challenges</h2>

<p>While the Bazel-provided library distribution mechanism works well for my case, it is simplistic. For one, there is really no good way to do <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. It is understandable. Coming from a monorepo culture, it is challenging for anyone to dive into dependency hells of library versioning. A <a href="https://donatstudios.com/Go-v2-Modules">slightly different story happened to Go</a> a while back as well.</p>

<p>It is messy if you want to pin a specific version of the library while your dependencies are not agreeing with you. This is going to be messy regardless in C / C++ world, unless you prelink these extremely carefully. Bazel’s philosophy from what I can see, seems largely on <em>keeping the trunk working</em> side. It is working so far, but one has to wonder whether this can scale if more libraries adopted Bazel as the distribution mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h2>

<p>The past a few months experience with Bazel has been delightful. While I would continue to use language specific tools (pip, Go modules, Cargo, NPM) when doing development in that particular language, Bazel is a capable choice for me when doing cross-language development. Concepts such as <code>workspace</code>, <code>git_repository</code>, <code>http_archive</code> fit well within the larger open-source ecosystem. And most surprisingly, it works for many-repo setup if you ever need to.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

					<p>A friend once said to me: <q>You know, to some people, C is just a bunch of macros that expand to assembly</q>. It’s been years ago (smartasses: it was also before <tt>llvm</tt>, ok?), but the sentence stuck with me. Do <em>Kernighan and Ritchie</em> really look at a C program and see assembly code? Does <em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> surf the Web any differently than you and me? And what on earth <em>did</em> <em>Keanu Reeves</em> see when he looked at all of that funky green gibberish soup, anyway? No, seriously, what the heck <em>did</em> he see there?! Uhm, back to the program. Anyway, what does Python look like in <em>Guido van Rossum</em>‘s<sup>1</sup> eyes?</p>
<p>This post marks the beginning of what should develop to a <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/tag/pythons-innards/">series</a> on Python’s internals, I’m writing it since I believe that explaining something is the best way to grok it, and I’d very much like to be able to visualize more of Python’s ‘funky green gibberish soup’ as I read Python code. On the curriculum is mainly <em>CPython</em>, mainly <em>py3k</em>, mainly <em>bytecode evaluation</em> (I’m not a big compilation fan) – but practically everything around executing Python and Python-like code (<em>Unladen Swallow</em>, <em>Jython</em>, <em>Cython</em>, etc) might turn out to be fair game in this series. For the sake of brevity and my sanity, when I say <em>Python</em>, I mean <em>CPython</em> unless noted otherwise. I also assume a POSIX-like OS or (if and where it matters) Linux, unless otherwise noted. You should read this if you want to know how Python works. You should read this if you want to contribute to CPython. You should read this to find all the mistakes I’ll make and snicker at me behind me back or write snide comments. I realize it’s just <em>your</em> particular way to show affection.</p>
<p>I gather I’ll glean pretty much everything I write about from Python’s source or, occasionally, other fine materials (documentation, especially <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/c-api/index.html">this</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/extending/index.html">that</a>, certain PyCon lectures, <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/05/07/searching-mailing-list-archives-offline/">searching</a> <a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev">python-dev</a>, etc). Everything is out there, but I do hope my efforts at putting it all in one place to which you can RSS-subscribe will make your journey easier. I assume the reader knows some C, some OS theory, a bit less than some assembly (any architecture), a bit more than some Python and has reasonable UNIX fitness (i.e., feels comfortable installing something from source). Don’t be afraid if you’re not reasonably conversant in one (or more) of these, but I can’t promise smooth sailing, either. Also, if you don’t have a working toolchain to do Python development, maybe you’d like to head over <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/04/08/contributing-to-python/">here</a> and do as it says on the second paragraph (and onwards, as relevant).</p>
<p>Let’s start with something which I assume you already know, but I think is important, at least to the main way I understand… well, everything that I do understand. I look at it as if I’m looking at a machine. It’s easy in Python’s case, since Python relies on a Virtual Machine to do what it does (like many other interpreted languages). Be certain you understand “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines">Virtual Machine</a>” correctly in this context: think more like JVM and less like VirtualBox (very technically, they’re the same, but in the real world we usually differentiate these two kinds of VMs). I find it easiest to understand “Virtual Machine” literally – it’s a machine built from software. Your CPU is just a complex electronic machine which receives all input (machine code, data), it has a state (registers), and based on the input and its state it will output stuff (to RAM or a Bus), right? Well, CPython is a machine built from software components that has a state and processes instructions (different implementations may use rather different instructions). This software machine operates in the process hosting the Python interpreter. Keep this in mind; I like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">machine</a> metaphor (as I explain in minute details <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/07/04/pythons-innards-for-my-wife/">here</a>).</p>
<p>That said, let’s start with a bird’s eye overview of what happens when you do this: <kbd>$ python -c 'print("Hello, world!")'</kbd>. Python’s binary is executed, the standard C library initialization which pretty much any process does happens and then the main function starts executing (see its source, <kbd>./Modules/python.c: main</kbd>, which soon calls <kbd>./Modules/main.c: Py_Main</kbd>). After some mundane initialization stuff (parse arguments, see if environment variables should affect behaviour, assess the situation of the standard streams and act accordingly, etc), <a href="http://docs.python.org/c-api/init.html#Py_Initialize">./Python/pythonrun.c: Py_Initialize</a> is called. In many ways, this function is what ‘builds’ and assembles together the pieces needed to run the CPython machine and makes ‘a process’ into ‘a process with a Python interpreter in it’. Among other things, it creates two very important Python data-structures: the <strong>interpreter state</strong> and <strong>thread state</strong>. It also creates the built-in <strong>module</strong> <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html">sys</a> and the module which hosts all <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#built-in-functions">builtins</a>. At a later post(s) we will cover all these in depth.</p>
<p>With these in place, Python will do one of several things based on how it was executed. Roughly, it will either execute a string (the <kbd>-c</kbd> option), execute a module as an executable (the <kbd>-m</kbd> option), or execute a file (passed explicitly on the commandline or passed by the kernel when used as an interpreter for a script) or run its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop">REPL</a> loop (this is more a special case of the file to execute being an interactive device). In the case we’re currently following, it will execute a single string, since we invoked it with <kbd>-c</kbd>. To execute this single string, <kbd>./Python/pythonrun.c: PyRun_SimpleStringFlags</kbd> is called. This function creates the <kbd>__main__</kbd> <strong>namespace</strong>, which is ‘where’ our string will be executed (if you run <kbd>$ python -c 'a=1; print(a)'</kbd>, where is <kbd>a</kbd> stored? in this namespace). After the namespace is created, the string is executed in it (or rather, interpreted or <em>evaluated</em> in it). To do that, you must first transform the string into something that machine can work on.</p>
<p>As I said, I’d rather not focus on the innards of Python’s parser/compiler at this time. I’m not a compilation expert, I’m not entirely interested in it, and as far as I know, Python doesn’t have significant Compiler-Fu beyond the basic CS compilation course. We’ll do a (very) fast overview of what goes on here, and may return to it later only to inspect visible CPython behaviour (see the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement">global</a> statement, which is said to affect parsing, for instance). So, the parser/compiler stage of <kbd>PyRun_SimpleStringFlags</kbd> goes largely like this: tokenize and create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_syntax_tree">Concrete Syntax Tree</a> (CST) from the code, transorm the CST into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> (AST) and finally compile the AST into a <strong>code object</strong> using <kbd>./Python/ast.c: PyAST_FromNode</kbd>. For now, think of the code object as a binary string of machine code that Python VM’s ‘machinary’ can operate on – so now we’re ready to do interpretation (again, <em>evaluation</em> in Python’s parlance).</p>
<p>We have an (almost) empty <kbd>__main__</kbd>, we have a code object, we want to evaluate it. Now what? Now this line: <kbd>Python/pythonrun.c: run_mod, v = PyEval_EvalCode(co, globals, locals);</kbd> does the trick. It receives a code object and a namespace for <strong>globals</strong> and for <strong>locals</strong> (in this case, both of them will be the newly created <kbd>__main__</kbd> namespace), creates a <strong>frame object</strong> from these and executes it. You remember previously that I mentioned that <kbd>Py_Initialize</kbd> creates a thread state, and that we’ll talk about it later? Well, back to that for a bit: each Python thread is represented by its own thread state, which (among other things) points to the stack of currently executing frames. After the frame object is created and placed at the top of the thread state stack, it (or rather, the byte code pointed by it) is evaluated, opcode by opcode, by means of the (rather lengthy) <kbd>./Python/ceval.c: PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd>.</p>
<p><kbd>PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd> takes the frame, extracts opcode (and operands, if any, we’ll get to that) after opcode, and executes a short piece of C code matching the opcode. Let’s take a closer look at what these “opcodes” look like by disassembling a bit of compiled Python code:</p>
<pre title="">&gt;&gt;&gt; from dis import dis # ooh! a handy disassembly function!
&gt;&gt;&gt; co = compile("spam = eggs - 1", "&lt;string&gt;", "exec")
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis(co)
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (eggs)
              3 LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
              6 BINARY_SUBTRACT     
              7 STORE_NAME               1 (spam)
             10 LOAD_CONST               1 (None)
             13 RETURN_VALUE        
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
<p>…even without knowing much about Python’s bytecode, this is reasonably readable. You “load” the name <kbd>eggs</kbd> (where do you load it from? where do you load it to? soon), and also load a constant value (<kbd>1</kbd>), then you do a “binary subtract” (what do you mean ‘binary’ in this context? between which operands?), and so on and so forth. As you might have guessed, the names are “loaded” from the <kbd>globals</kbd> and <kbd>locals</kbd> namespaces we’ve seen earlier, and they’re loaded onto an operand stack (not to be confused with the stack of running frames), which is exactly where the binary subtract will pop them from, subtract one from the other, and put the result back on that stack. “Binary subtract” just means this is a subtraction opcode that has two operands (hence it is “binary”, this is not to say the operands are binary numbers made of ‘0’s and ‘1’s).</p>
<p>You can go look at <kbd>PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd> at <kbd>./Python/ceval.c</kbd> yourself, it’s not a small function by any means. For practical reasons I can’t paste too much code from there in here, but I will just paste the code that runs when a <kbd>BINARY_SUBTRACT</kbd> opcode is found, I think it really illustrates things:</p>
<pre title="">        TARGET(BINARY_SUBTRACT)
            w = POP();
            v = TOP();
            x = PyNumber_Subtract(v, w);
            Py_DECREF(v);
            Py_DECREF(w);
            SET_TOP(x);
            if (x != NULL) DISPATCH();
            break;

<h4>
By Khaled Abou Alfa • Published 29th of July, <span>2020
</span></h4>
<p>
In 1927, Oleg Losev, a Russian inventor and scientist would introduce the world to the light-emitting diode. This technology would remain dormant for decades. Progress was made in 1962 with the introduction of the first red <span>LED</span>. For the next 30 years, an industry would hunt for the elusive colour blue. Over time the risk of pouring resource and treasure into this pursuit increased - you were chasing the pot of gold at the end of a blue coloured rainbow.
</p>
<p>
These pursuits would continue with little success until the early 90s. Then the work of Shuji Nakamura, Isamu Akosaki and Hiroshi Amano unlocked the secrets of the blue <span>LED</span>. So significant was this discovery that in 2004, the trio would receive the Nobel price in Physics.
</p>
<p>
This work would be employed in diverse contexts, from the multitude of screens we depend upon to data communications. For the built environment, this discovery would transform artificial lighting across the world. The incandescent (and to a lesser extent the fluorescent) lamp illuminated the 20th century. Light for the 21st century would be ushered in by the <span>LED</span> lamp.
</p>
<h2 id="obsolete-lighting-law">Obsolete Lighting Law</h2>
<p>In 1999, <a href="http://www.haitzs-law.com/uploads/7/6/3/6/76362633/1999-_national_research_report__same_as_2000_sarndia_nrp_.pdf">Roland Haitz co-authored</a> a research report, on the future of <span>LED</span> lighting (which was renamed as solid state lighting). The paper included data collected over decades that plotted both the cost of lumens and the red light output per <span>LED</span> package since the 1970s. 20 years ago Haitz empirically predicted the world we are living in today and captured in a<span></span> <span>‘</span>law’ which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every decade, for a given wavelength of light, the cost per lumen falls by a factor of 10 and the amount of light generated per <span>LED</span> package increases by a factor of 20.<br>
— Haitz’s Law</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A new report, which addressed the shortcomings and reviewed the impact of the earlier report, was published <a href="http://www.haitzs-law.com/uploads/7/6/3/6/76362633/2011-physica_-_haitz_r_2011_pssa.pdf">a decade later in 2010</a>. This paper predicted that within the decade (by 2020), we would have reached a point of diminishing returns. It acknowledged that Solid State Lighting (<span>SSL</span>) is limited in two areas. The conversion efficacy - converting electrical energy to luminous flux cannot exceed 100%. The actual need for increased flux range - just because you can produce it, doesn’t mean the market needs it. The paper provided indications of where the future after 2020 is likely to evolve:
</p>
<p><em><span>‘</span>These include digital tuning of both the chromaticity and the temporal/spatial placement of light within the environment that is being lit.’</em></p>
<p><span>
27</span> years after the initial spark of the blue <span>LED</span> revolution, we are now entering a period of equilibrium of both the efficacy and flux of solid state lighting. The advances in lighting have now begun to shift into new territory, one of circadian rhythms, diurnal patterns and refined controllability.
</p>
<h2 id="controllability">Controllability</h2>
<p>Inline with the predictions from 10 years ago, the lighting industry has begun to focus its attention on how <span>SSL</span> can be controlled and manipulated. The technology available today would be considered both technically impossible and prohibitively expensive, compared with technology from only 15 years ago.</p>
<p>
The terms<span></span> <span>‘</span>circadian lighting’ or<span></span> <span>‘</span>human centric lighting’ have begun entering the lexicon as a means to enhance the wellbeing of everyone interacting with the built world. With the advent of <span>SSL</span> technology we are now able to control parameters such as colour spectrum, intensity and directionality. These systems offer control based on the exact location, the relationship to the outside world and what is happening outside in real time.
</p>
<p>
The main debate for the use of this type of lighting control is whether it actually works. Does it suppress the levels of Melatonin in the body? Does it make people more alert and therefore more responsive throughout the day? These are some of the questions that the industry will need to address for the technology to become more widespread.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In the last two decades, the lighting industry has experienced a revolution. This has led to an expanded scope of what is achievable with light in a manner unimaginable back in 1927. Incredibly these benefits have come at a greatly reduced level of energy consumption (typically 1/5th of previous technologies). The work is far from done, as incandecent lamp sources (amongst others) remain in wide use throughout the world (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/246030/estimated-led-penetration-of-the-global-lighting-market/">global penetration of LEDs hovers around 61%</a>). We must wean ourselves both for our own wellbeing and that of the planet.</strong>

<p>We now know what form factor Dyson had chosen for their <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/exclusive-inside-story-dyson-ev">now shelved electric vehicle</a>. Micromobility this is <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>
The Dyson’s interview demonstrates the tone deaf nature associated with cars. You may need a car for some activities, but for most of your mobility needs, you likely can get away with other methods. How different our cities would be if we could understand and embrace that reality together.
</p>
<p>
In adjacent news the guys over at Micromobility.io have been documenting our transition for a while. Just released is <a href="https://micromobility.io/landscape">version 2.0 of their Landscape document</a>. The document demonstrates the breadth that is on offer in this field.

<p>The 2020 Tokyo Olympics may have been postponed but that doesn’t mean we don’t get to marvel at some stunning timber architecture. As covered in <a href="https://www.stet.build/ia/007">issue 007</a>, the Japanese know a thing or two about building in timber. The completion of the <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/nikken-sekkei-timber-gymnastics-center-tokyo-olympic-games-07-23-2020/">Ariake gymnastics center</a> is a wonderful extension of that history.</p>

<h2 id="spoke-pens">Spoke Pens</h2>
<p><img src="https://blot.im/cdn/blog_78585a67eddd4bfcb7936222fddae5c7/_image_cache/59e3faa3-40df-46fe-98d7-bbf3cdd7d852.jpg" alt="Spoke Pens" width="680" height="680"></p>
<p>Over the past 5–10 years there has been an incredible industry of machined pens produced and sold on Kickstarter. I have found that the ergonomic design and available refill options to be under-represented. Rather than focusing on the utility of the pen itself, many focus on both the materials and aesthetic design instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told,<span></span> <span>“</span>Make it look good!” That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.<br>
— Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this regard, the <a href="https://spokedesign.com/">Spoke pens and pencils</a> are different. The inside was considered first - even though the outside has a strong design language. The pen is primarily a wrap around the pen refill or pencil mechanism. The pens accept the standard Muji Gel ink refills or the Uni Signo <span>DX</span> refills (both come in a range of colours and go down to the 0.38mm range). While the pencil is based on the Pentel <span>P20</span># mechanical pencil mechanism. Both are highly recommended.

The reason we decided so late, was because we were waiting for a SIM card for our Iridium GO satellite phone, and we received it yesterday morning. As soon as we got it, we grabbed our passports and boat papers and hurried to the Immigration Office in Shizuoka to check out (a 4-5 hour train ride away). We were eager to leave on the 9th, as there was a good weather window, with moderate winds coming from a favourable direction. Because we weren't planning to leave until late yesterday morning, there were many tasks we had no yet done, or had not had time to do.<p>We're usually more organized than this, with only a few menial tasks to do, but not this time. Last minute departures is not our style, but we also wanted to take this window. We had to find a post box to send the pocket wifi we rented and to fill our water tanks — this may not seem like much, but it was, as it piled up on top of other things we'd forgotten, like finding and installing the pot holders to the stovetop, installing the jack lines, taking out the tethers, putting key items back in the ditch bag plus a number of other last minute things that had escaped us at the time.</p></td>

We use this opportunity to chat, meanwhile butterflies gather in my gut. I am nervous. I always am before a big trip and this time is no different, although this is our biggest passage yet, and will also likely be the most challenging. My gut has every right to twist itself into knots. We ask Shuhei to drop off our pocket wifi in a post box, he agrees ­— ah, what a kind person. He came by this with his truck to help Robusta with some last minute tasks, like getting produce, gas etc. We had done most of that ahead of time.</td>

		<td>We push off our spot and head over to the Shimoda Boat Services pontoon to fill our water tanks. We tied up to it and began to ferry bins back and forth to empty them in our tank. We filled as many recipients as we could carry, as we don't know how long the trip will take. Once the tanks and jerry cans were full, we left the pontoon and headed outside of the breakwater. The Shimoda coastguard ship was lifting anchor at the time, it went past us, disappearing quickly as it was going much faster. Outside of the breakwater, we saw the lighthouse on our starboard side, the one we had difficulty rounding when we arrived here a week and a half ago due to 30-knot winds off our bow. Today, the seas were tame and the skies clear and blue. <p>We saw the Kurofune, a replica of Commodore Perry's black ship, taking tourists about the harbor. It was the first time we'd seen it on the water, as there weren't many tourists before due to concerns with the coronavirus. Now that the state of emergency's been lifted, people started traveling more around the country.</p></td>

The kuroshio, or <i>black current</i>, is very strong in this area, and even stronger between the islands as the water is forced through a narrow opening. We had no problem with ships, even with many heading to Tokyo. Our speed made it easy to work our way out of the main shipping channel. We are flying!

For lunch, we had inari pouches, a meal we'd purchased at MaxValue the night before. It's nice not having to cook on the first day. Neither of us are sea sick, but going below is still difficult and can easily trigger it. We stay outside instead, enjoying the good wind, weather and sun. <p>Devine is reading "The mushrooom at the end of the world", while I steer us east. We tried calling Robusta on the VHF, but got no answer, either they're too far or their radio isn't on.</p></td>

We are at 36 degrees, and it is worrisome as we knew it was safer to stay under 35. The wind above that line tends to be stronger. Robusta was at 33 degrees, upon exiting Shimoda they took a more southerly route, I wish we'd done the same. We underestimated the strength of this current.

The automatic bilge pump doesn't empty the bilge entirely, as it sits on a little stand above the lowest point, but the manual pump tube touches the bottom and does a better job of sucking up the majority of the water.

<p>Besides manually compiling <a href="https://archive.xfce.org/xfce/4.16pre1/src/">tarballs</a>, it’s also possible to use <a href="https://github.com/schuellerf/xfce-test">xfce-test</a> (<code>ubuntu_20.04-xfce-4.16pre1</code> tag) to easily preview Xfce 4.16 without the risk of breaking your system.</p>

<p>Update: Arch Linux users more adventurous than usual can try <code>-devel</code> packages from AUR. Likewise, openSUSE users can install <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Xfce_repositories">packages</a> built directly from git master. If you’re afraid to trash your system consider playing with a virtual machine first.</p>

<p>Please go ahead try this release if possible, we would be more happy to hear your impressions as well as get bug reports before the final release.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>

<p>We’re expecting to release Xfce 4.16pre2 at the end of this month and if necessary pre3 will be released in October. If everything goes as planned Xfce 4.16 should be released by November!</p>

<![CDATA[Go’s Major Versioning Sucks – From a Fanboy]]>
            </title>

September 15, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/09/15/gos-major-version-handling-sucks-from-a-fanboy/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/09/15/gos-major-version-handling-sucks-from-a-fanboy/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>I’m normally a fan of the rigidity within the Go toolchain. In fact, we use Go on the <a href="https://app.qvault.io/dashboard/courses">front and backend at Qvault</a>. It’s wonderful to have standardized formatting, vetting, and testing across the entire language. The first real criticism I’ve had is with the way Go modules handle major versions. It’s over-the-top opinionated and slows down development in a significant number of scenarios.</p>



<h2>Refresher on “Go Mod”</h2>



<p>Go modules, and the associated commands <code>go mod</code> and <code>go get</code> can be thought of as Go’s equivalents to NPM and Yarn. The Go toolchain provides a way to manage dependencies and lock the versions that a collection of code depends on.</p>



<p>One of the most common operations is to update a dependency in an existing module. For example:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash"># update all dependencies
go get -u ./...

# add missing and remove unused dependencies
go mod tidy

# save all dependency code in the project's "vendor" folder
go mod vendor</code></pre>



<h2>Semantic Versioning</h2>



<p>Go modules use git tags and semantic versioning to keep track of the versions of dependencies that are compatible with the module in question. Semantic versioning is a way to format version numbers and it looks like this: <code>v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}</code>. For example, <code>v1.2.3</code>.</p>



<p>Each number is to be incremented according to the following standards:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</code></pre>



<h2>Package-Side Problems</h2>



<p>Go has decided that all versions beyond <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> are required to use the major version in the module path. There are two ways to accomplish this. </p>



<p><strong>The first and recommended way</strong> is laid out in an example on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.golang.org/v2-go-modules#TOC_4." target="_blank">Go Blog</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>To start development on&nbsp;<code>v2</code>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<code>github.com/googleapis/gax-go</code>, we’ll create a new&nbsp;<code>v2/</code>&nbsp;directory and copy our package into it.</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words, for every major version, we are encouraged to maintain a new copy of the entire codebase. This is also the only way to do it if you want pre-modules users to be able to use your package.</p>



<p><strong>The second way</strong> is to just change the name of your module in <code>go.mod</code>. Fore example, <code>module github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-tinydate</code> would become <code>module github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-tinydate/v2</code>. Besides this not working for older versions of Go, I also find it problematic because it breaks (in my mind) one of the most useful things about module names – they reflect the file path.</p>



<h2>Package-Side Solutions</h2>



<p>Allow package maintainers to specify the major version simply by updating git tags, no module name changes required. There is no need for two sources of truth.</p>



<p>We can enforce safe updating by adding warnings or prompts to the <code>go get</code> CLI. We don’t have to add unnecessary time-consuming policies.</p>



<h2>Client-Side Problems</h2>



<p>When new versions of dependencies are released we have a simple command to get the newest stuff: <code>go get -u</code>. The problem is that this command has no way to automatically update to a new major version. It will only download new minor changes and patches. There isn’t even a console message to inform you that a new major version exists!</p>



<p>That said, the reason for not auto-updating is clear, and to be fair, well-founded:</p>



<blockquote><p>If an old package and a new package have the same import path, the new package must be backwards compatible with the old package.</p><cite><a href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import" rel="noopener">Import compatibility rule</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In other words, we should only increment major versions when making breaking changes, and if breaking changes are made they can’t have the same import path. While this makes sense, I think a simple console warning would have been a better solution than forcing a cumbersome updating strategy on the community.</p>



<p><strong>Another problem </strong>on the client-side is that we don’t only need to update <code>go.mod</code>, but we actually need to <code>grep</code> through our codebase and change each import statement to point to the new major version:</p>



<blockquote><p>Users who wanted to use&nbsp;<code>v2</code>&nbsp;had to change their package imports and module requirements to&nbsp;<code>github.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2</code>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Instead of a few simple CLI commands to get the latest dependencies, we’re making changes to the code itself.</p>



<h3>A Caveat – Diamond Imports</h3>



<p>Using different paths for different major versions makes more sense in situations where we may require two different versions of the same package, you know, <a aria-label="diamond imports (opens in a new tab)" href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import#dependency_story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">diamond imports</a> and all that. This is the exception, not the rule, and it seems strange to tap dance around a problem that doesn’t exist in most codebases.</p>



<h2>Client-Side Solution</h2>



<p><code>go get -u</code> should have an additional command line flag to update major versions, and should default to showing a warning that there is a newer major version you don’t have yet.</p>



<p><em>Default</em> import paths should not change between major versions. If a module requires various versions, those <em>extra</em> versions could be flagged by having a different path.</p>



<h2>Why This Sucks For Me</h2>



<p>It is often the case that I want to build a package that has domain-specific logic and will only be used only in services at the small company I work for. For example, we have a repo that holds the <code>struct{}</code> definitions for common entities used across our system.</p>



<p>Occasionally we need to make backward-incompatible changes to those struct definitions. If it were an open-source library we wouldn’t make changes so often, but because it’s internal and we are aware of all the dependencies, we change the names of exported fields <em>regularly</em>. We aren’t changing names because we chose bad ones to begin with, we are usually changing names because requirements from the business change rapidly in a startup. </p>



<p>This means major version changes are a fairly regular occurrence. Some say that we should just stay on <code>v0</code>, and that’s a reasonable solution. The problem is these ARE production packages that are being used by a wide number of services. We WANT to Semver.</p>



<p>Go makes updating major versions so cumbersome that in the majority of cases, we have opted to just increment minor versions when we should increment major versions. We want to follow the proper versioning scheme, we just don’t want to add the unnecessary steps to our dev process.</p>



<h2>Hey – I Get It</h2>



<p>I understand why these decisions were made – and I even think in a lot of cases they were great decisions. For any open-source or public facing module this makes great sense. The Go toolchain is enforcing strict rules that encourage good API design.</p>



<p>In their effort to make public APIs great, they made it unnecessarily hard to have good “local” package design.</p>



<p>There is an <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40323" rel="noopener">open issue on Github</a> that would make new major versions more discoverable from the CLI. Take a look at that if you are interested.</p>



<p>Go still has the best toolchain and ecosystem. NPM and PIP can suck it.</p>



<p>If you disagree, @ me on Twitter.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div><article> <p>Performance tuning is one of those programming rituals that gets oddly addicting. Seems like humans have a fundamental impulse to make a graph plot in their desired direction. This can be seen in a wide assortment of fields. Day traders watch metrics focused on their net earnings, nutritionists keep their calorie counts logged, and programmers focusing on performance obsess over memory allocations.</p> <p>After spending sometime obessing myself I found myself making large allocation improvements with some tricks in the popular <a href="https://github.com/jackc/pgx">PGX</a> library.</p> <p>I'd like to shout out <em>Kale Blanekship</em> and <em>Eric Chlebek</em> from the performance channel in #gophers slack. They provided the clues used in this post.</p> <h2>The code</h2> <p>The code that's being profiled is a new distributed lock implementation for <a href="https://github.com/quay/claircore/">ClairCore</a>. Postgres is the only required infrastructure for ClairCore by design. While it's not the best mechanim for a distributed lock, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/explicit-locking.html">postgres advisory locks</a> can be utilized to get <em>mostly</em> there.</p> <p>You can view the distlock implementation <a href="https://github.com/ldelossa/distlock">here</a></p> <h2>Reducing channel allocations</h2> <p>Our distlock implementation utilizes the request/response channel-of-channel pattern. A request object with a response channel is pushed onto a request channel. When the receiver gets the request it writes to the response channel, unblocking any client listening.</p> <p>This pattern is useful but will also alloc a lot of channels resulting in bloating the heap.</p> <p>To demonstrate this a benchmark will be taken that profiles lock acquisition and lock return.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> go <span>test</span> -benchtime <span>"1m"</span>  -run xxx -bench . -memprofile memprofile.out -cpuprofile cpuprofile.out</span>
</code></pre> <p>The command above runs a 1 minute benchmark profiling both memory and cpu.</p> <p>Next lets start an interactive pprof session over the memory profile and drill into the function where the channel allocations are occuring.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> go tool pprof distlock.test memprofile.out</span>

</code></pre> <p>The above illustrates a simple channel implemented pool. The first implementation was a sync.Pool. After further profiling however implementing our own proved to be easier on the heap.</p> <p>After plumbing the requst pool into the rest of the code pprof reports a much nicer result.</p> <pre><code>(pprof) list \.Lock

</code></pre> <h2>A PGX Trick</h2> <p>Removing the cost of the response-request model was a good win but there is still more to tune.</p> <p>Lets generate a graph of our call stack and associated allocations.</p> <pre><code>❯ go tool pprof -svg distlock.test memprofile.out
</code></pre> <p><img alt="photo of high PGX allocations" src="https://www.ldelossa.is/profile001.png"></p> <p>The above diagram is showing a large amount of allocations in PGX's getRows method. Its not rare for methods dealing with serialization to and from the database to allocate heavily. But it would be nice if we could eliminate this.</p> <p>Getting a session pg advisory lock typically looks like this.</p> <pre><code>SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock($1);
SELECT pg_advisory_unlock($1);
</code></pre> <p>Both lock functions return a table expression resulting in a true or a false.</p> <p>An optimization we can make is changing these queries to only return a row if the lock function returns true. Our application logic can then simply check whether any rows are returned and not read the contents.</p> <p>First lets fix our queries.</p> <pre><code>SELECT lock FROM pg_try_advisory_lock($1) lock WHERE lock = true;
SELECT lock FROM pg_advisory_unlock($1) lock WHERE lock = true;
</code></pre> <p>A slight modification allows us to only return rows if the lock function returns true.</p> <p>The next step is to short circuit the PGX library from reading the rows. This took a bit of library spelunking but I eventually discovered this...</p> <pre><code>rr := m.conn.PgConn().ExecParams(ctx,
    trySessionUnlock,
    [][]<span>byte</span>{
        keyify(key),
    },
    <span>nil</span>,
    []<span>int16</span>{<span>1</span>},
    <span>nil</span>)
tag, err := rr.Close()
<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
    <span>return</span> response{<span>false</span>, <span>nil</span>, err}
}
<span>if</span> tag.RowsAffected() == <span>0</span> {
    <span>return</span> response{<span>false</span>, <span>nil</span>, fmt.Errorf(<span>"unlock of key %s returned false"</span>, key)}
}
</code></pre> <p>By using the lower level PgConn object we can exec our queries, get a response writer, and immediately close it to obtain the command tag. The command tag tells us if any rows were affected by the exec. This effectively tells us whether the lock was obtained or not in a somewhat indirect way.</p> <p>Let's take a new 1 minute memory profile to see how this effects our heap.</p> <p><img alt="photo of high PGX allocations" src="https://www.ldelossa.is/profile002.png"></p> <p>Notice the large improvement achieved.</p> <p>We can also compare the benchmark output.</p> <pre><code>85149            890605 ns/op            1288 B/op         21 allocs/op
</code></pre> <p>Where PGX was reading the rows.</p> <pre><code>58051           1238353 ns/op             517 B/op         11 allocs/op
</code></pre> <p>By eliminating the reading of rows we perform many more cycles and cut our allocation in roughly half.</p> <h2>Disclaimer on optimization</h2> <p>Is it worth to dig this deep into your allocations? Depends. If you know the code you are writing will be in the "hot-path" its empowering to know what your allocation profile looks like. Learning the skills to performance tune is addicting and powerful but writing code that can be read and easily maintained should always be the first goal. That being said I do think every engineer should go down the rabbit hole at least once. Its a lot of fun.</p> </article></div></div></div>]]>

<p>So you know when you’re flopping about at home, minding your own business, drinking from your water bottle in a way that does not possess <em>any</em> intent to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia?</p>

<p>It’s a feeling I know all too well, and in which I was vigorously partaking when I got this message in “the group chat”<sup id="fnref:groupchat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:groupchat">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/groupchat.png" alt="Can you hack this man?|medium">
<em>A nice message from my friend, with a photo of a boarding pass 🙂 A good thing about messages from your friends is that they do not have any rippling consequences 🙂🙂🙂</em></p>

<p>The man in question is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott">Tony Abbott</a>, one of Australia’s <em>many</em> former Prime Ministers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/tony_abbott_wikipedia.png" alt="if u google tony abbott u get this|small">
<em>That’s him, officer</em></p>

<p>For security reasons, we try to change our Prime Minister every six months, and to never use the same Prime Minister on multiple websites.<sup id="fnref:kevin07" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kevin07">2</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="the-boarding-pass-photo">The boarding pass photo</h4>
<p>This particular former PM had just posted a picture of his boarding pass on Instagram (Instagram, in case you don’t know it, is an app you can open up on your phone any time to look at ads).</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/instagrampost.PNG" alt="Instagram post showing boarding pass|large">
<em>The since-deleted Instagram post showing the boarding pass and baggage receipt. The caption reads “coming back home from japan 😍😍  looking forward to seeing everyone! climate change isn’t real 😌 ok byeee”</em></p>

<h4 id="can-you-hack-this-man">“Can you hack this man?”</h4>
<p>My friend<sup id="fnref:hoggemoade" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hoggemoade">3</a></sup> (who we will refer to by their group chat name, 𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊) is asking<sup id="fnref:onbehalf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:onbehalf">4</a></sup> whether I can “hack this man” not because I am the kind of person who regularly commits 𝒄𝒚𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒐𝒏 on a whim, but because we’d recently been talking about boarding passes.</p>

<p>I’d said that people post pictures of their boarding passes all the time, not knowing that it can sometimes be used to get their passport number and stuff. They just post it being like “omg going on holidayyyy 😍😍😍”, unaware that they’re posting cringe.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/instagramboardingpasses.png" alt="screenshot of #boardingpass on instagram|medium">
<em>People post their boarding passes all the time, because it’s not clear that they’re meant to be secret</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, some hacker is rubbing their hands together, being all “yumyum identity fraud 👀” in their dark web Discord, because this happens a <em>lot</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpassposts.png" alt="screenshot of #boardingpass on instagram"></p>

<hr>

<p>So there I was, making intense and meaningful eye contact with this chat bubble, asking me if I could “hack this man”.</p>

<h3 id="surely-you-wouldnt">Surely you wouldn’t</h3>
<p>Of course, my friend wasn’t <em>actually</em> asking me to hack the former Prime Minister.</p>



<p>However.</p>



<p>You <em>gotta</em>.</p>

<p>I mean… what are you gonna do, <em>not</em> click it? Are you gonna let a <em>link</em> that’s like 50% advertising tracking ID tell you what to do? Wouldn’t you be <em>curious</em>?</p>

<p>The former Prime Minister had just posted his boarding pass. Was that <em>bad</em>? Was someone in danger? I didn’t know.</p>

<p>What I did know was: the <em>least</em> I could do<sup id="fnref:nocrime" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nocrime">5</a></sup> for my country would be to have a casual browse 👀</p>

<h2 id="investigating-the-boarding-pass-photo">Investigating the boarding pass photo</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-hubris">Step 1: Hubris</h3>

<p>So I had a bit of a casual browse, and got the picture of the boarding pass, and then…. I didn’t know what was supposed to happen after that.</p>

<p>Well, I’d heard that it’s bad to post your boarding pass online, because if you do, a bored 17 year-old Russian boy called “Katie-senpai” might somehow use it to commit identity fraud. But I don’t know anyone like that, so I just clumsily googled some stuff.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/uhhboardingpasshacking.png" alt="uhhh|small"></p>

<p>Eventually I found <a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hackers-use-hidden-data-airline-boarding-passes-hack-flights-0180728/">a blog post</a> explaining that yes, pictures of boarding passes can indeed be used for Crimes. The part you wanna be looking at for all your criming needs is the barcode, because it’s got the “Booking Reference” (e.g. <code>H8JA2A</code>) in it.</p>

<p>Why do you want the booking reference? It’s one of the two things you need to log in to the airline website to manage your flight.</p>

<p>The second one is your… last name. I was really hoping the second one would be like a password or something. But, no, it’s the booking reference the airline emails you and prints on your boarding pass. And it also lets you log in to the airline website?</p>

<p>That sounds suspiciously like a password to me, but like I’m still fine to pretend it’s not if you are.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-scan-the-barcode">Step 2: Scan the barcode</h3>
<p>I’ve been practicing every morning at sunrise, but still can’t scan barcodes with my eyes. I had to settle for a barcode scanner app on my phone, but when I tried to scan the picture in the Instagram post, it didn’t work :((</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpass.png" alt="the boarding pass photo">
<em>Maybe I shouldn’t have blurred out the barcode first</em></p>

<h3 id="step-2-scan-the-barcode-but-more">Step 2: Scan the barcode, but more</h3>

<p>Well, maybe it wasn’t scanning because the picture was too blurry.</p>

<p>I spent around 15 minutes in an “enhance, ENHANCE” montage, fiddling around with the image, increasing the contrast, and so on. Despite the montage taking up way too much of the 22 minute episode, I couldn’t even get the barcode to scan<sup id="fnref:step3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:step3">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-notice-that-the-booking-reference-is-printed-right-there-on-the-paper">Step 2: Notice that the Booking Reference is printed right there on the paper</h3>

<p>After staring at this image for 15 minutes, I noticed the Booking Reference is just… printed on the baggage receipt.</p>

<p>I graduated university.</p>

<p>But it did not prepare me for this.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/bookinglogin2.png" alt="Manage booking login screen with empty fields-large"></p>

<p>After recovering from <em>that</em> emotional rollercoaster, I went to <a href="https://qantas.com.au/">qantas.com.au</a>, and clicked “Manage Booking”. In case you don’t know it because you live in a country with fast internet, Qantas is the main airline here in Australia.</p>

<p>(I also very conveniently started recording my screen, which is gonna pay off <em>big time</em> in just a moment.)</p>

<h3 id="step-4-type-in-the-booking-reference">Step 4: Type in the Booking Reference</h3>

<p>Well, the login form was just… <em>there</em>, and it was asking for a Booking Reference and a last name. I had just flawlessly read the Booking Reference from the boarding pass picture, and, well… I knew the last name<sup id="fnref:lastname" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lastname">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I did hesitate for a split-second, but… no, I had to know.</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you really felt that.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/yikes.png" alt="yikes"></p>

<p>I guess I was now logged the heck in as Tony Abbott? And for all I know, everyone else who saw his Instagram post was right there with me. It’s kinda wholesome, to imagine us all there together. But also probably suboptimal in a governmental sense.</p>

<h5 id="was-there-anything-secret-in-here">Was there anything secret in here?</h5>

<p>I then just incredibly browsed the page, browsed it so hard.</p>

<p>I saw Tony Abbott’s name<sup id="fnref:name" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:name">8</a></sup>, flight times, and Frequent Flyer number, but not really anything <em>super</em> secret-looking. Not gonna be committing any cyber treason with a Frequent Flyer number. The flight was in the past, so I couldn’t change anything, either.</p>

<p>The page said the flight had been booked by a travel agent, so I guessed some information would be missing because of that.</p>

<p>I clicked around and scrolled a considerable length, but still didn’t find any government secrets.</p>

<p>Some people might give up here. But I, the Icarus of computers, was simply too dumb to know when to stop.</p>

<h3 id="were-not-done-just-because-a-web-page-says-were-done">We’re not done just because a <em>web page</em> says we’re done</h3>

<p>I wanted to see if there were juicy things hidden <em>inside</em> the page. To do it, I had to use the <em>only</em> hacker tool I know.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/inspectelement.png" alt="Right click > Inspect-small">
<em>Right click &gt; Inspect Element, all you need to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia</em></p>

<p>Listen. This is the only part of the story that might be confused for highly elite computer skill. It’s not, though. Maybe later someone will show you this same thing to try and flex, acting like only <em>they</em> know how to do it. You will not go gently into that good night. You will refuse to acknowledge their flex, killing them instantly.</p>

<h5 id="how-does-inspect-element-work">How does “Inspect Element” work?</h5>
<p>“Inspect Element”, as it’s called, is a feature of Google Chrome that lets you see the computer’s internal representation (HTML) of the page you’re looking at. Kinda like opening up a clock and looking at the cool cog party inside.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Pocketwatch_cutaway_drawing.jpg" alt="cog party|small">
<em>Yeahhh go little cogs, look at ‘em absolutely going off. Now imagine this but with like, JavaScript</em></p>

<p>Everything you see when you use “Inspect Element” was already downloaded to your computer, you just hadn’t asked Chrome to show it to you yet. Just like how the cogs were already in the watch, you just hadn’t opened it up to look.</p>

<p>But let us dispense with frivolous cog talk. Cheap tricks such as “Inspect Element” are used by programmers to try and understand how the website works. This is ultimately futile: Nobody can understand how websites work. Unfortunately, it kinda <em>looks</em> like hacking the first time you see it.</p>

<p>If you’d like to know more about it, I’ve prepared a short video.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hey youtube welcome to my hacking tutorial, today we're gonna hack.... the nsa <a href="https://t.co/2Z35GJjSZE">pic.twitter.com/2Z35GJjSZE</a></p>— “Alex” (@mangopdf) <a href="https://twitter.com/mangopdf/status/1123400764926226432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2019</a></blockquote>


<h3 id="browsing-the-manage-booking-pages-html">Browsing the “Manage Booking” page’s HTML</h3>

<p>I scrolled around the page’s HTML, not really knowing what it meant, furiously trying to find anything that looked out of place or secret.</p>

<p>I eventually realised that manually reading HTML with my eyes was not an efficient way of defending my country, and Ctrl + F’d the HTML for “passport”.</p>

<h3 id="oh-no">oh no</h3>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/passportjson.gif" alt="Blurred screenshot of close up &quot;passport&quot; number"></p>

<h3 id="oh-yes">Oh yes</h3>

<p>It’s just <em>there</em>.</p>

<p>At this point I was fairly sure I was looking at the <em>extremely</em> secret government-issued ID of the <em>28th Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, servant to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</em> and I was <em>kinda</em> worried that I was somehow doing something wrong, but like, not enough to stop.</p>

<h3 id="anything-else-in-this-page">….anything <em>else</em> in this page?</h3>

<p>Well damn, if Tony Abbott’s passport number is in this treasure trove of computer spaghetti, maybe there’s wayyyyy more. Perhaps this HTML contains the lost launch codes to the Sydney Opera House, or Harold Holt<sup id="fnref:holt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:holt">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Maybe there’s a phone number?</p>

<p>Searching for <code>phone</code> and <code>number</code> didn’t get anywhere, so I searched for <code>614</code>, the first 3 digits of an Australian phone number, using my colossal and highly celestial galaxy brain.</p>

<h5 id="weird-uppercase-letters">Weird uppercase letters</h5>
<p>A weird pile of what I could only describe as extremely uppercase letters came up. It looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>RQST QF HK1 HNDSYD/03EN|FQTV QF HK1|CTCM QF HK1 614[phone number]|CKIN QF HN1 DO NOT SEAT ROW [row number] PLS SEAT LAST ROW OF [row letter] WINDOW
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, there’s a lot going on here. There is indeed a phone number in here. But what the heck is all this <em>other</em> stuff?</p>

<p>I realised this was like… Qantas staff talking to eachother <em>about</em> Tony Abbott, but not <em>to</em> him?</p>

        <blockquote><p>You sometimes can identify markers for an imminent project meltdown. But you have to pay attention to the red flags. Here’s what to look for.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should have recognized the signs earlier. Everyone else in our startup software company was busy at work, aware that we needed to finish our software to acquire the venture capital we needed. Yet, Sandra began bringing the newspaper to work, and reading the entire thing, while the people around her wrote code, worked on the business plan, or tried to make sense of our accounting. Although it was inevitable that she’d leave – and perhaps the team implosion was also a foregone conclusion – I somehow refused to deal with the early indications.</p>
<p>Not every software development crisis has an early warning system, but plenty of them do. If you learn to recognize the signs early enough – and you’re willing to confront the problem, as I was not – you may be able to prevent the project from failing. If you can’t prevent the meltdown, perhaps you can save yourself.</p>
<h3>Meetings of the minds</h3>
<p>When you first join a team, or when you begin to have a bad feeling that you can’t quite name, pay attention to the way people behave during team meetings. I don’t mean necessarily that you should rush to get your résumé in order, if people get upset with one another. But do watch for signs that the proceedings don’t matter to the participants.</p>
<p>A quality engineer at a midrange German bank attended his first meeting on a new project. People arrived and left at will, without saying a word. Nobody kept minutes, he told me. “We usually don’t need that,” project participants told him. At that point, says the engineer, “I knew that the level of discipline in this project was far too low to produce anything valuable. This proved to be true within a year.”</p>
<p>Are developers writing code instead of paying attention to what the users are asking? Do people regularly check their e-mail? It’s time to wonder about their commitment.</p>
<p>Meetings also show stress among the people who are supposed to be working together, especially when meetings don’t happen. In one project, where formerly independent teams were expected to merge, “They saw themselves as competing with one another,” reports Solomon, a programmer at a large financial firm. “When we did the requirements interviews, the users (and their managers) were looking to ‘protect’ the ‘way we’ve always done business.'” Some managers planned to limit the influence of other groups; political battles were fought over the design. “There was no process for surfacing these issues (many of them valid business issues) and having management make a decision,” Solomon says.</p>
<p>In fact, the number of meetings you attend is a sign on its own. If you have to gather a committee for a two-hour roundtable for every decision – because nobody can accept one person making the call – bump that project to the bottom of your priority list. Particularly so if meetings have more than five people, or when managers outnumber workers. Each such meeting moves the project doomsday clock closer to boom.</p>
<p>Another red flag is procrastination about timely updates for stakeholders. For example: A decision is required but not yet made. A milestone is not reached due to delays but someone doesn’t want to disclose that stumble. “Those may not kill or put a project in ‘zombie,’ status,” says one programmer, “But if the communication has broken down it’s a good indicator of heading that way.”</p>
<h3>Expectations out of whack</h3>
<p>I’ve heard dozens of stories from developers and tester about the signs that a project is headed downhill. By far, the most common source of problems is inaccurate or poorly-communicated project expectations – and an inappropriate reaction from management when things go awry.</p>
<p>“Why haven’t we done [this task]?”</p>
<p>“Oh, [task] is easy; we can do that any time.”</p>
<p>For example, one tester once was on a project that was completely oversold. The project team spent long weeks on the project. They even pulled all-nighters. But <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/estimating-testing-time-a-few-useful-guidelines/">the scope was too large for the timeframe and the staffing</a>. “The pressure on the company to produce a customer (and on the executive team) was such that the team was nearly run into the ground.”</p>
<p>This tester was lucky. After a wholesale change in upper management, a VP was sent to fire everyone in sight, after being told that the problems were the team’s fault. But this executive was astute enough to listen. The VP realized the problem wasn’t the staff, but the sales person and upper management who had sold the project. “He was able to slightly reset expectations with the customer, and we managed to put the project into production, producing a reference in the process.” Whew. One happy ending.</p>
<p>Others aren’t so fortunate. Don, a software consultant, found that “the surest single measure of increased likelihood of project failure is a management or owners who believe the task being performed is of one or more orders of magnitude less complexity than it actually is. This is usually reflected in poor or inept staffing… and other resource and planning shortfalls.”</p>
<h3>The C-suite gets involved</h3>
<p>If there’s no <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-do-a-product-evaluation-for-enterprise-software/">project champion</a>, by whatever job title, you should worry. Project sponsors need clout; the people above them have to respect them. Otherwise, while projects can be completed, they’re rarely transformational. However, the project champion also captures and communicates the team’s vision.</p>
<p>The sad alternative is when you see a big upswing in manager and upper-level manager check-ins. There’s a sudden surge in, “Is there anything we can do to help?” questions that would have been useful two months earlier.</p>
<p>Or personnel appear who aren’t integrated into the team. They don’t seem to have clear roles. For instance, a director from another department shows up, demanding to know why they weren’t consulted on the project, even though their superior had approved the process or task.</p>
<p>Another sign: Your project scope changes like the weather, for reasons you cannot fathom, and you have no ability to push back. As one techie described a too-familiar scenario: “The smoke of your burning deadlines will outline vast and terrible corporate gods who do not wish you well.”</p>
<h3>Project plan? What project plan?</h3>
<p>Often, those inaccurate expectations are a sign of earlier errors in analysis. A sure sign of failure is when time pressure exceeds normal limits – by far. “All of a sudden, you have loads of work to do, in ever-decreasing time intervals,” says a consultant who works in financial organizations. “This clearly shows that some points during the analysis and/or design phase was done horribly wrong.”</p>
<p>A related sign: The software is being built in parts, and nobody has integrated the parts yet. Especially if it’s because they don’t like to collaborate with the other authors.</p>
<p>There are <em>so</em> many variations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The project manager never presents a timeline, schedule, or milestone list.</li>
<li>A deadline for an important task is postponed more than two times.</li>
<li>Your weekly update call includes a lot of awkward silences. Or the definition of “done” drifts into science fiction.</li>
<li>You hear, “Are you sure this will take that long?”</li>
<li>Or they say, “Let’s use the occasion to also do &lt;big thing that’s completely unrelated&gt; while we have leverage.”</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to wait long for over-complicated expectations to emerge. Solomon adds, “When the chief architect explained the project, I started to count the tiers, and arrived at seven. A seven-tier architecture would contain so many chances to fail that I was immediately sure that the product would never see the customers. I was right. Twenty-three million Euros for nothing.”</p>
<h3>The attack of the killer accountants</h3>
<p>Your first clue: The snack closet doesn’t get refilled.</p>
<p>The more elaborate version: A random bean counter yells for the fainting couch when you submit a project expense line item has been utterly unremarkable during your entire tenure. Long-standing vendor contracts are scrutinized. Suddenly you need signoff from busybodies who have to render judgment on a critical spending component of your plan which nonetheless represents &lt;1% of the budgeted outlay.</p>
<p>The cost cutting isn’t logical. They don’t lay off an engineering team, which might be a hard-headed business decision. But they cancel required services, such as the organization’s Trello subscription.</p>
<h3>Inappropriate staffing</h3>
<p>Instead of dealing with the underlying problem – the team or the company can’t deliver what they’d promised – one way that poor management deals with the impending crisis is to hire or fire people. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-good-qa-director-and-a-great-one/">they often pick the wrong ones</a>. For example, in one project, Management felt the project was underfunded for the goals it was trying to reach.&nbsp;They couldn’t hire enough people with the right skills (that was too expensive) and caused the project to be slow to deliver.</p>
<p>When you can’t hire as many people as you need, you attempt to get more from the existing staff. In some cases, management threatens to lay people off if they don’t work harder. In one tester’s <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/3-reasons-to-stop-hating-one-on-one-meetings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-on-one session meeting</a>, the manager pointed out that the tester wasn’t at work in the evening. The tester told him he currently worked 50 hour weeks, and the company only paid for 37.5 hour weeks. The manager responded, “If you are not working 60 hour weeks, you are not working hard.” Ten minutes later, he added, “If you are not working hard, you are the list of people to be laid off.” The tester took the boss at his word. “I’m not sure if that project ever shipped. I quit and found a new job.”</p>
<p>How long do you wait before you recognize there’s a crisis? David’s ready to throw in the towel. He’s in a group that handles a couple dozen products, but David is the only developer, tester, and now manager. “I know the situation is bad. My company decided to fix the problem with people leaving or being laid off by building from the top. My program manager left, so naturally they replace him with a VP of Sales.” Two months …</p></div></div>

<p>It’s only a matter of time until we’re generating entire movies and shows. It’s startling to realize that Hollywood movies that cost $300M to produce today might be generated for a few cents within our lifetimes.</p>
<p>When the cost of something drops by a factor of a billion we should expect to see qualitatively different uses. It’d be a different medium. Not only would there be <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/714670494952370176">endless content</a>; there’d be endless content for any specific movie or TV show you could want. Generally speaking, AI will do for production what the internet did for distribution.</p>
<p>One of the amazing things about AI is how you can work at a high level of abstraction. Imagine adjusting sliders on your favorite movie to make it more gritty or funny. Or asking the AI to show you what Starwars would look like as directed by Christopher Nolan.<sup>1</sup> The same way you can use GPT-3 to write a <a href="https://arr.am/2020/07/09/gpt-3-an-ai-thats-eerily-good-at-writing-almost-anything/">Taylor Swift song about Harry Potter</a>, you could make a new Harry Potter movie starring Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>Language models already create new kinds of interactivity. One of the surprisingly fun things I’ve done with GPT-3 is to insert out of character behavior in the middle of a scene and&nbsp;watch the characters try to make sense of what happened.</p>

<p>Imagine a video form of this with your favorite characters.</p>
<p>Once we can generate high definition video and audio in real-time, these generative movies will become a different medium again – one you can inhabit.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayPqjPekn7g">already</a> <a href="https://www.latentspace.co/">companies</a> working on replacing 3D game engines like Unity with neural nets. In the limit, movies and games could merge into a single medium we might call Generative Reality.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>I don’t mean to say people will stop consuming passive entertainment. Just that the same software will create both, and that at any time you’ll not only be able to change anything about what you’re watching but also insert yourself into the story.</p>
<p>What we’ll probably see first are virtual people that are indistinguishable from real people – at least for short conversations. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/virtualbeings/permalink/967815567016992/">The</a> <a href="https://www.synthesia.io/">technology</a> is <a href="https://twitter.com/lishali88/status/1285014740029276162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1285014740029276162%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.com%2Fpost%2Farr.am%2F533">almost</a> there, and for some people, it <em>is</em> there. People are getting <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/replika-my-ai-friend/id1158555867#see-all/reviews">real emotional support</a> from chatbots, and they’ll be a lot more appealing when talking to them is indistinguishable from doing a video call with a friend (or with Abraham Lincoln or Professor Dumbledore). GPT-3 is already good at <a href="https://arr.am/2020/08/17/ai-tim-ferriss-interviews-ai-marcus-aurelius-gpt-3/">impersonating</a> <a href="https://aiwriter.app/sample/fac0734f03f5c2e388">people</a>. I expect licensing fictional and celebrity chatbots like Tony Stark or Lady Gaga will be a big business.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Before we get AI that can autonomously generate a full movie we’ll have increasingly powerful tools where humans guide the AI by selecting and combining the best outputs. This is the stage we’re at now with GPT-3. It’s generally coherent for only a paragraph or two, but if you have a human generating multiple paragraphs and picking the best one you can end up with <a href="https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1288554880144031744">surprisingly good results</a>.</p>
<p>Ira Glass <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wLP0izeJE&amp;t=69s">talks about</a> how when you get started as a maker, your taste exceeds your grasp because you lack technical proficiency. As AI tools become more powerful the technical skill required will decrease until good taste is all you need to make great art. Eventually though AI will create content that won’t be improved by human intervention.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>What timeline should we expect? The first tools for making generative movies (as well as real-time virtual people) seem only a matter of improvements on existing technology and putting them all together in a useable way.</p>
<p>One researcher I talked to told me I was underselling the whole thing and that fully generative movies could be here in under five years. That seems very fast to me, but what’s clear is that this is all closer than most people realize. Progress in AI has been <a href="https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/1084973596236144640?lang=en">frighteningly rapid</a> in the last five years. When I first started sharing samples of text generated by GPT-3 the main reaction I got was disbelief. Most <a href="https://twitter.com/wolfgang_xl/status/1290452261425029126">people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BruceHoult/status/1290482776622342145">thought</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/aPosteriorChain/status/1284164529048309762">it</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/erroraptor/status/1289592150527635458">was</a> a <a href="https://twitter.com/arram/status/1281995747924180992">hoax</a> and that there was no way an AI could have written that.</p>
<p>Combine photorealism with convincing virtual people and endless personalized stories and worlds to explore and it’s hard to imagine a more entertaining form of entertainment. We’d have the kind of simulated reality that philosophers have long built <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/table/the-experience-machine">thought experiments</a> around.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>This will be addictive. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/11/avatar.movie.blues/">Thousands of people were depressed after watching Avatar</a> because their real lives weren’t as appealing. It’s simultaneously exciting and worrying to imagine what would happen if people could live inside the movie.</p>
<p>It’ll be especially addictive if we use AI to discover what we want. By <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137">watching us interact with content</a>, it could learn what we want better than we understand it ourselves.</p>
<p>I hesitate to predict this is the end of civilization since that sort of prediction is <a href="https://pessimists.co/">famously</a> usually wrong, but it’s worrying to imagine alternate realities so compelling that people no longer engage with the real one.<sup>6</sup> Most animals, including humans, are susceptible to <a href="https://www.sparringmind.com/supernormal-stimuli/">superstimulus</a>. When Google tried using AI to develop the best chocolate chip cookie recipe, the solution it converged on was to make the cookie out of solid chocolate.</p>
<p>What I’m describing isn’t just a single superstimulus, but an <a href="http://consc.net/papers/virtual.pdf">entire reality</a> made of superstimuli. What will reality look like when it’s made out of solid chocolate? We might find out.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Ben Mann, Amanda Askell, Nick Cammarata, Emmett Shear, and Ian Thompson for reading drafts of this essay.</em></p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>1. I expect one of the most popular uses will be people creating more content from fandoms people already love. There are 800,000 Harry Potter stories on fanfiction.net.</p>
<p>2. Game engines today have a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1291889682788253696">practical uses</a> beyond games which would also be impacted by Generative Reality.</p>
<p>3. You could argue that the need for canned NPC dialogue is one of the biggest things holding games back as an art form compared to books or movies. GPT-3 obviates it.</p>
<p>4. Generative Reality is trivially possible if we create superintelligence, but the thing I want to point at here is that even without superintelligence it appears to be not only possible but not very far away. (For what it’s worth, I also suspect that Artificial General Intelligence isn’t much further off than Generative Reality.)</p>
<p>5. Like all guesses at the future, this essay looks at a handful of trends and ignores all the others. While Generative Reality seems possible, a few of the basic assumptions it holds are that humans will continue to exist and that they’ll remain relatively unchanged.</p>
<p>6. We’d still be missing important technologies for fully immersive virtual reality, such as haptics, but once VR becomes very popular there will be a tremendous economic incentive to improve it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.home-assistant.io/images/blog/2020-09-15-home-assistant-tags/tag-reader.jpg" alt="Photo of a Tag Reader"></p>
<p>RFID tags have been on my radar for home automation since <a href="https://github.com/hoveeman" rel="external nofollow">@hoveeman</a> published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvCseOQidSw" rel="external nofollow">this video</a> two years ago of him using RFID cards to play music in his house.</p>
<p>It has been <a href="https://twitter.com/balloob/status/1256728762680393728?s=12" rel="external nofollow">my dream</a> ever since to get this easily accessible to every Home Assistant user. It already got a lot more accessible when <a href="https://github.com/maddox" rel="external nofollow">@maddox</a> released <a href="https://github.com/maddox/magic-cards" rel="external nofollow">Magic Cards</a>. But this was still a separate application that you had to run besides Home Assistant, and it required a separate RFID reader.</p>
<p>Can we do better? Yes, we can. Today we are introducing <b>Home Assistant Tags</b>. A collaboration between our iOS, Android, frontend, core and hardware groups. With Home Assistant Tags, we’re making scannable tags (NFC/RFID) a first-class citizen in Home Assistant. Easy to read, write and automate!</p>
<h2>
<a name="the-apps" href="#the-apps"></a> The Apps</h2>
<p>The official Home Assistant apps have been updated with NFC support. This dramatically lowers the bar for starting to automate your house with NFC tags. All you need now is tags!</p>
<p>From the apps you can now write a special Home Assistant URL to tags. Once you hover over one of these tags with your phone, they will trigger the Home Assistant app and send the identifier to your Home Assistant instance for processing. Tags are not bound to the phone that wrote them, any phone can scan them.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/david-development" rel="external nofollow">@David-Development</a> for the NFC support in the Android app and thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zacwest" rel="external nofollow">@zacwest</a> for the NFC support in the iOS app.</p>

</p>
<p>
Only iPhone XS, XR and iPhone 11 or later support background NFC tag reading.
</p>
<h2>
<a name="standalone-tag-reader" href="#standalone-tag-reader"></a> Standalone Tag Reader</h2>
<p>Having mobile tag readers is great, but there is more! The original RFID jukebox that peaked my interest worked with a dedicated RFID reader. This RFID reader was connected to a Raspberry Pi that was running a script to read the tags and send them to Home Assistant.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://www.home-assistant.io/images/blog/2020-09-15-home-assistant-tags/old-system.jpg" alt="Photo of the old system">
Photo of the old system.
</p>
<p>These solutions work great but were bulky and required hardware skills and technical skills to set up. The hardware cost for building a single reader could be around $30 (RFID reader + Raspberry Pi 0), but that’s just for 1 room. What if you want more rooms? That adds up quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adonno" rel="external nofollow">@adonno</a>, with the help of <a href="https://github.com/magnusoverli" rel="external nofollow">@MagnusO</a>, has been working on a smaller tag reader based on <a href="https://www.esphome.io/" rel="external nofollow">ESPHome</a>. It’s powered by an ESP8266 chip and a PN532 NFC module. The case is 3D printed.</p>
<p>Because it’s powered by ESPHome, setting up is a breeze. Once powered on, it will create an access point that allows you to add your WiFi configuration. After that Home Assistant will pick it up and you can start scanning tags.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.home-assistant.io/images/blog/2020-09-15-home-assistant-tags/orange-reader.jpg" alt="Photo of a tag reader with orange accents"></p>
<p>The nice thing about standalone tag readers is that they are dedicated to a room. This means automations know in which room to act when a music card is scanned and can pick the right media player. This makes it easy to have cards that can work in every room.</p>
<p>The tag reader is open-source and <a href="https://github.com/adonno/tagreader" rel="external nofollow">available on GitHub</a>. You can make one yourself or buy one of the pre-built ones or DIY kits that Adonno is <a href="https://adonno-crafts.myshopify.com/" rel="external nofollow">selling</a>.</p>

<a name="managing-tags-in-home-assistant-0115" href="#managing-tags-in-home-assistant-0115"></a> Managing Tags in Home Assistant 0.115</h2>
<p>Home Assistant 0.115 will contain a brand new tag manager, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bramkragten" rel="external nofollow">@bramkragten</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dmulcahey" rel="external nofollow">@dmulcahey</a>. On this screen you can create new tags, see the tags that have been scanned and can easily create automations for each tag. The new UI tightly integrates with the mobile apps, allowing you to write existing IDs to new tags with the tap of a button.</p>

September 15, 2020 | https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-bypassing-flash-encryption/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-bypassing-flash-encryption/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In our <a href="https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-controlling-pc-during-sb/">previous post</a> we described an attack where we load an arbitrary value indirectly into the PC register using <strong>EMFI</strong>. During that attack we achieved our initial goal where we wanted to last year's research, where we turn <strong>Data Transfers</strong> into <strong>Code Execution</strong>, into practice.</p>
<p>As we already pointed out, the <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> feature of the <strong>ESP32</strong> chip, which <strong>Espressif</strong> advises to use, significantly increases the complexity for bypassing <strong>Secure Boot</strong>. The typical approach of making modifications to the plain-text code or data stored in external flash is not possible any more once <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> is enabled.</p>
<p>In this post we describe an attack where we leverage the (hardware) vulnerability described in our <a href="https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-controlling-pc-during-sb/">previous post</a> in combination with another vulnerability (i.e. <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/advisory_downloads/Security%20Advisory%20CVE-2020-15048%2C%2013629%20EN%26CN.pdf" target="_blank">CVE-2020-15048</a>) in order to load an arbitrary value into the PC register.</p>

<p>The <strong>ESP32</strong> supports <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v3.2/security/flash-encryption.html" target="_blank">Flash Encryption</a> which is used to assure the confidentiality of the code and data stored in external flash. Interestingly, decryption of the data is done transparently to the processor by the flash controller. It uses a tweaked <strong>AES-256</strong> hardware implementation to assure the plain-text data cannot be obtained from the cipher-text without knowledge of the decryption key.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-flash-encryption.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-flash-encryption.png" width="700px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>The <strong>decryption key</strong> is stored in <strong>OTP-memory</strong> and cannot be access directly from software. This secure key storage was found to be vulnerable to a <strong>Fault Injection</strong> attack for which the results are <a href="https://limitedresults.com/2019/11/pwn-the-esp32-forever-flash-encryption-and-sec-boot-keys-extraction/" target="_blank">published</a>. Our attack is not related to this research.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the <strong>decryption key</strong> is actually not used as-is. It is actually used to generate unique keys for each 32-byte block in the external flash. This is likely done to mitigate several of the issues applicable when the standard <strong>AES-256</strong> algorithm is used. These issues are mostly related to the <strong>cipher mode</strong> that is used as the underlying cryptographic algorithm is sufficiently secure. For example, when <strong>ECB</strong> mode is used it's possible to swap blocks and when <strong>CBC</strong> mode is used it's possible to flip bits.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as the <strong>unique keys</strong> are only generated for each 32-byte block, and the block-size of the underlying cryptographic algorithm is 16 bytes, adjacent blocks are still encrypted with the same key. This is exactly what we leverage, in combination with several design and implementation issues, to bypass <strong>Secure Boot</strong> using a very similar attack as described in our <a href="https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-controlling-pc-during-sb/">previous post</a>.</p>

<h4 id="flash-communication">Flash communication</h4>
<p>The chip's communication with the external flash, shown in the picture below, already indicated to us that there were more stages loaded during boot than just the <strong>bootloader</strong>.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-spi-pin1-during-boot.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-spi-pin1-during-boot.png" width="600px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>We observe several patterns during which different parts of the external flash are copied from external flash to internal memory. Without further investigation we do not exactly know what the parts are.</p>
<h4 id="rom-printing">ROM printing</h4>
<p>Conveniently, the <strong>ROM</strong> prints during its execution, on the serial interface, information about these parts. This printing cannot be disabled as far as we know and is therefore always available. This information allows us to know, without analyzing the flash communication itself, exactly when what is copied.</p>
<p>We concluded the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>+ load:0x3fff0008,len:4         &lt;-- C
</span><span>+ load:0x3fff000c,len:3220      &lt;-- D
</span><span>+ load:0x40078000,len:4816      &lt;-- E
</span><span>+ load:0x40080400,len:18640     &lt;-- F

</span></code></pre></div><p>The <strong>ROM</strong> extracts the <strong>load address</strong> and <strong>length</strong> for each part from the external flash itself. This information is stored in so-called headers which is stored at the beginning of each part. For example, the header for part '<strong>C</strong>' is shown below. The last two 4-byte words are the <strong>load</strong> and <strong>len</strong> in the above snippet.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">00001010    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 08 00 FF 3F 04 00 00 00
</code></pre></div><p>It's important to realize that this information is printed before any signature is verified. For example, the <strong>ROM</strong> will print the following if these values are set to <code>0x41414141</code>, even though it will result in a chip that does not boot as these values are invalid. Note, <code>1094795585</code> is <code>0x41414141</code> in decimal.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff">load:0x41414141,len:1094795585
</code></pre></div><h4 id="encryption">Encryption</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, all data is encrypted once <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> is enabled, including these headers. This means we cannot simply set the values contained in the header to arbitrary values as they will be decrypted into garbage as we do this research under the assumption that we do not have access to the decryption key.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Espressif's SDK stores the different parts of the flash image next to each other. This is shown in the picture below.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff">...

</code></pre></div><p>The <span>green</span> data is loaded during part '<strong>E</strong>' and the <span>red</span> data is loaded during part '<strong>F</strong>'. The last 16-byte block of part '<strong>E</strong>' is encrypted with the same key as the first 16-byte block of part '<strong>F</strong>'.</p>
<p>Interestingly, because last block of part '<strong>E</strong>' and the first block of part '<strong>F</strong>' are encrypted with the same key, we can leak the last two 4-byte words of part '<strong>E</strong>'. This works as the first block of part '<strong>F</strong>' is actually the header that contains the information that is printed on the serial interface prior to the <strong>Secure Boot</strong> check.</p>
<p>For example, if we overwrite the last block of part '<strong>E</strong>' with the first block of part '<strong>F</strong>', the <strong>ROM</strong> prints the following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>+ load:0x3fff0008,len:4
</span><span>+ load:0x3fff000c,len:3220
</span><span>+ load:0x40078000,len:4816
</span><span></span><span>- load:0x40007a5c,len:2349373696    # last two 4-byte words of part 'E'
</span><span></span><span>+ entry 0x40080740
</span></code></pre></div><p>Please note that the both blocks are encrypted and we actually copy an encrypted block over another encrypted block. We cannot do anything else as we assume we do not have access to the <strong>decryption key</strong>, similarly as a real-world attacker.</p>
<h4 id="brute-forcing">Brute forcing</h4>
<p>This sequence of choices made during the design and implementation of the <strong>ESP32</strong>'s <strong>Secure Boot</strong> implementation allows us to <strong>brute force</strong> arbitrary values of the last two 4-byte words of part '<strong>E</strong>'. Nonetheless, brute forcing an arbitrary value, considering we do roughly 10 experiments per second, takes more than 10 years (i.e. search space is 2^32). Optimizations are likely possible, but we did not investigate this.</p>
<p>Regardless if we can optimize the brute force to something reasonable, we do not know if it's even feasible to load a value into the PC register if we can only control a single 4-byte value. Therefore, we decided to determine exactly that before we deal with the limitations imposed to us by the brute force requirement.</p>

<h4 id="approach">Approach</h4>
<p>We are performing the attacks on a development board and therefore we are able to set the <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> keys. It allows us to identify if the attack is applicable using a fully controlled environment. Even though a real-world attacker is unable to do so, it's not unlikely an attack will do the vulnerability identification on a development board as well.</p>
<p>We started our experiments by overwriting part '<strong>E</strong>', in a plain-text flash image, entirely with address pointers to a function in <strong>ROM</strong> that prints something on the serial interfaces. This is the exact same address we used for identifying a successful glitch as during the attack described in the <a href="https://raelize.com/espressif-systems-esp32-controlling-pc-during-sb/">previous post</a>. This part is stored in flash from address <code>0x1cc0</code> to address <code>0x2f90</code>.</p>
<p>Then, we encrypt the plain-text flash image with the correct encryption key and program the encrypted result using the <strong>ESP32 SDK</strong>. This allows us to make arbitrary modifications to the plain-text flash image. Of course, this is definitely not possible by a real-world attacker as the encryption key will not be known. Nonetheless, this is definitely a valid approach for working towards attack identification.</p>
<h4 id="initial-experiments">Initial experiments</h4>
<p>For our first experiments we injected glitches while part '<strong>E</strong>' was being copied by the processor from external flash to internal memory. Even though this <strong>attack window</strong> is rather large, we are really affected by timing as we know that part '<strong>E</strong>' is entirely overwritten with the address pointer.</p>
<p>The results of this campaign are shown in the picture below.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-1.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-1.png" width="600px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed four experiments for which we execute <strong>ROM</strong> function successfully. As anticipated, the successful results are spread out across the <strong>attack window</strong>. Like with the other attacks performed on the <strong>ESP32</strong> chip so far, we are able to reproduce the attacks with a high success rate (i.e. higher than once per minute).</p>
<h4 id="working-towards-success">Working towards success</h4>
<p>We set the glitch parameters to that of the successful glitch that is closest to the end of part '<strong>E</strong>'. The two 4-byte words that we can potentially brute force are copied last as they are present in the last 16-byte block of part '<strong>E</strong>'.</p>
<p>Then, we slow start overwriting part '<strong>E</strong>' with 0x100 byte chunks of <code>0x41</code> bytes until we cannot reproduce the successful glitch any more. This tells us exactly, which 0x100 byte chunk of data contains the pointer that is loaded into the PC register. For this first result we concluded the pointer is taken from the chunk at offset <code>0x2a00</code>.</p>
<p>Then, we start targeting the remaining <strong>attack window</strong> again in order to find a successful glitch closer to the end of part '<strong>E</strong>'. After a couple hours of testing we identified a successful glitch for which the result is shown in the picture below.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-2.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-2.png" width="600px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>Again, we fix the glitch parameters and we slowly start overwriting part '<strong>E</strong>' again until we cannot reproduce the attack anymore. This time we concluded the pointer is taken from the chunk at offset <code>0x2c00</code>.</p>
<p>Then, we start targeting the remaining <strong>attack window</strong> again in order to find a successful glitch closer to the end of part '<strong>E</strong>' which is shown in the picture below.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-3.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-3.png" width="600px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>At this point it was late at night and the temperature in our office dropped significantly. As a result, we observed alterations in the behavior of the chip compared to the previous experiments. The result was that we could not reproduce the successful glitches any more.</p></article></div>

<p><strong>It always takes more time</strong><br>
…to lose weight<br>
…to gain weight<br>
…to build good habits<br>
…to get rid of bad habits<br>
…to arrive on time<br>
…to finish the project on time<br>

<p><strong>But that is OK</strong>. All we have to do is push forward. Every day. Giving our all.
And account that everything will take longer than we want it. Most of the time.</p>

<p>Two months ago, I started building a “simple” job board - <a href="https://99remotejobs.com/" target="_blank">99remotejobs.com</a>.
I thought it would take me a week. It took a month!</p>

<p>This short post was supposed to take me only 15 minutes, of course, yet it took 40.</p>

<p>When I started <a href="https://www.saashub.com/" target="_blank">SaaSHub</a> I though AND CALCULATED that
if the project had 10,000 visitors a day, I would be all set - making enough
passive income to have a comfortable life. That was naive. It will take much more.
The project has about 8,000 visitors a day today (80% of my initial target),
and it is making only 15% of my target.
But that is OK. I keep pushing forward - every day.</p>

<p>The moral of the story - be prepared both psychologically and financially that
our endeavours will take more time. If you are pressed to give an end date of a
project, multiply by 2 your initial guess (yes, it is a guess) and then
extend it a bit more.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently finished reading a reinforcement learning textbook (by Barto and Sutton), and throughout it I was constantly vexed by one important assumption that underlined all the algorithms: the Markov property, stating that a succeeding event depends only on the one preceding it, and not on ones far in the past. This kind of restriction is a helpful tool both practically and theoretically, but it causes problems when dealing with a rather natural situation where there is long-term dependence between events. The book doesn’t address this, so I tried to, and found out it’s a genuine problem with real research behind it. Here’s what I did.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://github.com/corazza/reinforcement-learning">here’s the Rust code</a> I wrote that includes several algorithm and environment implementations taken from the book and also my method for this dependence problem.</p>

<p>But first, a brief explanation of the basic concepts:</p>

<h2 id="the-basics-of-reinforcement-learning">The basics of reinforcement learning</h2>

<p>The point of RL algorithms is to learn a policy (for achieving some goal) from interacting with an environment. A policy is a mapping from states to actions (or, a mapping from actions to probabilities of taking them in some particular state), which is followed by an RL <em>agent</em>. The interaction consists of the agent taking actions which causes the environment to undergo state transitions and provide the agent with a <em>reward signal</em> evaluating its performance in achieving the goal. The point isn’t chasing after immediate rewards, but maximizing overall <em>cumulative reward</em> (or gain) from the interaction.</p>

<p>Many tasks can successfully be formulated in this framework: a game of chess where all moves give a reward of 0, except a win resulting in a reward of 1 and loss resulting in a reward of -1 (a draw also being 0).</p>

<p>The algorithms accomplish policy improvement indirectly by estimating the <em>value</em> of the environment’s states (or <code>(state, action)</code> pairs), and modifying the policy to better reflect that knowledge. Value is defined as the gain (cumulative reward) following a state (or state-action pair). If you are in state <code>S_t</code> with available actions <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code>, then knowing that the state-action pair <code>(S_t, A1)</code> is <em>more valuable</em> than <code>(S_t, A2)</code> should be reflected in your policy so that the probability of taking <code>A1</code> is no less than the probability of taking <code>A2</code>.</p>

<p>This incremental process is called <em>Generalized Policy Iteration</em> and is a strong contender for the core idea of reinforcement learning. It actually consists of two competing processes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Policy evaluation</strong>: for a given policy, estimate the values of states or state-action pairs for the agent following that policy (i.e. learn the <strong>value function</strong> of the policy)</li>
  <li><strong>Policy improvement</strong>: for a given value function, change the policy so that it is more likely to result in more valuable behavior (e.g. by making it greedy with respect to the learned value function)</li>
</ol>

<p>An important theoretical result that enables this is the <em>Policy improvement theorem</em>, which justifies the policy improvement step. It assures that the resulting policy is either strictly better, or that the original policy is already optimal. (There’s some very interesting math here derived from Bellman optimality equations, but I won’t get into that here.)</p>

<p>Another important idea is that the crucial problem all RL algorithms solve can be thought of as <strong>credit assignment</strong>, i.e. giving credit for future outcomes to past behavior.</p>

<h2 id="the-markov-property-and-breaking-it">The Markov property and breaking it</h2>

<p>The interaction process is a sequence of random variables: <code>(S_0, A_0, R_1, S_1, A_1, R_2, ...)</code> called a <strong>Markov decision process</strong>. This is where the Markov property comes into play: it is a restriction on the environment/interaction dynamics stating that the probability of the next state and reward is a <em>function of the previous state and action taken.</em> The only information that determines the probabilities of transitioning into <code>S_{t+1}</code> with reward <code>R_{t+1}</code> is the pair <code>(S_t, A_t)</code> (these probabilities usually aren’t known, however).</p>

<p>The restriction is worthwhile: it underlies the convergence proofs for estimating values and guarantees that policy iteration is possible and finds the optimal policy in the limit. Many examples of environments satisfy the Markov property so you can still get far. It also guarantees that it is possible to encode knowledge about values of states and actions “locally”: that we can rely on the gain following a taken action to really be due to that action, and not some past one. The relation to the credit assignment problem is obvious.</p>

<p>But it is also a genuine restriction that bothered me while reading: it’s not difficult to come up with meaningful tasks/environments where the Markov property <em>does not</em> hold. After finishing the book I wanted to see how hard it would be to modify the algorithms to handle credit assignment in these non-Markov environments. First, here’s an example of such a case:</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhngozzmz/image/upload/v1600199392/IMG_20200915_215137_hfurfg.jpg" alt="corridor"></p>

<p>The task here is simple. There is a corridor that ends with a choice: up or down. On each trial, one of these paths is randomly <em>trapped</em>, meaning that taking it results in a large negative reward (the other path gives a positive reward). All other actions give a small negative reward to incentivize moving forward. The crucial part is that the location of the trap is <em>observable</em> but <strong>only at the start of the corridor</strong>. Afterwards, this information is unavailable.</p>

<p>Why does this break the Markov property? Because in the final state i.e. the “split” where the up/down decision has to be made, the reward probabilities depend on the starting state, i.e. on the observation made there. The choice “up” doesn’t have a set of probabilities for receiving rewards, but rather the probabilities are a function of what the agent had observed sometime in the past. The knowledge of the value of available actions cannot be encoded locally at the split state alone.</p>

<p>This is the general form of many of these Markov-breaking examples: long-term dependence of future events on past events. And none of the algorithms from the book can solve this example, even though it seems to correspond to a reasonable task.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>I came up with a simple solution and it works, although only if certain requirements are met by the algorithm. Later I found out that people already worked on this problem (of course), but I’m still glad I independently identified it and had a working solution.</p>

<p>The solution is giving agents a few bits memory and actions for mutating them. In fact, for the corridor problem, a single bit will suffice. But this has to be done <em>transparently</em>, with minimal changes to the algorithm itself. More precisely the agent should have its <code>(state, action)</code> pairs extended at each step: the state <code>S_t</code> becomes <code>(S_t, MS_t)</code> and the action <code>A_t</code> becomes <code>(A_t, MA_t)</code>, where <code>MS</code> and <code>MA</code> denote memory-state and memory-action. Effectively this means that you can take a regular RL algorithm and give it, in each step of the interaction, the ability to read and write to memory <code>M</code> (which can generally be a bit array), and <code>M</code> becomes a part of the environment state from the perspective of the agent–this is how the “transparency” is accomplished. The reading and writing of memory has to be completely subject to learning.</p>

<p>How can this solve the corridor problem? Well, for one, now it is at least <em>possible</em> to have a policy that solves it! The policy is simple: in the beginning, depending on the observation that tells the agent where the trap lies, either flip the bit or don’t (it starts in 0, always). Afterwards, don’t touch the bit (noop). Then, at the split where the up/down decision has to be made, your state is no longer <code>S_t=Split</code>, but <code>(S_t, M_t)=(Split, m)</code>, and <code>m</code> tells you the observation from the past! The policy at this stage has encoded the value for going up or down that is dependent on the memory set at the beginning: we’ve handled temporal dependency between the observation event and the decision event.</p>

<p>But the harder question is: can this policy actually be learned?</p>

<h2 id="the-limitation">The limitation</h2>

<p>To understand when this policy is learnable and when it is not, and why, it is best to look at the simplest RL control algorithm, SARSA, named after the basic segment in a Markov decision process <code>(S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})</code>. There’s no need to spell it out in detail, it only has two crucial parts corresponding to the two competing processes in Generalized Policy Iteration. Here, <code>Q(s, a)</code> denotes the state-action value function that the algorithm is learning, and epsilon-greedy means choosing an action that is best according to <code>Q</code> most of the time (with <code>1 - epsilon</code> probability) and a random action some of the time (with <code>epsilon</code> probability).</p>

<p>For each step of the episode:</p>

<ol>
  <li>From <code>S_t</code> take action <code>A_t</code>, observe transition to <code>S_{t+1}</code> with reward <code>R_{t+1}</code></li>
  <li>Choose next action <code>A_{t+1}</code> so that it is epsilon-greedy with respect to <code>Q</code> <em>(policy improvement)</em></li>
  <li>Update <code>Q(S_t, A_t)</code> slightly towards a new target value <code>R_{t+1} + Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})</code> <em>(policy evaluation)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The update target is the most important part: <code>R_{t+1} + Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})</code> is a new estimate of the <em>gain</em> following <code>S_t</code> after <code>A_t</code> is taken, and what’s interesting is that it only takes into account the immediate reward and not rewards that come afterwards. However gain isn’t just the immediate reward: it is the cumulative reward, i.e. the sum of all rewards. Correcting that is the role of the <code>Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})</code> term, the value of the succeeding state-action pair. As I said in the introduction, value functions represent the gain following a state-action pair.</p>

<p>My Rust code for SARSA is <a href="https://github.com/corazza/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/src/learner/sarsa.rs#L18">here</a>, it has more details.</p>

<p>Can this algorithm learn a policy that solves the corridor problem? Well, no. Too bad! Why? Because of the <strong>credit assignment problem</strong>. The algorithm cannot <em>give credit</em> to the action of <em>remembering the observation</em> because it only gives credit one step backwards! Here’s an illustration:</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhngozzmz/image/upload/v1600197120/IMG_20200915_211311_e6xpgb.jpg" alt="crediting"></p>

<p>The agent moves from <code>S</code> into either <code>U</code> or <code>L</code> and this state represents the observation. Then it moves into the corridor <code>C(1)</code> (there can be multiple corridor …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div><p>
                Hello!

                These are the results of a survey I posted recently, which aimed to ask the Github userbase what their
                thoughts on the controversial change of the default branch on Github (and by extension, Git) from 'master'
                to an alternative phrase like 'main' or 'trunk'.

                The name change was proposed as a response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, demanding equal rights
                and restructure of the American police system in response to the violent, tragic and reckless murders of
                innocent black men, women and children at the hands of police.
                
                </p><p>
                This proposed change has divided opinions within Github's user base. Github has claimed that the use of the word
                'master' has connotations to slavery in many countries, and it is being changed to make black developers feel
                more comfortable on the platform. However, many others have argued that the change is meaningless to the cause,
                distracts the public from the actual issues faced by real black people, and that the change breaks CI solutions
                and other habits. However, many others also support the change, believing that it is expanding inclusivity, and
                it is also a chance to change the name of the branch to something more meaningful or a name which expresses the
                branch's purpose more clearly.

                </p><p>
                In the wake of this, I decided to create this survey to ask the users of Github directly what they thought about
                the change. I also decided to collect information about the responder's ethnicity, country of residence and gender,
                in order to gauge the demographics which were mainly for and against the change.

                The survey spanned many different countries, reaching people who identified with around 16 different
                ethnic groups. The survey was also taken by several people who did not identify as either male or female.
                However, the majority of people who responded were white, and the most prevalent gender identity to respond
                was male, followed up by females. This was expected based on how the majority of people involved in computer
                science (and therefore, users of Github) are white males. Despite this however, many users chose not to
                disclose their gender identity, so the true distribution is not known.

                Perhaps unsurprisingly, the United States came in with the most responses by 29.5%, followed closely by many
                European countries. I did not list all countries in Europe, but many responses from other countries in Europe
                responded, taking up about 29% of all responses. Based on the ethnic data, I'm guessing most of these are from
                countries like Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, and so on. In hindsight, I probably should have included more
                countries in the list.

                The general opinion for most users is that they are <b>against</b> this change. 70% of all participants said
                that they are against the change, with only 15.7% being in support of the change. The other 14.3% fall under
                'Maybe' and 'Don't care', though their actual opinions are usually mixed and lean towards one of the two main
                options. Based on the written responses from users who were asked to explain their responses, most reasoning
                for their responses is as follows:
                </p><p>
                <b>For</b></p></div><ul>
                    <li>It is outdated terminology, and changing it from 'master' to some other alternative in order to create
                        a more inclusive space is worth the effort.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an opportunity to pick a more meaningful name which better expresses what the branch actually does.
                        It is difficult to understand exactly what 'master' means on first encounter, whereas something like 'main'
                        would make much more sense.
                    </li>
                    <li>The name 'master' simply doesn't make sense to some users. It is now legacy terminology, and holding onto
                        it would simply be impractical.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some are not bothered either way, but feel that if individuals are offended by it they are supportive of
                        changing it to something else.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Against</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This action is being taken as a form of 'virtue signalling', Github and Microsoft merely did this in order
                        to jump onto a bandwagon while the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum on social media.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several African Americans who responded stated that it was <i>more</i> offensive to change it, since it
                        comes across as white people "thinking we are "vulnerable" and need protecting" from a word which they
                        understand has multiple meanings in different contexts.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an impractical change which will break workflows, continuous integration (CI) setups and several other
                        automated scripts which will require manual fixing later.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using the word 'master' depends on the context being used. In Git, it is widely understood that the word
                        'master' is used to mean master copy (the original copy which all derivatives are made from), and nobody
                        associates the word in this context with it's master/slave connotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several git tutorials and walkthroughs will become obselete.</li>
                    <li>It is introducing politics into a website which is not and has not ever been involved in politics, and it
                        is creating a social issue where there actually isn't one to begin with.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                It is clear that most users believe it is an unnecessary change, which breaks automated workflows, is insensitive
                given the current political landscape in the world, offensive to the group of people they are trying to be inclusive
                of, and suggests that Github and/or Microsoft are simply only interested in doing this to gain favor in public opinion.
            
                <p>
                However, some users also believe that it is time to rid the industry of questionable terminology, which could possibly
                offend certain people, is confusing and unclear in its meaning given the context it is used in, and should be
                swapped out with clearer and less ambiguous terminology.

                </p><p>
                Those who were in support of the change were asked to pick from a list of alternative names for the branch which they
                preferred, or suggest their own. The most popular one chosen by participants was 'main' with 47.6% of votes, followed
                by 'trunk' with 14.3%. Several other names were suggested which are listed below.

            <h2>Correlations</h2>
            <p>
                I originally ran this survey with the goal of discovering some kind of correlation between the different demographic
                groups which make up Github's user base, and how positive/negative their support is in relation to this issue. I also
                wanted to see which group was most supportive of the change, which group was least supportive, and how much the 
                response changed between ethnicities, genders and countries.
            </p>

            <div><p>
                Something I was not expecting when gathering the data for this survey is that every single African American who
                answered the survey responded 'No' in support of the change. Not only that, when asked to explain their reasoning,
                all of them sounded fairly spiteful towards Github and it's executives, since they felt that these decisions were
                made by white executives who didn't actually consider whether it offended them or not, and these responses suggest
                that they were more offended by Github feeling the need to change it in the first place.
                
                </p><p>
                You can also see that most of the users in support of this change are of either caucasian or asian descent, while
                more marginalised groups like africans, indians, hispanics and otherwise are almost universally against the changes,
                reflecting that the main ethnic group which feels the need to change it (and take offense to it) are white.

This means that the regret an investor could have for missing a winning early stage investment is theoretically infinite. Theoretically infinite regret is not a particularly helpful concept, so consider the corollary to this: <strong>With a power law with an alpha less than two, the largest expected return multiple per investment increases faster than the number of investments made.</strong></p><p>The graph to the right <a href="http://reactionwheel.net/2015/06/power-laws-in-venture.html">illustrates this concept</a>. The x-axis is the number of picks and the y-axis the largest expected return multiple. The green line shows (for alpha = 1.9) the effect of increasing the number of investments vs the largest expected return multiple per investment. This illustrates that fund performance is likely improved with a larger number of investments. The lower the alpha, the more pronounced this trend becomes (i.e. the curve is steeper for alpha = 1.75 than for 1.95).&nbsp;</p><h3>Independent B2B SaaS company outcomes are power law distributed</h3><p>Does this also apply to Independent SaaS companies?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>JDK 15 hit General Availability today. While I spend most of my time in Kotlin these days, I do keep a close on Java, as it still has
a special place in my heart, so I thought I’d make a quick post highlighting some of its new features. :) There are quite a few changes
in the release, so I’ll list all of them, but focus on the ones I think most developers will find more interesting.</p>


<div>
<h2 id="general-notes">General Notes</h2>
<div>
<p>There are some pretty techincal changes here (it seems to me) that <strong>most</strong> people won’t care about. If you’re into crypto, the EdDSA change might be of interest,. If you’re performance-sensitive, ZGC will likely pique your interest, and if you’re a framework developer, hidden classes sound pretty awesome. Solaris, RMI, and Javascript users, though, may be in for a slight disappointment, but these changes were telegraphed long ago, so they shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>
<p>For my money, the most interesting (read as: applicable to me) are</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sealed classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pattern matching instanceof</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text blocks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Records</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Let’s take a super quick looks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="sealed-classes">Sealed Classes</h2>
<div>
<p>There’s a good chance that at some point in your career, you’ve needed to define a hierarchy of classes and control where it can be extended. In languages like Kotlin, there is the <code>sealed</code> modifier that prevents the class from being extended without permission, so to speak. In Java however, you’re carefully curated list of system status codes, say, can be extended willy nill by any and all. Until now. the new feature, for those not familiar with the concept, allows the developer to "seal" a class, preventing its extension by all except a special few. In it’s simplest form, it might look like this:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">abstract sealed class Shape {
    abstract public draw();
}

final class Square extends Shape {
    public draw() {
    }
}

final class Circle extends Shape {
    public draw() {
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this example, <code>Shape</code> is abstract (though it need not be), and there are only two available shapes: <code>Square</code> and <code>Circle</code>. In this example, all three classes are declared in the same file, but, unlike, say, Kotlin, that need not be the case. If your classes are complex, have a lot of code, etc., and it would be better from a maintainability perspective, say, to have them in separate files, the compiler will let you do that, but you have to tell it which
classes are allowed to participate:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">public abstract sealed class Shape
    permits fully.qualified.class.Square,
            fully.qualified.class.in.another.package.Circle {
        ...
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Interfaces can also be sealed, with all of the same rules applying.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="pattern-matching-instanceof-preview-feature">Pattern-matching instanceof (Preview feature)</h2>
<div>
<p>For years, we’ve used <code>instanceof</code> to test the type of a variable, and for years, immediately after, we’ve type-casted that variable so we can use it:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">if (foo instanceof Interface1) {
    ((Interface1)foo).someMethod();
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Having to type (har har) twice was a bit annoying. JDK 15 brings a new syntax that lets us reduce that:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">if (foo instanceof Interface1 f) {
    f.someMethod();
} else {
    f.someOtherMethod(); // compiler error
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice that we can declare a variable after the <code>instanceof</code> check that we can then use in the <code>true</code> branch of the <code>if</code>. The variable is <em>not</em> available in the <code>else</code>.</p>
<p>This does not currently work in a <code>switch</code> statement, but that change is expected to come as well. This is only a preview feature so we can kick its tires, so use it with caution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="text-blocks">Text blocks</h2>
<div>
<p>One of the things I’ve loved about Kotlin is the ability to write multi-line strings and let the compiler do the hardwork for me. For example.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="kotlin">val foo = """
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus luctus
    finibus velit dictum lacinia.
    """.trimIndent()</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This allows us to write a text block, spanning lines, and the system does the work for us to make a single, properly formatted string. In Java, that might look like</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">String foo = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus luctus\n" +
    "finibus velit dictum lacinia.";</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>JDK 15 allows this:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">String foo = """
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus luctus
    finibus velit dictum lacinia.
    """;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Very neat and clean.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="records">Records</h2>
<div>
<p>Finally, we come to records.In a nutshell, Records, a new kind of class on the JVM, allow us to declare an new, immutable type primarily intended to carry data in a _very_concise manner. Take this example from the JEP:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">// The old way
class Point {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;

    Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    int x() { return x; }
    int y() { return y; }

    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (!(o instanceof Point)) return false;
        Point other = (Point) o;
        return other.x == x &amp;&amp; other.y = y;
    }

    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(x, y);
    }

    public String toString() {
        return String.format("Point[x=%d, y=%d]", x, y);
    }
}
// The new way
record Point(int x, int y) { }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <em>huge</em> improvement. The eagle-eyed may notice that the <code>record</code> definition is missing some methods. That is because, for <code>record</code> classes, the compiler generates <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code>, and <code>toString</code> for you. It also generates getters and setters as well. While the JEP officially states that this isn’t the opening salvo of a War on Boilerplate, it’s at least a nice test shot. :P</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div>
<p>There is, of course, more in the release than what I’ve discussed here, and you may find other bits more interesting, but these are the things that I’m most excited about.</p>
<p>You can download it <a href="https://jdk.java.net/15/">here</a> and read the official release notes <a href="https://jdk.java.net/15/release-notes">here</a>. Congrats to the entire JDK team!</p>

<p>
	Which sounds better to you?
</p><p>
	“In his best-selling book on behavioral science, <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, Nobel-prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman said, ‘Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.’.”
</p><p>
	… or just saying it:
</p><p>
	“Whatever’s on your mind is not as important as it seems.”
</p><p>
	When I first started reading a lot of books, I started quoting them a lot.
	When bringing up an idea in conversation, first I would mention its source — the book, the title, the author, and the subject of the book — before finally saying the idea.
</p><p>
	After far too many times hearing myself referencing this book and that book, always naming titles and authors, I realized it was a lot of unnecessary clutter.
	I could see my listeners waiting for me to get to the point.
<strong>
	It was inconsiderate.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Then I started noticing how annoying it was to read books that do the same thing.
	It’s really common in these <a href="https://sive.rs/book">pop non-fiction</a> books I like:
	“This person said this thing. That person said that thing.”
</p><p>
	It got me wondering:
<strong>
	Why don’t we just say the idea, instead of referencing and quoting it?
</strong>
</p><p>
	I think there are a few reasons:
</p>
<ol><li>
<strong>
	It feels like stealing.
</strong>
	It’s <em>their</em> idea, not mine.
	But all ideas come from somewhere.
	Maybe they were paraphrasing it from someone else.
</li><li>
<strong>
	School teaches us to reference.
</strong>
	But we’re not trying to impress a teacher anymore.
	And every unnecessary fact dilutes our point.
</li><li>
<strong>
	By quoting someone else, we can easily disavow the idea if attacked.
</strong>
	If someone says it’s wrong, we can avoid responsibility and say, “Don’t look at me! It’s his idea, not mine!”
</li></ol>
<p>
	So instead, I go the other way now.
</p><p>
	If I hear an idea, have considered it, and integrated it into my beliefs, <strong>it’s mine</strong>.
	I’ll say it succinctly in my own words, and stand behind it.
	Like adopting a child, I will take care of this idea and raise it as my own.
	If anyone wants to know the source, I’ll be happy to tell them.
</p><p>
	I highly recommend this.
	Stop referencing.
	Stop quoting.
	Paraphrase.
	Internalize it.
	Make it yours.
<strong>
	Tell me what <em>you</em> think, not what someone else thinks.
</strong>

<p>A lightweight F#/C# library for efficient functional-style pipelines on streams of data.</p>
<div>
  
  <div>
    <div id="nuget"><p>
      Install via <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Streams">NuGet</a>:
      </p><pre>PM&gt; Install-Package Streams
PM&gt; Install-Package Streams.CSharp</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  
</div>
<p>The main design behind Streams is inspired by Java 8 Streams and is based on the observation that many functional pipelines follow the pattern:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1: </span>
</pre></td>
<td><pre><code lang="fsharp"><span>source</span><span>/</span><span>generator</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>lazy</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>lazy</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>lazy</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>eager</span><span>/</span><span>reduce</span>
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<ul>
<li>Source/generator are functions that create Streams like Stream.ofArray/Stream.init.</li>
<li>Lazy functions take in streams and return streams like Stream.map/Stream.filter, these operations are fused together for efficient iteration.</li>
<li>Eager/reduce are functions like Stream.iter/Stream.sum that force the Stream to evaluate up to that point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference between LINQ/Seq and Streams is that LINQ is about composing external iterators (Enumerable/Enumerator) and  Streams is based on the continuation-passing-style composition of internal iterators.</p>

                    <h2 id="what-is-rss">What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>?</h2><p>It aims to be an open standard for the open web, where applications can get updates from websites. This runs against the current closed off portions of the web like Facebook that keep content behind their account login - i.e. the internet's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform">'walled gardens'</a>. For a while, a lot of people used the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">Google Reader</a> RSS application - unfortunately, as with many loved Google projects it got killed off because of declining usage and it didn't generate revenue. </p><p>So why get one now? </p><ul><li>Ideals of an open web. I don't have a Facebook account. I believe there are interesting blogs out there that I don't necessarily see unless they surfaced through the front page of search results or aggregators like Hacker News or Reddit. </li><li>Solve the problem of - <em>huh this blog/site was really interesting. How do I keep track of new content without signing up to a thousand newsletters or entering a walled garden?</em></li></ul><h2 id="my-starting-point">My Starting Point</h2><p>There's a bunch of open source Feed Readers listed on the <a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#feed-readers">Feed Reader section of Awesome Self-Hosted</a>. My criteria to filter the list were:</p><ul><li>Minimum 1000 Github Stars</li><li>Commit in the last 6 months</li></ul><p>This is what I was left with.

I'm running these locally to assess before deploying to my server.</p><h3 id="stringer-1"><a href="https://github.com/swanson/stringer">Stringer</a></h3><pre><code>docker run --rm -it -e DATABASE_URL="sqlite3:':memory:'" -p 8080:8080 mdswanson/stringer
</code></pre><p>Opened on <code>localhost:8080</code> - Simple as that. UI feels nice and simple. Unfortunately, the only import methods are from the long defunct Google Reader or with one URL at a time. </p><figure><img src="https://lukesingham.com/content/images/2020/05/image.png"></figure><p>I tried importing the OPML file through this method but that seemed to crash the application - poor error handling?</p><figure><img src="https://lukesingham.com/content/images/2020/05/image-1.png"></figure><p>Once you do manually load some feeds the <code>/feeds</code> interface is nice and clean.</p><figure><img src="https://lukesingham.com/content/images/2020/05/image-2.png"></figure><p>The <code>/news</code> view is well laid out and the fonts used are a nice reading experience.</p><figure><img src="https://lukesingham.com/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-31-at-09.41.46.png"></figure><p>Lastly, whilst poking around the Github repo I found this comment on <a href="https://github.com/swanson/stringer/issues/512">this recent issue</a>:</p><blockquote>... I don't think anyone is currently developing new features. I'm available to review code and merge it if you want to submit a patch.</blockquote><p>So whilst the UI is nice and the setup is incredibly easy. The active development of &nbsp;Miniflux and Wind have started to look more appealing.</p><p>⭐️ 6.5 / 10 - Easy install, nice UI, functionality is low and active development has slowed.</p><h3 id="miniflux-1"><a href="https://github.com/miniflux/miniflux">Miniflux</a></h3><ol><li>You need postgres which I had not setup on my mac. I recommend doing this the easy way with <a href="https://postgresapp.com/">postgres.app</a>.</li><li>The <a href="https://miniflux.app/docs/installation.html#docker">instructions </a>here are a little hairy. I went with saving the following to a <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. I couldn't get it working on port 80 so switched the port to 8050. </li></ol><pre><code>version: '3'
services:
  miniflux:
    image: miniflux/miniflux:latest
    ports:
      - "8050:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://miniflux:secret@db/miniflux?sslmode=disable
      - RUN_MIGRATIONS=1
      - CREATE_ADMIN=1
      - ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=test123
  db:

    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=miniflux
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
    volumes:
      - miniflux-db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  miniflux-db:  
</code></pre><p>Then run the following commands and go to <code>localhost:8050</code> once the containers have finished booting: </p><pre><code>$ docker-compose up -d db
$ docker-compose up miniflux</code></pre><p>Firstly, the initial UI is <em>very </em>simple, whilst incredibly plain is very functional. Navigating the app is explicit with text whereas Stringer you had to poke around using icons without text descriptions.</p><figure><img src="https://lukesingham.com/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-31-at-09.46.28.png"></figure><p>There are several integrations to apps like Pocket, Instapaper and Wallabag. And after changing the theme. the reader is quite nice. Albeit, I do notice the entire page refresh from the server side oriented app - but I have to tell myself that the simplicity philosophy trumps the complexity of introducing a frontend framework.</p><figure><img src="https://lukesingham.com/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-31-at-13.36.10.png"></figure><p>⭐️ 8.5 / 10 - Whilst being minimalistic has all the features you need, dark theme and the most active development of them all with a clear software philosophy.</p><h2 id="winds-1"><a href="https://getstream.io/winds/">Winds</a></h2><p>The install is relatively long particularly with the external dependencies which include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://getstream.io/">Stream</a> - an API for building activity feeds + handle personalization (machine learning). </li><li><a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> - for search</li><li><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">MongoDB Atlas</a> - a DB as a service (DBaaS)</li></ul><p>At this point I opt to sign up for a free account to try it out. I get the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/winds-by-getstream-io/id1381446741">app from the apple store</a>. Upon opening Winds, you are first confronted with a selection of interests like 'Programming', 'News' etc. I pick a couple and click next. I then have to create an account 😑 which I do. Then once logged in I have a very populated set of feeds and podcasts.</p><figure><img src="https://lukesingham.com/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-31-at-14.02.22.png"></figure><p>I then want to try and remove all of these and start fresh, which no amount of clicking around can I figure out how to do other than clicking individually on each feed to remove it. I could create a new account and then add my OPML file - however at this point I'm already missing the bloat free approach of Miniflux.</p><p>⭐️ 7 / 10 &nbsp;- for a non self-hosted piece of software I can see this is actually really nice. However major downsides of the installation complexity for self-hosted installation combined with features I don't particularly want. For instance, I don't want a recommender system - I can find my own content and probably consume too much as it is! If I want reinforcing recommender systems I'd go into a walled garden like Facebook.</p><h2 id="-winner-miniflux-">🎉 Winner - Miniflux 🎉</h2><h2 id="rss-tips">RSS Tips</h2><p>Do you have a list of websites you want to follow?</p><ul><li>A lot of sites you can just <code>/rss</code> e.g <code>domainname.com/rss</code></li><li>For medium sites add <code>/feed/</code> e.g. <a href="https://medium.com/feed/@cjolowicz/"><code>https://medium.com/feed/@verygoodblogger/</code></a></li><li>I used <a href="https://opml-gen.ovh/">this site</a> to convert a list feeds into an OPML file I could mass import to the various RSS feed reader apps.</li><li>About a decade ago I used blogspot/blogger.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> Python framework allows people to build websites extremely fast. One of its best features is the Object-relational mapper (ORM), which allows you to make queries to the database without having to write any SQL. Django will allow you to write your queries in Python and then it will try to turn those statements into efficient SQL. Most of the time the ORM creates the SQL flawlessly, but sometimes the results are less than ideal.</p>
<p>One common database problem is that ORMs can cause N+1 queries. These queries include a single, initial query (the +1), and each row in the results from that query spawns another query (the N). These often happen when you have a parent-child relationship. You select all of the parent objects you want and then when looping through them, another query is generated for each child. This problem can be hard to detect at first, as your website could be performing fine. But as the number of parent objects grows, the number of queries increases as well — to the point of overwhelming your database and taking down your application.</p>
<p>Recently, I was building a simple website that kept track of expenses and expense reports. I wanted to use Sentry’s new <a href="https://sentry.io/for/performance/">Performance</a> tool to assess how the application was performing in production. I quickly set it up using the instructions for <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/performance-monitoring/getting-started/?platform=python">Django</a> and immediately saw results.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was that the median root transaction was taking 3.41 seconds. All this page did was display a list of reports and the sum of all of the expenses on a report. Django is fast and it definitely shouldn’t take 3.41 seconds.</p>

<p>Looking at the code I couldn’t see any immediate problems, so I decided to dig into the Event Detail page for a recent transaction.</p>

<p>The second thing I noticed was just how many queries the ORM had generated. It was at this point that I saw that I had a single query to fetch all of the reports and then another query for each report to fetch all of the expenses —an N+1 problem.</p>
<p>Django evaluates queries lazily by default. This means that Django won’t run the query until the Python code is evaluated. In this case, when the page initially loads, <code>Reports.objects.all()</code> is called. When I call <code>{{ report.get_expense_total }}</code> Django runs the second query to fetch all of the expenses. There are two ways to fix this, depending on how your models are set up: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#select-related"><code>[select_related()]</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch-related"><code>[prefetch_related()]</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>select_related()</code> works by following one-to-many relationships and adding them to the SQL query as a JOIN. <code>prefetch_related()</code> works similarly, but instead of doing a SQL join it does a separate query for each object and then joins them in Python. This allows you to prefetch many-to-many and many-to-one relationships.</p>
<p>We can update ReportsList to use <code>prefetch_related()</code>. This cuts the number of database queries in half, since we’re now making one query to fetch all of the Reports, one query to fetch all of the expenses, and then n queries in <code>report.get_expense_total</code>.</p>
<div data-language="py"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ReportsList</span><span>(</span>ListView<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    model <span>=</span> Reports
    context_object_name <span>=</span> ‘reports’
    queryset <span>=</span> Reports<span>.</span>objects<span>.</span>prefetch_related<span>(</span>‘expenses’<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To fix the <code>n</code> queries from <code>report.get_expense_total</code> we can use Django’s <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.annotate"><code>annotate</code></a> to pull in that information before passing it to the template.</p>
<div data-language="py"><pre><code>
<span>class</span> <span>ReportsList</span><span>(</span>ListView<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    model <span>=</span> Reports
    context_object_name <span>=</span> ‘reports’
    queryset <span>=</span> Reports<span>.</span>objects<span>.</span>prefetch_related<span>(</span>‘expenses’<span>)</span><span>.</span>annotate<span>(</span>total_amount<span>=</span>Sum<span>(</span>‘expenses__amount’<span>)</span><span>)</span>


<span>{</span><span>%</span> <span>for</span> report <span>in</span> reports <span>%</span><span>}</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>h2<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> report<span>.</span>name <span>}</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h2<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span><span>%</span> <span>for</span> expense <span>in</span> report<span>.</span>expenses<span>.</span><span>all</span> <span>%</span><span>}</span>
                <span>&lt;</span>small<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> expense<span>.</span>name <span>}</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>small<span>&gt;</span>
                <span>&lt;</span>small<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> expense<span>.</span>amount <span>}</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>small<span>&gt;</span>
         <span>{</span><span>%</span> endfor <span>%</span><span>}</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>small<span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> report<span>.</span>total_amount <span>}</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>small<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span><span>%</span> endfor <span>%</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now the median transaction time is down to 290ms!</p>

<p>In the event the number of queries increases to the point where it could take your application down, try using prefetch_related or select_related. This way, Django will fetch all of the additional information without the extra queries. After doing this, I ended up saving 950 queries on my main page and decreasing the page load by 91%.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Giuseppe Paternò has worked on over 100 cloud projects and no two were exactly alike. Moving applications to the cloud is a start point for many businesses on their journey to the cloud. But every business should have its own tailored journey.</p>



<p>Cloud solutions can be complex and each project has to meet specific business needs and work within specific parameters. They can range from building large private clouds to moving everything to the cloud, and even implementing organisational changes.</p>



<p>In this book Giuseppe set out what he learnt in 25+ years of IT, sharing three different case histories that show how every business should have its own tailored journey to the cloud. The author also shares in the publication his own six pillars for delivering successful cloud projects.</p>



<p>The author aims to inspire businesses in finding their own path to increase their business agility, lower or rationalise their costs and better focus on the core business.</p>

<p>Money makes the world go ‘round. Cash is king. A dollar makes you holler. A penny saved—well, you get the point. But here’s the kicker:</p>

<h2>Nobody cares about the number on your paycheque as much as you do.</h2>

<p>What’s an extra $10,000 worth? Let’s look at some cold, hard math.</p>

<p>To you, $10,000 more equals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An extra $6,000 after taxes, or $500 per month</li>
  <li>5-20% of your average technical salary</li>
  <li>Ramen that isn’t prepared in the microwave</li>
</ul>

<p>There are long-term effects, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bigger bonuses, which are often expressed as a percentage of the current salary</li>
  <li>A better starting point when your next employer asks for your current salary</li>
  <li>A bank account that’s as full and delicious as a bowl of <em>edamame</em></li>
</ul>

<p>An extra $10,000 sounds great doesn’t it? No downsides for you—but what does it mean to the other people involved in the hiring process?</p>

<h3 id="the-external-recruiter">The External Recruiter</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/1303d71d4384ec0334f4bc9f9071f554.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/external-recruiter.png"><figcaption>Me, profiting off your hard work</figcaption></figure>

<p>Let’s start with this guy/gal, who is coincidentally me. The External Recruiter doesn’t work for the hiring company directly, they work for a staffing agency / recruitment firm, and they work on commission. To an external recruiter, $10,000 more equals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An extra $1,500 for the agency at a 15% commission</li>
  <li>A personal commission to the recruiter of $375 at 25%</li>
  <li>After-tax earnings of $225</li>
</ul>

<p>That after-tax $225 buys a decent amount of ramen for the recruiter, but if the client chooses another candidate because you were too expensive—POOF. That $225 vanishes in a cloud of soy-scented smoke and the recruiter <em>is not pleased</em> that you cost him a commission.</p>

<p>Let’s face it: whatever you and the recruiter intend to buy with your newfound wealth, you both want to see a nice number in that letter of offer. Mo’ money, mo’ joy, right? But not everyone is looking to pay you as much as possible… meet:</p>

<h3 id="the-internal-recruiterhr">The Internal Recruiter/HR</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/001fd846fa88d16e574eb527cb55b6cc.jpg" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/internal-recruiter.jpg"><figcaption>No more free lunches</figcaption></figure>

<p>Candidates flow from the External Recruiter to the Internal Recruiter/HR who <em>does</em> work for the hiring company, and is meant as the company’s first line of defense.</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’ve got to hire someone within a set time-frame and budget range</li>
  <li>That LinkedIn post about <em>“If you Think a Professional is Expensive, Wait until you Hire an Amateur”</em> has them shook</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81Nl7VYFEaI">guy in the $3,000 suit</a> said they have to hire “a rock star who knows CSS to build out the backend widget accounting system”—whatever that means</li>
  <li>The recruiter takes them for nice lunches, but that doesn’t mean they’ll pick his candidate. Unless it’s their favourite bistro on the corner and then … the candidate’s in</li>
</ul>

<p>An extra $10,000 a year on your salary doesn’t matter to the internal recruiter/HR <em>at all</em> as long as it’s within the range they’ve been given. If it’s outside of that range, it means they’ll need to exchange some emails with someone else in the company to see if an exception can be made for you.</p>

<h3 id="the-hiring-manager">The Hiring Manager</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/265e2ec80c5cd1590a36bc8b51bd23a2.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/hiring-manager.png"><figcaption>Hiring Manager, <i>ad astra</i></figcaption></figure>

<p>The Hiring Manager is likely to be your line-manager (or a level up from that) in the role. She is (or was) probably a programmer like you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Often, they don’t control their own budget, which means they don’t <em>really</em> care how much you cost</li>
  <li><strong>BUT</strong> The Widget Automation project is six months behind, and they’ve got to hire someone now or it goes up in flames</li>
  <li>They can hire whomever they want if the salary falls within a certain range and can beg the boss for an increase if they meet a Widget Automation rock star</li>
  <li>Hiring makes them hungry. When’s lunch?</li>
</ul>

<p>An extra $10,000 a year on your salary mostly doesn’t matter to the Hiring Manager, as it’s not her money. But while the internal recruiter/HR will need to simply get someone to authorise going outside the normal salary range, the Hiring Manager will actually need to make the case for it. She’ll need to convince whomever does control the budget that you’re worth it … and that’s real, actual effort in a busy professional’s day.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-lose-a-job-offer">How To Lose A Job Offer</h2>

<p>Remember, knowledge is power. Once you understand what’s happening in the background, you will be light years ahead of your competition. Key to your success is one universal truth:</p>

<h2>Hiring people is HARD, so recruitment processes are inflexible</h2>

<p>External recruiters, internal recruiters/HR, and hiring managers follow rigid processes they’ve been given, because when they deviate from these well-trodden roads, trouble looms.</p>

<p>About the best way to experience this first hand is to decide on 4:45pm on the last day of the month that you’d like the job offer you said you were likely to accept at $90,000 to pay $90,500 instead.</p>

<h3 id="who-youve-annoyed-and-how">Who you’ve annoyed and how…</h3>

<h4 id="the-external-recruiter-1">The External Recruiter</h4>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/1303d71d4384ec0334f4bc9f9071f554.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/external-recruiter.png"></figure>

<p>The External Recruiter thought he had his commission in the bag for the quarter, but now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Accounts Department are closing up the month in 15m</li>
  <li>… which means this month’s sales target go the way of the Death Star</li>
  <li>… even though he had a frank and detailed discussion with you about wage expectations at the start, you’ve decided to roll the dice at the eleventh hour</li>
</ul>

<p>Frantic phone calls will be made to…</p>



<h4 id="the-internal-recruiter--hr">The Internal Recruiter / HR</h4>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/001fd846fa88d16e574eb527cb55b6cc.jpg" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/internal-recruiter.jpg"></figure>

<p>The Internal Recruiter/HR had to fill out a lot of forms to get a job offer authorised:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He camped out in the CEO’s office for half of Tuesday to get authorization to offer $90,000.</li>
  <li>Can’t get in touch with the CEO because she is at a technology-free week-long “Management Realignment Camp” in Tahiti.</li>
  <li>Needs to jump back through all those hoops because now you want an extra $500.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s time to check with the Hiring Manager how much she <em>really</em> cares about hiring you…</p>



<h3 id="the-hiring-manager-1">The Hiring Manager</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/265e2ec80c5cd1590a36bc8b51bd23a2.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/hiring-manager.png"></figure>

<p>The Hiring Manager:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Was authorised to sign off on $90,000 because internal HR got it approved</li>
  <li>Can’t offer $90,500 without a formal review, three pieces of paper signed in triplicate, and the blood of an albino bat, because it’s just over an internal company threshold that means the hire needs referring to the Board</li>
  <li>Wants to make it home for dinner at least one night this week and has a candidate she likes almost as much as you who’s asking for $89,000…</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sorry, the other candidate got the job because you're not a good "cultural fit"</h2>

<p>If you know how the recruitment process works, you can get paid more by working <em>with it</em> rather than against it. Help them to help you! Let’s rewind and examine the four stages of recruitment to see what happened to lead to that missed opportunity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hiring Stage 1: Before the Job is Posted</li>
  <li>Hiring Stage 2: The Job is Posted</li>
  <li>Hiring Stage 3: Interview</li>
  <li>Hiring Stage 4: The Offer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hiring-stage-1-before-the-job-is-posted">Hiring Stage 1: Before the Job is Posted</h2>

<p>The hiring manager didn’t wake up thinking, “My day’s looking a little slow—let’s hire a new employee!” The hiring process starts when a business need has been identified, and if you can find out what that need is, you’ll have useful intel.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-they-hiring">Why are they hiring?</h3>

<p>If the business is replacing an existing person:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re likely looking for someone with similar experience</li>
  <li>They don’t want to pay a dramatically different salary</li>
  <li>They probably want to use the same job title</li>
</ul>

<p>In this situation, flexibility is usually low, but listen for an indication that the last person has “been there forever and needs replacing” or “wrote horrible legacy code and ran SQL ‘fixes’ against the live DB.” These can be indicative that the employer knows they need an upgrade in professionalism and skills, and this may be the cue to mention your <em>professionalism, experience, and ability to deliver more appropriate methods</em> for their business—at a price befitting those skills, of course.</p>

<p>If the business is hiring for a new project or team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Somehow, somewhere, someone got a funding sign-off for this project</li>
  <li>They’re likely drawing from a pot of money for the project or team, so they have the potential to make a few expensive hires (because who doesn’t want at least one rockstar on their team?)</li>
  <li>There may be a leadership position that offers a big title and the big bucks to go with it</li>
</ul>

<p>A new project or team has the most flexibility in hiring. They’re starting from square one, and they might as well start with a gem, like you. In an interview, take this as a signal to tout your past success in leading or collaborating on new and exciting projects.</p>

<p>What if the role is something between a replacement and a new hire? Say the business is undergoing incremental growth: they need new people, but aren’t ready to rain dollar bills on any developer who comes through the door. What do you do?</p>

<h2>You ask questions!</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How many people are they hiring?</li>
  <li>Is this a new role? A new team?</li>
  <li>Are you joining a team of people with the same job title?</li>
</ul>

<p>At worst, asking questions makes you seem interested in their business. Not a bad way to make a great first impression.</p>

<p>Earlier we said “someone got a funding sign-off” for the project. This somebody sits somewhere in the hierarchy above where you ultimately will. This person controls their budget, and your salary is part of that budget. Their performance is often measured on the health of this budget. Unless it’s a small company, you probably won’t …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<h2>Files</h2>

<p>The best way I've found to organize my files is to split them between "created by me" versus "created by strangers". If I write an article, it goes in one place. If somebody else wrote it, it goes someplace else. 

</p><p>This distinction is important, but it is also fuzzy. Plenty of photos of my family were not taken by me, but I store them in the "me" pile. I have an <code>install</code> directory designed for recreating my setup, full of drivers and profiles and so forth, and even though I didn't create most of that, it represents a configuration I did create. What about bookmarks? Bookmarks can show up in either pile, no big deal.

</p><p>"Did I make this or not?" really seems to be the highest-order bit for organization. Old PDFs of my LaTeX homework solutions are completely different from a magazine article I downloaded in PDF. They don't belong together in the same folder.

</p><p>In fact, it seems that the things I worked on are my <em>only</em> important files. Everything else is just cache. Out of ten top-level directories, only one is for non-personal files, <code>found</code>. That's where I store the infographics and other miscellanea from the internet. If I have to think twice about deleting it, it doesn't belong in <code>found</code>.

</p><p>For a long time now, the internet has had a sufficient number of people volunteering as archivists that the rest of us can take a breather when it comes to things like "rare B-sides" and "fan movies". I only archive things I need that no one else mirrors.

</p><h2>Emails</h2>

<p>You really only need the last three years or so of email online. I have offline archives going back about twenty years, and I have never once gone back to read old email. The stuff that's worth saving gets plucked anyway. I still can't justify deleting the emails—there's too much personal correspondence mixed in—so I compromise by moving them offline.

</p><p>When Gmail first appeared, Google encouraged users to stop pruning email. But they were wrong about that. It isn't enough to simply have the capacity. The downside to not pruning is that eventually your email becomes impossible to search. Real deletes help that. I now try to trash anything automated, impersonal, recurring, or replicated. Letters that other people have written me are high value. Shipment IDs are already saved on Amazon.com.

</p><h2>Posts</h2>

<p>We save the things we make forever, but most of the stuff we post online has a limited shelf-life, at least when it comes to outside appreciation. In practical terms, the only time people ever read through old tweets is when they're looking for something damaging. Which means they don't need access to them.

</p><p>Initially, Snapchat sounded absurd. How could you stop anybody from taking screenshots? But the system works, not because it stops people from saving any one snap, but because it makes it prohibitive for anyone to keep a running archive of all snaps. The archive is where the liability is.

</p>

September 15, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/django-access-control | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/django-access-control">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nearly every application needs to enable its users to see only their data. Many other applications go further and add more controls, like sharing, or making some content private and public. These concepts are increasingly important to get right as data privacy consistently finds itself at the center of the conversation in technical, business and political communities.</p>
<p>In this post, we will explore how to build a simple social app that allows users to share posts, like Twitter.  We will use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/">Django</a>, a popular Python web framework that includes an ORM and templating system.  Unlike Twitter, our application will include post visibility control.  We will implement this access control using oso, an open source policy engine that is embedded in your application.  The <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-oso/">django-oso</a> package makes it possible to use oso in a Django app with little configuration.</p>
<p>This tutorial will walk through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting a Django project</li>
<li>Creating a custom User model</li>
<li>Creating Django models and views to list and create posts</li>
<li>Adding oso to our Django app to implement public &amp; private posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tutorial is self-contained, but if you prefer, you can follow along in the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-social-django">github repo</a>.</p>
<h2>Starting our project</h2>
<p>To get started, we will need Python 3 (at least 3.6) installed.  Let's start a new directory for our project, and create and activate a virtual environment.</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir oso-social
$ cd oso-social
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's install <code>django</code> &amp; <code>django-oso</code> in our virtual environment.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install django
$ pip install django-oso
</code></pre>

<p>Django includes the <code>django-admin</code> tool which has commands for scaffolding django apps &amp; developing them.  We will use it to start a new project:</p>
<pre><code>$ django-admin startproject oso_social
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new <code>oso_social</code> directory within our top level directory:</p>
<pre><code>ls -l oso_social
total 392
-rwxr-xr-x   1 dhatch  staff     666 Sep  3 16:14 manage.py
drwxr-xr-x   8 dhatch  staff     256 Sep  3 17:55 oso_social
</code></pre>

<pre><code>ls -l oso_social/oso_social
total 32
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff     0 Sep  3 16:14 __init__.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   397 Sep  3 16:14 asgi.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff  3219 Sep  3 17:55 settings.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   798 Sep  3 16:44 urls.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   397 Sep  3 16:14 wsgi.py
</code></pre>

<p>Every Django project is organized into multiple apps.  Apps are Python modules that are reusable across projects.  The <code>oso_social/oso_social</code> module is the project module, which includes settings &amp; configuration for our <code>oso_social</code> project.</p>
<p>Let's create an app now to contain our database models and views.  In the <code>oso_social</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd oso_social
$ ./manage.py startapp social
</code></pre>

<pre><code>ls -l social
total 56
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff     0 Sep  3 16:14 __init__.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   206 Sep  3 16:33 admin.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff    87 Sep  3 16:14 apps.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   638 Sep  3 17:46 models.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff    60 Sep  3 16:14 tests.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   394 Sep  3 17:52 urls.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff  1312 Sep  3 17:59 views.py
</code></pre>

<p>We just used the <code>manage.py</code> utility, which does the same thing as django-admin, but is aware of the project settings.  This allows it to perform project specific tasks, like database operations.</p>
<p>To finish setting up our <code>social</code> app we need to add it to the settings file to make Django aware of it. In <code>oso_social/oso_social/settings.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code># Search for this setting in the file, and add 'social'.
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... existing entires ...
    'social',
]
</code></pre>

<h2>Creating our User model</h2>
<p>First we are going to create a User model to represent users in our app.  This model will be used to store User information in our database.  Django has a built-in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/default/">authorization system</a> that handles things like password management, login, logout, and user sessions.  A custom User model provides flexibility to add attributes later to our User.</p>
<p>Let's create one in our <code>oso_social/social/models.py</code> file.  Use the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>from django.db import models

from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

class User(AbstractUser):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>django.contrib.auth</code> built-in app provides authentication for Django projects.  We will use it to jumpstart our authentication setup.  To create a custom user model, we simply inherit from <code>AbstractUser</code>.  We haven't defined any custom fields, so the class body is empty.</p>
<p>Next, we'll add an entry to our settings file in <code>oso_social/oso_social/settings.py</code>.  The settings file configures the Django projects and apps within it.  It is a standard Python file, where each configuration entry is stored as a global variable.  We will add the following line:</p>
<pre><code>AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'social.User'
</code></pre>

<p>This indicates to the <code>django.contrib.auth</code> app to use the <code>User</code> model from the <code>social</code> app for authentication.</p>
<p>Finally, we will create a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/migrations/">database migration</a>.  Django's built in database migration tool keeps your database schema in sync with the models used in your app.  To make a migration, run:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./manage.py makemigrations social
</code></pre>

<p>This will create <code>oso_social/social/migrations/0001_initial.py</code>.  Now, apply this migration to our database (since we haven't customized our database settings it is a SQLite database by default).</p>
<pre><code>$ ./manage.py migrate
</code></pre>

<h2>Logging in</h2>
<p>Now, let's make sure we have set up our authentication properly and can login.  We haven't built any views yet, but we can use the built-in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/">Django admin</a> interface to test out our authorization.</p>
<p>First, add our custom User model to the admin site in <code>oso_social/social/admin.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin

from .models import User

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(User, UserAdmin)
</code></pre>

<p>Then, create a super user using the <code>manage.py</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./manage.py createsuperuser
</code></pre>

<p>This will prompt you for user credentials, which you will then use to login to the admin site.</p>
<p>Let's start our app:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./manage.py runserver
</code></pre>

<p>And visit http://localhost:8000/admin. From here, we can login and access the admin interface.</p>
<p><img alt="Building%20a%20Django%20app%20with%20data%20access%20controls%20in%204b3da60512dd49e58b9f8e0cbdfbba6d/Screen_Shot_2020-09-10_at_4.14.59_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/django-twitter-clone/Building%20a%20Django%20app%20with%20data%20access%20controls%20in%204b3da60512dd49e58b9f8e0cbdfbba6d/Screen_Shot_2020-09-10_at_4.14.59_PM.png"></p>
<h2>Creating our Post model</h2>
<p>Now that we've setup our login, let's start building the post functionality.  Our app will allow users to create new posts, and view a feed of posts.  To support this, we will create a Post model that stores the post information in our database.</p>
<p>In <code>oso_social/social/models.py</code>, create a <code>Post</code> model below the <code>User</code> model:</p>
<pre><code>class Post(models.Model):
    ACCESS_PUBLIC = 0
    ACCESS_PRIVATE = 1
    ACCESS_LEVEL_CHOICES = [
        (ACCESS_PUBLIC, 'Public'),
        (ACCESS_PRIVATE, 'Private'),
    ]

    contents = models.CharField(max_length=140)

    access_level = models.IntegerField(choices=ACCESS_LEVEL_CHOICES, default=ACCESS_PUBLIC)

    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
</code></pre>

<p>This defines a model class called <code>Post</code> with four fields: <code>contents</code>, <code>access_level</code>, <code>created_at</code> and <code>created_by</code>.  The <code>contents</code> field will store the message submitted by the user, while <code>created_at</code> &amp; <code>created_by</code> store post metadata.  We will use <code>access_level</code> later to implement post visibility with oso.</p>
<p>Save this file, and create a migration to make the table to store the <code>Post</code> model in our database:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./manage.py makemigrations social
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>makemigrations</code> command will check the models against existing migrations and create new migration scripts as needed.  Most types of database changes are auto-detected. Apply this migration as we did before with the <code>migrate</code> command.</p>
<p>Now, we've made our <code>Post</code> model. Let's check that things are working as intended.  Instead of making a view, we will use the admin interface to create some posts.  Register the Post with the admin interface by adding the following to <code>oso_social/social/admin.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code># Add Post import (in addition to User)
from .models import User, Post

# ...
admin.site.register(Post)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we can visit the admin site at: <a href="http://localhost:8000/admin/">http://localhost:8000/admin/</a>.  The Post model is available, let's use the admin interface to create a post.  Click on <strong>Posts</strong>, then <strong>Add Post</strong> in the upper right.</p>
<p><img alt="Building%20a%20Django%20app%20with%20data%20access%20controls%20in%204b3da60512dd49e58b9f8e0cbdfbba6d/Screen_Shot_2020-09-08_at_12.38.05_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/django-twitter-clone/Building%20a%20Django%20app%20with%20data%20access%20controls%20in%204b3da60512dd49e58b9f8e0cbdfbba6d/Screen_Shot_2020-09-08_at_12.38.05_PM.png"></p>
<p>Fill out the form as we did above, and save the new Post.  This example illustrates the power of the Django admin interface.  With no custom code, we were able to test out our model and interact with it!</p>

<p>Ok, enough time in the admin interface.  Let's move on with creating the feed view that users will use.  Every page in a Django web app has an associated <strong>view.</strong>  When a user visits a particular URL, the view function is responsible for handling the request and producing a response.  Let's write a simple view to display Posts.</p>
<p>In <code>oso_social/social/views.py</code>, write the following code:</p>
<pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

from .models import Post

def list_posts(request):
    # Limit to 10 latest posts
    posts = Post.objects.all().order_by('-created_at')[:10]

    posts_text = ""

    for post in posts:
        posts_text += f"@{post.created_by} {post.contents}"

    return HttpResponse(posts_text)
</code></pre>

<p><code>list_posts</code> is our view function.  It first uses the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/querysets/">Django QuerySet API</a> and our <code>Post</code> model to get the first 10 posts from the database, ordered by latest post first.  Then, we produce a string to respond with using Python format strings.  Finally, we return an <code>HttpResponse</code> containing the <code>posts_text</code>.</p>
<p>We wrote our view function, but we aren't done yet! We still have to tell Django when to call it.  Django uses <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/urls/#example">URLconf</a> modules for this purpose.  Open <code>oso_social/oso_social/urls.py</code> in your editor. This is the root URLconf.  It specifies what view functions are run when a request is made for a particular URL.  Right now, you will see the url pattern: <code>path('admin/', admin.site.urls)</code> which drives the admin site.  Let's add one more pattern:</p>
<pre><code># Add include import
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('social.urls'))
]
</code></pre>

<p>This tells Django to use the <code>oso_social/social/urls.py</code> file to resolve any urls that do not …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The sky is clear, the breeze is strong. A perfect day to make the long sea voyage to Mythyn. You prepare your galley, hire a crew of sailors, and cast off.</p>

<p>But a few hours into your trip, the dreaded words appear: “Thou seest rippling waters…”</p>

<p>Sea serpent? Giant squid? Something’s out there, and it’s headed your way.</p>

<p>So it goes in “Thieves’ Guild,” a unique <span>BBS </span>door game for the Atari <span>ST.</span></p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/456419073" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>For me, the quest to play Thieves’ Guild properly has been my own 7-year voyage, something akin to Captain Ahab chasing the whale.</p>

<p>Though Thieves’ Guild debuted for Atari ST <span>BBS</span>es in the early 1990s, I didn’t learn of its existence until 2013, which means this post will be unlike previous installments of my <a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/category/door-game-memories/">“door game memories”</a> series.</p>

<p>I came across Thieves’ Guild as I was researching <a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/2020/09/09/a-different-way-to-play-front-ends/">graphical front-end clients for <span>BBS </span>games</a>. I was astonished to find that someone had created one on the Atari <span>ST, </span>my favorite computer platform, and I quickly became obsessed with finding a way to play it. If you’re so inclined, you can read about my <a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/2014/11/12/hatari-lantronix-and-cosmosex-my-quixotic-quest-to-play-thieves-guild/">quixotic quest to run the TG front-end client</a> years ago.</p>

<p>In the years since, I’ve made many attempts to play the game, most of which fizzled out. But today, finally, I can say that I have completed it!</p>

<p>So let’s talk about what makes it unique, what I enjoyed, and what was tedious — but with the obvious caveat that I played this game 30 years after its heyday.</p>

<div id="attachment_1604"><p><a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tg_title2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1604" src="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tg_title2.gif" alt="" width="600" height="345"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1604">This animated <span>GIF </span>shows the title screen for the Thieves’ Guild Emulator for the Atari <span>ST.</span></p></div>

<h2>The game</h2>

<p>Paul Witte wrote Thieves’ Guild beginning around 1988, using <a href="https://archive.org/details/OSSPersonalPascal">Personal Pascal</a> for the Atari <span>ST.</span></p>

<p>Initially Witte hosted the game on his <span>BBS,</span> Dark Fortress, where friends and acquaintances in Utah play-tested it and gave him feedback. He released it as shareware in 1993, and sold about 100 registered copies to sysops.</p>

<p>But that wasn’t all — Witte and his primary collaborator Herb Flower, also released a <a href="http://breakintochat.com/files/doors/Mythyn/thieves-guild/distributions/TG_EMUL.ZIP">graphical front-end</a> for Thieves’ Guild in 1993.</p>




<p>Flower, a talented pixel artist, drew dozens of backgrounds and animated sprites for the front-end, such as the three temple images above. He also created a detailed paper map of the game world, which they sold to users.</p>

<p>Myron Crandall, another collaborator, later ported the game to Turbo Pascal on the <span>PC.</span> While <a href="https://github.com/Kirkman/mythyn-archive/tree/master/thieves-guild/pc">a PC version</a> seems to have been completed in 1995, it appears to have been used on only one <span>BBS, </span>and was never publicly released.</p>

<h2>The setting</h2>

<p>Thieves’ Guild has many of the trappings of other text-based <span>BBS </span>role-playing games set in medieval times such as Legend of the Red Dragon or Assassin. Like Assassin, it uses deliberately archaic language to make you feel like you’re in another time. Like LoRD, you must face a dragon at the end of the game.</p>

<p>On its face, the game seems simple: You are a thief and you want to increase your skill and steal as much loot as you can. But there’s a lot more.</p>




<p>TG is in fact a <a href="https://breakintochat.com/wiki/Category:Meta-BBS">meta-BBS game</a>. Its hefty 1,500-word backstory establishes the premise that your player character is a <span>BBS</span>er who one day is sucked through a vortex into another world. You land on Rogues’ Isle where you are recruited by the Master Thief, who assures you there must be a portal back to Earth. To find it, you will have to solve many quests and navigate mazes, in addition to fighting and stealing from almost everyone around. Once any player on the <span>BBS </span>successfully resolves the final quest and goes through the portal, the game will reset, and that player’s name will be added to the “Masters of Riddles” screen to memorialize the achievement.</p>

<p>You begin on the Rogues’ Isle, which is just one small part of a large world of interconnected towns. You travel between them by boat or by horse. Each town has the staple locations you’d expect — tavern, inn, jail — but most towns have also have one unique location such as the Temple of Balor, the Torture Chamber, or the Silver Pyramids.</p>

He and Paul Witte sold paper copies of it to players of the game.</p></div>

<p>The world is complex enough that Flower drew an extremely detailed paper map showing all the locations, with illustrations that offer hints toward solving the quests. Witte sold copies of this map directly to users, and advertised its existence within the game. It’s very much like an Infocom “feelie” that adds to the depth of the game. I have a low-resolution scan of the map, and I found it essential when I was playing. Without it, mapping the game world on my own would have taken an enormous amount of time (more on why later).</p>

<h2>Getting hooked</h2>

<p>The thing that makes TG special among <span>BBS </span>games is its graphical front-end (which they called the “Thieves Guild Emulator”). When you play in a traditional <span>ASCII, ANSI, </span>or VT-52 terminal, the game looks much like any other text-based <span>BBS </span>game. But if you install and run the graphical front-end, the experience is greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>First, you hear a voice say “Welcome to Thieves’ Guild.” Then you see the title screen. It’s fantastic, animated pixel art. A torch flickers, mounted to a gray wall covered with detailed glyphs of skulls, ankhs, mermaids, wolves, and other things. The flames of the torch burn a slowly-expanding hole in the parchment “Thieves’ Guild” banner across the top. The text of the credits dissolve and reform as Old English runes. This opening screen, so full of small thoughtful details, made a huge first impression on me. I had never seen such well-drawn pixel art in any other <span>BBS</span>-related project or front-end client.</p>

<p>What do I mean by a “front-end client?” <a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/2020/09/09/a-different-way-to-play-front-ends/">I wrote about this at length last week</a>, but in brief: It’s an enhanced terminal program designed to work with one specific <span>BBS </span>game. Normal terminal programs would render only text and symbols on an 80-character, 25-line screen. But some <span>BBS </span>game authors wanted to offer an experience more like a video game with detailed pixel graphics, animation, or sound. Their solution was to develop their own custom terminal programs that could display such graphics when they received special codes from a specific game. And that’s exactly what the “Thieves Guild Emulator” does.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/456419066" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Keep in mind that most <span>BBS </span>games were pet projects of individual programmers. Often they were middle-aged men with regular jobs and families, coding during stolen hours at night. Sometimes they were teenagers, teaching themselves how to program by writing the game. But seldom were these programmers also skilled pixel artists.</p>

<p>That’s why the title screen of the TG front-end client captivated me. I hadn’t seen anything like it among other <span>BBS </span>games. It spurred me to keep going over the years to find, first, a way to use the TG front-end client successfully; and second, to play a sustained game where I didn’t die if I had to stop playing for a while.</p>

<h2>The front-end</h2>

<p>What is it like to play TG in the TG front-end client? For a modern-day user, it is both delightful and a little bit of a let-down.</p>

<p>This client was designed to overcome limitations of the Atari <span>ST.</span> The <span>ST’</span>s 80-column mode can display only four colors. In the front-end client, most menus are displayed in this 80-column text mode. But when the front-end wants to display an image, it will change to low resolution in order to use 16 colors. Consequently, any text that appears on screen with an image will use the Atari <span>ST’</span>s wider 40-column font.</p>

<p>Each location in the game gets its own small 160×100 image, on top of which sprites might be placed. These images are customized from town to town, depending on conditions in the game. For example, if it’s midnight in the town square, the front-end client will adjust the color palette of the image to make the image look like night time.</p>

<div id="attachment_1632"><p><a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/town-day-night.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1632" src="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/town-day-night.gif" alt="" width="720" height="480"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1632">This animated <span>GIF </span>shows how the Thieves’ Guild front end simulates night time in a town by by adjusting the color palette of the background image. The daytime frame shows a “large elf” sprite; the nighttime frame shows a “young guard” sprite as well as animated rain drops.</p></div>

<p>If it’s raining in the town, then you will see animated white pixels move across the scene. The sea coast images have little tree sprites that are positioned differently from town to town. If a storm is coming, the sky will fill with clouds, and they will gradually darken.</p>

<p>Wind is important in Thieves’ Guild, as it determines whether you can sail, and how successful your sea journey might be. The various wind speeds are reflected in the movement of rain or snow.</p>

<p>Gameplay and menus remain text-based, exactly the same as they would be in a normal terminal. You press “3” to enter a tavern, for example. When fighting an opponent, you press a number between 1-6 to choose what type of attack to make, then press a letter corresponding to a part of the body to target.</p>

<p>In the front-end, though, when an event takes place or you encounter a person or monster, the front-end will switch to low resolution and display an image with a sprite on the top half of the screen. The bottom half is reserved for text. Each <span>NPC’</span>s sprite has a few frames of simple animation. The sprites are not controllable and do not walk or fly across the screen — this is still a turn-by-turn <span>BBS </span>adventure, not a video game.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/456418954" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Combat is where sound and animation get the most immersive. As you fight, there are animations for when you hit hit an opponent, when they take attack you, when they fall to the ground, and for when they are killed. I have commented before about the death animation: it’s a short, vivid animation of the character disintegrating into a bloody pulp (or a pile of bones). Each character has a unique sound effect. For example, wizards yell the incantation “Ful nox or!” when attacking; some characters scream “Please, …</p></div></div>

September 15, 2020 | https://christopher-russo.github.io/sep-dashboard-launch/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://christopher-russo.github.io/sep-dashboard-launch/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Today, I launched the <a href="https://christopher-russo.github.io/dashboard/sep/">Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) Dashboard</a>. Its purpose is to better communicate the economic projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body which sets monetary policy for the United States. The dashboard is free to access, with the intention of helping the public make better-informed economic decisions. In this post, I provide additional guidance on understanding these data and projections.</p>

<p>The FOMC regularly prepares and releases these projections as part of their public communications strategy. Each FOMC participant submits their projections for inflation, unemployment, GDP growth, and the federal funds rate. These projections are their individual assessments of how the economy will evolve under appropriate monetary policy. In my experience, participants take great care in compiling their submissions. Underlying these submissions are weeks of work by research staffs around the Federal Reserve System. For each economic variable, I show the median projection of FOMC participants. I also show two measures of disagreement: range and central tendency. Finally, I contextualize these projections using historical data.</p>

<p>In addition to projecting the next few years, participants provide â€œlonger-runâ€� projections. These values represent the policymakerâ€™s belief about where the economy would ideally converge over time in the absence of further disruption. For illustration purposes, I assume that these â€œlonger-runâ€� values are attained within about five years. In practice, we may arrive at these longer-run figures sooner, later, or not at all.</p>

<p>Policymakers submit projections for five economic variables.</p>

<p><strong>PCE Inflation:</strong> The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index is the Federal Reserveâ€™s preferred price measure. It measures the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers in the United States. The Fed has a price stability mandate from Congress and, under its interpretation of this mandate, the Fed targets a 2 percent annual increase in this index.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserveâ€™s statutory mandate.<a href="#note1">[1]</a><a name="back1"></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of writing, PCE inflation has generally run below 2 percent since the adoption of this target in January 2012. Still, policymakers have regularly emphasized that 2 percent is an intended average and not a cap. If policymakers are successful under their recently-adopted policy of Average-Inflation Targeting, PCE inflation will first overshoot before returning to 2 percent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods where inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.<a href="#note2">[2]</a><a name="back2"></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, policymakers have been intentionally ambiguous about how high they intend to let inflation run, as well as for how long. As recently explained by FOMC Chairman Powell,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the averageâ€¦ Our decisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations and will not be dictated by any formula.<a href="#note3">[3]</a><a name="back3"></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result, I have omitted the â€œlonger-runâ€� projections for PCE inflation. Consistent with their consensus target, all participants have a longer-run projection of 2 percent.</p>

<p><strong>Core PCE Inflation:</strong> The Personal Consumption Expenditures Excluding Food and Energy (PCEXFE) price index ignores the volatility in food and energy prices. Policymakers generally use changes in PCEXFE, or so-called â€œcoreâ€� inflation, to better understand inflation trends. FOMC participants do not submit a longer-run projection for core PCE inflation.</p>

<p><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> The Unemployment Rate (also called U-3) measures the number of people without a job who are actively looking and available for work, as a percentage of the labor force. Although the Fed has a maximum employment mandate from Congress, the Fed does not specify a fixed target for U-3. While U-3 is informative, policymakers consider a range of indicators.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committeeâ€™s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments.<a href="#note4">[4]</a><a name="back4"></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Real GDP Growth:</strong> Real GDP is a comprehensive measure of U.S. economy activity. It measures the value of goods and services in the United States after accounting for changes in prices. This adjustment allows for comparisons between different periods. Real GDP is closely tied to the income of houses and firms in the United States, and hence growth in real GDP is a key economic indicator.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Funds Rate:</strong> The fed funds rate is the rate at which banks borrow from each other overnight. Under current policy, this rate is closely tied to the interest rate the Fed pays eligible banks on their reserve deposits held at the Fed.</p>

<p>The fed funds rate is the Fedâ€™s primary tool for monetary policy. Raising (lowering) the fed funds rate tends to raise (lower) other dollar-denominated interest rates. This includes interest rates on Treasury securities, repurchase agreements, mortgages, auto loans, and consumer savings. Using this transmission, the Fed adjusts the fed funds rate to expand or contract credit in the economy, thereby stimulating or constraining growth in economic activity.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ariss.org/">Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS)</a> team has announced the new ham radio FM repeater is now active aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as of September 2, 2020 at 1:02 GMT.</p>



<h2>Ham radio and the International Space Station</h2>



<p>Ham Radio operators have enjoyed making contact with the ISS for many years. The holy grail has always been<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93z5x_ulQVY"> talking to ISS astronauts on FM simplex (145.800)</a> — but those can be rare chance encounters. Ham radio operators have also enjoyed slow-scan television (SSTV) broadcasts and APRS packet radio via the ISS digipeater. Now we get to work the world’s most expensive FM repeater thanks to the new InterOperable Radio System (IORS) installed on the ISS.</p>



<p>The InterOperable Radio System (IORS) replaces an ancient Ericsson radio system and packet module that were certified for spaceflight over two decades ago. The 5 watt HT that was aboard the ISS was getting worn out after many years of use.&nbsp;The Ericsson radio looks like something from a 1990s episode of Cops.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="669" height="753" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ericcson_ISS_Radio.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ericcson_ISS_Radio.jpg 669w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ericcson_ISS_Radio-267x300.jpg 267w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ericcson_ISS_Radio-300x338.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"><figcaption>5-watt Ericcson radio aboard the International Space Station that has now been replaced by the new InterOperable Radio System (IORS) radio system.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The new IORS was launched from Kennedy Space Center on March 6, 2020 onboard the SpaceX CRS-20 resupply mission. It consists of a custom space-modified Kenwood D710GA transceiver and an ARISS-developed multi-voltage power supply. The equipment was installed by NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy (KF5KDR).</p>



<h2>New Kenwood D710G ‘Space Flight Edition’</h2>



<p>The radio now being used is a Kenwood D710G and was engineered specifically for space flight. JVCKENWOOD USA and the ARISS worked closely to modify the D710G. The upgrades were performed by JVCKENWOOD and include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Output power is hardware limited to 25 watts for the safety of the International Space Station</strong></li><li><strong>Custom firmware and menus tailored for operation onboard the ISS.</strong></li><li><strong>Higher output/high-reliability fan to allow continuous repeater operation.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Continuous fan operation is an important feature in space for the reliability of the radio. There is no convection in microgravity, so all heat-generating components need to be cooled by moving air or conduction. If the radio burns up, there isn’t a Ham Radio Outlet down the street to grab parts.</p>



<h2>Ham radio antennas on the International Space Station</h2>



<p>The ISS features four different vertical antennas on the spacecraft. The reason for four antennas is redundancy in case of an antenna failure.  They are made of flexible metal tape that are coated in Kapton, a polyimide film that can withstand extreme temperatures. The antennas are designed to withstand kick loads of 125 lbs.  </p>



<p>Three of the four antennas are identical and measure 0.5-meter (1.5 foot) in length and each can support both transmit and receive operations on 2 meters, 70 cm, L-band, and S-band. The fourth antenna has a 2.5-meter (8 foot) long vertical whip that can be used to support High Frequency (HF) operations, particularly on 10 meters. However, no HF radio is currently aboard the space station.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Challenges of ham radio in space</h2>



<p>One of the most significant challenges with installing ham radio equipment on the International Space Station is power. The Muliti-Voltage Power Supply (MVPS) that powers the radio has to operate from either 120VDC or 28VDC and meet both NASA and Russian requirements, which are different. NASA also has stringent and detailed safety and engineering requirements.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="451" height="284" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ISS_HamRadio_Power_Supply.jpg" alt="ISS Multi-Volt Power Supply" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ISS_HamRadio_Power_Supply.jpg 451w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ISS_HamRadio_Power_Supply-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px"><figcaption>Multi-Volt Power Supply that will power the Kenwood D710 aboard the ISS</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The ARISS had to meet strict power quality and Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Compatibility&nbsp;specifications and limits. Even things like fan sound level, temperature rise, specific LED colors, special connectors, and non-flammable wiring. Even air filtering was a massive consideration as dust and lint are a real issue onboard the ISS.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>ARISS and getting ham radio aboard the ISS</h2>



<p>If you’ve made contact with the International Space Station in any way via ham radio you have the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) to thank. The group was created and is managed by an international working group, including several countries in Europe as well as Japan, Russia, Canada, and the United States of America. </p>



<p>The organization is run by volunteers from the national amateur radio organizations and the international AMSAT (Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation) organizations from each country. Since ARISS is international in scope, the team coordinates locally with their respective space agency&nbsp; and as an international team through ARISS working group meetings, teleconferences and webinars. </p>



<p>As you can imagine, the coordination between countries, space agencies, ham radio manufacturers and the ham community at-large is a time-intensive process — and it’s all volunteer. I urge you to consider <a href="https://www.ariss.org/donate.html">donating to the ARISS</a>. </p>



<h2>Trying the new ISS FM repeater</h2>



<p>I couldn’t wait to try the new FM repeater myself. During a recent pass I tried to make contact with my friend Dan, KB0TDW, in Council Bluffs, IA. </p>



<h3>ISS FM repeater information</h3>



<p><strong>Downlink</strong>: 437.800 +/- doppler</p>



<p><strong>Uplink:</strong> 145.990 (67hz PL Tone)</p>

<p>We all know the story. Some of us have even lived it. Forgotten, overshadowed, and pushed aside. Being the middle child was the worst. The oldest sibling received all the accolades and rewards, the youngest received all the attention. And there we were, waving our hands in the air trying to say, “Hey! I’m right here and I’m not like them!” And here we are, still waving our hands, still trying to push our way past the shoulders of our surrounding siblings. A little older, a little wiser, but still just as frustrated. Being a 90’s kid is tough.</p>


<p>“<em>Damn Millennials</em>.” Many times have these words been uttered through the lips of baby boomers and Gen X’s. “All they care about is social media! They don’t know how to work hard!” We hear it. And we take it. But it’s a load of bulls**t. Sorry, I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s go back. The definition of a Millennial is someone who was born between around 1980 and around the early 2000’s. While the characteristics of a Millennial can vary depending on the source, the gist is relatively the same. Lazy, narcissistic, coddled, materialistic, disengaged. Positive isn’t it? However in reality, the term “Millennial” isn’t as generalizable as many make it out to be.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.partyfeverltd.co.uk/media/catalog/category/Disco-section.jpg?resize=500%2C200" alt="" width="500" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.partyfeverltd.co.uk/media/catalog/category/Disco-section.jpg?resize=500%2C200&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>People born in the 1980’s are currently aged anywhere between 26 and 35 years old. Having been in the working world for around four or five years, this decade of people are usually seen as responsible employees and entrepreneurs, creating a name for themselves and making short work of corporate ladders all around the world (sounds like the eldest sibling doesn’t it?). Racking up accomplishments and higher salaries, they’re already integrated with Gen X and often aren’t thought of when someone mentions Millennials. People born in the latter half of the term “Millennial” are currently in the height of their teenage years, and because of their youth, are usually grouped in with the rest of the post-century birth crowd. This is where the stereotypes of being a Millennial stem from. But I’ll come back to that later. Right smack in the middle, as always, are 90s kids. Currently aged 16 to 25, we are forced to be grouped into this almost derogatory term, “Millennial”. However we couldn’t be more different than our two surrounding siblings.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/nSOoS53.jpg?resize=525%2C295" alt="" width="525" height="295" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/nSOoS53.jpg?resize=525%2C295&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>I was born in 1994. A great year if I allow myself to say so. Nelson Mandela, Netscape, Rwanda massacre, World Trade Center Bombing…Kurt Cobain…O.J. Simpson… Okay so maybe it wasn’t that great of a year. My point though is that all this happened in one year. Look at what 90’s kids have been through over the course of their short lives: Y2K, 9/11, the dot com boom and bust, the Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan, and the War in Iraq, Apple’s rise to power, the Great Recession, the first black president, the legalization of gay marriage. And those are just a few off the top of my head. We’ve been left to solve the energy crisis and are the last generation that can reduce climate change and global warming before it’s too late. The world has changed immensely in the past 25 years. It’s led to one of the greatest qualities that 90’s kids possess. Nostalgia. And a whole lot of it. We grew up in a time that was almost entirely analog and the biggest fear was Y2K instead of war and the economy. We came of age in a time of great turmoil both domestic and abroad. We became adults in an entirely digital age and a slowly recovering economy. We are incredibly young, and yet possess the nostalgia of an old man.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/vector.me/files/images/3/8/38289/aol_instant_messenger.png?resize=465%2C258" alt="" width="465" height="258" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/vector.me/files/images/3/8/38289/aol_instant_messenger.png?resize=465%2C258&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>We yearn for the simpler times, when the TV was turned on only after finishing family dinners and calling our friend’s home phone was the only way to reach them (other than AIM). And now I’m currently sitting in front of two computer screens as my phone sits within an arm’s reach dinging with updates of text messages, emails, and social media updates (perhaps this nostalgia is why hipsters came about). This dichotomy in ways of life leaves us 90’s kids wishing we were kids again. And that age was only 15 years ago! This isn’t a bad thing though. Growing up through all of this change has allowed us to adapt to all of the new tech and be very proficient with it. But we also see the value in writing a handwritten note to an employer after a job interview and enjoy relaxing with a good book. In a way, we are the most tech savvy analog people out there. Yes, I know what a tape deck is and watched VHS movies. I also owned a CD player. 90’s kids learned on Gateway computers but can do programming on any Mac book or PC no problem. I could go on and on but my point is that in our eyes, technology doesn’t seem to be advancing that fast. See, we grew up at the same time Apple did. At the same rate Google and Microsoft did. The pace of new technological advancements is about as routine as our birthday coming around every year. And it’s allowed us to be a pretty rare breed. Yes, we are different. But don’t you dare tell me I’m a Millennial.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I believe the term Millennial comes from the stereotypes derived from the post-turn of the century kids. All these kids know is digital. This group of kids was seven years old when the first iPhone came out. Is it their fault? Not to me it isn’t. It’s the result of being thrust into a rapidly advancing, tech dependent world and having a cell phone in their hands since 1<sup>st</sup> grade (that’s not an exaggeration, see the link at the bottom**). Look, our society is convenience oriented. Everything is about what makes things easier and faster. Is it any surprise that it has rubbed off on the very kids that are in their peak of susceptibility? Call it lazy if you want, I call it the effects of their environment. And everything <em>is</em> faster and easier. My cell phone (or mini-computer, however you look at it) has the capability to do anything I want and more. It houses the ability to connect with anyone I know in about 30 different ways. It’s no wonder these kids live and breathe social media. When everyone is connected to everyone else at all times, it’s easy to want to keep attention on yourself (after all, they are the youngest sibling; attention is everything). Has it implanted an entitled “me, me, me” loop track in these kids heads? Gen X seems to think so. And I’m inclined to agree. This is what is scaring employers and causing feelings of regurgitation every time they encounter a so called Millennial.</p>

<p>Sure, call me bitter. I think all of us 90s kids are. We are sick of being grouped into all these <em>Millennials</em> stereotypes. <em>But it is not us</em>. I suppose it’s our fault we’re included in this. We’ve had our heads down, working hard to build a name for ourselves. Haven’t heard of us? Well you’re about to. We are the kids from the 90’s. And we’re about to step out from behind our siblings and shake up the world.</p>

My day started pretty early as I have few appointments before I could dive into shopping, but those finished and, it was time for shopping.</p><p>Before selecting a specific store, I have gone through several stores and checked their provided lumber stock/prices. Later on, I even have created a bit advanced Google Sheets doc with all sizes/prices and some smart filtering, which helped me switch from 2x2 (38x38 mm) stock to almost 3x times cheaper 30x40mm stock.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-59.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-59.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-59.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image-59.png 1600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-59.png 2169w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So my choice was Super Viva Home Toyosu as it had a moderately huge lumber variety and tools section.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-55.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-55.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-55.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-55.png 1194w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>First, I went to check the carpet tiles as I plan to use them in the room to prevent the floor damage and help with acoustics a bit.</p><p>After that, I checked available tabletops to see if there is enough stock-size. I choose 2100x60x25 mm as tabletop stock. Afterward, I went through all plank sizes; everything was fine until I came to 60x60 mm columns, and there was not a single plank left...

I could go for picking tools and parts that I don't want to order via Amazon, as I would like first check them myself before buying.</p><p>Selecting only the necessary tools and screws and bits, I was finally finished after paying up my finally my 4-hour trip to the hardware store was completed.</p><p>I would like to thank the consultant named "あさゃ". I am not sure if it's the correct name, but it was written on his name tag, and big thanks for Super &nbsp;Viva Home Toyosu, which helped me with many issues. Even with a significant language barrier, I managed to deliver exceptional results.

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Don’t trust webview logins on native apps, they can read your cookies and use them to their advantage. <br>Following the Hacker News thread “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24469921">How I lost €4k in a Facebook scam</a>“, we reverse engineered the app to see how this happens.</p>



<h2>The new phishing wave</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">Phishing</a>. We all know it, we all hate it. Niek van der Maas hates it too, but <a href="https://github.com/Niek/Niek/blob/master/facebook-scam/README.md">he fell victim to a new type of phishing scam</a>, which took €4k from his bank account.</p>



<p>How did this happen? How did Niek, a tech-savvy user who owns an e-commerce business, fell for this kind of attack? </p>



<h2>Login flow and the user trust issue</h2>



<p>Login forms are everywhere these days. Instagram, TikTok, and even your local newspaper, there is almost always a need for user authentication to use any app.</p>



<p>One of the options of logging in involves an external provider – namely Google, Facebook, Twitter or others. In the case of Facebook, for example, Android SDK presents the user with an overlay and asks the user to log into Facebook using his or her username and password.</p>



<p>This makes the user trust the app, and creates within the user a confidence that logging into his or her social account via username and password is safe.</p>



<p>But it isn’t always so.  </p>



<h2>The case of Webview  scams</h2>



<p>What happens when you involve Webviews in the login process?</p>



<p>Webviews are inherently insecure by design. Any android app using a webview has full access to any data stored by the website – session storage, local storage, and most importantly, cookies. </p>



<p>For example, an app presenting a Facebook login page, can steal the user’s cookies after the login to the website.</p>



<p>Here are screenshots of two login pages. One is of an insecure Webview, and the other is a secure native login page. Can you tell the difference?</p>







<p><em>(The Instagram login is the secured native login page)</em></p>



<h2>Losing&nbsp;€4k in a Facebook scam</h2>



<p>Niek fell for the Webview scam. Niek isn’t a typical user; He runs an e-commerce, online marketing and consultancy. In his own words:</p>



<blockquote><p>I still find it hard to believe I fell for a scam like this. I have 2FA on all my accounts, use a password manager, and I’m generally very cautious with account security.</p></blockquote>



<p>Niek trusted logging into the malicious app by using his Facebook username and password. But little did he know that the app he downloaded was malicious, and used webview to steal his Facebook cookies, log into his account, and steal €4k from him. </p>



<p>Let’s have a peak behind the scenes of Tiktok Ads Business, the malicious app that he downloaded.</p>



<h2>Retrieving cookies from a Webview on Android</h2>



<p>The flow is simple. Niek opens the app, clicks on the big FB button, and is presented with a webview with Facebook’s mobile page on it. </p>



<p>After he logs in, the app runs this very simple line of code, taken from a decompilation of the app we did here at Sayfer:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="java" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public final string retrieveWebCookie() {
        return cookie = 
CookieManager.getInstance().getCookie(LoginActivity.CONST_URL_FACEBOOK);
}</pre>



<p>The Facebook coockies are then being sent to the malicious app’s remote server, and can be used to log into to the victim’s account.</p>



<p>Simple. Too simple really – any user logging into any website through a webview on an app, is at risk of giving away full ownership of his or her account.</p>



<h2>What’s next?</h2>



<p>A change is needed on two different levels.</p>



<p>Firstly, native flow logins shouldn’t rely on web-like views for the login flow. This makes users trust them too much, and results in users falling victim for real webview cookies hijacking scams.</p>



<p>Secondly, a technical change is needed in Android’s implementation of webview. Apps shouldn’t be allowed to access the cookies of any website they load. Webviews should be sandboxed, and the app should communicate with it via a very thin and limited API, to prevent them from hijacking user credentials.  </p>

<p>If you’re not living under a rock, then you’ve surely encountered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfsVAYSMwsksjfpy8P2t_I52mugGeA5gR">Heroes of Deep Learning</a>, an inspiring, heterogeneous band of Deep Learning all-stars whose  sheer grit, determination, and—[dare we say?]—genius, catalyzed the earth-shaking revolution that has brought to market such technological marvels as DeepFakes, GPT-7, and Gary Marcus.</p>



<p>But these are <em>no ordinary times</em>. And as the world contends with a rampaging virus, incendiary wildfires, and smouldering social unrest, <em>no ordinary heroes </em>will suffice. However, you needn’t fear. Hope has returned to the Machine Learning Universe, and boy, oh boy the timing couldn’t be better.</p>



<p>As confirmed to us by several independent witnesses, the sun, moon, and stars have been joined in the night’s sky by new, supernatural, sights. After a months-long meticulous investigation, including consultations with NASA, MI6, and Singularity University, we can confirm the presence, on Earth, of <strong>the</strong> <strong>Superheroes of Deep Learning</strong>!</p>



<h2>Superheroes of Deep Learning</h2>



<p>Who are these superheroes, you ask? What makes them so <em>super</em>? Let’s get one thing clear. These ain’t your run-of-the-mill GPU jockeys. The Superheroes of Deep Learning physically manifest the marvels of AI through psychokinetic powers. <em>Can any obstacle stand in their way?</em></p>

<p>With legions of students and quad-rotors at the ready, MOOC never goes into battle alone! Legend has it that in his last appearance on Earth, MOOC narrowly escaped an ambush by The Syndicate of Stanford Statisticians. With the dreaded Lasso constricting, MOOC was abruptly snatched from the jaws of defeat and carried to safety by a swarm of drones. Then, following his expert demonstrations, the drones acquired paranormal fighting skills via imitation learning. The Statistics Department has never recovered from the smashing defeat that followed!</p>

<p>A million data points isn’t cool. You know what’s cool? A billion data points. The superheroes of deep learning might seem powerful, but their powers only come to life when fueled by (st)reams of data. At one with the internet, Benchmark conjures epic datasets from thin air. Her powers can tip the scale in any battle.</p>

<p>You thought TPUs were fast? Better upgrade your drivers if you want to keep up with Q-silver! Warping the space-time continuum, he has acquired over 20 million lifetimes of experience. With such speed, he can even learn tabula rasa.</p>

<p>What cannot be solved by the power of convolution? If Captain Convolution continues at this pace, the answer may prove to be… “nothing!”. When he’s not taking supervillains to the mat or sliding his feature detectors across surveillance footage in search of ne’er-do-wells, The Captain enjoys rap battling vs. Ali Rahimi, convolving on the floor laughing, and feeling the learn.</p>

<p>Step out of the way, you low-dimensional nincompoops. If 0 dimensions can represent only a point, and 4 dimensions all of space time, just imagine what magic lives in higher-order realms. The Tensorial Professor travels these esoteric spaces with the ease of a native, and her famed <strong>tensor decomposition</strong>s will cut any villain down to size.</p>



<h2>Other Paranormal Sightings</h2>



<p>While the DL Superheroes have captured the lion’s share of public attention, they are far from the only supernatural beings to show up on the scene. We can confirm that at least three additional super-humans have been identified.</p>

<p>Don’t take your eye off of The Kernel for a split second or you might find yourself ripped off the ground and exploded into infinite-dimensional space. Some say the pain is even greater than tensor decomposition. With his powerful kernel machine in hand, can anyone stand in the way of Kernel Sch<span>ö</span><span></span>lkopf? Let’s hope he’s on our side.</p>

<p>While the DL superheroes’ arrival has been met by hordes of breathless fans and endless fawning on /r/machinelearning, not everyone is convinced that they’re on the side of justice. Wielding an arsenal of diagnostic probes and rocking a black belt in verbal jiu jitsu, Code Poet has convened the Algorithmic Justice League to hold the DL Superheroes to account. </p>

<p>Perhaps the DL Superheroes’ most vocal detractor, DAGman himself possesses extraordinary abilities. Rumor has it, he scaled The Ladder of Causation,  acquiring the ability to intervene on arbitrary facts in the world! But how can we verify these deeds if we can only ever observe just one … <em>potential outcome</em>?</p>

I’ve added half again as many logos as well as updated many existing logos as new reference material has surfaced. I’ve put in quite a few hours, scouring for typefaces that may or may not exist, giving up and making things from scratch, and of course, finding that perfect reference to make something perfect. In the process, I’ve found lots of fun easter eggs, plenty of mistakes, and lots of friends who share the same love as I do of these particular logos and designs. I am so happy that I have been able to do as much as I have and I hope to continue in the coming year. Thanks to all of you who have supported me be it in materials submitted, advice, references, financial aid, linking, etc! I am very humbled by the community and will continue to try to support these as long as I can.</p><p>This is a personal project that I began working on once the Cyberpunk 2077 Gameplay reveal came out, remaking many of the assets that the game has to offer in terms of graphic design. Its diversity in styles makes it such a fantastic game to replicate and I hope that these will come in handy for anyone hoping to make their own custom assets along with any cosplayers, modelmakers, or printers who need these files to lend authenticity to their own work. I truly appreciate the amount of time and effort the team at CD Projekt Red and their designers/artists have put out towards making such a real and visceral world. I am very excited for the game and look forward to finding many more amazing examples of their fine handiwork!</p><p>If there is an asset you would like to see recreated from the game, trailer, or something else, <a href="https://www.valencygraphics.com/contact">please let me know</a>. My WIP list is at the end of this page, but subject to change as new logos are found. These logos are also subject to change due to the fact that I am working with low-res screenshots and odd angles when recreating the logos from reference, thus some proportions might be off, certain designs may be modified, or some fonts might be off completely. Just know that I tried my best and if anything, that’s just my extra “spin” on things for now. :)</p><p>Special thanks to Eli (<a href="https://twitter.com/hey_elium" target="_blank">@hey_elium</a>) for contributing a few of these logos as well as The Madqueen (<a href="https://twitter.com/MadqueenShow">@MadqueenShow</a>), herself! They are denoted by the *.

September 15, 2020 | https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/react/learning-context-api-and-the-usecontext-react-hook/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/react/learning-context-api-and-the-usecontext-react-hook/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_d6b"><div><p>In this react hooks series, we have already explored the react hooks <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/react/react-hooks-and-local-storage-lets-build-a-todo-app/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">useState, useEffect</a>, and <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/react/understanding-the-usereducer-hook-in-react/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">useReducer</a>. The next react hook we will look into is the useContext hook.</p><p>As we saw while building our sample application, we had to lift the state up to our root component in order to be able to share it among multiple children components. We then passed in the corresponding state objects to the children components as props to have shared state and a single source of truth at the parent level.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>This problem was initially solved by using third party libraries for state management such as Redux. But in React 16.3, the React team introduced an official context API.</p><h2>The React context API</h2><p>Now that context API is built directly into the react library, we can use this context API to avoid the problem of passing data down through multiple layers of components. The context API makes it possible to pass data through components without having the need to pass props down manually through every level of the component tree.</p><p>Thus context is useful when the same data is needed by many components at different levels of a React application. It is worth noting that it makes component reuse a bit more difficult, so it should be used sparingly.</p><p>Context lets you broadcast data and changes to that data to components that have subscribed to it.</p><h3>Context Object</h3><p>To start using the API, we need to create a context object:</p><pre><code>const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);</code></pre><p>This object will be our source of values to components that subscribe to it. Whenever React is going to render a component that has subscribed to a context object, it will read it’s value from the nearest Provider above it in the tree.</p><h3>Context Provider</h3><p>Every context object comes with a Provider component which ,as the name suggests, provides the value of the context object to all children components. It also allows the consuming components to subscribe to changes in the context value. It can be declared as:</p><pre><code>&lt;MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}&gt;</code></pre><p>A provider can be connected to more than one consumers and providers can be nested as well. They might override values deeper in the tree, since the subscribers consume values from the nearest provider.</p><h3>The useContext react hook</h3><p>Now that we have a provider, we can start consuming the value that was assigned.</p><pre><code>const value = useContext(MyContext);</code></pre><p>Making use of the useContext hook, we subscribe to the context object and any changes that are made to it. The value that we receive from the useContext hook will always be equal to the value being passed from the nearest provider in the tree. If there is no provider above the component, the value will be equal to the default value that was passed to createContext().</p><p>All subscribers/consumers of a provider are re-rendered whenever the value prop of the provider is changed.</p><p>Now that we understand the context API, let us get into using it with hooks.</p><h2>Putting it all into place in our sample To-Do list application</h2><p>If you have not been following along our sample to-do list application, you can find the code that we have built <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo/tree/d2f2c98c1b9918eac8a909a3d8153497ff289156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. We will now start hooking in the context API to pass the items using the context API instead of passing them as props from the App component. We will use the useContext hook for doing so, but we first need to create the context object.</p><p>So, we will create a new context folder and in it, we will add a items context file:</p><pre><code>import React from 'react';

const ItemsContext = React.createContext();

export { ItemsContext as default };</code></pre><p>Next, we will hop into our App component to create a provider for the context object that we created.</p><p>The render function part of the component changes from:</p><pre><code>return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;header className="App-header"&gt;
        To Do items
        &lt;ItemList items={items} removeItem={removeItem} /&gt;
        &lt;AddItemForm addItem={addItem} /&gt;
      &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );</code></pre><p>to:</p><pre><code>return (
    &lt;ItemsContext.Provider&gt;
      &lt;div className="App"&gt;
        &lt;header className="App-header"&gt;
          To Do items
          &lt;ItemList items={items} removeItem={removeItem} /&gt;
          &lt;AddItemForm addItem={addItem} /&gt;
        &lt;/header&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/ItemsContext.Provider&gt;
  );</code></pre><h3>What do we want to share using the context API?</h3><p>We need to provide the value to the provider now. But what do we want to share among components? That is up to us. In this instance, we want to share the items so that components that need it can access it. And we also want to share the items dispatch function as well, so that components that need to change the components data can do so.</p><p>Doing so will remove the need for all the props that we are passing from the App component right now.</p><p>Thus, we will be creating an object with those two properties on it, and that will also be the default value for our context object. Thus the initialization of the context object changes to:</p><pre><code>const ItemsContext = React.createContext({
  items: [],
  itemsDispatch: () =&gt; {},
});</code></pre><p>and the provider gets the value as:</p><pre><code>&lt;ItemsContext.Provider value={{ items, itemsDispatch }}&gt;</code></pre><p>With this in place, we do not need to pass in any props to the ItemList and AddItem components. It is now upto them to extract what they need from the context API using the useContext hook.</p><h3>Refactoring the ItemList component</h3><p>The item list component no longer needs items as a prop. We can refactor it to get the items using the useContext react hook. We will refactor this first, and then see if we can also remove the removeItem prop later.</p><p>Since we will be using the useContext hook, we will need to import that in the ItemList component as well as the items context that we had created since useContext needs that too.</p><pre><code>const ItemList = ({ items, removeItem }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div className="items-container"&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        {items.map((item) =&gt; (
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;Item key={item} item={item} removeItem={removeItem} /&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        ))}
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};</code></pre><p>will be changed to:</p><pre><code>const ItemList = ({ removeItem }) =&gt; {
  const { items } = useContext(ItemsContext);

  return (
    &lt;div className="items-container"&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        {items.map((item) =&gt; (
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;Item key={item} item={item} removeItem={removeItem} /&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        ))}
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};</code></pre><h3>Removing the remove item prop</h3><p>Notice that the remove item function is eventually calling the dispatch function in our application. And we have already added that function to the context object. So we can remove that prop as well, and refactor our Item component too.</p><pre><code>const Item = ({ item, removeItem }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;{item}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; removeItem(item)}&gt;X&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};</code></pre><p>can now be changed to:</p><pre><code>const Item = ({ item }) =&gt; {
  const { itemsDispatch } = useContext(ItemsContext);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;{item}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;button
        onClick={() =&gt;
          itemsDispatch({ type: 'REMOVE_ITEM', itemToBeDeleted: item })
        }
      &gt;
        X
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};</code></pre><p>You can see all the changes until now <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo/commit/8a0eee1191050fa1754f96d0a283d21b282a6bc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and the code until now <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo/tree/8a0eee1191050fa1754f96d0a283d21b282a6bc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p>Now that we have combined our useContext with useReducer, we have created our own mini version of Redux. We are sharing our dispatch function and the application data in our store just like we do with Redux. This does not make Redux obselete and there are use cases for using it. But for smaller applications, useContext and useReducer are sufficient to get the job done without relying on any third party packages.</p><h3>Refactoring the AddItemForm component</h3><p>This will be fairly similar to what we did above for the ItemList component. If you are interested, you can see the changes for this component <a href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo/commit/8a0eee1191050fa1754f96d0a283d21b282a6bc8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p>And once we are done, we will see that we are no longer passing any props to our children components at all. We are relying on useContext to get state from the context API and solve our initial problem of passing props down.</p><p>The final code for this application can be found on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>. And if you have any questions, feel free to drop a comment below. If there is any other hook that you want us to cover next, do let us know too.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><em>Hey, Aline (founder of interviewing.io) here. We’re trying something new. Up till now, all posts on this blog have been written by interviewing.io employees or contractors. Why? Frankly, it’s hard to find great content in the recruiting space. There’s so much fluff and bad advice out there, and we didn’t want any part of that.</em></p>



<p><em>The other day though, I was reading Hacker News and saw </em><a href="https://medium.com/@meekg33k/14-lessons-i-learned-from-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days-7732e4f7608d?source=---------4------------------"><em>an article by Uduak Obong-Eren about how he did over 60 technical interviews in 30 days</em></a><em> and what he learned from that gauntlet of an experience. I thought it was honest, vulnerable, well-written, and brimming with actionable advice. So, I reached out to him to see if he’d want to write something else. Fortunately, he did, and the article below is the inaugural post in what I hope will become our Guest Author series. You can read more about Uduak in the bio below.</em></p>



<p><em>A quick note because this is the first time we’re doing this. One of the things I’m most excited about with this new Guest Author series is the diversity of opinions it will bring to our blog. Technical interviewing and hiring is fraught with controversy, and not everything these posts contain will be in line with my opinions or the official opinions of interviewing.io. But that’s what’s great about it. After over a decade in this business, I *still* don’t think there’s a right way to conduct interviews, and I think hiring is always going to be a bit of a mess because it’s a fundamentally human process. Even if we don’t always agree, I do promise that the content we put forth will be curated, high quality, and written by smart people who are passionate about this space.</em></p>



<p><em>Now, off we go!</em></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" width="150" height="193" src="http://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Uduak-Obong-Eren-Photo-e1600132427566.jpg" alt=""><em><em>Uduak Obong-Eren is a Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area who is passionate about architecting and building scalable software systems. He has about five years of industry experience and holds a Masters in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. He is also an open source enthusiast and writes technical articles – you can view some of his writings at </em><a href="https://meekg33k.dev/"><em>https://meekg33k.dev</em></a><em>.

<p>What is the one thing you would look out for if you had to join a company?</p>



<p>Sometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-i-learned-from-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days/">60+ technical interviews in 30 days</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.</p>



<p>In this article, I will be sharing some of the red flags I observed while I was on this marathon of technical interviews. I will not be mentioning names of any companies because that’s not the intent behind this article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of this article is also not to make you paranoid and be on the hunt for red flags in your next interview, far from it. Rather the goal is to equip you with knowledge to help you immediately identify exactly the same or similar red flags in your next interview<em>,</em> and hopefully identifying them will set you up to better handle them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though the stories I’ll be sharing come from my marathon of <em>technical </em>interviews, these red flags do not apply only to technical interviews. They apply to all kinds of interviews and so there’s a lot to learn here for everyone.</p>



<span>The Red Flags</span>




<span>Your interviewer is only open to solving the problem ONE way</span>



<p>In the world of computing and in life generally, for any given problem, there is typically more than one way to solve that problem. For example, given a sorting problem, you could solve it using a<a href="https://www.programiz.com/dsa/merge-sort"> merge-sort</a> algorithm or a<a href="https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-sort"> heap sort</a> algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having this rich number of techniques to solve a problem makes it even more interesting and the general expectation in technical interviews is that you should have the flexibility to solve a problem using your preferred technique.</p>



<p>I had an interview where the interviewer asked me to solve an algorithmic problem. I had started solving the problem using a specific technique when the interviewer stopped me in my tracks and asked that I use another technique.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I probed a bit further to know why, it appeared that the reason he asked that I used the second wasn’t to test my knowledge of that second technique; it was because he was more ‘comfortable’ with that approach.</p>



<p>It is different if the interviewer wants to test your knowledge of something very specific. For example, given a problem that can be solved using iteration and recursion, the interviewer may want to test your knowledge of recursion and can ask you to solve the problem recursively. That wasn’t the case here.</p>



<p>I ended up using both techniques and discussed the trade-offs but frankly that experience left a bad taste in my mouth especially because that interview was with the hiring manager — my would-be manager, who is someone that can significantly influence your career growth and trajectory.&nbsp;</p>



<span>Undue pressure to accept an offer letter</span>



<p>It’s very exciting and fulfilling when you go through all preliminary stages of a technical interview, through to the onsite interview (remote or in-person) and then you receive that “<em>Congratulations &lt;insert name here&gt;, we are pleased to offer you…</em>” email.</p>



<p>However, that excitement often becomes short-lived when there is some form of pressure from your soon-to-be employer to accept the offer. It’s a bit more manageable when the pressure comes from someone in HR or the recruiter, but when it’s from the hiring manager, that can be harder to manage.</p>



<p>That was the case for me when I interviewed with a startup based in Palo Alto. They were a small company in terms of staff strength. My onsite interview with them had gone quite well. I had a good conversation with the hiring manager and an even better conversation with the VP of Engineering, so much so that I could tell that I was going to be extended an offer. I asked to know how long I had to accept the offer letter and I was told seventy-two hours.</p>



<p>The offer letter arrived later that evening, and it looked great — a six-figure offer definitely didn’t seem like a bad start. I was also at the final stage of the interview process with other companies too and thankfully, I had enough time to negotiate and accept the offer, or so I thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then the pressure started, incessant calls from the hiring manager and the VP of Engineering, back-to-back emails, all within the allotted time. So much was the pressure that it got to a point where I wasn’t sure I wanted to negotiate the offer anymore. I turned down the offer.</p>



<p>I turned down the offer because the experience got me thinking about the company’s work culture. Were the methods employed by the company to get me to accept the offer indicative of their work culture? If they needed to get something done, how far would they go?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now don’t get me wrong, yes the company wants to employ you, yes the recruiting team wants to ‘close the deal’ however, it’s very important to pay attention to how the company does this. Do they remain professional about it?</p>



<p>A company’s values go beyond what they say, it shows in what they do and how they do it.</p>



<span>Not enough clarity about your role</span>



<p>Among the many reasons why you would join a company is your desire to be involved in valuable work. I had the opportunity to join a US company based in Boulder, Colorado. They had contracted a recruiting agency to help them find someone to fill a Software Engineer position in their firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hiring process started with an exploratory interview with the recruiting agency closely followed by a second interview with a recruiter from the company. In both interviews, I couldn’t get a clear sense of the details of my specific role was — what team I would be on, what kinds of projects I’d be working on, what the career growth pathway was, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I understand that sometimes companies can be going through restructuring, but that didn’t seem to be the case here. It seemed more like the company was focused on completing their headcount. Even though there’s nothing wrong with completing a headcount, I think there is everything wrong with not having a clear purpose for a role for a couple of reasons:</p>



<ul><li>It means the role may not be critical to the company’s core business.</li><li>If the role isn’t that important, it may mean when a layoff comes, your position may be impacted.</li></ul>



<p>On a more personal note, I don’t want to be just a number. I want to work at a place where I have the opportunity to contribute in an impactful way, and I like to believe you would too. So it’s important to get clarity about your role, for where you are today and for future career growth.</p>



<span>Consistent lack of interest or low morale from interviewers</span>



<p>When looking to join a company, one of the things you simply must care about is the team you will end up working on. At least 25% of your waking hours will be spent interacting with that team whether in-person or virtually.</p>



<p>Interviews offer you an opportunity to experience firsthand what it will look like to work with your prospective teammates, especially since, unless you’re interviewing at a huge company, your interviewers are likely to become your teammates.</p>



<p>If through all the different stages of the interview process, you experience a <strong>consistent</strong> lack of interest or low morale from your interviewers, you might want to pay attention .&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I experienced that during one of my interviews, I couldn’t exactly tell what the cause was, but I knew something just wasn’t right. After some internal tussle, I decided to trust my gut feelings and ended the interview process with the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward to two months …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How is Google so fast? It’s so fast we take it for granted.  It feels instant from the time you search to when results are displayed.  What can we learn about the techniques they use to make their site so fast?</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="google-search-results-are-fast">Google Search Results are Fast</h2>
<p>The Google homepage is known for it’s speed, but that’s partly a function of how sparse it is.  For this discussion, let’s focus instead on the Google <strong>search results</strong> page.  There’s a lot more functionality and content, and it still loads incredibly fast.  Here we’re searching for “request metrics” from a mobile phone.</p>

<figure>
    <video controls="" muted="" preload="metadata">
        <source src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/results-load.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>Google Search Results for "Request Metrics"</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Wow.  That is almost instant. If we compare the speed of Google’s search results to our <a href="https://requestmetrics.com/web-performance/performance-profiling-nike">web performance profile of Nike.com</a>, there’s no question which experience is preferable.  But how does Google load those results so quickly?</p>

<h3 id="search-result-page-statistics">Search Result Page Statistics</h3>
<p>Let’s look at the statistics for this page load (gathered in the Network tab in Chrome Developer Tools)</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/page-load-totals.png" alt="Network resources loaded for search results">
</figure>
<ul>
  <li><strong>130</strong> requests total to load the search results</li>
  <li><strong>707 KB</strong> of assets over the wire (compressed using gzip)</li>
  <li><strong>9</strong> JS files</li>
  <li><strong>104</strong> image files</li>
  <li><strong>0</strong> CSS files</li>
</ul>

<p>Compared to many sites this is a “lightweight” page load, but there’s still over one hundred requests.  And there’s three quarters of a megabyte of assets shipped over the wire.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Google is using <strong>gzip</strong> for compression instead of their own <a href="https://github.com/google/brotli">Brotli algorithm</a>, even though my browser will accept either.  In benchmarks <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2016/02/understanding-brotlis-potential.html">Brotli can be configured to increase compression and performance</a> compared to gzip, so it’s not clear why they’re making this choice.</p>

<p>Overall these statistics are OK, but they don’t explain the speed we see.  The most notable insight here is that there are <em>zero</em> external CSS files.</p>

<h4 id="where-are-the-styles-coming-from">Where are the styles coming from?</h4>
<p>The browser did not request a single CSS file, and yet the page is styled nicely. Let’s look at the HTML that we got back from Google to see if we can figure out where the styles are coming from.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/inline-styles.png" alt="Inline styles">
    <figcaption>Inlined CSS in the page response.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They are inline!  Google is inlining the CSS and sending it out with the page response.  This allows the browser to render the styled content without waiting for an external resource to come back.  But Google doesn’t just inline CSS.</p>

<h2 id="inline-every-static-resource">Inline Every Static Resource</h2>
<p>Google takes inlining seriously.  Not only do they inline the styles, they inline their JavaScript!</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/inline-script.png" alt="Inline scripts">
    <figcaption>Inlining JavaScript too.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In fact, we can run some selectors against the page to see just how pervasive the inlining of scripts and styles is.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/inline-stats.png" alt="Inline scripts">
    <figcaption>Inline vs. external script and style resources.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can see that of <em>all</em> the scripts and styles on the page, everything is inlined except <strong>2</strong> external JavaScript files.  (<em>Note:</em> those two external scripts dynamically load additional JS files which is how we get <strong>9</strong> total on page load).</p>

<h3 id="what-if-we-dont-load-any-external-assets">What if We Don’t Load Any External Assets?</h3>
<p>To illustrate just how far Google has taken the concept of inlining static resources, let’s <em>only</em> load the HTML.  <strong>No other external assets</strong>.  No external JavaScript, no external images, no external anything.  I saved the HTML response from Google and opened it with my network turned off. How does it look?</p>

<figure>
    <video controls="" muted="" preload="metadata">
        <source src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/doc-only.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>The source HTML only.  No external assets.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It looks great!  There’s even favicons for all the search results.  The hamburger menu doesn’t work, and the images carousel towards the end is missing its images. But everything else looks pretty good.</p>

<p>Earlier we saw that <strong>104</strong> image files were loaded during the real page load.  And yet, we see most of the images working here.  What gives?</p>

<h3 id="inlining-images-with-data-uris">Inlining Images with Data URIs</h3>
<p>Google is using a clever optimization with most of the images.  If we look at the Request Metrics favicon image in the inspector we can see that the image has a special <code>src</code> URI - a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/">Data URI!</a> The binary image content is Base64 encoded and shoved directly into the <code>src</code> attribute.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/base64-rm.png" alt="Data URI base64 encoded favicon">
    <figcaption>The Base64 encoded Request Metrics favicon Data URI source.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Using Data URIs is yet another way Google shows their committment to inlining assets.  It’s a perfect technique to use when there’s many small images to display. The Data URI approach has diminishing returns for larger images since it bloats the page size. That’s why the “Images” carousel is blank - they are still using externally sourced images to populate that section.</p>

<p><em>Important:</em> It’s worth noting that each one of these Base64 encoded images is counted as a “request” in the Network tab of Chrome developer tools.   This explains why there are so many images “requested” but the page is so fast.  The browser never goes over the network to get them!  Here’s what they look like in the developer tools:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/data-img.png" alt="Network tab showing data uri images.">
    <figcaption>Data URI Image "Requests" in the Network Tab</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="inlining-for-speed">Inlining For Speed</h3>
<p>Google’s dedication to inlining JS, CSS and images shows how important it is for maximizing performance. Every external request the browser makes is a performance problem waiting to happen.</p>

<p>Google is taking no chances here.  Once a user’s browser receives that <em>very first</em> response from Google, it can render <strong>90%</strong> of the UI without going over the wire again.  This speeds things up and also mitigates slow or unreliable networks.</p>

<p>Of course, getting that first response to the user <em>quickly</em> is also important.  And 90% is not 100% - there <em>are</em> other requests necessary for a fully featured experience.  Inlining is not the only thing Google does to be fast.</p>

<h2 id="googles-fast-edge-network">Google’s Fast Edge Network</h2>
<p>Optimizing the content of a page is important, but perhaps equally important is delivering that page and its associated resources quickly over the wire.</p>

<h3 id="a-globally-distributed-infrastructure">A Globally Distributed Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Google runs <a href="https://peering.google.com/#/infrastructure">a robust network with multiple layers of infrastructure</a> to ensure that requests are handled as close to the end user as possible.  They have numerous <a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/net/433">peering arrangements</a> with ISPs around the world, and a comprehensive edge caching setup that ensures static resources are almost always nearby.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/ggc-nodes.png" alt="Google Edge Cache Nodes">
    <figcaption>Areas with at least one Google Global Cache edge node.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s <a href="https://peering.google.com/#/learn-more/faq">difficult to objectively measure</a> the performance of Google’s network with traditional tools like <code>ping</code>, but we can look at how things perform in our browser.</p>

<h3 id="the-initial-search-results-response">The Initial Search Results Response</h3>
<p>Here’s what the developer tools say about our search results loading times:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/doc-load.png" alt="Search results page load">
    <figcaption>Search results page load timing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The initial request to Google had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_byte">time to first byte</a> (TTFB) of <strong>145 ms</strong> (the blue box).  That is, the browser started receiving the response from Google after 145 milliseconds.  <a href="https://web.dev/time-to-first-byte/">That’s pretty fast</a>. The overall time to finish reading the response was <strong>880 ms</strong> (orange box).  This includes the time to download the entire response from Google.</p>

<p>Remember, because of Google’s aggressive static content inlining, 90% of the UI can be displayed to the user once the response is finished.</p>

<h3 id="the-static-content-is-even-faster">The Static Content Is Even Faster</h3>
<p>There are a few external JavaScript files retrieved during page load.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/static-load.png" alt="JS file load times">
    <figcaption>JavaScript File Load Times</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These files all have an average TTFB of <strong>~30 ms</strong>. This suggests the server is nearby, with minimal hops between my browser.  Considering I loaded this page over a Comcast internet connection, this is a solid response time.</p>

<h4 id="the-protocol-makes-a-difference">The Protocol Makes A Difference</h4>
<p>Not only are the Google servers nearby, they’re also serving files using a new protocol.  You might have noticed the value <strong>h3-Q050</strong> in the screenshots above. That’s because the browser is talking to Google over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3">HTTP/3</a>.</p>

<p>It’s still a draft standard, but the main difference between HTTP/3 and HTTP/2 is that TCP is no longer the underlying connection protocol.  They’ve adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> instead of TCP because it improves performance:</p>

<blockquote>
[QUIC] does this by establishing a number of multiplexed connections between two endpoints over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This works hand-in-hand with HTTP/2's multiplexed connections, allowing multiple streams of data to reach all the endpoints independently, and hence independent of packet losses involving other streams.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-to-be-fast-like-google">How to Be Fast, Like Google</h2>
<p>Most companies don’t have access to Google’s network or vast developer pool, but the same ideas they use to make their pages load quickly can be applied to any site.</p>

<h3 id="make-less-requests">Make Less Requests</h3>
<p>Google takes it to a new level, but avoiding network requests is major factor in improving web performance. Even with newer HTTP protocols, bundling assets to coalesce static content is still a good idea.  If you can inline some JavaScript or CSS that’s even better.  Using data URIs to transmit small images can also help. Networks are unreliable, and every request the browser makes has the potential to fail or be delayed.</p>

<p>Webpack is a staple in modern front-end tool chains, and there are several plugins that can help if you want to go the inlining route:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/DustinJackson/html-webpack-inline-source-plugin">html-webpack-inline-source-plugin</a> - for inlining all CSS <em>and</em> JS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/">style-loader</a>- if you just want to inline your styles.</li>
  <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/url-loader/">url-loader</a> - building Data URIs from images or other sources.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-cdns-and-modern-protocols">Use CDNs and Modern Protocols</h3>
<p>It’s unlikely you’ll have access to a network quite as sophisticated as Google’s, but modern cloud providers offer many similar features. Things like purpose-built CDNs and dynamic geo-based DNS routing are available to anyone.</p>

<p>Hosting static content on a CDN is an easy way to get some of the network benefits Google enjoys, including HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 support.  And using a geo-aware DNS solution let’s you take data locality to the next level if that’s important for your use case or customer base.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t use the cloud, third parties like <a href="https://www.stackpath.com/maxcdn/">MaxCDN</a> and <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> make it simple to deliver static content from around the globe.  And there are DNS providers like <a href="https://easydns.com/dns/pro/">easyDNS</a> offering full GeoDNS routing.</p>

<p>Google is one of the premier web properties on the Internet, and the company is driving many new web standards.  It’s no surprise their site is one of the fastest.  For everyone else, we’ve built <a href="https://requestmetrics.com/">Request Metrics</a>. Now you can see how your users really experience your site.</p>

<p>In the book <em>Refactoring</em>, Martin Fowler talks about splitting up long functions:</p>



<blockquote><p>How do you identify the clumps of code to extract? A good technique is to look for comments. They often signal this kind of semantic distance. A block of code with a comment that tells you what it is doing can be replaced by a method whose name is based on the comment. Even a single line is worth extracting if it needs explanation.</p><cite>Martin Fowler, <em>Refactoring</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>To find an example, I opened up the <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost">Github repo for Ghost</a> (the first major open source project that came to mind). Within 15 seconds I <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/7b5401b26841fbed839b5d964f27897b8bb15cf3/core/frontend/helpers/ghost_head.js#L141-L144">found this chunk</a> within a ~100 line anonymous callback function:</p>



<pre><code>// don't allow indexing of preview URLs!
if (_.includes(context, 'preview')) {
    head.push(writeMetaTag('robots', 'noindex,nofollow', 'name'));
}</code></pre>



<p>The book quote says to replace the block with “a method whose name is based on the comment.” So we could create <code>excludePreviewFromIndexing()</code> and remove the comment. </p>



<p>What would that get us? A few things:</p>



<p>We’d have<strong> no risk of the comment becoming outdated</strong>. The classic book <em>Clean Code</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin">Uncle Bob</a> talks about this:</p>



<blockquote><p>The problem with comments is that they have no compile-time check and&nbsp;tend to be forgotten. It’s very easy to change your code but forget about the comments.</p><cite>Uncle Bob, <em>Clean Code</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>We’d also get <strong>self documenting code</strong>. You wouldn’t need to read a comment to grok it at a glance.</p>



<p>Plus, we’d have a <strong>shorter parent method</strong>, and it would get <em>much </em>shorter if we did that in a few more places.</p>



<p>But how can this be?! I always learned that comments are good, and that uncommented code is bad code. I always felt guilty if I submitted a pull request without some solid code comments. I’ve asked other people to add comments countless times in code review. Have I had it backwards for all these years?</p>



<p>And what about “code tells you how, comments tell you why”?</p>



<p>I went looking for other opinions and found another, spicier quote from Uncle Bob:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>A comment is an apology</strong> for not choosing a more clear name, or a more reasonable set of parameters, or for the failure to use explanatory variables and explanatory functions. Apologies for making the code unmaintainable, apologies for not using well-known algorithms, apologies for writing ‘clever’ code, apologies for not having a good version control system, apologies for not having finished the job of writing the code, or for leaving vulnerabilities or flaws in the code.</p><p>[…] Is there any use of comments that are not apologies? I don’t think so. I can’t think of one. <strong>Is there any good reason to write a comment? Only if you’ve done something “wrong”.</strong></p><cite><a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.TimOttinger.ApologizeIncode">Uncle Bob</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Vicious, right? There’s never a good reason to write a comment, ever? Comments always mean you’ve done something wrong?</p>



<p>Jeff Atwood doesn’t go <em>quite</em> as far, but he’s close:</p>



<blockquote><p>You should always write your code as if comments didn’t exist.&nbsp;This&nbsp;<em>forces</em>&nbsp;you to write your code in the simplest, plainest, most self-documenting way you can humanly come up with.</p><p>[…] <strong>If your feel your code is too complex to understand without comments, your code is probably just bad</strong>. Rewrite it until it doesn’t need comments anymore. If, at the end of that effort, you still feel comments are necessary, then by all means, add comments. Carefully.</p><cite><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-without-comments/">Jeff Atwood</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Jeff also referenced <a href="http://www.codeodor.com/index.cfm/2008/6/18/Common-Excuses-Used-To-Comment-Code-and-What-To-Do-About-Them/2293">this blog post</a>. It ends with a tiny list of legitimate reasons to add comments:</p>



<blockquote><p>There are only four situations I can think&nbsp;of&nbsp;at the moment where I need to comment code:</p><p>1. In the styles&nbsp;of&nbsp;Javadoc, RubyDoc, et cetera for documenting APIs others will use.<br>2. In the off chance it really is that complex: For example, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bioinformatics DNA search function that took 5 weeks to formulate and write out. That’s how rare it is to have something complex enough to warrant comments.<br>3. TODOs, which should be the exception, not the rule<br>4. Explaining why the most obvious code wasn’t written. (Design decisions)</p><cite><a href="http://www.codeodor.com/index.cfm/2008/6/18/Common-Excuses-Used-To-Comment-Code-and-What-To-Do-About-Them/2293">Sam Larbi</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I guess I’ve had it backwards. Comments are not a sign of craftsmanship. Comments do not imply good code. It’s the opposite – comments imply bad code. If the code was good then the comments wouldn’t need to exist. </p>



<p>Comments should be an absolute last resort. And even then, I should feel a little guilty about them. </p>

The term refers to a process of <strong>writing and maintaining the source code</strong>, but in a broader sense of the term it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and structured process.</p></blockquote> <p>There is no ambiguity here. At all.</p> <p>Programming, writing code, building products, maintaining code and bug fixing. None of those means “<em>installing a platform with a few clicks</em>” or “<em>customizing options built by other programmers</em>“.</p> <p>I used to find that amusing over the first dozen or two interviews and applications. Nowadays, I do receive submissions by various people, including folks with little to no exposure to power user Internet usage or even “developers” who don’t own a computer (but rather use a smartphone to change themes, write short posts and&nbsp;post statuses on Facebook).</p> <p>Most people suffer from the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>&nbsp;and know nothing, hence claim to be developers.

A good percentage of the small business websites and blogs are often DIY solutions or merely WordPress installations with a bunch of themes and plugins installed.</p> <p>And this is totally fine for a hobby blog or a single page app that displays general information about the business.</p> <p>That said, there are more than enough use cases that require heavy programming, scaling large systems, performing migrations from 3rd party frameworks to WordPress platforms, enhancing security for enterprises, building educational multisite networks for universities, crafting Software as a Service solutions on top of WordPress and more.</p> <p>We’ve been involved in each of these cases. Currently, we do&nbsp;provide ongoing development for several sites generating over 10M page views a month, as well as franchise networks ran by enterprises, large media outlets, professional event management platforms and several more.</p> <h2>WordPress as An Application Framework</h2> <p>While WordPress has initially started as a blogging platform, its popularity has led to increasing the scope of applications that WordPress is a suitable solution for.</p> <p>Back in WordPress 3.0, custom post types and an editable taxonomy engine were introduced. Over the years, WordPress became a tool of choice for application framework development as well. In 2016, the REST API had been included as a part of the WordPress Core, making it possible to build single page applications or completely detached software solutions interacting with a WordPress website through its various APIs.</p> <p>Moreover, the most popular eCommerce solution nowadays is WooCommerce – currently powering 41% of all eCommerce websites using a known eCommerce platform:</p> <div><figure><a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/shop"><img alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" nitro-lazy-src="https://nitrocdn.com/mdqikLgfKYGSrbmTldEJjFfznWndiqoY/assets/static/optimized/rev-89836d7/devwp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/73d9f63cbf68d5d7391d41bb4dcbecbf.ecommerce-usage-statistics.png" nitro-lazy-empty="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNjQwIDM3OCIgd2lkdGg9IjY0MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzNzgiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+"></a></figure></div> <p>WordPress has been used by thousands of reputable brands, high-traffic websites, Fortune 500 companies and some of the leading giants on the Internet. Their teams are comprised of capable PHP and JavaScript engineers, devops experts, integration specialists and other qualified folks who make sure that the system is up and running, compatible with&nbsp;upcoming features and additional enhancements, secure, and fast.</p> <p>I wrote the definitive guide to the skills taught at a Computer Science specialty that is relevant to WordPress development at WP Elevation:</p> <div><figure><a href="http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/11/wordpress-install-developed-solutions/"><img alt="Building a Web Product Requires a Set of Skills" data-recalc-dims="1" nitro-lazy-src="https://nitrocdn.com/mdqikLgfKYGSrbmTldEJjFfznWndiqoY/assets/static/optimized/rev-89836d7/devwp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/73d9f63cbf68d5d7391d41bb4dcbecbf.disconnect-wordpress-install-developed.png" nitro-lazy-empty="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNjQwIDU3MCIgd2lkdGg9IjY0MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1NzAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+"></a><figcaption>Building a Web Product Requires a Set of Skills</figcaption></figure></div> <p>My guide includes a list of skills such as: Computer Architectures, Operating Systems, Networks, Databases,&nbsp;Programming Languages, Data Structures, Algorithms and more that are used by developers while building a web solution in order to build a robust, scalable and reliable end product for the right stack while considering other aspects related to building, operating and running a web solution.</p> <h2>Should Web Developers Use WordPress?</h2> <p>Yes, there is no practical reason for web developers to avoid WordPress whenever the platform provides a good chunk of the required functionality.</p> <p>Let’s take into account the fact that WordPress comes with a bunch of features out of the box:</p> <ul><li>An engine for creating pages and posts (news entries, articles)</li><li>A role&nbsp;engine with several roles and different capabilities having access to various features</li><li>A media component for uploading media, resizing images, creating post thumbnails</li><li>A full-fledged dashboard with limited features depending on the user role</li><li>A large suite of themes and plugins that you can extend further</li><li>Comments, additional tools, default website settings</li></ul> <p>With that in mind, as a web developer, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel when you can use WordPress. Put your PHP and JavaScript skills in use, study the default database schema and the plugin APIs provided by WordPress and use it as an application framework accordingly – just as you’d do with Laravel, FuelPHP, CakePHP, CodeIgniter or any of the other frameworks out there (excluding the UI element).</p> <p>Otherwise, if you’re someone who offers “WordPress development” but don’t code, and you haven’t read about the different layers under WordPress itself, <strong>please change your title to something relevant to your skills</strong> and service offering. Also, in order to&nbsp;evolve and start offering valuable solutions, allocate some time, and start reading – extensively – about everything that happens from the hardware through the network layers to the databases and programming languages.</p> <p>Installing a website itself is of no service to most clients who can accomplish the same in a couple of hours with a cheap host providing a detailed guide on their website. Providing&nbsp;real value and investing your relevant&nbsp;skills or partnering with a technical expert would be far more rewarding to you and your customers, and allow you to step up and take on great custom <a href="https://mariopeshev.com/main-considerations-when-working-with-big-enterprises/">projects for large businesses</a>.</p>  </div>  </article></div>]]>

          <p>We’re excited to release the first preview of Stargate, an open source API framework for data. This project came about because we got tired of using different databases and different APIs depending on the work that we were trying to get done. With “read the manual” fatigue and lengthy selection processes wearing on us every time we created a new project, we thought - why not create a framework that can serve many APIs for a range of workloads? From this, Stargate was born.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re a JavaScript developer building a website, saving and searching JSON is great and maybe you also have some GraphQL sprinkled throughout. If you’re a Java or C# developer working on an enterprise application, SQL is likely more your style. The goal of Stargate is to make your data available for you through whatever API you can dream up regardless of the backing datastore.</p>

<p>So far we’ve started with Apache Cassandra as the first backend and implemented the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) and a REST API for CRUD access to data in tables and have many more APIs coming soon.</p>

<p>For any project to thrive it needs to be easy to work with and contribute to. We kept that in mind while architecting Stargate and the core codebase is modularized to facilitate extensibility and collaboration. We hope that you’ll join us on this journey to redefine what’s possible when it comes to interacting with data at scale and if you’re interested in getting involved you can check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/stargate/stargate">GitHub</a>, join our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stargate.io/g/stargate-users">mailing list</a>, or follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/stargateio">@stargateio</a>! 🚀</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/init-stargate/stargate.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/init-stargate/stargate.png"></p>

<h2 id="how-does-stargate-work">How does Stargate work?</h2>

<p>Stargate is a data gateway component that is deployed between your client applications and database. We chose Cassandra as the first database because it solves the world’s hardest scale and availability challenges and we think there’s low hanging fruit in terms of APIs for the database.</p>

<p>Stargate itself is based on the concept of a Cassandra <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/dynamo.html">coordinator node</a> and is very similar to the “fat client” that Eric Lubow explains in his <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DataStax/optimizing-your-cluster-with-coordinator-nodes-eric-lubow-simplereach-cassandra-summit-2016">presentation</a> at Cassandra Summit in 2016. This means when Stargate is deployed, it joins the Cassandra cluster as a coordinator node but does not store any data. We chose this design because coordinator nodes in Cassandra already handle most of the request handling and routing that’s needed for a highly available storage proxy and it made sense to reuse that time-tested logic. This architecture allows for compute to be scaled independently of storage; a common model when using cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>The high-level architecture diagram below explains where Stargate fits in the stack and the vision for new APIs and integrations.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/init-stargate/kubernetes.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/init-stargate/kubernetes.png"></p>

<p>Taking a closer look, when a request is sent to Stargate, it is handled by the API Service, translated to the database query, and dispatched to the Persistence Service. The Persistence service then sends the request to the storage replicas of that row using Cassandra’s internal QueryHandler. The Persistence Service processes the request and responds to the client once it receives acknowledgements from the number of storage replicas specified by the request consistency level.</p>

<p>This is a pretty classic implementation of “<a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo-based</a>” coordination. Stargate’s ultimate goal is to have pluggable APIs on the front-end and pluggable storage engines on the <em>back-end</em> with all the Dynamo magic happening in the middle.</p>

<p>To understand how this distributed coordination works a bit more, in a single 6-node datacenter cluster with 3 storage replicas, an incoming request will go to all 3 replicas that own the requested row. In this case, the nodes labeled 1, 3, and 4 are storages nodes that own the data for the request. In the example below, the consistency level is LOCAL_QUORUM which means that Stargate will read or write data to 2 of the 3 storage replicas in order to satisfy the client request and ack the success.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/init-stargate/steps.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/init-stargate/steps.png"></p>

<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>
<p>Below is an example of the REST API for CRUD operations that serves the data stored in Cassandra tables over HTTP. You can try this example by downloading <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a> and importing the Stargate REST API collection in the <a href="https://github.com/stargate/docs/blob/master/modules/developers-guide/examples/stargate-rest-api.postman_collection.json">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Pull down the docker image</strong> (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/stargateio">https://hub.docker.com/u/stargateio</a>)</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">docker pull stargateio/stargate-3_11:v0.0.3</code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 2: Start the docker container</strong> using the <code>DEVELOPER_MODE=true</code> env variable. This removes the need to install a separate Cassandra instance.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  docker run <span>--name</span> stargate <span>-p</span> 8081:8081 <span>-p</span> 8082:8082 <span>-p</span> 127.0.0.1:9042:9042 <span>-d</span> <span>-e</span> <span>CLUSTER_NAME</span><span>=</span>stargate <span>-e</span> <span>CLUSTER_VERSION</span><span>=</span>3.11 <span>-e</span> <span>DEVELOPER_MODE</span><span>=</span><span>true </span>stargateio/stargate-3_11:v0.0.3</code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 3: Generate an auth token</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>-L</span> <span>-X</span> POST <span>'http://localhost:8081/v1/auth'</span> <span>-H</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
    "username": "cassandra",
    "password": "cassandra"
  }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"authToken"</span><span>:</span><span>"{auth-token-here}"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 4: Create a keyspace</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>--location</span> <span>--request</span> POST <span>'localhost:8082/schemas/keyspaces'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
      "name": "users_keyspace",
      "replicas": 1
    }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span>"users_keyspace"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 5: Create a table</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>--location</span> <span>--request</span> POST <span>'localhost:8082/schemas/keyspaces/users_keyspace/tables'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
      "name": "users",
      "columnDefinitions": [
        {
          "name": "firstname",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "lastname",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "email",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "favorite color",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        }
      ],
      "primaryKey": {
        "partitionKey": ["firstname"],
        "clusteringKey": ["lastname"]
      },
      "tableOptions": {
        "defaultTimeToLive": 0,
        "clusteringExpression":[
          {
            "column": "lastname",
            "order": "ASC"
          }
        ]
      }
    }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span>"users"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 6: Add rows</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>--location</span> <span>--request</span> POST <span>'localhost:8082/v2/keyspaces/users_keyspace/users'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
    "firstname": "Mookie",
    "lastname": "Betts",
    "email": "mookie.betts@gmail.com",
    "favorite color": "blue"
  }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"firstname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Mookie"</span><span>,</span><span>"lastname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Betts"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 7: Get rows</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>-G</span> <span>--location</span> <span>'http://localhost:8082/v2/keyspaces/users_keyspace/users'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--data-urlencode</span> <span>'where={"firstname": {"$eq": "Mookie"}}'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"count"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"data"</span><span>:[{</span><span>"firstname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Mookie"</span><span>,</span><span>"favorite color"</span><span>:</span><span>"blue"</span><span>,</span><span>"email"</span><span>:</span><span>"mookie.betts@gmail.com"</span><span>,</span><span>"lastname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Betts"</span><span>}]}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Check out the code and start building with us! We’ve architected this project with exploration, flexibility, and API and storage agnosticism as our <em>first class</em> citizens; the goal is that this makes it easy for the community to innovate and add new APIs and extensions.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how the Stargate modules fit together.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/init-stargate/stargate-modules.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/init-stargate/stargate-modules.png"></p>

<p>To get started building a new API extension, have a look at the existing <a href="https://github.com/stargate/stargate/tree/master/restapi">REST API</a> implementation in the Stargate repo first. To get started building a new storage extension, check out the <a href="https://github.com/stargate/stargate/tree/master/persistence-cassandra-3.11">persistence-cassandra-3.11</a> implementation. Once you have an idea of what you want to build, shoot us a note on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stargate.io/g/stargate-users">mailing list</a> to discuss. Note that the internal APIs are under active development and they are likely to change before the first version is released.</p>

<p>To request new features or file bugs, create a new GitHub issue in the <a href="https://github.com/stargate/stargate">stargate/stargate</a> repository and we’ll take it from there.
Let’s Explore
We can’t wait to see where this project takes <em>us</em> and we’ll be rolling out a few new APIs in the coming weeks. You can get updates by following us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/stargateio">@stargateio</a> and throw us a star on Github if you like what you see!</p>

<p>We’re ready for lift-off, see you in the stars! ✨</p>

    <article>
      
<p>On Thursday, September the 10th of 2020, three and a half months after the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.senx.io/may-2020-warp-10-release-2-6-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.6.0</a>, we published the 2.7.0 release of Warp&nbsp;10. Some exciting new features and functions as well as a few optimizations and several bug fixes come with this new release.</p>



<h2>New Features</h2>



<p>Fetching the right data is the first step in creating fast and concise scripts for data analytics. That’s why Warp&nbsp;10 offers multiple parameters to precisely select the data you want. In the 2.3.0 release, <a href="https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-release-2-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we introduced skip, sample, and boundaries</a>. </p>



<p>In this 2.7.0 release, we introduce <a href="https://github.com/senx/warp10-platform/pull/772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">step and timestep</a>. <em>Step</em> allows you to get one point every <em>N</em> points by stepping over points. <em>Timestep</em> works similarly, but on time, allowing you to get one point every at least <em>N</em> time unit. These 2 parameters as well as the sample parameter let you choose a technique to subsample your data when using all of it is irrelevant.</p>



<p>While adding these new parameters, we noticed <code>Warp10InputFormat</code> was lagging behind in terms of functionalities. It was not offering the same parameters fetch had, so we updated it to make it on par with standard fetching. In Spark or Pig, you can now use both a time window and a count as well as boundaries and subsampling to fetch data from Warp&nbsp;10.</p>



<p>For those seeking performance while having a very high number of GTSs, we added the <a href="https://github.com/senx/warp10-platform/pull/777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labels priority feature</a>. This lets you define the order with which the labels are used to select the GTS you requested by a FIND or a FETCH. By prioritizing the most discriminating labels, you can improve the performance of FIND and FETCH. Remember that the benefit is only visible for a very high number of GTS, more than millions.</p>



<p>Finally, we modified the mechanism of custom JSON serializers<a href="https://github.com/senx/warp10-platform/pull/802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> to make it easier</a> to implement. Instead of returning a raw string, you can choose between a raw string or a serializable object. This makes the serialization code easier to write and understand.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FLoWS is Coming</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-1024x262.png" alt="FLoWS syntax" width="245" height="62" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-1024x262.png 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-300x77.png 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-768x197.png 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-1536x394.png 1536w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-2048x525.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px"></figure></div>



<p>We heard you! </p>



<p>WarpScript has a too steep learning curve for some of the new users. We will introduce the FLoWS language which will simplify the onboarding of new users by making functions input and output clearer. </p>



<p>What differentiates FLoWS from WarpScript is its functional approach, hence the name FLoWS for Functional Lineage of WarpScript. FLoWS is fully compatible with WarpScript, enabling the use of all core functions plus all those from extensions.</p>



<p>The 2.7.0 release is the first to be able to support FLoWS by providing the necessary functionalities for FLoWS to operate. Be sure to update to this release if you plan to use FLoWS!</p>



<p>We will release it very soon, be sure to keep an eye on the blog, or subscribe to the <a href="https://senx.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=322486758928f239c3698c600&amp;id=bc195bb85c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newsletter</a> to be notified!</p>

September 15, 2020 | https://microtica.com/jenkins-is-old-we-need-an-alternative/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://microtica.com/jenkins-is-old-we-need-an-alternative/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>By far, Jenkins is the most adopted tool for continuous integration, owning nearly <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/ci--319/jenkins-market-share">50% of the market share</a>. As so many developers are using it, it has excellent <strong>community support</strong>, like no other Jenkins alternative. With that, it has more than 1,500 plugins available for continuous integration and delivery purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We love and respect Jenkins. After all, it’s the first tool we encountered at the beginning of our automation careers. But as things are rapidly changing in the automation field, Jenkins is <strong>left behind with its old approach</strong>. Even though many developers and companies are using it, most of them aren’t happy with it. Having used it ourselves on previous projects, we quickly became frustrated by its <strong>lack of functionality</strong>,<strong> numerous maintenance issues</strong>,<strong> dependencies,</strong> and <strong>scaling problems</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We decided to investigate if other developers face the same problems and quickly saw the need to create a tool ourselves. We asked some developers at last year’s AWS Summit in Berlin about this. Most of them told us that they chose Jenkins <strong>because</strong> <strong>it’s free</strong> in the first place. However, many of them expressed interest in trying to use some other Jenkins alternative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When using Jenkins, teams tend to make more mistakes with the delivery and end up with <strong>broken pipelines</strong>. As a result, they implement inefficient practices, can’t adopt agility well, and lose the flexibility to innovate. When problems come up, you instantly need an expert that will resolve the issues to unblock developers.</p>



<p><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> is a Jenkins alternative with modern DevOps in its foundations. Say goodbye to plugins and dependencies, late maintenance nights, backup, scaling, patching issues.</strong></p>



<h2>Solving modern problems with old technology</h2>



<p>CI servers date back to the mid-2000s when containers and microservices weren’t so popular. Coming from this pre-cloud era, Jenkins is designed primarily for manual installations. It doesn’t really help in taking the <strong>maximum advantage of Docker containers</strong> to create modern infrastructure. Docker integration is handled through multiple plugins (around 30 different ones are available with the name “docker”). For a world that is Dockerized, this is not what you’re looking for in a CI tool.</p>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-1024x839.png" alt="" data-id="2814" data-full-url="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm.png" data-link="https://microtica.com/?attachment_id=2814" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-1024x839.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-300x246.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-768x629.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-1536x1259.png 1536w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-488x400.png 488w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm.png 1600w" sizes="100vw"></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>Challenges arise with access management, configuration usability, and setting up jobs. Even with a <em>Jenkinsfile</em> that helps you define the job structure, you need to recreate new jobs from scratch. With the CLI, you need to have good knowledge of how Jenkins stores its configurations, and the documentation doesn’t really help you there at all. The tool is hard to learn, especially from a beginner’s perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, Jenkins setup is hard to create, maintain, and automate. <strong><a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> requires a single YAML file to define pipeline configurations (microtica.yaml), which makes it one of the simplest Jenkins alternatives.</strong></p>



<h2>Maintenance nightmares</h2>



<p>Jenkins requires a lot of maintenance, so you need to have dedicated experts to resolve problems efficiently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need to create and manage scripts to orchestrate everything. Even the core concepts of a deployment pipeline like build, artifact, environment, variables, steps, triggers, workflows, applications and services, rollback, testing, and monitoring <strong>all require a Jenkins job or script to manage</strong>. Hardcoding a deployment pipeline with scripts doesn’t work in today’s world of public clouds, containers, and microservices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doing this will bring more problems than benefits since you have to maintain those scripts as technologies and applications change and evolve. In the end, you <strong>spend more time maintaining</strong> then deploying new versions of the product. Your DevOps team should be <strong>innovating</strong> around your deployment process, not dealing with broken pipelines. Your pipelines should be dynamic and easily adaptable to changes by the ecosystem.</p>



<p><strong>With <a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> as a Jenkins alternative, you need NO additional setup and maintenance. You deploy in minutes so that developers focus on writing code and spend less time maintaining the tool.</strong></p>



<h2>Plugin overload</h2>



<p>Plugins are great as they can provide extensibility to a system’s core functionalities. But, what happens when you have to use a plugin for everything, even basic tasks? Build for a Docker environment, Kubernetes, pull from GitHub, authentication… All pretty common tasks, for which you need to <strong>install and maintain a plugin</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jenkins has 1500+ plugins available today. How do you decide which one to use? Most of them are written by third parties, which means they can lose support without any notice.</p>



<p>Also, worth mentioning is the dependency chain. Many services change all the time, making plugin <strong>dependencies very problematic</strong> and one of the most common causes of broken pipelines. This doesn’t really provide availability and stability.</p>



<p>Plugins require developers to install and configure them before they can start working. <strong>With <a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a>, you can start working right away! No need to use plugins and maintain them to build a complete solution.</strong></p>



<h2>Microservice support</h2>



<p>Jenkins was born way before microservices became popular. So it does a very poor job of supporting microservices. Especially the <strong>observability and monitoring</strong> aspects when having a more significant number of microservices, each having its own pipeline process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With no support for integrating and testing multiple services at once, Jenkins lacks essential functionalities for microservice applications.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> is a Jenkins alternative that offers multiple pipelines and automates your entire CI/CD microservices process. With integrated production-ready Kubernetes, you can deploy all your microservices in just a few clicks and monitor how they’re running &amp; detect issues.</strong></p>



<h2>Continuous delivery</h2>



<p>Continuous integration is part of the entire continuous delivery process, but you need more than CI to achieve a company maturity in CD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Jenkins, you can try and build a CD platform yourself, but be aware you’ll need a whole team for it, a load of time and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> enables you to define complex cloud infrastructure through full integration with AWS and Kubernetes. Automate your deployments and deliver on the cloud with confidence. </strong>If something fails during deployment, Microtica has the ability to rollback the environment to a previously successful state. This is especially important for a production environment, where system availability is a must.</p>



<p>Microtica also integrates with communication tools to enable software delivery teams to collaborate seamlessly.</p>



<h2>Wrap up</h2>



<p>Jenkins comes with a limited set of features. You need plugins to integrate with a lot of tools we use in today’s ecosystem. The biggest pro of Jenkins is that it is used and managed by the community, so you can mostly find answers to your questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jenkins is best for:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>On-premise solutions</li><li>Code hosted in-house&nbsp;</li><li>Highly customized workflows</li><li>Companies that have the resources to dedicate a team to manage and maintain it</li><li>Companies that don’t want to spend on a tool</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica,</a> on the other hand, <strong>covers both infrastructure provisioning and delivery of applications on Kubernetes, so you don’t have to use additional tools for that</strong>. In Microtica, with a few clicks, you can set up an entire Kubernetes infrastructure (plus databases, storages, cache clusters, etc.) and automate the delivery.</p>

<p>When I ask people whether or not they know what Qt is, they have either never heard of it, or know pretty well what it is. And usually the people who know what it is, have used it for software development, or simply built it because some other piece of software needs Qt. For you who don’t know what Qt is, I’d say without quoting Wikipedia or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.qt.io/" target="_blank">our own web site</a>, that Qt is a software platform with which you can easily create software that after written once, runs on all platforms supported by Qt. Meaning that you could have your calculator app running on an infotainment screen in your car, any desktop operating system, phone, tablet… you name it, but it would always run because of Qt. Honestly, the amount of supported target devices is huge. But to be able to support all these target devices, we at <strong>The Qt Company</strong> need to ensure that your app actually works everywhere. That’s, where our <strong>Continuous Integration</strong> (CI) comes in.</p>



<p>We spawned over <strong>4 million virtual machines</strong> during 2019, with the intent of testing something perhaps you created. Qt is <strong>open source</strong>. Anyone can suggest or implement a new feature or fix a bug they might have found. Your commit would then be peer reviewed and thrown in the mouth of the CI. The CI’s job is either to accept the change and merge it into the code base, or reject it when it doesn’t pass the vigorous testing done to it.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog-1024x453.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="340" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog-1024x453.jpg 1024w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog-300x133.jpg 300w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog-768x339.jpg 768w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog-1536x679.jpg 1536w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog.jpg 1708w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>



<p>The back bone of our CI is <strong>OpenNebula</strong> along with <a href="https://testresults.qt.io/coin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coin</a>. Coin is our own tool which monitors <a href="http://codereview.qt-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gerrit</a> for any changes staged for the CI. Coin is quite complex actually and does the work of figuring out what exactly needs to be built or tested. One staged commit in Gerrit causes a cascade of events where Coin requests OpenNebula for dozens of virtual machines at a time followed by yet dozens if not hundreds. One staged commit in Gerrit can in some cases produce over 2000 virtual machines, running various Windows, Linux and macOS distributions. These virtual machines compile the new code both natively and by cross compiling to different target architectures / devices and they also run automated tests.</p>



<p>The important task of <strong>maintaining the life cycle</strong> of all these virtual machines lands in the hands of OpenNebula. OpenNebula monitors the capacity of our infrastructure and queues up all requests it can’t handle yet due to lack of computing capacity on the servers. It keeps a constant eye on the servers watching that they respond and are healthy and takes them offline for maintenance if something goes amiss.</p>



<p>The <strong>orchestration of the virtual machines</strong> happens on the fly. Coin knows what needs to be built, and in the request for a virtual machine it defines the amount of CPU and RAM we wish to have, all depending on the task at hand. OpenNebula takes care of creating these virtual machines instantly using backing files over the network and not by doing slow deep clones out of the VMs.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grafana_for_blog.jpg" alt="" width="688" height="431" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grafana_for_blog.jpg 917w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grafana_for_blog-300x188.jpg 300w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grafana_for_blog-768x481.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px"></figure></div>



<p>Combined with an SQL database, OpenNebula stores all the data about what it has done. This allows us to collect that data and send it to <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> for easy tracking. There we can further visualize the loads in different time scales combined with the graphs from the servers as well. And OpenNebula’s <strong>support for custom hooks</strong> enables us to do various things whenever OpenNebula goes from one state to another with a virtual machine, further allowing us to <strong>optimize or track the performance</strong> of our CI system.</p>



<p>With the support of VNC within OpenNebula, we can go in to the desktop view and watch the progress within the virtual machine, and possibly start debugging a problem. We can also leave VMs up and running for longer periods of time, if we enable breakpoints in our flow so that in case of a test failure, we stop right there and allow a developer to go in and have a look.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/one_for_blog_.jpg" alt="" width="912" height="408"></figure></div>



<p><strong>Setting up OpenNebula</strong> is or can be very easy. Sometimes the flexibility of a software can be its downfall. If the software is too generic or works by dozens of plugins there’s a risk that the learning curve is too steep. Naturally, the more you can change the behaviour, the more you must also answer questions about how you want it to work. OpenNebula is quite flexible in those areas in which it works, yes, but luckily we have pretty good documentation regarding those other tweaks—at least if you ask me. And the OpenNebula dev team hasn’t thrown in a bunch of plugins that are not related to the core idea that’s behind it.</p>



<p>The documentation actually provides us with the means of <strong>self implementing drivers</strong> we use, and we even did so when we implemented the support for <a href="https://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a>. So instead of only running virtual machines via KVM (in Linux), we can also run them in Parallels (in macOS). The code for the drivers isn’t very complex either, so by looking at the existing code you can quite easily figure out what you need to do and whether you might need to start working on your own driver.</p>



<p>The last piece of the puzzle is then how OpenNebula really doesn’t care about how these build servers came to be. We use <a href="https://maas.io/">MAAS</a> to automatically deploy our servers. After the fully deployment process, we have a server online which OpenNebula can connect to. Add the server to the list and it is ready to serve. Ta-da!</p>



<p>I’m eager to see if some day in the near future OpenNebula incorporates Grafana and MAAS as a part of their standard delivery… Although this again starts to sound a bit like the plugin world where everything seems so complex, when all you wanted to do was schedule tasks on hosts, right? Maybe, sometimes, a tool is simply just complete and good enough to perform its original purpose? Wasn’t Winamp actually ready at 2.91? 😉</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I’ve got a big news to share with you today - after (over) 9 years of
development, <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> finally made it to version 1.0! There’s nothing
really big or groundbreaking there, as Prelude has been in a pretty good place for a very
long time feature-wise, but I felt like tagging a 1.0 release, because it’s 2020 and
all sort of crazy things are happening the entire year. Most of you probably
don’t know this, but Prelude was one of my first open-source projects<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>,
that’s why making it to 1.0 means a great deal to me. Open-source projects are a
product of love, plain and simple.</p>

<p>I know that Prelude has probably lost some of its significance in the era of
Spacemacs, Doom Emacs, and a myriad other great Emacs distributions with more
features, sophisticated plugin systems, bells, whistles, kitchen sinks, and all that jazz, but
I don’t really care. I’m happy that we made it so far, I’m glad that Prelude was
the gateway to Emacs for many people, I’m proud of the community we’ve built,
I’m proud that it inspired many other distributions to go in different
directions, and I’m proud that Prelude always stood true to its core philosophy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>simple</li>
  <li>easy to understand and extend</li>
  <li>stable</li>
  <li>a foundation for you to build upon, as opposed to some end-user product that you’re supposed to use as-is</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that it intentionally doesn’t pack all the bells and whistles that it could.
Prelude aims to enhance the classic Emacs experience without deviating a lot from it - e.g.
it would never enable something like <code>evil-mode</code> (vim keybindings) by default and so on.</p>

<p>All the third-party packages that it bundles are carefully vetted and are known to be of
good quality and to have reliable maintainers. That generally means that Prelude’s unlikely
to immediate adopt some shiny new package, that has established tried and true alternatives.</p>

<p>I know some people were pissed/disappointed that in recent years Prelude didn’t
change much, but for me this was never a problem - it was actually a feature, in
the same way that stability is a feature for Clojure. Fewer changes mean fewer
breakages, fewer things to learn, fewer confused users, etc. They also mean that
I believe that in terms of functionality and experience Prelude is where I want
it to be. Believe it or not, from time to time software projects are (mostly)
done.  Yeah, there’s always some room for more improvements, but after a certain
point the return on investment is simply not worth it (or even worse - it
becomes negative).</p>

<p>I’m always amused by how many people come to CIDER’s issue tracker reporting basic
issues with packages like <code>sayid</code> and <code>clj-refactor</code> (CIDER plugins) that were automatically
installed and enabled by their distribution. Most casual CIDER users don’t need those
packages and the complexity that comes with them, and power users can obviously
install and configure the packages themselves. That’s not a good user experience
in my book, and it’s a classic example of the power of the “less is more”
philosophy. Prelude bundles only CIDER (no extensions) and it just works.
Same with many other programming languages.</p>

<p>Rest assured that Prelude will continue to evolve in the future, but don’t
expect anything massive to change.  Lately I’ve been pondering switching to
<code>use-package</code> for the internals, although I don’t see a strong reason to do so,
and to leverage more of LSP here and there. Leveraging some Emacs 27 features is
also on the agenda. Better documentation would be an awesome improvement as
well!<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>One thing I’ve vowed to do going forward is to keep a better track of changes
and to tag releases more often. As a result the project finally has a
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> and
better contribution templates. I plan (hope) to cut a couple of “stable” releases 2-3
times a year. I also plan to find a couple of co-maintainers to ensure I can
retire quietly down the road, but I’m in no rush to do this.</p>

<p>I guess that was one pretty weird release announcement, but that’s the release
announcement I felt like writing.  Thanks to everyone who helped and used
Prelude for almost a decade! I love you all! Keep hacking!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-526">

<div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Google Maps</strong> is an excellent – probably the best – solution for displaying an interactive map on your website. A few years back, though, they decided to put a limit on their free API, beyond which you begin getting charged. While this decision makes total sense, and the free limit is high enough for most use cases, it has an important drawback: to use the API, you need to create an account, providing a valid credit card. That can be no issue for a one-off site, but if you are a web developer can cause a few headaches, as you have to ask each client to create a billing account and enable the required APIs. Clients can get overwhelmed by that, and supporting them could eventually cost you a few extra hours of work.</span></p>
<h2>The alternatives</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Therefore, searching for an alternative using data from <strong>OpenStreetMap</strong>, which has no such limits, was the reasonable thing to do, at least for projects that need no complex implementations, but just a map with a few locations on it (which is the majority of my projects). Searching at the WordPress’ repository can give you plenty of such plugins. More or less, they fall in two distinct categories:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Those that organize locations as custom post types, retrieving the maps with shortcodes. Some of them are quite powerful, with a handful of features. Managing them, though, becomes too complicated. First, you need to (sometimes painstakingly) create your locations either as post types or as repeater fields on a single post type, one location at the time. Then, you get a shortcode which you have to paste on the post/page that you want the map to appear. Those plugins can be excellent solutions for more complicated maps, but not practical enough for our simple use case. Also, <em>using shortcodes when you can have Gutenberg blocks is like sending a fax when you can use email</em>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Gutenberg blocks. They are not many, and they are more user-friendly, but they usually require you to copy the locations’ coordinates, which makes them OK but not great.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>The ideal requirements</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So, if there were no restrictions at all, how would we want a simple map block to work, for it to be as easy as possible for the non-tech-savvy content manager? After all, Gutenberg allows us to think out of the box here (or should we say, out of the block?). Based on my own needs, I identified the following requirements:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It should be a Gutenberg block. No shortcodes, and no custom post types. The whole functionality should exist entirely inside the post/page hosting the map.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It should work out of the box. No setting of API keys, and no options to be set beforehand. Just click on the block and start adding your locations.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You shouldn’t have to manually add coordinates. Just point and click on the map to drop a marker.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A marker’s popup should be allowed to accept formatted text, links, and images.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We live in the Gutenberg era. You don’t need a separate text field to add your popup’s content. You can just open the popup and start typing in it.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The map should remember the zoom level that you last set when adding your markers.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You should be able to adjust a few basic things on the map, like height, minimum and maximum zoom, dragging, and clicking behavior.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the end, we should end up with something like this:</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ootb-openstreetmap.gif" alt="" width="1462" height="980" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201462%20980'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></span></p>
<h2>UX challenges</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Building the above functionality turned out to be relatively straightforward on the technical front. <strong>Gutenberg</strong>, <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaflet.js</a> and <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStreetMap</a> were all the tools that we needed. In the process, though, a few interesting UX challenges came up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Removing a marker</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Click-and-drop is probably the most straightforward way to add markers. How do you remove them, though? In general, how should you deal with marker-specific options? For example in a future version of the plugin, you will have the option to add a different icon per marker.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Well, that was an easy one: just keep those options inside the marker’s popup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup.png" alt="" width="1195" height="519" srcset="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup.png 1195w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-500x217.png 500w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-1024x445.png 1024w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-768x334.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1195px) 100vw, 1195px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201195%20519'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup.png 1195w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-500x217.png 500w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-1024x445.png 1024w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-768x334.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup.png"></span></p>
<h3>Accidental drops</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Click-and-drop markers is a great feature but it can easily get problematic in two scenarios: when you accidentally quick-click anywhere on the map, and when you click and hold intending to drag.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To work around this issue, a small delay has been added, to create an “opportunity window” where you can perform the drop. That way, accidental quick clicks will have no effect. Similarly, if you fail to release the click quickly enough, you miss your window, as it assumes that you intend to drag.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To identify the opportunity window and make it apparent to the user, the cursor changes to a crosshair, and a notice pops up.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/drop-marker.gif" alt="" width="616" height="482" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20616%20482'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></span></p>
<h3>Drop an overlapping marker</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When you haven’t zoomed enough and you click-and-drop too close to an existing marker, the new marker appears on top of the old one and you can’t tell if the drop was successful or not unless you either zoom in or drag the marker to see if there is another one underneath. Solving this was as simple as adding a CSS animation to the dropping marker.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not only does that make the dropping apparent, but it makes our interface more visually appealing, and it’s just a few lines of CSS. Win-win, in all regards!</span></p>
<h3>Sane minimum and maximum zoom levels</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The map allows you to set the maximum and minimum limits that the user can zoom on the frontend. What if you set a min-zoom higher than the max-zoom, or a max-zoom lower than the min-zoom? Of course, you could always ignore the illogical values on your frontend, or let leaflet.js deal with it with whatever way it does, but still, your admin interface would make no sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To fix this, we need to make sure that whenever one value goes beyond the limits posed by the other, the other value gets updated as well. As a bonus, setting the same minimum and maximum zoom will lock the frontend zoom at that level, practically disabling it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zoom-limits.gif" alt="" width="263" height="539" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20263%20539'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So far, the plugin has been tested only by me, though I saw no serious bugs. It will probably need some polishing here and there, as well as some important additions. More specifically, the development roadmap includes, among others, features like separate icons per marker, an option to change the map’s colors and styles, a way to import and export the markers to a JSON file, and, probably the most important, a location finder with autocomplete capabilities, as a complementary way of adding locations.</span></p>
<p>In fact, I consider the location search to be an essential tool for the plugin’s UI to be complete. It’s a big feature, though, which needs some good thinking and careful implementation to make it as user-friendly as possible. So, I thought I’d release that basic version first, so that people start using it, and fix possible bugs before continuing to implement new features.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you think that the above functionality would work well for your needs as well, you can give the plugin a try, downloading it either from <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ootb-openstreetmap/" rel="noopener noreferrer">wordpress.org</a> or from <a href="https://github.com/gsarig/ootb-openstreetmap" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and let me know about your impressions in the comments.</span></p>

<p>Many people think Big Idea Productions died because of the lawsuit brought against it by Lyrick Studios over general market distribution rights to VeggieTales home videos.&nbsp; While it is fair to say that it was the loss of that lawsuit that forced Big Idea into bankruptcy, it certainly wasn’t the only factor causing Big Idea’s downfall.&nbsp; Others believe the money spent producing and marketing our first movie, Jonah, brought the company down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally I had hoped to produce and release the film for less than $15 million total.&nbsp; When the final production and marketing costs came in at nearly twice that, our hopes of recouping our investment vanished.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end our distributor got all of its marketing investment back, but not a penny made it back to Big Idea to recoup the money we had spent producing the film.&nbsp;&nbsp; So surely that killed the company, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; Not exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp; These two factors were certainly the straws that broke the camel’s back, but the camel was pretty sickly before Jonah even began production, and long before the owner’s of Barney the Dinosaur and Bob the Builder turned a litigious eye toward Bob and Larry.</p>
<p>So what killed Big Idea?&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour yourself some tea, and I’ll tell you the real story.</p>
<p>We Americans love to be ranked.&nbsp;&nbsp; People magazine keeps track of our “50 Most Beautiful People.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Forbes tracks the “400 Wealthiest Americans” and the “200 Highest-Paid Entertainers.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to be outdone, every year Inc. magazine puts out a list of the 500 fastest growing private companies in America.&nbsp;&nbsp; These companies tend to be on the small side, but for whatever reason, they’re growing like gangbusters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inc. tracks and ranks them all, and then the entrepreneurs behind each company can hang the magazine cover in their conference room and beam like proud parents when their friends notice their amazing fast-growing-ness.</p>
<p>If I had put a lot of value on such lists or if Inc. magazine had noticed us, it’s fairly likely Big Idea would have made the list a year or two.&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1996 and 1999 our revenue grew by 3300%, from $1.3 million to $44 million.&nbsp; Pretty impressive by anyone’s standards.&nbsp; But by early 2000, just as Jonah was headed into production, the company was in serious financial trouble. How could that be, you ask?&nbsp; Let me tell you.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note that only one-out-of-three companies that make the Inc. list repeat their appearance the following year.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens to the rest?&nbsp;&nbsp; Many see their growth stall, never to fully recover.&nbsp;&nbsp; Others simply cease to exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanish.&nbsp;&nbsp; You see, when a small company experiences extremely rapid growth, it soon ceases to be a “small company.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet just because it no longer qualifies as “small” doesn’t necessarily mean it is now “big.”&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, just because you’re no longer “Tim’s Software Hut” doesn’t necessarily mean you’re “Microsoft.”&nbsp;&nbsp; And somewhere in the middle, many, many companies fail.</p>
<p>Inc. magazine noticed this dynamic and had several business researchers look into it.&nbsp;&nbsp; What emerged was a picture of a treacherous period in any business’s growth when a company finds itself “too big to be small yet too small to be big.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The researchers dubbed it “No Man’s Land.”</p>
<p>The year was 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; VeggieTales was booming in a big way, and I was taken off guard by the success.&nbsp;&nbsp; Frankly, I thought 1996 was amazing, yet here was 1997 making 1996 look like… well, 1995!&nbsp;&nbsp; Every year since 1993 every VeggieTales video had sold more than the year before, and the trend seemed to be continuing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could remember the days when Christian publishers wouldn’t return my calls, and now the Wall Street Journal was calling for an interview!</p>
<p>In the midst of this mayhem, I read the book Built to Last, a classic business study of what makes great companies great.&nbsp;&nbsp; The analysis of the Walt Disney Company struck me as particularly relevant, and I found myself asking the question, “Do I just want to make a few films to leave behind when I’m gone, or do I want to build a company that can keep making great films for the next 100 years?”&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer seemed obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to build the next Disney.</p>
<p>By the time I finished the book I had a new vision for Big Idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; We would attract top artists from all over the country. We would build a culture of biblical values and great storytelling.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, the big one: The book said you needed to pick a “Big, Hairy Audacious Goal,” or a “BHAG” in Built to Lastparlance. Golly gosh… what was my “BHAG?”&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm. I wasn’t sure.&nbsp; I had always felt that God wanted me to tell the stories and teach the lessons he laid on my heart, but he hadn’t given me any particular big, hairy audacious goal.&nbsp; But the book said I needed one to inspire and focus my employees. Okay… deep breath… “We will build a top-four family media brand within 20 years!”&nbsp;&nbsp; Huh? Where did that come from?&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I knew was that now I had my “BHAG.” And if it was going to come true, we were going to have to get a lot bigger. What I didn’t know was that my new path would take us right smack through “No Man’s Land.”&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cue sinister score here.)</p>

<p>I try to be a friendly citizen of the web. I try to keep my site in good
   shape. It should load quickly, track nothing beyond your basic server logs,
   not hassle you about cookies, GDPR or my newsletter. I do have a newsletter
   but it won't pop up in your face here. I try to stay firmly on the side of
   friendly and a good experience in how I run this site.
</p>
<p>I do these things because I want my site to be not just bearable but an
   actually great experience in its own quiet way. Just
   as important to me as replying to email in a reasonable timeframe, doing
   what I've told people I will and following up on things that require my
   attention. I try my best and I want this to also be true for my website.
   As a consequence it also happens to have a perfect Lighthouse score most
   of the time.
</p>
<p>A while back I had an idea that smells a bit funny.
   It has the scent of some poor web ethics. But it may also be a very useful.
   I'm not the first to discover it but I also haven't seen a lot about it.
   It seems to be usable for reasonable things but it is also somewhat
   abusable. Also, it definitely breaks the principle of least astonishment
   (or least surprise) in that it makes your browser do things you do not
   expect.
</p>
<p>I'm talking about <strong>tracking users via CSS</strong>. So one of the
   potential downsides of only knowing your traffic via server logs is that
   <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/server-log-analysis#the-total-number-of-unique-visitors">they are not a very good
      indicator of readership</a>
   as outlined by the Plausible Analytics people. Lots of automated traffic
   on the web, bots, crawlers and scrapers. So if there is a way that can
   remove most of the automated traffic without loading any JS, is that a win?
</p>
<p>Consider this CSS:</p>
<pre>    body:hover {
        background-image: url("https://underjord.io/you-was-tracked.png");
    }
</pre>
<p>There are endless ways to do it. This has a certain elegance because it
   actually requires mouse interaction. You could probably cover accessibility
   with some use of <code>:focus</code> as well. CSS won't load the URL until
   the selector is hit and it will only load it once for a given page view.
   You'd want a separate URL per page, which is trivial enough, query params
   would likely be enough. I'm convinced that this would give me better data.
</p>
<p><em>I am</em> <strong>not</strong> <em>going to be implementing it.</em>
   I think it's mostly fine to use things like Plausible or Fathom that are
   privacy-oriented analytics platforms because it is a lot better than what
   was going on before and I think the exchange between visitor and site isn't
   entirely clearcut. The negotiation is implicit and the browsers set the
   outer boundary terms. But what we do within that space is what determines
   our character. And I think the best way to serve my audience is to be
   mindful of this stuff, not stare myself blind at the numbers and keep
   working to maintain the trust and attention I've built up.
</p>
<p>The ugly side is that there are things that you can do to indicate every
   single link your users hover, even if they are blocking all JS. You can
   absolutely use this to do things I consider somewhat of an overstep that
   are probably just table stakes in the analytics space. One could also
   measure how long people stay using invisible animations, doing the same
   thing I believe.
</p>
<p>But it is a neat hack and I hadn't really thought about the possibility
   before. It is already somewhat known. I haven't checked who does and doesn't
   do this. So I figured I'd share. Because I do like a neat hack.
</p>
<p>If you want to register your opinion in the aggregate you can just click one
   of the following links and you and all the bots will be recorded in the
   server logs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://underjord.io/it-is-evil.html" target="_blank">It is evil</a></li>
<li><a href="https://underjord.io/it-is-not-evil.html" target="_blank">It is not evil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Where do you draw your lines on privacy? Are there things sites are fine to
   do to understand their traffic and visitors or should even the server log
   be abolished?</p>
<p>I'm genuinely curious how you feel. Feel free to get in touch via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or just find me on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Net Neutrality: European Court of Justice ruling on ISP 'zero rating' services]]>

September 15, 2020 | https://decoded.legal/blog/2020/09/the-end-of-zero-rating | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://decoded.legal/blog/2020/09/the-end-of-zero-rating">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><img src="https://decoded.legal/blog/content/images/20200915121345-person_pointing_at_screen.jpg" alt="Person pointing at green text on screen"><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The Court of Justice of the European Union has <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=FF6118823515E4E307895CFC0627E18A?text=&amp;docid=231042&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=2438278">ruled in its first case</a> on the interpretation of the EU's "open Internet" regulation — known by some as the "net neutrality" framework.</p>

<p>The Court was asked to consider the issue of "zero rating", in the context of two packages offered by Hungarian telco Telenor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>‘My Chat’ is a package which enables subscribing customers, first, to purchase 1 GB of data and use it without restriction until that data has been used up, accessing freely the available applications and services. Moreover, the use of six specific online communication applications, namely Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Twitter, Viber and Whatsapp, which are covered by a ‘zero tariff’, is not deducted from that 1 GB data limit. Secondly, the ‘My Chat’ package provides that once the 1 GB of data has been used up, subscribers may continue to use those six specific applications without restriction, whereas measures slowing down data traffic are applied to the other available applications and services.</p></li>
  <li><p>‘MyMusic’ is a package available in three different formats, ‘MyMusic Start’, ‘MyMusic Nonstop’ and ‘MyMusic Deezer’, respectively, which are accessible to customers with a pre-existing internet-access services package. Those formats enable subscribers, first, to listen to music online using four music streaming applications in particular – Apple Music, Deezer, Spotify and Tidal – and six radio services, and the use of those ‘zero tariff’ applications and services is not deducted from the data volume included in the format purchased. Secondly, the ‘MyMusic’ package provides that once that data volume has been used up, subscribers may continue to use those specific applications and services without restriction, whereas measures blocking or slowing down data traffic are applied to the other available applications and services.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In essence, users can buy a package which lets them use any services they want, up to their data allowance, but which lets them use certain, specific services as much as they like: traffic to and from those services does not count towards their data allowance. Once the user has used all of their data allowance, access to other services is blocked or degraded, but they can still access these specific services.</p>

<p>The CJEU was asked to look at four specific questions, which it condensed into one: is the approach to zero rating taken here compatible with either or both Articles 3(2) and Article 3(3) of the open Internet Regulation.</p>

<p>The Court's answer was that such a service is incompatible with both. The Court said that those services:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>are incompatible with Article 3(2) of Regulation 2015/2120, read in conjunction with Article 3(1) of that regulation, where those packages, agreements, and measures blocking or slowing down traffic limit the exercise of end users’ rights, and</p></li>
  <li><p>are incompatible with Article 3(3) of that regulation where those measures blocking or slowing down traffic are based on commercial considerations.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>



<p>The Court limited its finding in respect of Article 3(2) to the situation in which the measures in question "limit the exercise of end users' rights".</p>

<p>The Court analysed whether this was the case for the measures here, and concluded that it was. However, its determination on this point is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the conclusion of such agreements <em>on a significant part of the market</em> is liable to limit the exercise of end users’ rights, within the meaning of Article 3(2) of Regulation 2015/2120 (my emphasis)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, the Court felt that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the greater the number of customers concluding subscription agreements to such packages, the more likely it is that, given its scale, the cumulative effect of those agreements will result in a significant limitation of the exercise of end users’ rights, or even undermine the very essence of end users’ rights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this give a provider scope to argue about the uptake of a particular package, and whether it is sufficiently limited that it poses no risk?</p>

<p>Or whether any limitation of rights is likely to be "significant"?</p>

<p>Or what if the "zero rated" services just consumed data at a lesser rate, rather than zero rate?</p>

<p>Or what if the user could pick which services fell within their zero rating bundle? (Although perhaps not appealing to communications providers, especially if they have commercial agreements with the zero-rated services.)</p>

<p>Possibly, if Article 3(2) was the only barrier to overcome.</p>

<p>But it's not. And the decision on Article 3(3) seems to be the nail in the coffin here, if zero rating leads to some services being degraded.</p>



<p>Even if a provider could find some way to wiggle around Article 3(2), the Court's ruling on Article 3(3) offers little assistance.</p>

<p>While providers can adopt "reasonable traffic-management measures", these must be based on "objectively different technical quality of service requirements of specific categories of traffic", and not on "commercial considerations".</p>

<p>Is there scope to argue that the kind of zero rating at issue here is not based on "commercial considerations"? Not really:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In particular, any measure of a provider of internet access services in respect of an end user [which is one of the zero rating approaches described above], which, without being based on such objective differences, results in the content, applications or services offered by the various content, applications or services providers not being treated equally and without discrimination, <em>must be regarded as being based on such ‘commercial considerations’</em>. (my emphasis)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second, the Court reiterated the requirements of the Regulation, that the measures must be only a fixed period and must be limited to those necessary to comply with a legal obligation, to preserve the integrity and security of the network or to prevent or remedy network congestion.</p>

<p>The Court ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>all measures consisting in blocking, slowing down, altering, restricting, interfering with, degrading or discriminating between specific applications or services cannot be considered reasonable within the meaning of the second subparagraph of Article 3(3) and must, therefore, in themselves be regarded as incompatible with [these requirements]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no need, the Court said, to assess the impact of the measures of end users' rights, because that is not a factor in assessing compliance with Article 3(3).</p>



<p>I wish I had some thing pithy and wise to say here. But I don't.</p>

<p>On its face, the ruling appears to pose a considerable challenge to communications providers which currently offer zero rated services. And, while the ruling in terms of Article 3(2) seems to offer some room for manoeuvre, this appears to me to be taken away by the blunt finding in terms of Article 3(3) if the outcome would be blocking or degrading of services.</p>

<p>I suspect some operators will look to see what they can do within the parameters of the judgment. If they can find a way to continue to offer zero rated services without triggering Arts 3(2) and 3(3), they may well do so. For example, by zero rating certain services only while a user has credit which lets them also access other services, a provider may be able to argue that Article 3(2) is satisfied, and Article 3(3) is not triggered.</p>

<p>Or perhaps we’ll see an end to zero rating. Is this a bad thing? It depends on your perspective.</p>

<p>These packages are attractive to telcos and, presumably, are attractive to some customers too.</p>

<p>But, if you are trying to launch a competing service to one included in a zero rating bundle, and traffic to your service comes out of a user's data allowance while traffic to your competitor's service does not, well, you've got another barrier to entry to overcome.</p>

<p>We'll need to see how this pans out but, seemingly, this is a pretty clear strike against many current approaches to zero rating.</p>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>

            <p>
              3D photography is a new medium that allows viewers to more fully experience a captured moment.
              In this work, we refer to a <i>3D photo</i> as one that displays parallax induced by moving the viewpoint (as opposed to a stereo pair with a fixed viewpoint).
              3D photos are static in time, like traditional photos, but are displayed with interactive parallax on mobile or desktop screens, as well as on Virtual Reality devices, where viewing it <i>also</i> includes stereo.
              We present an end-to-end system for creating and viewing 3D photos, and the algorithmic and design choices therein.
              Our 3D photos are captured in a single shot and processed directly on a mobile device.
              The method starts by estimating depth from the 2D input image using a new monocular depth estimation network that is optimized for mobile devices.
              It performs competitively to the state-of-the-art, but has lower latency and peak memory consumption and uses an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
              The resulting depth is lifted to a layered depth image, and new geometry is synthesized in parallax regions.
              We synthesize color texture and structures in the parallax regions as well, using an inpainting network, also optimized for mobile devices, on the LDI directly.
              Finally, we convert the result into a mesh-based representation that can be efficiently transmitted and rendered even on low-end devices and over poor network connections.
              Altogether, the processing takes just a few seconds on a mobile device, and the result can be instantly viewed and shared.
              We perform extensive quantitative evaluation to validate our system and compare its new components against the current state-of-the-art.            </p>

<p>In today’s world, data has played a huge role in the success of technology giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. All of these companies have built massively scalable infrastructure to process data and provide great product experiences for their users. In the last 5 years, we’ve seen a real emergence of AI as a new technology stack. For example, Facebook built an end-to-end platform called <a href="https://code.fb.com/core-data/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/">FBLearner</a> that enables an ML Engineer or a Data Scientist build Machine Learning pipelines, run lots of experiments, share model architectures and datasets with team members, scale ML algorithms for billions of Facebook users worldwide. Since its inception, millions of models have been trained on FBLearner and every day these models answer billions of real-time queries to personalize News Feed, show relevant Ads, recommend Friend connections, etc. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for most other companies <strong>building AI applications remains extremely expensive</strong>. This is primarily due to<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/06/forget-agi-lets-build-really-useful-ai-tools/"> a lack of systems and tools</a><strong> </strong>for supporting end-to-end machine learning (ML) application development — from data preparation and labeling to operationalization and monitoring [1][9][10][11]<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The goal of this post is 2-fold: </p>



<ol><li>List the challenges with adopting AI successfully: data management, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring; </li><li>List the tools I think we need to create to allow developers to meet these challenges: a data-centric IDE with capabilities like explainable recommendations, robust dataset management, model-aware testing, model deployment, measurement, and monitoring capabilities.</li></ol>







<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eHHhzc1HYAh18oRETgjri9drWQpHZwF6OkyDRJ5E4r9YxSwqRViLC6LDTOt4UGLhdg0zMmTj7ScuMCOStrJk_jcmLqRrOkm5z7qIDjEIsyeIi8vpw3q8wAhltmiWA3LfUjDGcT3J" alt=""></figure>



<p>In order to build an end-to-end ML platform, a data scientist has to go through multiple hoops of the following workflow [3].</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O29ZMh7AatXlnuiH8_QAxbnpcxrVvl_ioNedmGNdks2QMDJbSWt-XpN757fu41qtdpoNgZ_kNYWBOV70s8LSGnMjA96sfW7A6FVX2naSq1Ukav1WlnmD3br_gw4ijLGnG8DDg1L9" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><strong>End-to-End ML Workflow</strong></p>



<p>A big challenge to building AI applications is that different stages of the workflow require new software abstractions that can accommodate complex interactions with the underlying data used in AI training or prediction. For example:</p>



<p><strong>Data Management</strong> requires a data scientist to build and operate systems like Hive, Hadoop, Airflow, Kafka, Spark etc to assemble data from different tables, clean datasets, procure labeling data, construct features and make them ready for training. In most companies, data scientists rely on their data engineering teams to maintain this infrastructure and help build ETL pipelines to get feature datasets ready. </p>



<p><strong>Training models</strong> is more of an art than science. It requires understanding which features work and what modeling algorithms are suitable to the problem at hand. Although there are libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn etc, there is a lot of manual work in feature selection, parameter optimization, and experimentation.</p>



<p><strong>Model evaluation</strong> is often performed as a team activity since it requires other people to review the model performance across a variety of metrics from AUC, ROC, Precision/Recall and ensure that model is calibrated well, etc. In the case of Facebook, this was built into FBLearner, where every model created on the platform would get an auto-generated dashboard showing all these statistics. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Deploying models </strong>requires data scientists to first pick the optimal model and make it ready to be deployed to production. If the model is going to impact business metrics of the product and will be consumed in a realtime manner, we need to deploy it to only a small % of traffic and run an<strong> A/B test</strong> with an existing production model. Once the A/B test is positive in terms of business metrics, the model gets rolled out to 100% of production traffic.</p>



<p><strong>Inference of the models </strong>is closely tied with deployment, there can be 2 ways a model can be made available for consumption to make predictions. </p>



<ul><li><strong>batch inference</strong>, where a data pipeline is built to scan through a dataset and make predictions on each record or a batch of records.</li><li><strong>realtime inference</strong>, where a micro-service hosts the model and makes predictions in a low-latency manner.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Monitoring predictions </strong>is very important because unlike traditional applications, model performance is non-deterministic and depends on various factors such as seasonality, new user behavior trends, data pipeline unreliability leading to broken features. For example, a perfectly functioning Ads model might need to be updated when a new holiday season arrives or a model trained to show content recommendations in the US may not do very well for users signing up internationally. There is also a need for alerts and notifications to detect model degradation quickly and take action. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4Km_x5ON36tuOWCwHEXI1pvbchanrGvk6ZZr0Zv789WO1g25Qo6T2_St-fnLKIwfitW_l6c304-ZVppb2iz6QRcvcq_cWoQAwrk2XWh26ZhgydZxjXKC0T140HnuJ5hyAMuY9qMt" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>As we can see, the workflow to build machine learning models is significantly different from building general software applications. If models are becoming first-class citizens in the modern enterprise stack, they need better tools. As Tesla’s Director of AI Andrej Karpathy succinctly puts it, <strong>AI is</strong><a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35"><strong> Software 2.0</strong></a><strong> and it needs new tools</strong> [2].<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZN2xWg5G0-EYYH2iEQ7b_Vza4SO9wU8YFrKfQyl3NlWatWmz2Z2hMsKtprxOofb7PtwZAXHfeKBjvyF9tKqE4aLSLDOSS_OvaTV1PZ10CbY4N2NEdHogmhoFRVpC3rb2fot3GO9x" alt=""></figure>



<p>If we compare the stack of Software 1.0 with 2.0, I claim we require transformational thinking to build the new developer stack for AI.</p>







<p>In Software 1.0, we have seen a vast amount of tooling built in the past few decades to help developers write code, share it with other developers, get it reviewed, debug it, release it to production and monitor its performance. If we were to map these tools in the 2.0 stack, there is a big gap!<br></p>



<blockquote><p>What would an ideal Developer Toolkit look like for an AI engineer?</p></blockquote>



<p>To start with, we need to take a <strong>data-first approach</strong> as we build this toolkit because, unlike Software 1.0, the fundamental unit of input for 2.0 is data. </p>



<p><strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE): </strong>Traditional IDEs focus on helping developers write code, focus on features like syntax highlighting, code checkpointing, unit testing, code refactoring, etc. </p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ArLnwbA3Hkj2cjWIVDKgHGTjLaNidh98es1ZdDFfETtPEdQpsUiVwuay3LKdkkKVa3Q33TR5PIZPo1ggbI9H1g6ZSv4RuhX8utUkLLI_b40h509nBk7OR3a34oKZ4DZa2cFgJvXj" alt=""></figure>



<p>For machine learning, we need an IDE that allows easy import and exploration of data, cleaning and massaging of tables. Jupyter notebooks are somewhat useful, but they have their own problems, including the lack of versioning and review tools. A powerful 2.0 IDE would be more data-centric, starts with allowing the data scientist to slice and dice data, edit the model architecture either via code or UI and debug the model on egregious cases where it might be not performing well. I see traction in this space with products like StreamLit [13] reimagining IDEs for ML.  <br></p>



<p>Tools like Git, Jenkins, Puppet, Docker have been very successful in traditional software development by taking care of continuous integration and deployment of software. When it comes to machine learning, the following steps would constitute the release process. </p>



<p><strong>Model Versioning:</strong> As more models get into production, managing the various versions of them becomes important. Git can be reused for models, however, it won’t scale for large datasets. The reason to version datasets is that to be able to <strong>reproduce a model</strong>, we need the snapshot of the data the model was trained upon. Naive implementations of this could explode the amount of data we’re versioning, think 1-copy-of-dataset-per-model-version. DVC [12] which is an open-source version control system is a good start and is gaining momentum. </p>



<p><strong>Unit Testing </strong>is another important part of the build &amp; release cycle. For ML, we need unit tests that catch not only code quality bugs but also data quality bugs. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I99g74dfzW1-4MoswbrjtOeSnw7aH0W8UpbwdumvSxN0FgshNyH-Jpa1WNmsJ-uoNScx6qRnw7IfnWSdcEuZekOwX-UMDliYVP69vDAyGpi4CiD0LQfE_lrfYVUWaHmYIwwBqXmS" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><strong>Canary Tests</strong> are minimal tests to quickly and automatically verify that the everything we depend on is ready. We typically run Canary tests before other time-consuming tests, and before wasting time investigating the code when the other tests are failing [8]. In Machine Learning, it means being able to <strong>replay a previous set of examples</strong> on the new Model and ensuring that it meets certain minimal set of conditions. </p>



<p><strong>A/B Testing </strong>is a method of comparing two versions of an application change to determine which one performs better [7]. For ML, AB testing is an experiment where two or more variations of the ML model are exposed to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal. For example in the dashboard below, we’re measuring click conversion on an A/B experiment dashboard that my team built at Pinterest, and it shows the performance of the ML experiments against business metrics like repins, likes, etc. CometML [14] lets data scientists keep track of ML experiments and collaborate with their team members. </p>

<p><strong>Debugging: </strong>One of the main features of an IDE is the ability to debug the code and find exactly the line where the error occurred. For machine learning, this becomes a hard problem because models are often opaque and therefore exactly pinpointing why a particular example was misclassified is difficult. However, if we can understand the relationship between feature variables and the target variable in a consistent manner, it goes a long way in debugging models, also called<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/"><strong> </strong>model interpretability</a>, which is an active area of research. At Fiddler, we’re working on a product offering that allows data scientists to debug any kind of models and perform root cause analysis. </p>



<p><strong>Profiling: </strong>Performance analysis is an important part of SDLC in 1.0 and profiling tools allow engineers to figure out slowness of an application and improve it. For models, it is also about improving performance metrics like AUC, log loss, etc. Often times, a given model could have a higher score on an aggregate metric but it can be performing poorly on certain instances or subsets of the dataset. This is where tools like &nbsp;Manifold [5] can enhance the capabilities of traditional performance analysis. </p>



<p><strong>Monitoring: </strong>While superficially, application monitoring might seem similar to model monitoring and could actually be a good place to start, we need to track a different class of metrics for machine learning. Monitoring is crucial for models that automatically incorporate new data …</p></div></article></div>

            <header>We believe software development will become ubiquitous. You will be able to create your own custom apps according to your specific needs from a simple text editor.</header>

            <p> The text editor is the living force of the modern world. We use it everyday for countless use cases. It’s our go to tool for putting words down. But it seems there’s room to improve the text editor for the next generation of makers and builders that grew up with the cloud, collaboration and information at the tip of their fingers.</p>

            <p>So, we tried to reimagine this piece of software from the ground up. The result is a simple text editor tool that helps you do more and be more productive.</p>

            <p>Main features</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Build with growing collection of components</li>
                <li>Connect your text editor document to a database</li>
                <li>Integrate logic operations to build custom no code applications</li>
                <li>Markdown editor to take notes, scribble ideas or plan your work</li>
                <li>Call APIs to get information quickly. Build your own internal tools</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We’ve decided to have a fairly large set of features in the beginning but with limited functionality (e.g. we only have a handful of Components and Functions to start with). This will allow us to learn from our users and build new features for them.</p>
            
            <call-to-action></call-to-action>

            <p>Next steps</p>            

            <p>We are working hard every single day to improve our product. We are in a very early stage and bugs <i></i> can appear from anywhere. <a href="https://zecoda.com/contact">Drop us a note</a> if you catch one of those 🙏</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Downloading, modifying, uploading, in general exchanging data is fundamental for modern apps. Using API (defined set of rules how apps can communicate with each other) is the most popular way of setting up a communication system between external systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What makes a good API?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, it needs to be easily understandable and legible for all its potential users. A decent API should have well-documented examples and do not leave any room for guessing. There is a solution that comes in handy if you want to create a solid API, it’s a tool called <strong><a href="https://api-platform.com/">the API Platform</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>API Platform</h2>
<p>API Platform is a set of tools that combined build a next-generation REST and GraphQL framework to build modern API. The server API Platform is built on top of enterprise-proven solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server-side</strong> - Symfony 4 microframework and the Doctrine ORM.</li>
<li><strong>Client-side</strong> - we have an option to choose between ReactJS &amp; Vue.js  for the web and React Native for mobile. </li>
<li><strong>Development &amp; deployment environments</strong> -  Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that powers the modules responsible for API creation, schema generation, admin panel &amp; client generation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Platform Core Library</strong> - a highly flexibly, stacked with cool features core library allowing you to build fully-featured REST or GraphQL API in minutes. </li>
<li><strong>The Schema Generator</strong> -  a CLI tool that instantly generates a PHP data model from the Schema.org vocabulary allowing ORM to create corresponding tables.</li>
<li><strong>API Platform Admin</strong> - a tool to automatically adds a React-based admin interface to your API, all that without writing a single line of code.</li>
<li><strong>API Platform Client Generator</strong> - the fastest way to scaffold fully-featured web apps (powered by React or Vue.js) or native mobile apps (based on React Native).</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Snowflake was destined for obscurity or worse. Snowflake seems like such an obvious winner today with the likes of risk-averse Berkshire Hathaway taking an unprecedented stake in their IPO. But it wasn’t always the case.</p><p>I remember talking to several venture capitalists and industry insiders in 2013 and this was the consensus:</p><blockquote><p>Snowflake is not a viable long-term company.</p></blockquote><p>At best, people believed they could be a me-too provider of analytics in a world dominated by cloud leaders like AWS, Microsoft, and Google. They weren’t entirely wrong.</p><h2>#1: AWS will kill them</h2><p>The fact that Snowflake was built to run exclusively on the AWS cloud platform was considered the biggest risk. Just like Veeva on Salesforce, the conventional wisdom was that the platform owners like AWS (or Salesforce) could squish them at will.</p><p>It turns out platforms like AWS do want companies on their platforms to succeed — they win when more startups build on their platform.</p><h2>#2: Hadoop will kill them</h2><p>Snowflake was a closed proprietary system whereas the industry was headed towards open source and Hadoop was the clear winner. Here’s a news headline from 2013:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/10/29/with-141-million-in-capital-ipo-bound-cloudera-sprints-to-1-billion-in-revenue/#f726156368b0" target="_blank">With $141M in Capital, Cloudera sprints to $1B in Revenue</a>.</p><p>It turns out that very few customers really care about their ability to touch and feel your source code. Even the best open-source companies are now pivoting to a cloud-first approach.</p><h2><b>#3: Gross Margins will kill them</b></h2><p>Snowflake pays a lot of money to AWS and the thinking was they can never walk out of that abyss.</p><p>It turns out that scale and pricing power can lead to great gross margins (61%) and here’s what Snowflake says about it in it’s IPO prospectus:</p><blockquote><p><i>Our improved gross margin during the last four quarters presented is primarily attributable to higher volume-based discounts for purchases of third-party cloud infrastructure, increased scale across our cloud infrastructure regions, and improved platform pricing discipline.</i></p></blockquote><h2>#4: Low Switching Costs will kill them</h2><p>Snowflake runs on data stored in AWS (or Google’s GCP or Microsoft Azure). This means customers can easily switch analytics providers to others that run on the same platform especially the platform owners themselves like AWS.</p><p>It turns out that while it’s true in theory — enterprises don’t really switch if they are being well served. In fact, Snowflake has a net negative churn — people buy more of it every year.</p><h2>#5: Lack of Subscriptions will kill them</h2><p>Unlike the SaaS players Salesforce, Workday, etc., Snowflake was not a subscription sale. You paid every month based on actual usage and not some pre-determined pre-negotiated dollar amount. This means you can’t model 3 to 5-year Total Contract Value of millions like Veeva &amp; Workday could.</p><p>It turns out that pay as you go pricing is an even more powerful model. As customers’ data increases and they run more queries, they end up paying a lot of money. Snowflake has some customers paying them north of $10M a year!</p><h2>#6: Public cloud strategy will kill them</h2><p>While people could envision storing sales leads or marketing emails in the cloud, it was conventional wisdom that the cloud was still not ready for prime time when it comes to financial services and healthcare companies. Why would a bank like Capital One put their most important data in the public cloud?</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5vb3k5tov1cb/1UWMrldK94Fds7CesgnYgd/f6226fad31f7e359e1af7991eed5f00d/1_jXwaBmIrosFQE1BRc-6M2Q-1.png"></p><p>                                                 Snowflake runs on public clouds (only).</p><p>It turns out Capital One and many like them decided it was just too damn hard to compete against the tsunami of startups without being able to use the public cloud. They went all in and never looked back.</p><h2>#7: SaaS Analytics will kill them</h2><p>This was my favorite. With all the cloud data sitting in the likes of Salesforce and Workday which offered their own analytics, why would companies bother to take a DIY approach? Wouldn’t all customer data end up in Salesforce, marketing data in Adobe, and employee data in Workday?</p><p>It turns out that few enterprises rely on just one SaaS provider. To get a sense of your business and your data, you have to combine data from internal and external systems, on-premise, and cloud apps, and so you do need a data warehouse.</p><h2>#8: Sales &amp; Marketing Costs will kill them</h2><p>Snowflake is in a very competitive business. Likes of Google, Salesforce &amp; AWS are willing to spend a lot of money to get you to use their data platforms. This criticism rings true even today as they have to spend about a dollar in sales &amp; marketing every quarter for every dollar in revenue they have. It literally burned through a $100M to get to its first few millions in revenue and has gone on to raise $1.4B so far.</p><p>It turns out that the market is willing to be very patient for big winners.</p><h2>#9: Data Platforms will kill them</h2><p>Snowflake is just a data warehouse solution whereas the companies it competes with like AWS, Azure, GCP — all have end to end platforms that include not just the data warehouse but also relational databases, analytics tools, and much much more.</p><p>It turns out best of breed wins if you are truly better than your competition.</p><h2>#10: Hired CEOs will kill them</h2><p>Snowflake is an oddity in the startup world. We love companies started and run by founders. I am personally in that camp too. And here we have a startup that went out and hired a Microsoft executive as the first CEO. Heresy!</p><p>And then it fired Bob Muglia and hired another retired executive and seasoned CEO. Heresy!</p><h2>Cloud Colors</h2><p>It turns out that success comes in many shades, mostly blue. Snowflake blue is one of them. Salesforce blue is another.</p><p>I am hoping so is Skyflow blue. We are building Skyflow learning form Salesforce (be cloud) and Snowflake (run on cloud). A simple, turnkey solution to all your data privacy and data residency needs — and soon you will be doing it right inside your Snowflake data warehouse.</p><p>With companies like Skyflow betting on the Snowflake platform, the future looks very blue.</p></div></div>]]>

Dies verstoße gegen den&nbsp;Grundsatz der Netzneutralität, wonach alle Daten im <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/thema/Internet">Internet</a> diskriminierungsfrei gleich behandelt werden müssen.</p><p>Hintergrund ist ein Fall in Ungarn, bei dem es um Tarife mit begrenztem Internet-Datenvolumen geht. Ist dieses Volumen verbraucht, wird der weitere Datenverkehr verlangsamt oder blockiert. Der Datenverkehr bestimmter Dienste wie Video- oder Musikstreaming-Apps wird jedoch nicht auf das Volumen angerechnet und ist auch nicht von der Verlangsamung betroffen.</p><p>Ähnliche Tarife werden aber auch in Deutschland angeboten. Susanne Blohm von der Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband erklärte am Dienstag jedoch, dass die bekanntesten deutschen Angebote wohl nicht von dem EuGH-Urteil betroffen seien, weil bei ihnen alle Apps - also beispielsweise auch die bevorzugten Musik- oder Streaming-Dienste - von der Tempo-Drosselung betroffen seien.</p><p>Dies betonten am Dienstag auch Vodafone und die Telekom: Vodafone habe seine Tarife sorgfältig gemäß EU-Recht konzipiert, sagte ein Sprecher. "Aus diesem Grunde drosseln wir bei Aufbrauchen des Tarif-Datenvolumens auch die Surfgeschwindigkeit der zusätzlich gewählten Pass-Option." Telekom-Sprecher Dirk Wende äußerte sich ähnlich: "Bei uns wird alles gleichbehandelt. Wenn reduziert wird, gilt das für alle Dienste." Wegen des Telekom-Tarifs "StreamOn" ist derzeit noch ein Gerichtsverfahren in Deutschland anhängig. Das Verwaltungsgericht Köln rief dazu im Januar den EuGH an.</p><p>Denn Verbraucherschützer sehen auch die Angebote in Deutschland kritisch. Auf den ersten Blick seien sie für den Kunden attraktiv, sagte Blohm. "Über kurz oder lang besteht jedoch die Gefahr, dass sich solche Angebote negativ auf die Wahlfreiheit der Verbraucher und Angebotsvielfalt am Markt auswirken." Ziel sollte Blohm zufolge sein - wie in vielen EU-Ländern längst Standard - grundsätzlich mehr Inklusivvolumen für den monatlichen Tarifpreis zu bekommen.</p><p>Grundsätzlich begrüße sie das Urteil vom Dienstag. Zugleich forderte sie jedoch Rechtssicherheit für die Verbraucher. Der Umgang mit derlei Tarifen müsse grundsätzlich geklärt werden - auch mit Blick auf die deutschen Angebote.</p><p>Die Luxemburger Richter argumentierten in ihrem Urteil vom Dienstag unter anderem, dass derlei Tarife die Rechte der Nutzer erheblich einschränken könnten. Sie könnten unter anderem dazu beitragen, dass die Nutzung der bevorzugt behandelten Anwendungen erhöht und der anderen Anwendungen verringert werde.</p><p>© dpa-infocom, dpa:200915-99-568762/4</p></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Hey there, welcome back. If you have been following my ongoing series <strong>Introduction to Elements Positioning</strong>, well you've made it to the third part of the series and here we're are going to be focusing on <strong>FlexBox</strong>.</p>
<p>At the end of this article, you would be able to use the flexbox module and it's properties to layout a webpage beautifully. Alright, let's carry on.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-flexbox">What is Flexbox?</h2>
<p>Flexbox is a CSS module, designed as a one-dimensional layout model which means it deals with one dimension at a time either rows or columns in contrast to the CSS grid which is a two-dimensional model and can take rows and columns together. 
Just like the CSS grid, it is a module because it has a whole lot of properties that help the flexbox model come to life.</p>
<p>Flexbox is activated by setting the display property of a parent element to Flex or inline-flex.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>: flex || inline-flex;
}
</code></pre><h2 id="flexbox-properties">Flexbox Properties</h2>
<p>In this article, We're only going to be focusing on  Properties for the Parent Elements(Flex Container).</p>
<p>We're going to be looking at properties from the parent elements property group, that will help you create beautiful and responsive page layouts.</p>
<h2 id="parent-elementsflex-container-properties">Parent Elements(Flex Container) Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>Display</li>
<li>Flex-direction (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse)</li>
<li>Flex-wrap (wrap, nowrap, wrap-reverse)</li>
<li>Flex-flow </li>
<li>Justify-content (center, flex-start, flex-end, space-around, space-between)</li>
<li>align-items (center, flex-start, flex-end, stretch)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="display">Display</h2>
<p>By setting a parent element's display property to Flex or Inline-flex, you have activated Flexbox. let's look at the example below ;</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>: flex;
}
</code></pre><h2 id="flex-direction">Flex-direction</h2>
<p>The flex-direction property defines what direction the flex-items would be arranged in, this could be in rows or columns i.e horizontally or vertically. </p>
<p>let's look at some examples to show us the various flex-direction values; </p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {
    <span>display</span>:flex;
    <span>flex-direction </span>: row;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The row value sets the horizontal direction of the flex-items, from left to right.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>: flex;
    <span>flex-direction</span>:row-reverse;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The row-reverse value sets the horizontal direction of the flex-items, but this time from right to left.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>: flex;
    <span>flex-direction</span>:column;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The column value sets the vertical direction of the flex-items, from top to bottom.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>: flex;
    <span>flex-direction</span>:column-reverse;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The column-reverse value sets the vertical direction of the flex-items, but this time from bottom to top.</p>
<h2 id="flex-wrap">Flex-wrap</h2>
<p>The flex-wrap specifies whether or not flex-items should continue on their specified direction which may cause some scrolling or wrap. let's look at some examples that explain better; </p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-direction </span>: row;
  <span>flex-wrap </span>: wrap;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the flex-items wraps? So that now there is no more scrolling </p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-direction </span>: row;
  <span>flex-wrap </span>: nowrap;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>nowrap</code> value is the default value for flex-items, which means there still is going to be some scrolling.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-direction </span>: row;
  <span>flex-wrap </span>: wrap-reverse;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The wrap-reverse value wraps the flex-items in reverse.</p>
<h2 id="flex-flow">Flex-flow</h2>
<p>The flex-flow flexbox property is a shorthand property for setting the <code>flex-direction</code> and <code>flex-wrap</code> of a flex-box container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-flow </span>: row wrap-reverse;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="justify-content">Justify-content</h2>
<p>Justify-content property is used for aligning items in a flex container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-flow</span>: row wrap-reverse;
  <span>justify-content</span>: center;
}
</code></pre>
<p>the center value aligns items to the center of the flexbox container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-flow</span>: row wrap-reverse;
  <span>justify-content</span>: flex-start;
}
</code></pre>
<p>flex-start value aligns items to the start of the flexbox container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-flow</span>: row wrap-reverse;
  <span>justify-content</span>: flex-end;
}
</code></pre>
<p>flex-end value aligns items to the end of the flexbox container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>justify-content</span>: space-around;
  <span>background-color </span>: black;
}
</code></pre>
<p>the space-around value specifies space before, between, and after a flex-item in a  flexbox container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>justify-content</span>: space-between;
  <span>background-color </span>: beige;
}
</code></pre>
<p>the space-between value specifies space between a flex-item in a  flexbox container.</p>
<h2 id="align-items">Align-items</h2>
<p>While the <code>justify-content</code> property aligns items on the horizontal axis, the <code>align-items</code> property aligns items on the vertical axis.</p>
<p>let's look at the values for the <code>align-items</code> property;</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>background-color</span>:yellow;
  <span>height</span>: <span>600px</span>;
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>align-items</span>:center;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>align-items: center</code> aligns the flex-items to the center of the flex-container on a vertical axis.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>background-color</span>:yellow;
  <span>height</span>: <span>600px</span>;
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>align-items</span>:flex-start;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>align-items: flex-start</code> aligns the flex-items to the start of the flex-container on a vertical axis.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>background-color</span>:yellow;
  <span>height</span>: <span>600px</span>;
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>align-items</span>:flex-end;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>align-items: flex-end</code> aligns the flex-items to the end of the flex-container on a vertical axis.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>background-color</span>:yellow;
  <span>height</span>: <span>400px</span>;
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>align-items</span>:stretch;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>align-items: stretch</code> stretches flex-items to fill the flex-container on a vertical axis.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <code>flexbox</code> module has eased front-end web development and brought a new way to position items with ease. It's comes packed with simple to read properties that make it have an even better learning experience.</p>
<p>This brings me to the end of this article. In this part of the series, we looked at how to layout a webpage,  using the Flexbox module. I hope you had a wonderful time, cheers ;-)</p>

<h3 id="1-the-origins-of-big-data-processing">1. The Origins of Big Data Processing</h3>
<p>The origin of the internet in 1989 enabled us to produce and consume data in all forms of life. This ensured a huge boom in data and in the following years essentially every organization and app became data reliant regardless of their scale.</p>
<p>Big Data/Data Engineering, which deals with the Collection, Processing and Storage of huge volumes of data became a matter of prime importance for business applications. For operational efficiency, demand prediction, user behavior, and other use cases like fraud detection, we need data and also in correct format. This is also know as ETL or Extract(Collection), Transform(Processing) and Load(Storage).</p>
<p>At this inflection point of data growth traditional tools (ex: Relational Databases) fell short this kind of new tasks which required processing petabytes scale datasets and providing the results quickly. This was very pronounced at companies like Google, which essentially crawls the whole internet and indexes the webpages for search results at planetary scale.</p>
<p>Google then came up with a very clever solution to their ever growing data problems called <a target="_blank" href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">MapReduce</a>, which later became <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.com/life/14/8/intro-apache-hadoop-big-data#:~:text=Hadoop%20was%20created%20by%20Doug,after%20his%20son%27s%20toy%20elephant.">Apache Hadoop</a>; and later on it went on to became the watershed moment in Big Data Processing and Analytics.</p>
<h3 id="2-hadoop-mapreduce">2. Hadoop MapReduce</h3>
<p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce program</a> is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each name), and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies). </p>
<p>The "MapReduce System" (also called "infrastructure" or "framework") orchestrates the processing on distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between different parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.</p>
<p>This initially solved the problems like building a large clusters of data and processing it. But this solution had a huge efficiency problem over time and as the data grew exponentially.</p>
<h3 id="3-hadoops-shortcomings">3. Hadoop's Shortcomings</h3>
<p>The verbose batch-processing MapReduce API, cumbersome operational complexity, brittle fault tolerance became evident while using Hadoop. With large batches of data jobs with many pairs of MR tasks, each pair’s intermediate computed result is written to the disk. This repeated disk I/O took large MR jobs hours on end, or even days.</p>

<p><em>Intermittent iteration of reads and writes between map and reduce

<h3 id="4-what-is-apache-spark">4. What is Apache Spark?</h3>
<p>Spark is a unified engine designed for large-scale distributed data processing, on premise data centers or in the cloud. Spark provides in-memory storage for intermediate computations, making it much faster than Hadoop MapReduce.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-spark-way-of-doing-things">5. The Spark Way Of Doing Things</h3>
<p>Spark achieves simplicity by providing a fundamental abstraction of a simple logical data structure called a <a target="_blank" href="https://databricks.com/glossary/what-is-rdd">Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)</a> upon which all other higher-level structured data abstractions such as DataFrames and Datasets are constructed. By providing a set of transformations and actions as operations, Spark offers a simple programming model that you can use to build big data applications in familiar languages.</p>
<p>Once an application is built using transformations and actions Spark offers, it builds its query computations as a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a>; its DAG scheduler and query optimizer construct an efficient computational graph that defines the path of execution and can usually be decomposed into tasks that are executed in parallel across workers on the cluster.</p>

<p>Spark supports the following </p>
<p>traditional RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL and etc., NoSQL </p>
<ol>
<li>Relational Databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL</li>
<li>NoSQL Databases like Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra and MongoDB</li>
<li>Apache Hadoop</li>
<li>Distributed Event Streaming Platform like Apache Kafka</li>
<li>Delta Lake</li>
<li>Elastic Search Engine</li>
<li>Redis Caching Database and many more...</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="7-spark-components-and-apis">7. Spark Components and APIs</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600066228544/GePH1Yf5w.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Spark-Components.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Spark Components and API Stack</em></p>
<p>Spark Supports languages like</p>
<ul>
<li>Scala</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Python - PySpark</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>R</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="71-spark-sql">7.1. Spark SQL</h4>
<p>Spark SQL works well with structured data and you can read data stored in an RDBMS table or file formats with structured data like CSV, text, JSON, Avro, ORC, Parquet and etc.</p>
<p>We can write the SQL queries and access the resulting data as a Spark Dataframe.</p>
<pre><code>// Spark SQL Example
// In Scala
// Read data off Amazon S3 bucket into a Spark DataFrame
spark.read.json("s3://apache_spark/data/committers.json")
.createOrReplaceTempView("committers")
// Issue a SQL query and return the result as a Spark DataFrame
val results = spark.sql("""SELECT name, org, module, release, num_commits
FROM committers WHERE module = 'mllib' AND num_commits &gt; 10
ORDER BY num_commits DESC""")

//Note: You can write similar code snippets in Python, R, or Java, 
//and the generated bytecode will be identical, 
//resulting in the same performance.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="72-spark-mllib">7.2. Spark MLlib</h4>
<p>Spark comes common machine learning (ML) algorithms library called MLlib. It provides many popular machine learning algorithms built on top of high-level DataFrame-based APIs to build models.</p>
<p>These APIs allow you to extract or transform features, build pipelines (for training and evaluating), and persist models (for saving and reloading them) during deployment. Additional utilities include the use of common linear algebra operations and statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Starting with Apache Spark 1.6, the MLlib project is split between two packages: spark.mllib and <a href="http://spark.ml/" target="_blank">spark.ml</a>. spark.mllib is currently under maintenance mode and all new features go into <a href="http://spark.ml/" target="_blank">spark.ml</a>.</em></p>
<pre><code>

<span>from</span> pyspark.ml.classification <span>import</span> LogisticRegression
...
training = spark.read.csv(<span>"s3://..."</span>)
test = spark.read.csv(<span>"s3://..."</span>)

lr = LogisticRegression(maxIter=<span>10</span>, regParam=<span>0.3</span>, elasticNetParam=<span>0.8</span>)

lrModel = lr.fit(training)

lrModel.transform(test)
...
</code></pre>
<h4 id="73-spark-structured-streaming">7.3. Spark Structured Streaming</h4>
<p>Spark Continuous Streaming model and Structured Streaming APIs, built atop the Spark SQL engine and DataFrame-based APIs.</p>
<p>It is necessary for big data developers to combine and react in real time to both static data and streaming data from engines like Apache Kafka and other streaming sources, the new model views a stream as a continually growing table, with new rows of data appended at the end. Developers can merely treat this as a structured table and issue queries against it as they would a static table.</p>
<p>Underneath the Structured Streaming model, the Spark SQL core engine handles all aspects of fault tolerance and late-data semantics, allowing developers to focus on writing streaming applications with relative ease.</p>
<h4 id="74-graphx">7.4. GraphX</h4>
<p>GraphX is a library for manipulating graphs (e.g., social network graphs, routes and connection points, or network topology graphs) and performing graph-parallel computations. </p>
<p>It offers the standard graph algorithms for analysis, connections, and traversals, contributed by users in the community: the available algorithms include PageRank, Connected Components, and Triangle Counting.</p>
<h2 id="8-spark-use-cases">8. Spark Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Processing in parallel large data sets distributed across a cluster</li>
<li>Performing ad hoc or interactive queries to explore and visualize data sets</li>
<li>Building, training, and evaluating machine learning models using MLlib</li>
<li>Implementing end-to-end data pipelines from myriad streams of data</li>
<li>Analyzing graph data sets and social networks</li>

	<div>
		
<p>In <a href="https://www.sicpers.info/2020/09/the-manifesto-for-anarchic-software-development/">The Manifesto for Anarchic Software Development</a> I noted that one of the agile manifesto principles is for self-organising teams, and that those tend not to exist in software development. What would a self-organising software team look like?</p>



<ol>
<li>Management hire a gang and set them a goal, and delegate all decisions on how to run the gang and who is in the gang to members of the gang.</li>
<li>The “team lead” is not in charge of decision-making, but a consultant who can advise gang members on their work. The team lead probably works directly on the gang’s product too, unless the gang is too large.</li>
<li>One member of the gang acts as a go-between for management and communicates openly with the rest of the gang.</li>
<li>Any and all members of the gang are permitted to criticise the gang’s work and the management’s direction.</li>
<li>The lead, the management rep, and the union rep are all posts, not people. The gang can recall any of them at any time and elect a replacement.</li>
<li>Management track the outcomes of the gang, not the “productivity” of individuals.</li>
<li>Management pay performance-related benefits like bonuses to the gang for the gang’s collective output, not to individuals.</li>
<li>The gang hold meetings when they need, and organise their work how they want.</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><hr><p><em>This is an automatic translation, we apologize for any mistakes. You can read the original spanish <a href="https://auamstrad.es/hardware/mundo-cpc/amstrad-cpc-472/">version here</a>.</em></p><hr><p><strong>The Amstrad CPC 472 is an 8-bit Microcomputer of the Amstrad brand, </strong>belonging to the classic range of <strong>CPC </strong>(<strong>Colour Personal Computer</strong>) and sold exclusively in Spain between 1985 and 1986. It is a personal computer almost identical to its predecessor, the CPC 464.</p><p>At the sight, it is only distinguished by the screen printing of the case, where the «64» is replaced by a «72», however, it has a particularity that <strong>makes it special: those extra 8 KB of RAM</strong> that indicates its name and that are accompanied by a hilarious and sometimes even crazy story. A succession of anecdotes, occurrences and arguing that will delight the most curious by the history of microinformatics.</p><p>For example, not everyone knows that <strong>t</strong>he CPC 472<strong> owes its existence to another 8-bit microcomputer: the Dragon</strong>. Had it not been for the emergence of Dragon computers in the Spanish computer scene, the Range of the Amstrad CPC would have gone from version 464 to 664 and completed in the 6128 (not counting the plus range). However, the Dragon brand was decisive for Amstrad to take out in Spain, and only in Spain, its version 472.</p><p><strong>How and why did it all happen?</strong> It’s a fascinating story, full of ambitious characters, business odagos, influence-trade and even palatial intrigue. But let’s start at the beginning….</p><h3>Dragon, the microcomputer made in Spain</h3><p>In 1982<strong>, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Data" target="_blank" aria-label="Dragon Data (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dragon Data</a> was a subsidiary of a British toy company called Mettoy,</strong> which then had financial problems. They get more funding from a number of sources, one of them bein<strong>g the Welsh Development Office</strong>. As a result, this UK-constituting nation moves the Dragon factory and began producing mass microcomputers.</p><p>However, after various commercial vicissitudes, in 1984 the majority distributor decided to abandon its distribution and try to settle the brand. Several bids from companies such as Tandy or Philips come into play, but eventually it was <strong>Spain’s</strong> Eurohard who bought Dragon’s<strong> right</strong>s for 150 million pesetas (almost one million euros), which accounted for less than a third of its real value. In principle, it seemed like a good deal.</p><figure><img width="640" height="499" src="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp" data-src="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg" alt="The Amstrad CPC 472, an unusual case 2" data-srcset="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="The Amstrad CPC 472, an unusual case 2" data-src-webp="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp" data-srcset-webp="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg.webp 300w" srcset="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg.webp 300w"><figcaption>Dragon 32</figcaption></figure><p>Eurohard’s di<strong>rective</strong> moved in the high circles of Spanish politics.

An appetizing and hearty candy for any company.</p><blockquote><p><em>Dragon computer ad in 1985</em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, <strong>Eurohard’s leaders failed </strong>to convince the Minister of Education and Science, socialist <strong>José María Maravall</strong>, and the<strong> </strong>Athena project was eventually nurtured with mostly foreign teams (Olivetti, IBM, Fujitsu…), with MS-DOS-compatible PCs being preferred as an operating system. To be sure, foreign brands also had their contacts in important circles of power.</p><p>Despite the clarity of the technical specifications (including the 5 1/4 floppy disk), we can find on the Internet <a href="http://www.elmundodelspectrum.com/proyecto-atenea-conoceis-a-atenea/" target="_blank" aria-label="testimonials from people (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">testimonials from people</a> who had at their <strong>Amstrad CPC 6128 schools and even Spectrum without a disk drive</strong>, so it follows that the application of Project Athena was also not very strict. In any case, <strong>Eurohard’s management failed</strong> to take over this succulent business for its <strong>Dragons</strong> and, at most, a few microcomputers of the brand would manage to enter the Spanish classrooms, which was a major economic blow to the company’s ambitions.</p><h3>The Spanish tariff policy</h3><p>However, not all aces had fallen out of their sleeves.

<br/>
September 15, 2020 | https://usamaejaz.com/nginx-lua-pastebin/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://usamaejaz.com/nginx-lua-pastebin/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>At times I use different services for sharing text or code snippets. Pastebin is a well known term for such services (where you <em>paste</em> whatever you want to share). The functionality is also simple (mostly) and that’s why I decided to build a pastebin service using only NGINX.</p>

<p><img src="https://usamaejaz.com/images/nginx-lua.png" alt="NGINX and Lua"></p>

<p>I have been a fan of NGINX the moment I learnt of it. In my earlier days (about 5 yrs ago), I was an <em>Apache guy</em>. But the moment I became familiar with NGINX and its vast power, I never looked at any other webserver software.</p>

<p>I often share text or code snippets online and that is why, It was fun to build it without using any “backend”. NGINX alone was enough with its <a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module">awesome Lua module</a> which offers unlimited possibilities. I wanted to make it simple so there is not much in it other than the only feature of storing plain-text pastes.</p>

<h2 id="nginx-config">NGINX Config</h2>

<p>The whole backend of this pastebin is inside of the NGINX config. The Lua code within <code>content_by_lua_block</code> is all responsible for saving the paste. The code is saving the pastes to the local filesystem but there are endless possibilities (for example, storing in a database like mysql or redis).</p>

<p>The following location block is responsible for all <code>/api/pastes</code> requests. The directory to which the paste is saved must also be writeable by the webserver user.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># api for storing paste
location = /api/pastes {
	default_type "text/plain";

		client_max_body_size 128k;
		client_body_buffer_size 128k;
			
	content_by_lua_block {
		ngx.req.read_body()
		
		local method = ngx.req.get_method()

		if method == "POST" then
			local args, err = ngx.req.get_post_args(1)

			if err == "truncated" then
				ngx.say("error: only one POST parameter allowed.")
				ngx.exit(403)
			end

			if not args then
				ngx.say("error: failed to get post args: ", err)
				ngx.exit(500)
			end
			
			local content = args.content

			if content == nill then
				ngx.say("error: required parameter 'content' not set")
				ngx.exit(400)
			elseif content == "" then
				ngx.say("error: required parameter 'content' is empty")
				ngx.exit(400)
			end

			math.randomseed(os.clock()+os.time())
			local random = math.random
			local function randid()
				local template ='xxxx4xxxxxxyxxxx'
				return string.gsub(template, '[xy]', function (c)
					local v = (c == 'x') and random(0, 0xf) or random(8, 0xb)
					return string.format('%x', v)
				end)
			end
			local name = randid()
			local file, err = io.open("/var/www/nginx-pastebin/pastes/" .. name, "w")
			if file == nill then
				ngx.say("error: couldn't open file: ", err)
			else 
				file:write(content)
				file:close()
			end
			
			ngx.say("https://", ngx.var.host, "/", name)

		elseif method == "GET" then
			ngx.say("send a post request with 'content=your_text_content'")
		else 
			ngx.say("error: not allowed")
			ngx.exit(405)
		end
	}
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an example of how services involving simple (or even complicated?) logic can be written using Lua inside NGINX.</p>

<p><code>ngx</code> has many other APIs and you can perform almost every NGINX-related action in your Lua code (rewriting, redirects, caching, serving content and much more).</p>

After seeing his post, and realizing I was meaning to go buy a Raspberry Pi 4, it just seemed natural to try and replicate his results in the hope of taking it a bit further. I am known for <a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/pi-on-the-wall-wall-mounted-home-server-part-2-diet-pi/">Raspberry Pi Butchery</a>, after all.</p>
<p>Before I tried desoldering anything, I set up my Pi for remote use; enabling SSH, WiFi, serial UART+ boot messages. The USB ports on the Pi board will not function after this modification, so this is super important.</p>

<p>As Tomasz lays out in his article, we need to remove the VL805 USB3 chip in order to access the PCIe interface. I used a hot air soldering station at low volume and medium-high temperature, with small nozzle head in order to not disturb the components nearby. I used flux along the edges and after a while the chip came away.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip.jpg" alt="" width="1521" height="1140" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip.jpg 1521w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip-300x225.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip-768x576.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip-1024x767.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1521px) 100vw, 1521px"></a>I tried to remove the solder from the large pad by mixing some low-temperature solder paste into whats there, but it’s not needed. Just cover it with capton or poor electrical tape. I used electrical tape just to make seeing the small wires I’d be soldering above it easier to see.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare.jpg" alt="" width="1521" height="1140" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare.jpg 1521w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare-300x225.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare-768x576.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare-1024x767.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1521px) 100vw, 1521px"></a></p>

<p>The VL805 datasheet is confidential which makes posting parts of it here tricky. However, an image search for “VL805-Q6 QFN68” may yield interesting results for those interested in finding out more. The pins we are interested in, are as follows (note differing polarity from Tomasz’s work):</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout.jpg" alt="" width="1382" height="1024" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout.jpg 1382w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout-300x222.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout-768x569.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout-1024x759.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout-405x300.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 1382px) 100vw, 1382px"></a></p>
<p>I used 0.1mm enameled wire, with each differential pair cut to nearly the same length. Tinning the end of the wire by scraping with a knife and dipping in a molten solder ball makes soldering to the pads we need easier. Holding the wires down with kapton tape, and using flux, with the smallest iron tip I had made the job just bearable under a microscope.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soldering.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soldering.jpg" alt="" width="855" height="862" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soldering.jpg 855w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soldering-150x150.jpg 150w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soldering-298x300.jpg 298w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/soldering-768x774.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 855px) 100vw, 855px"></a></p>
<p>The rather untidy looking result:</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/closeup.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/closeup.jpg" alt="" width="1521" height="1140" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/closeup.jpg 1521w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/closeup-300x225.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/closeup-768x576.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/closeup-1024x767.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/closeup-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1521px) 100vw, 1521px"></a></p>

<p>I was using a cheap PCIe riser as my “first interface” which was then to be connected to a PCIe switch card, which would then enable another 4 PCie slots. This first socket, as Tomasz mentioned in his article, needs the PCIe Reset pin pulled to 3v3, and both Reset and Wake signal traces to the USB socket cut. Note that whilst we now know where the PCIE Reset line is on the Pi, I have not needed to connect this as yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys.jpg" alt="" width="1152" height="864" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys.jpg 1152w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys-300x225.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys-768x576.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px"></a></p>
<p>The first attempt to boot with this setup resulted in the Pi not managing to boot at all. After some wiggling of the PCIe slot, the raspberry Pi booted, but no devices were shown when running lspci (<em>lspci can be installed via apt-get</em>). The third attempt, however, after some <em><strong>professional</strong> </em>wiggling of the PCIe slot, resulted in success! A booted Pi, with a PCIe switch!</p>

</pre>
<p>However, no devices were detected beyond the ASM1184e switch. Even a USB3 PCIe card using the same VL805 chip that I removed refused to detect. Running dmesg on the pi to get some driver details, I saw that whilst the PCIe link was active, and some busses were being assigned to the switch – it said that devices behind the bridge would not be usable due to bus IDs.</p>

</pre>
<p>The great thing about linux is that the source code is just there to dig into, and after finding where that “devices behind bridge are unusable” warning is printed I further discovered that the range of assignable busses can be limited by the Device Tree linux uses.</p>

<p><a href="https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Reference">Device trees</a> are simply a description of the hardware which is passed to the Linux kernel on boot. It has all the devices listed; their driver compatabilities, memory mappings, and configuration. It is particularly useful for describing peripherals which may not be discoverable via conventional means. On the root directory of your Raspbian Raspberry Pi boot SD volume, you will find <strong>bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb</strong> – which is the Compiled Device Tree binary. This binary blob is not user readable, but thankfully we can use the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dtc/dtc.git/plain/Documentation/manual.txt?id=HEAD">Device Tree Compiler</a> to decompile it into a readable form. I did all of this within Windows Subsystem for Linux.</p>
<pre>dtc -I dtb -O dts -o bcm2711-rpi-4-b_edit.dts bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb
</pre>
<p>That command will decompile into <strong>bcm2711-rpi-4-b_edit.dts</strong>. Searching this file for “pci” we find an entry for the PCIe – and it has a definition for bus-range which limits the bus IDs from 0 to 1. I change the entry from “&lt;0x0 0x1&gt;” to “&lt;0x0 0xff&gt;” and recompile to the binary form, and place that on the Raspbian SD card overwriting the default.</p>

<p>And then I plugged some VL805-based USB3 cards in (one with a chained Network Interface). The setup looks as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock.jpg" alt="" width="1521" height="1140" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock.jpg 1521w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock-300x225.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock-768x576.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock-1024x767.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1521px) 100vw, 1521px"></a></p>
<p>I have my Motorola LapDock USB hub connected to the Pi via the PCIe USB controller. The keyboard and trackpad work great!</p>

<p>I have a SATA controller based on a JMicron JMB363, which is detected correctly but there is no driver to load. This will require some linux driver/kernel fiddling to get a driver loaded correctly – but it’s very promising!</p>

<p>I’ll leave this here for now, whilst I read up on the Linux driver stack and how to build kernels for the raspberry pi 🙂</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! You can find me, as always, over on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/domipheus">@domipheus</a>. Additionally, thanks to <a href="http://mloduchowski.com/">Tomasz Mloduchowski</a> for his previous blogs which spurred my interest! I don’t fully understand why Tomasz had kernel panics using a VL805 board, but maybe it’s something to do with the Device Tree, and the fact I also had a PCIe switch.</p>

<p><span>The real endgame is to harness the <strong>power of the Crowd</strong> to have each other’s back.</span></p>
<p>While your agent is blocking aggressive IP, it can also share them with the global network. The community then gets fed with your spottings and you also benefit from the community ones in return. The goal is to create the most accurate and complete IP reputation database. Together we create a real-time IP reputation system that benefits all of our community members. So far, it gathers and maintains a fresh (less than 72 hours) list of 100 000 malevolent IPs addresses.</p>
<p><span>The consensus database (which stores aggressive IPs) includes a native anti-false-positive and anti-poisoning system. API oriented from day 1, our goal is to make it usable anywhere (infra, code, app, framework, libs, etc.). L</span><span>ast but not least, it has also been designed to be GD</span><span>PR compliant and privacy respectful.</span></p>
<h2>Born in the Cloud, thought for the Cloud</h2>
<p><span>To adapt to modern architectures, CrowdSec uses a decoupled approach “<strong>detect here, remedy there</strong>”. For example, if it detects an attack directed toward your database, it could remediate it on your firewall. To date, Netfilter (with an Ipset), Cloudflare, Nginx &amp; WordPress are supported. We work on new ones like Captcha, MFA, throttling,&nbsp; limiting access to some folders or features, etc. </span></p>
<p><span>If you decide to write Datasource connectors, log parsers, scenarios, you can share them on the </span><span><a href="http://hub.crowdsec.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>community hub</span></a></span><span>. The scenario grammar (YAML) is very versatile and allows for a lot of creativity. ie: If someone is hammering a webpage that takes a lot of CPU to generate, you can throttle. If an IP is port scanning, web scanning, and brute-forcing, you could consider it’s a targeted attack and not an opportunistic one and apply different remediation.</span></p>
<h2>Fully Open-Source&amp; Free</h2>
<p><span>CrowdSec, the behavior &amp; reputation-based security engine, is based on an <strong>MIT license</strong> and is open to contributions.<br>
Don’t hesitate to reach out to us through our </span><span><a href="https://crowdsec.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Website</span></a></span><span>, </span><span><a href="https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GitHub</span></a></span><span>, or interact directly with the team on our </span><span><a href="https://gitter.im/crowdsec-project/community#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Gitter</span></a></span>, we’ll be glad to help.</p>

<p><span>Blog post 11 September 2020, by Tom Tervoort, Senior Security Specialist and Ralph Moonen, Technical Director at Secura</span></p>
<p><span><span><em></em></span></span><span><strong><span>Last month, Microsoft patched a very interesting vulnerability that would allow an attacker with a foothold on your internal network to essentially become Domain Admin with one click. All that is required is for a connection to the Domain Controller to be possible from the attacker’s viewpoint. </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Secura's security expert Tom Tervoort previously discovered <strong><span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.secura.com/blog-cve-2019-1424" rel="noopener noreferrer">a less severe Netlogon vulnerability last year that allowed workstations to be taken over</a></span></strong>, but the attacker required a Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) position for that to work. Now, he discovered this second, much more severe (CVSS score: 10.0) vulnerability in the protocol. By forging an authentication token for specific Netlogon functionality, he was able to call a function to set the computer password of the Domain Controller to a known value. After that, the attacker can use this new password to take control over the domain controller and steal credentials of a domain admin. </span></p>
<p><span>The vulnerability stems from a flaw in a cryptographic authentication scheme used by the Netlogon Remote Protocol, which among other things can be used to update computer passwords. This flaw allows attackers to impersonate any computer, including the domain controller itself, and execute remote procedure calls on their behalf. </span></p>
<p><span>Secura urges everybody to install the patch on all their domain controllers as fast as possible. Please refer to Microsoft’s advisory. <strong>We published a test tool on Github</strong>, which you can download here:&nbsp;<strong><span><a href="https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472">https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472</a></span></strong> that can tell you whether a domain controller is vulnerable or not.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1058"><div><p>I spend a lot of time working remotely, and while I have a decently sized laptop, I often miss having a second monitor. I looked at USB monitors, but then I remembered my old 2014 Galaxy Tab. Could I use it as a second monitor? The answer is: yes!</p><p>This setup works via virtual output devices and VNC. It essentially creates a remote desktop session on your laptop, which you can view and even interact with from your tablet. It’ll technically work with any network-ready computing device for that matter, whether it’s a tablet, a phone, a Raspberry Pi, or even another laptop.</p><p>These instructions are for Linux. Any Linux distribution should work, but you <em>must</em> be using X.org, not Wayland. You’ll also need to install the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb">Android Debug Bridge</a> (adb) and <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a>.</p><p>You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/8bitbuddhist/7ab180286d6eb7fdc68d374063814175">download the full script from GitHub</a>. This post explains how the script works and provides setup instructions.</p><h2>Step 1: Create a Virtual Output Device</h2><p>First, we need to create a virtual output device by configuring Xorg. Create a file named <code>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-virtual.conf</code> and add the following contents:<br> <code>Section "Device"<br> </code><code>&nbsp;Identifier "intelgpu0"<br> Driver "intel"<br> Option "VirtualHeads" "1"<br> EndSection</code></p><p>The Identifier and Driver options will be different if your GPU is AMD or Nvidia. You can add more virtual outputs by changing the <code>VirtualHeads</code> option, but for now let’s keep it at one. Save the file, then log out and log back in to apply the changes. To confirm, run the <code>xrandr</code> command. You should see a line starting with <code>VIRTUAL1 disconnected</code>.</p><h2>Step 2: Configuring and Enabling the Virtual Display</h2><p>Now, we need to configure the virtual display by setting its resolution and placement relative to the primary display (i.e. the laptop screen).</p><p>Open the <a href="https://gist.github.com/8bitbuddhist/7ab180286d6eb7fdc68d374063814175"><code>create-android-display.sh</code></a> file in a text editor and change the following lines to match your specific setup:</p><ul><li><code>W=1920</code> and <code>H=1080</code> set the width and height of the virtual display. Set this to your tablet screen’s resolution.</li><li><code>VIRTUAL1</code> should match the name of the virtual display as reported by xrandr.</li><li><code>eDP1</code> should match the name of your primary display. You can use xrandr to confirm this as well.</li></ul><p>The line starting with <code>PW</code> uses xrandr to get the width of the primary display. We’ll use this later on when creating the VNC session.</p><p>The lines starting with <code>gtf</code> configure the display and set its position relative to the primary display. In the third line, you can change where the display is located by changing <code>--right-of</code> to <code>--left-of</code>, <code>--above</code>, or <code>--below</code>.&nbsp;These instructions assume you’re using <code>--right-of</code>, so if you decide to change the placement, note that you’ll need to change the crop options when running x11vnc.</p><h2>Step 3: Create a VNC Session</h2><p>For VNC, we’ll use <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a> because it can expose an existing Xorg session without requiring root permissions. We’ll use the <code>-clip</code> option to restrict the visible area to the virtual monitor.&nbsp;We’ll also use <code>-localhost</code> to prevent x11vnc from exposing the session over the network for better security.</p><p><code>x11vnc -localhost -clip ${W}x${H}+${PW}+0</code></p><p>Some 3D applications and compositing window managers don’t work well over VNC, so if your screen isn’t updating, try adding <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/faq.html#faq-beryl"><code>-noxdamage</code></a>&nbsp;to the command.</p><h2>Step 4: Create an ADB Session</h2><p>VNC software uses port 5900 by default. However, since we ran x11vnc with <code>-localhost</code>, only software running on the laptop itself can access the VNC session. Fortunately, we can use adb to forward port 5900 on our laptop to port 5900 on our tablet. With port forwarding enabled, our tablet can access x11vnc as if it was coming from localhost.</p><p>We’ll forward the port with the command:</p><p><code>adb reverse tcp:5900 tcp:5900</code></p><h2>Step 5: Connect From Your Tablet</h2><p>The final step is to use a VNC viewer app on your tablet to open the x11vnc session. I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.freebVNC&amp;hl=en_US">bVNC</a>, but any viewer app will work.</p><p>From the app, enter <code>localhost</code> as the target and click connect. In a moment, you should see your virtual monitor appear on screen. Move your cursor around, drag windows, and watch them appear on your tablet! Once you disconnect, the script automatically turns off the virtual display on your laptop so you don’t have “invisible windows” floating off-screen.</p><figure id="attachment_1062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1062"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=656%2C875&amp;ssl=1" alt="Using an Android tablet as a second monitor" width="656" height="875" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=656%2C875&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1062">Kate and Konsole on an Android tablet via VNC.</figcaption></figure><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>VNC isn’t a perfect protocol, and it can be slow even over USB. It’s alright for web browsing and Slack/Discord, but I wouldn’t use it to watch movies. You <em>can</em> use VNC over the network, but this comes with some severe security implications. Make sure you enable encryption and password protection before exposing your desktop to <em>any</em> network.</p><p>One problem I couldn’t completely resolve was black bars appearing on my tablet when the tablet resolution was different from the laptop resolution. The bars completely covered the desktop and any windows I had on the screen. My only solution was to use the same resolution for both the laptop and the tablet, but this was workable for me.</p><p>Have any issues, thoughts, or suggestions?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I host this website on github pages which means I don't have access to a server or database. In other words, my website is hosted on computers I don't own and is accessible by anyone.</p><p>And I want a login service.</p><p>Specifically I want a place where I can type in a password and gain access to private information. However, because my site is public, I have to be able to do this from any computer.</p><p>While I have been thinking about this problem for quite a while, it wasn't until I finished taking a cryptography class at college that I learned the tools to do this job. Specifically, AES.</p><p>AES is a secure encryption algorithm where you take your data and encrypt it with a key. When you want your data back, you use the key again to decrypt. As far as I know AES has a long enough key that it hasn't been cracked and it probably won't be cracked any time soon.</p><p>From a high level, I used AES to encrypt and decrypt the contents of my secret web pages with a password.</p><p>Before encryption, my secret website looks like:</p><p>When my website is encrypted, the file structure looks as follows:</p><div><pre><span></span>007a69b693fbc1f43f7ce8f4c9779621.html

</pre></div><p>The html files with hex names correspond to <code>main.html</code> and <code>other.html</code>, and the additional files are libraries to help decrypt the pages.</p><p>I make sure to obfuscate the real file names to make it harder for people to get any information from even the file structure.</p><p><code>aes.js</code> and <code>sha256.js</code> are encryption libraries I found online and <code>landing.html</code> is the webpage through which you access the private site.</p><p>My claim is that it is very hard to decode the webpages without the password.</p><p>For example, this is what <code>007a69b693fbc1f43f7ce8f4c9779621.html</code> looks like:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

</pre></div><p>Go to <a href="https://smlandis.com/secret/landing">the landing page</a> to try it out. The password is <code>pass</code>.</p><p>The main restriction of this setup is it only works for one user. I'm sure there are algorithms that support multiple passwords but at that point it would make sense to switch to a dedicated password service.</p><p>Another small shortcoming is the title of secret pages always says "Encrypted Page". I could fix this by encrypting the page title along with page contents and it would probably be more secure to encrypt them together. Maybe json would be a good encoding format. On the other hand, it is kinda cool that the page appears as "Encrypted Page" in my browser history.</p><p>Speaking of browser history, because the key is passed through the url, anyone can access my secret site by looking at my history. It also means I can bookmark a page and never need to type in the password again.</p><p><img src="https://smlandis.com/posts/encrypted_page.jpg" alt="History"></p><p>Now that I have an AES-secured secret site, I'm not sure what to do with it. Maybe I'll host some e-books I'm reading, or posts I'm working on, or a journal, or a todo list.</p><p>But whatever it is, I hope it's secure.</p></div></div>]]>

                <center><em><p>Investigating number-theoretic patterns in large grids of trees</p>
</em></center>
                <h4>Tuesday, September 10, 2019 · 3 min read</h4>
<p>The last time I spent a long time on I-5, I started thinking about
<a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/envelope.html">envelopes</a>. This time, I started thinking about orchards. As
you drive along the central valley highway, you can see thousands and thousands
of perfect rows of trees. You can actually see them from the top on Google’s
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.6590095,-120.643549,2656a,35y,236.91h/data=!3m1!1e3">satellite
imagery</a>;
try zooming in slowly on that point, it’s really quite beautiful.</p>
<p>When you drive by them, you see the side view rather than the top view. In
fact, you see the side view <em>in motion</em> – the trees look like they’re dancing
an elaborate dance, continuously lining up into different formations to form
different rows in different angles. Really, of course, it is you who is moving;
the trees are still but by viewing them from different angles you can see
different “alignments” of the grid.</p>
<p>The effect is most pronounced with freshly-planted trees (or perhaps those are
markers?), where there is no foliage blocking the horizon.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/orchard.png" alt="orchard"></p>
<p>I didn’t think to make a video at the time, but you can imagine that as the car
moves forwards a little bit, the pattern re-aligns in an incredibly satisfying
way.</p>
<p>I’m intrigued by the multiple “vanishing points” you can see in that picture.
The trees are regularly spaced in a square grid, but somehow there are multiple
(!) irregularly-spaced (!!) points along the horizon to which rows of trees
appear to converge. What’s going on here — is there a pattern to the
patterns? You could either stop reading here to have food for thought on your
next road trip, or you could keep reading for my ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p>The I-5 trees are a variation on a well-known theme: a theme called <em>Euclid’s
orchard</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_orchard">Wikipedia</a>,
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsOrchard.html">MathWorld</a>). You stand at
the origin of the plane, and at every integer point there is a line segment
(“tree”) extending one unit upwards perpendicular to the plane. What you see
from your vantage point is Euclid’s orchard. Try to imagine what it looks like;
then, play with a JavaScript simulation of it
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/euclids-orchard/5282060266635264">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main idea of Euclid’s orchard is that trees at integer points (x, y)
occlude trees at any integer multiples of that point (nx, ny), so you don’t see
anything behind them. Also, nearby trees appear taller than farther-away trees
because that’s how perspective works. So there is a “horizon” where in each
direction you either see (1) a tree if the direction’s slope is rational, and
the tree is shorter if its denominator is larger; (2) nothing if the
direction’s slope is irrational. All sorts of fun can be had with this: see for
example a <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2017/07/22/a-few-words-about-pww-20/">nice connection to the Fibonacci
numbers</a>.</p>
<p>The I-5 orchard in the picture is similar, but now we look upon it from some
height. Imagine mapping each point on the horizon to the direction in which I
would have to point my camera to look directly at that point. The “vanishing
points” have lots of trees along those directions, giving the illusion of
“rows.” What does this mean? It means that if you walked along that ray in
Euclid’s orchard, you would run into trees more frequently than other rays. In
other words, those rays represent directions whose slopes are rational with
small denominators.</p>
<p>Hmm… rational with small denominators… where have I blogged about that
before…? Right — around four years ago, when we
<a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/a-balance-of-powers.html">showed</a> that 2^12864326 begins with the digits
“10000000…” (and other number-theoretic shenanigans).  I wasn’t kidding,
rational approximation really is one of my favorite topics!</p>
<p>At the time I showed you this picture with little explanation.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/ford-circle.png" alt="Ford circle"></p>
<p>Here is a little more explanation of its significance: as you start filling in
circles to some level, you generate a sequence of fractions called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence">“Farey
sequence”</a> by listing the points
of tangency of the circle and the X axis. The Farey sequence is the list of
completely reduced fractions whose denominators are smaller than some bound.
Putting those two facts together: the points of tangency of the circles
represent points that are “rational with small denominators” — exactly what
we thought our I-9 orchard’s “vanishing points” were!</p>
<p>Looking back at the image, this is somewhat believable. We see a couple of
“strong” vanishing points, and then “weaker” vanishing points in between the
strong ones, and then <em>even</em> “weaker” vanishing points between the strong and
the weak vanishing points, and so on.</p>
<p>There are a number of cool implications of this. For example, the “least
patterned” regions of the horizon would correspond to regions that are “hard to
rationally approximate”; so, you’d expect them at plus-or-minus the golden
ratio’s slope from your line of sight.</p>

  <p><label>Posted on <strong>09 September 2020</strong></label></p><p>Colab source code can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/Mr4k/1f1b7ecaf30de073a50cbedd0da4dc82">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
Let's say we want to reduce the number of colors in an image. For example consider the image of fruit below:
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit.jpg" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
If we run a count of how many colors are in the above image we get a whopping 157376 (for a 900 x 450 pixel image). Are all those colors really necessary?
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
The image above has 16 colors and the one below only has 8.
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-8-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
The problem of color palette reduction has been studied extensively and the typical approach works roughly as follows:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build a reduced color palette of size N by dividing the color space up into N distinct regions where each region is represented by one color. This is usually accomplished by one of several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_quantization">popular approaches</a>.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither">Dither</a> the image. The process of dithering eliminates color banding and creates the illusion of more colors through a stippling like effect. If you are not familar with dithering we will explore it in more detail later. Given a fixed color palette there are specialized algorithms for dithering such as <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/559-s2004/docs/floyd-steinberg.pdf">Floyd Stienberg</a>.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of the usual approach, we are going to solve both of these problems at the same time using gradient descent.  </p>
<p>First of all let's define a palette of N colors. For this article the colors will be 3 component vectors in rgb space. A quick warning to graphics nerds, for portability and simplicity we do not take <a href="http://xahlee.info/img/what_is_gamma_correction.html">gamma correction</a> into account.</p>
<p>Now how do we assign a discrete set of colors to pixels in a differentiable way? I decided to do this using probability distributions. Each pixel is represented by a vector containing the probabilities of each palette color being chosen for that pixel. When actually generating an image we just sample each pixel's color from it's distribution.  </p>
<p>The above formulation is pretty general. Importantly both the colors in the palette and the mapping of image pixels to palette colors are variables which we can optimize over simultaneously. Now all we need to do is attach any one of a number of loss functions.   </p>
<p>The loss function I chose to use at first was just the squared difference between the original image and the expected value of the output image:  </p>
<p><span>\(loss(output, target)=\sum_{i\in pixels}(target_i\)</span> <span>\(-\)</span> <span>\(E[output_i])^2\)</span> (equation 1)  </p>
<p>So what's the idea here? Basically the expected output allows our image to pretend it has more colors than it really does.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/dither-grey.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>For example let's pretend our palette has only two colors, black and white. Also suppose our target image is a 50% gray square. Consider the following three possible representations of the image. One is an all black image, one is all white and the third has 50% black and 50% white pixels randomly distributed across the image. If we look from far away the third image will look better. This is because the black and white pixels will blur together and appear gray. This effect is called dithering.   </p>
<p>By the above reasoning we want to make sure that the dithered pixel assignment (each pixel has a 50% chance of being black or white) should appear more desirable than the other two candidates to our loss function. Taking the squared error between the target image and the expected color of each pixel does exactly this.   </p>
<p>You might be asking, why not take the expected value of the whole squared error? This would look like:</p>
<p><span>\(loss(output, target) = E[\sum_{i\in pixels}(target_i\)</span> <span>\(-\)</span> <span>\(output_i)^2]\)</span>    </p>
<p>This actually does not work. To see why, let's look at the same setup as above and consider the expectation of an individual pixel (for math sticklers we can do this because expectation is linear). The loss function for a pixel denoted by the random variable <span>\(X\)</span> that always chooses black is: </p>
<p><span>\(E[(0.5 - X)^2] = (0.5 - 0)^2 = 0.25\)</span>   </p>
<p>And the loss function for a pixel denoted by the random <span>\(X\)</span> which is 50% black and 50% white is:</p>
<p><span>\(E[(0.5-X)^2] = (0.5-0)^2 * 0.5\)</span> <span>\(+\)</span> <span>\((0.5-1)^2 * 0.5 = 0.25\)</span>  </p>
<p>Unfortunately the values here are the same in both cases which rules out this loss function.  </p>
<p>Let's try using the loss from equation 1 with a palette of two colors:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-2-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>Hey! Not too bad! As we can see, different shades are captured by different densities of darker pixels. For a starker example let's try this image of a vertical black and white gradient:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/bw-grad.png" width="25%"> 
        <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/bw-grad-2.png" width="25%">
    </p> 


<p>Now let's try 16 colors:
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-noisy.png" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
The above image highlights one weakness of our current loss function. It's very noisy, even when it doesn't have to be.   </p>
<p>To give an extreme example, consider an image with three colors red, blue and purple (a mix of 50% red and 50% blue). Let's say we have room for 3 colors in our palette. In the eyes of equation 1 both of the following solutions would have the same loss:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The red pixels are red, the blue pixels are blue and the purple pixels are purple. We are using all three colors in our palette to the best of our ability and the image is reproduced perfectly.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each red pixel is red, each blue pixel is blue, each purple pixel has a <span>\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> chance of being red and a <span>\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> chance of being blue. Notice here we only use two out of three possible colors and the final image is clearly lower quality.   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To control for this weakness, I added an additional term to the loss function which penalizes the sum of the pixel variances. Right now I just hand tune the coefficient of the variance penalty. A good rule of thumb seems to be larger palettes should weigh variance more heavily. Applying this penalty (variance coefficient = 0.25) gives us the 16 color image from the top of this post:
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p>   
<p>The tradeoff is that too little variance removes noise which, due to the absence of dithering, makes the final image appear to contain fewer colors and also creates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding">banding effects</a>. The image below has 16 colors and variance coefficient = 1.0. It demonstrates both of these problems:<br>
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-saturated.png" width="50%"> 
</p>   
<p>Note there are many valid choices of loss function here and I'm not claiming mine is perfect at all. For example <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2017/12/23/c-differentiable-programming-searching-for-an-optimal-dither-pattern/">this article</a> on creating optimal dither patterns blurs both images and takes the difference between those. We could try to use this idea or search for something else to replace our simple squared error. It would also be interesting to try to use a real image quality metric like <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/ssim/">SSIM</a> to measure image quality instead of using variance as a proxy.   </p>
<p>Another place for improvement is that our approach is sloooow (up to several minutes). It also does not scale well memory wise to large palettes (when I try using more than 200 colors for the 900x450 pixel fruit image my colab notebook runs out of ram). This is because in that case there are more than 200x950x450 variables to optimize over. We could potentially tackle these problems in two ways. To address speed we could try to break the image up into mini batches. To address memory usage we could try to use a neural network to output probabilities at each pixel location instead of storing them all explicitly.   </p>
<p><strong>Why do I think this approach is interesting?</strong><br>
Although this approach is not state of the art by any means in either speed or quality I think it's interesting that we can optimize both the palette selection and dithering at the same time.  </p>
<p>As far as I know dithering and palette selection aren't really part of state of the art lossy compression today. However it would be neat if these same concepts could be applied to something like the color space transform, discrete cosine transform and weight quantization steps of <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~web6140/TopTenAlgorithms/JPEG.html">jpeg compression</a>.  </p>
<p>A pipedream would be an entirely differentiable image compression pipeline where all the steps can be fine tuned together to optimize a particular image with respect to any differentiable loss function.</p>

    <p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/memory/memory-storage-types-cover.png" alt="Memory Storage Types Cover"></p>
<p>Human memory is captivating. Take a moment to dive into your oldest recollections and evoke any memory related to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first memory you can recall;</li>
<li>your first friend;</li>
<li>your first pet;</li>
<li>your childhood toys;</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-the-brain-basics/">How People Learn — The Brain Basics</a>, memories are well established neural patterns that get activated simultaneously. These circuits encode our memories, abilities, behaviors, knowledge, literally everything.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, there are different types of memory storage, and in this article, I’d like to describe what those are.</p>
<h2 id="from-high-resolution-short-lived-to-low-resolution-eternal-timespan-memory">From High-Resolution, Short-Lived To Low-Resolution, Eternal Timespan Memory</h2>
<p>Nature did a fascinating job in designing life (and us). We don’t even think about how we form memories, and, incidentally, we don’t yet fully understand this process. What we do know is that there are several stages the information from the outer world has to pass through until it becomes part of our long-lasting memories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensory Memory</li>
<li>Short-Term Memory</li>
<li>Working Memory</li>
<li>Long-Term Memory</li>
</ul>
<p>A note of caution before we proceed: human memory is an active area of research that still has many unknowns, and there are many models and theories about some aspects of it. As we do not yet fully understand the internal workings of the brain, scientists have to rely on some simplifications and approximation models to explain how we receive, process, and perceive information. If you have heard about a different model or disagree with the models presented here, I kindly invite you to discuss it in the comments!</p>
<h2 id="sensory-memory">Sensory Memory</h2>
<p>Sensory memory is the first place where sensory information gets deposited for further use. Data from <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-human-senses/">human senses</a> is stored here in a relatively unprocessed form for a brief period.</p>
<p>Sensory memory consists of distinct storage types for three of human senses:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Iconic Memory</em> is for the exclusive storage of visual information;</li>
<li><em>Echoic Memory</em> is for the exclusive storage of auditory information;</li>
<li><em>Haptic Memory</em> is for the exclusive storage of tactile stimuli;</li>
</ul>
<p>It is considered that Sensory memory is outside of cognitive control. It is the first step in the perception of the environment around us. As mentioned in how <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/micro/the-world-we-see-is-a-pixelated-version-of-the-real-world/">we see a pixelated version of the world</a>, information quality degrades as it moves from our senses to the central executive system. Sensory memory is the first frontier toward ingesting and making sense of data, and at this point, the information is of very high quality.</p>
<p>However, storing such detailed information comes at a price. It is incredibly volatile, as it fades away quickly. The availability differs between senses, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconic memory’s availability is &lt;1 second.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> That’s why you don’t remember what time it is, even though you just looked at your watch!</li>
<li>Echoic memory’s availability is somewhere between 2–4 seconds.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> That’s why, whenever you don’t pay attention when someone’s talking, and they ask you to repeat what they just said, you still can access those several seconds worth of information from your Echoic memory store.</li>
<li>Haptic memory’s availability is &lt;2 seconds.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="short-term-memory-stm">Short-Term Memory (STM)</h2>
<p>STM is a very ambiguous term that supposedly originated at the beginning of the twentieth century. It is often used interchangeably with Working Memory, which I will also use here. Other usages relate to simply holding the information (in contrast to storing <em>and</em> processing it, as Working Memory does) over a short period. But as you will see below, one Working Memory model encompasses some components that fit the description of an STM store. Therefore, whenever you see in the literature STM, it most probably is the Working Memory, which is a more recent term that better fits the description of cognitive processes related to information processing and storage.</p>
<h2 id="working-memory-wm">Working Memory (WM)</h2>
<p>Once the information from the outer world reaches our senses and is stored in the sensory memory, some of it requires conscious processing and manipulation, and the Working Memory is the place where that happens. The nature of working memory is still under active debate, as many models have been proposed to explain its essence. However, only two of them are the most influential:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The multicomponent model</em> by Baddeley and Hitch;</li>
<li><em>Working memory as part of long-term memory</em> by Ericsson and Kintsch;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-multicomponent-model">The Multicomponent Model</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/memory/Baddeley_and_Hitch%27s_Working_Memory_Model.png" alt="Baddeley and Hitch multicomponent model"> <figcaption>
            <p>Source:
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Baddeley_and_Hitch%27s_Working_Memory_Model.png">Wikipedia</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>According to Baddeley, the WM consists of several components. The <em>Central Executive</em> component coordinates attention and cognitive processes, suppresses irrelevant information and actions, and switches between various tasks. It also is responsible for coordinating the subordinate systems (Phonological Loop and Visuo-Spatial Scratchpad).</p>
<p>The <em>Phonological Loop (PL)</em> stores phonological information (sound and language). Interestingly, visually presented language (like the text you are reading here) can be transformed into phonological information by subvocalization. PL consists of an <em>Acoustic Store</em> (which partially represents the Sensory Memory for auditory information) and an <em>Articulatory Loop</em> that continuously refreshes data in the Acoustic Store in a rehearsal loop.</p>
<p>The <em>Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad (VSS)</em> is a similar structure to PL but for visual and spatial information. It connects with the visual sensory memory store but, at the same time, can be used to construct and manipulate images and represent mental maps. If I ask you to imagine an oak tree on a green field on a sunny day, you will engage the VSS to perform that action.</p>
<p>The original model was proposed in 1974 and consisted only of these three components, but in 2000, Baddeley extended the model by adding a fourth one, the <em>Episodic Buffer (EP).</em> Its addition was to address some concerns regarding the flexibility of the model. The EP is supposed to hold representations that integrate phonological, visual, and spatial information and information not covered by the subordinate systems (e.g., semantic, musical, categorical information). It is <em>episodic</em> because it is assumed to bind information into a unitary episodic representation.</p>
<p>This model does a good job portraying the inner processes of the Working Memory. However, it is not exhaustive. For example, it does not provide a representation for tactile sensory information.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="working-memory-as-part-of-long-term-memory">Working memory as part of long-term memory</h3>

<p>Contrary to the multicomponent modal, Anders Ericsson and Walter Kintsch have introduced the notion of “long-term working memory,” which they define as a set of “retrieval structures” in long-term memory that enables seamless access to the information relevant for everyday tasks.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>According to this model, the Working Memory is not a separate system but rather a mechanism to activate and operate on parts of the long-term memory. The activated <em>long-term memory representations</em> can then be brought to our awareness through the <em>focus of attention.</em></p>
<p>In terms of capacity, since activated working memory representations rely on the existing long-term memory representations, there can be many of these. But the bottleneck is the focus of attention, which is very narrow and can hold up to four such activated representations at once. I will discuss this in more detail in a follow-up post.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-memory-ltm">Long-Term Memory (LTM)</h2>
<p>Finally, LTM is the memory storage that holds all our memories, old and new, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_memory">implicit</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_memory">explicit</a>. The most common analogy is that the LTM is like a hard-disk: you write information to it, and it is stored there. It is the warehouse of all the things we have read, heard, saw, and experienced.</p>
<h2 id="the-whole-brain">The Whole Brain</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are still many unknowns, both at the level of each store type as well as at their joints. But the information we know already gives us a possibility to improve our productivity and the way we learn. In the next articles, I will dive deeper into some of these stores and show you what causes poor performance and what to do about it.</p>

Financial&nbsp;details of the transaction weren't disclosed.</p>  <p>Last year, the retailer <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mec-11m-outdoor-gear-mountain-equipment-co-op-1.5375846" target="_blank">detailed financial problems</a> caused by slow sales, inventory backups, supply chain problems and ever-increasing online competition.

Families. It's a very emotional thing," Claus said. "It's obviously going to be a difficult time."</p>  <p>He says the decision about which stores remain open should come soon, saying it's "not going to be a long and drawn out process."</p>  <p>"Given who we are and what we know of the business and how it operates and the culture, and bringing our Canadian element to it will help ensure that the brand will last a long time," Claus said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5376019.1574892904!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/mec-clearance-racks.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5376019.1574892904!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/mec-clearance-racks.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5376019.1574892904!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/mec-clearance-racks.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5376019.1574892904!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/mec-clearance-racks.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5376019.1574892904!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/mec-clearance-racks.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5376019.1574892904!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/mec-clearance-racks.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Mountain Equipment Co-op (MEC) has struggled financially in recent years due to slow sales, inventory backups, supply chain problems and online competition.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Ben Nelms/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>Will I get my $5 share back?</h2>  <p>The Vancouver-based outdoor gear and clothing retailer was formed in 1971. It is Canada's largest&nbsp;consumer co-operative with over five million members.</p>  <p>News of its acquisition Monday prompted many members of the co-operative to wonder whether they would get their co-operative shares — about $5 — back.&nbsp;</p>  <p>During the transition from a co-operative to a private company, members would have to claim themselves as creditors&nbsp;to stake a claim on their $5 shares.</p>  <p>But Claus says its "highly unlikely"&nbsp;that members would get their share value&nbsp;back.</p>  <p>"Like in any business, if it's a co-operative or another, equity ranks at the bottom of the list," he said.&nbsp;"I'm sure there'll be some people that won't be happy they lost their $5, but I think the co-op's given them over the years a lot more value than $5."</p>  <p><span><blockquote lang="en" data-conversation="none"><p>Signature a little faded, but according to this I am still the holder of one share of MEC. &lt;a href="https://t.co/jIG6ZedGGr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jIG6ZedGGr&lt;/a&gt;</p>&amp;mdash;<a href="https://twitter.com/attaboy/status/1305683130393800704">@attaboy</a></blockquote></span></p>  <p>He says the company is still hoping to&nbsp;find a way for membership to have value,&nbsp;and has committed to remaining&nbsp;involved in the community.</p>  <p>"Hopefully as the new stewards of the brand.. members going forward [will] stay with MEC and continue to get value out of it."</p>    <p>MEC has successfully obtained court protection under the CCAA proceedings. This will allow MEC to continue operating its retail business while the acquisition is completed.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The sale&nbsp;is still&nbsp;subject to court and regulatory approvals&nbsp;but is expected to close by the end of the year.</p>  <p>At the end of the transaction, MEC&nbsp;will be a privately owned company. MEC says the co-op will continue to exist for a period of time after the sale completes but will no longer be operating a retail business.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

This is an early version of the product, but we're releasing it now to bring you — our global community of users, creators and artists — on our journey with us as we build and improve Shorts. We’ll continue to add more features and expand to more countries in the coming months as we learn from you and listen to your feedback. Here are more details on what to expect.</p></div>

We'll continue to expand to iOS devices and in more countries soon. You can also expect more creation features in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><br><ul><li><p><b>Get discovered: </b>Every month, 2 billion viewers come to YouTube to laugh, learn and connect. Creators have built entire businesses on YouTube, and we want to enable the next generation of mobile creators to also grow a community on YouTube with Shorts.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>We encourage any mobile creator or artist to start uploading their existing short videos on YouTube today to start getting discovered.</p><br><ul><li><p><b>Watch:</b> You may have recently seen a row on the YouTube homepage especially for short videos, and starting today we’re also introducing a new watch experience that lets you easily swipe vertically from one video to the next, plus discover other similar short videos.

This is both it's greatest strength <em>and</em> weakness.</p><p>Over the years, I've tried many different ways to style my React apps. Each solution has its pros and cons.
This article will share my journey using CSS with React and how it's evolved to its current state. Then, I'll discuss pros/cons of
different approaches for styling.</p><h2 id="vanilla-css"><p>Vanilla CSS<a aria-label="anchor" href="#vanilla-css">#</a></p></h2><p>Like most, I started web development with vanilla CSS. All you need is a single HTML and CSS file. Pretty simple.</p><pre mb="8"><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>header<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Welcome<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre><pre mb="8"><code><span><span>.header</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>32</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>As I built more large applications, I began to understand some of the drawbacks.</p><ul><li><strong>Reusability.</strong>&nbsp;It's easy to create append-only stylesheets that become very complex.</li><li><strong>Global Namespace.</strong>&nbsp;Since CSS has a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://css-tricks.com/regarding-css-global-scope/">global namespace</a>, you can unintentionally target too many elements.</li><li><strong>Colocation.</strong> It's hard to modularize your CSS, which makes it difficult to delete code safely.</li></ul><p>At this point, I was introduced to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_preprocessor">CSS pre-processors</a>.
These tools aim to introduce new funtionality and compile back to vanilla CSS.</p><h2 id="sass"><p>Sass<a aria-label="anchor" href="#sass">#</a></p></h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, one of the most popular preprocessors, allows you to write more reusable, maintainable CSS.
Some of the most popular features are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables">variables</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin">mixins</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules">modules</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Variables.</strong>&nbsp;I want to define global values once and share them throughout my stylesheets.</li><li><strong>Mixins.</strong>&nbsp;I want to reuse particular snippets of CSS.</li><li><strong>Modules.</strong>&nbsp;I want to split up my CSS files for a more maintainable codebase.</li></ul><pre mb="8"><code><span><span>$font-stack</span></span><span>:</span> Helvetica<span>,</span> sans-serif<span>;</span>
<span><span>$primary-color</span></span><span>:</span> <span>#333</span><span>;</span>

<span>body </span><span>{</span>
  <span>font</span><span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>%</span> <span>$font-stack</span><span>;</span>
  <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>$primary-color</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><pre mb="8"><code><span><span>@use</span> <span>'base'</span><span>;</span>

<span>.</span>header</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>32</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

Over time, I ran into new issues.</p><ul><li><strong>Naming.</strong>&nbsp;As your CSS grows, it's easy to have class names get out of hand.</li><li><strong>Browser support.</strong>&nbsp;Certain features aren't <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://caniuse.com/">supported across all browsers</a> and require <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix">vendor prefixes</a> like <code>-moz-</code> (Firefox), <code>-webkit-</code> (Safari), and <code>-ms-</code> (Internet Explorer and Edge).</li></ul><p>To solve naming, I started to adopt&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://getbem.com/introduction/">BEM</a>.
Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components
and organize CSS in a modular way, which keeps specificity low.</p><pre mb="8"><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>button<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Cancel<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

For browser support, it's possible to set up your Sass toolchain with a tool like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/">autoprefixer</a>&nbsp;to handle vendor prefixes.
However, around this time, I started using component-based frameworks like React. This led me to explore CSS-in-JS.</p><h2 id="css-in-js"><p>CSS-In-JS<a aria-label="anchor" href="#css-in-js">#</a></p></h2><p>My first adventure with CSS-in-JS: building a <a href="https://leerob.io/blog/ui-component-library-with-styled-components">component library with styled-components</a>. At first, CSS-in-JS solved all my problems.</p><ul><li><strong>Specificity</strong> is solved by auto-generated class names.</li><li><strong>Colocation</strong> is solved by putting CSS directly with the component, making it easy to delete code.</li><li><strong>Browser support</strong>&nbsp;is solved by having autoprefixer built-in.</li><li><strong>Variables</strong>&nbsp;are solved by creating a global theme.</li></ul><p>However, <strong>naming</strong> was still a huge pain.</p><p>As the component library grew, I began to explore <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://theme-ui.com/">Theme UI</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://styled-system.com/">styled-system</a>.
These were more structured approaches to scaling CSS-in-JS to help enforce a design system.
Plus, they helped solve&nbsp;naming. Trying to scale <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://styled-components.com/">styled-components</a> alone in a large application made me get <em>really</em> creative with names.
You can only have so many container, wrapper, layout things. For example:</p><pre mb="8"><code><span>const</span> <span>HomeContainerWrapper</span> <span>=</span> styled<span>.</span><span>div</span><span><span>`</span><span>
&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;padding</span><span>:</span> <span>8</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>
&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;font-weight</span><span>:</span> bold<span>;</span>
&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;color</span><span>:</span> white<span>;</span>
&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;background</span><span>:</span> blue<span>;</span>
</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>HomeContainerWrapper</span><span>&gt;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello
<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>HomeContainerWrapper</span><span>&gt;</span>


<span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>3</span><span>}</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fontWeight<span>=</span><span>'bold'</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;color<span>=</span><span>'white'</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bg<span>=</span><span>'blue'</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
