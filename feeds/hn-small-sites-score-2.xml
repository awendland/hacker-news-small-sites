</p>
<br>


<p><em>J-U-S-T</em>. Those four characters can be significantly detrimental to a software development process. In this blog post, I’ll describe how the <em>“just keyword”</em> can affect team’s communication and how to avoid misusing it on Slack.</p>
<h2 id="lets-just-do-it">Let’s “just” do it</h2>
<p>You’ve probably been there. Your product manager shares his brand new plan on the Slack channel:</p>
<p><em>“Why don’t we</em> <strong>just</strong> <em>add this cool new feature to our application?”</em></p>
<p>or your colleague got the wrong idea about scaling after reading a HackerNews story:</p>
<p><em>“Let’s</em> <strong>just</strong> <em>migrate our infrastructure to Kubernetes…“</em></p>
<p><em>“Just”</em> is toxic and dangerous. It implicitly suggests that the proposed task is straightforward. It undermines the discussion about the issues that might pop-up during the implementation.</p>
<p>There’s no <em>“just”</em> in software development. Most of the tasks turn out to be more complex than anticipated. <em>“Just tickets”</em> tend to drag, evolve into epics, miss deadlines and hurt the team’s motivation.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this topic discussed many times before. Make sure to check out <a href="https://alistapart.com/blog/post/the-most-dangerous-word-in-software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these two</a> <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/brad-frost/2014-january-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts</a> for a more in-depth description of it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-slack-to-get-rid-of-just-tickets">How to use Slack to get rid of “Just tickets”</h2>
<p>I want to propose a solution to the <em>“Just”</em> problem. Lexically there’s never a need to include the word <em>“just”</em> in a sentence. You can always omit it without altering the core meaning of your message.</p>
<p>You could discourage using the word <em>“just”</em> in communication. Slack offers a simple feature that will let you automate it. Introducing Slackbot triggers:</p>
<p><img alt="Slack keyword trigger in action" title="Slack keyword trigger in action" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/slack-keyword-trigger-40d3219d92fe2bee0932a832ff7c80608c9b99a067f704347ed564dec917bc1e.png"></p>
<p>Slack trigger in action</p>

<p>You can configure Slack to automatically send a custom message whenever a <em>trigger</em> keyword is detected. In settings, go to <strong>Customize &gt; Slackbot</strong> and enter your desired trigger and response.
<br></p>
<p><img alt="Slack trigger settings" title="Slack trigger settings" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/slack-trigger-settings-3456bc59b61b75a27c245690b2d0a5d57afd8e2ac535027c9d01e3a87c54cffb.png"></p>
<p>Slack trigger settings</p>

<p>It could be pretty spammy to start with, but your team should quickly adjust and stop using the <em>forbidden</em> keyword. If someone does use it, the alert message will be a fun reminder to stop and think twice if the <em>“just”</em> idea is really that simple.</p>
<p>So why won’t you just give this communication experiment a try?</p>
<p>BTW if you’re looking for more creative ways to enhance your communication on Slack, you can check out <a href="https://abot.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abot for anonymous messaging and polls</a>. It’s highly configurable and supports various <a href="https://abot.app/scenarios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usage scenarios</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Anonymous poll conducted using Abot for Slack" title="Anonymous poll conducted using Abot for Slack" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/slack-anonymous-poll-bda619f03336795730c69705f61eddc8f4bac6a6bcd8deb65e83bf3ff880156d.png"></p>

<p>After big-tech censorship silenced social media company Parler on January 11, 2020, they are back online with new servers as well as new leadership.</p>



<p>Over one month ago Amazon Web Services removed Parler from their servers, taking them offline.&nbsp; Google and Apple also removed them from their app stores. &nbsp; They claimed that the platform was used to “incite, organize, and coordinate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.”</p>



<p>Defense and National Guard officials, including now former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, have stated in interviews that federal law enforcement authorities indicated there was activity relating to the organizing of the Capitol attack on Twitter also.</p>



<p>Parler execs said it was a war on free speech, and Amazon stated that requests to remove violent content, including death threats against public figures were ignored.</p>



<p>In addition, their co-founder and CEO, John Matze was terminated by their board on January 29 over differences in company visions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parler’s interim CEO Mark Meckler told<a href="https://justthenews.com/nation/culture/welcome-back-parler-resumes-social-media-app-after-securing-new-computer-servers?utm_source=breaking-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter#article"> Just the News</a> that “20 million users who were already using the app can begin logging back in on Monday, and new users should be able to sign up in approximately one week.”</p>



<p>“He also said the platform is using artificial intelligence and human editors to police for illegal speech that violates its service agreement but otherwise is remaining true to its free speech, no censorship roots.”</p>



<p>According to his<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkMeckler?s=20"> Twitter</a> account, Meckler is the President of the Convention of States Project, Co-Founder and former National Coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, Constitutional Revolutionary, Husband, Father, and Son.</p>



<p>“Parler is being run by an experienced team and is here to stay,” Meckler said in a statement. “We will thrive as the premier social media platform dedicated to free speech, privacy and civil dialogue.”</p>



<p>There are still some issues with the platform as many people are reporting the site is still not accessible, but it seems their return is imminent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A writeup detailing the vulnerability reporting process that took place after Sakura Samurai had breached the Indian Government</p><p>Reading time: 6 minutes.</p><div>
      

<p>Sakura Samurai knew that the Indian Government operated an RVDP (Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program). <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> put a list together of initial assets in scope for Sakura Samurai to legally test. <a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a> reported that he had found sensitive data and was able to breach police assets. <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> was working in the enumeration processes with his friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/orpheus9001" title="https://twitter.com/orpheus9001">Zultan Holder</a> [not an active Sakura Samurai member] and identified a slew of various attack vectors, immediately resulting in the exposure of many pairs of credentials for databases and other pertinent applications.</p>
<p>The team was informed of the initial enumeration results as they continued to work on the list of assets within scope, while also further jumping into the research and began performing analysis on the sensitive data, identifying additional vectors of attack, exposed PII, and even more credentials.</p>
<p>Sakura Samurai team members included <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Kirtaner" title="https://twitter.com/Kirtaner">Aubrey Cottle</a>, and<a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking"> John Jackson</a></p>
<p>In total, the following vulnerabilities were identified, in no specific order:</p>
<ul>
<li>35 Separate Instances of Exposed Credential Pairs (Servers, Important Applications, etc)</li>
<li>3 Instances of Sensitive File Disclosure</li>
<li>5 Exposed private-key pairs for servers</li>
<li>13K+ PII Records [and those are only the records that we were inadvertently exposed to]</li>
<li>Dozens of Exposed Sensitive Police Reports</li>
<li>Session Hijacking Chained via Multiple Vulnerabilities, resulting in the compromise of extremely sensitive government systems</li>
<li>Remote Code Execution on a sensitive financial server; a server that contained large backups of Financial Records</li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, it is important to note that so many Critical findings had been identified during our testing that we cannot possibly include all of the vulnerabilities without making this writeup unnecessarily heavy. Therefore, we have opted to include small snippets of repetitive findings in this section. Many variations of application and server credentials also were obtained but the point has already been made.</p>
<p><strong>Exposed Database Credentials</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/db-creds.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Private SSH Keys</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/priv-ssh.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Sensitive File Exposure</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/sens-file-exp.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Exposed PHP Mailer Credentials</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/mailer.png" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a> identified an application that resulted in a vulnerability that allowed him to access Sensitive Police Records, containing PII of individuals listed on the report. In addition, sample forensic reports and forensic tooling that is used by the police department was identified by Willis. The exposure of citizen’s sensitive information, some being victims, is a sensitive subject within itself and highly alarming.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/police.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/police2.png" alt=""><br>
Shortly after, <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> found a vulnerability that resulted in the exposure of 14,000+ user records. The records included a wide range of sensitive information, including full name, contact info, employee’s department, date of birth, etc. These exposed records along with other various SQL server dumps and Rob’s Police Record Exposure is enough to constitute a data breach without even logging into any of the servers.</p>
<p>Henry identified many credential pairs which could have resulted in even more exploitation of many other people. The PII identified is a small sample of a much larger issue.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/14k-records.png" alt=""><br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking">John Jackson</a> was able to identify a relevant Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, affecting an out-of-date application residing on one of the government servers. The remote code execution vulnerability allowed for complete access to sensitive files on the server, including the ability to exfiltrate complete backups of financial records [although data exfiltration wasn’t performed to avoid unnecessary action]</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/rce1.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/rce2.png" alt=""><br>
Finally, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Kirtaner" title="https://www.twitter.com/Kirtaner">Aubrey Cottle</a> identified the presence of what appeared to be an extremely important application being hosted by the same server that John had achieved successful Remote Code Execution on. Cottle then chained together multiple vulnerabilities in conjunction with the Remote Code Execution vulnerability, resulting in the ability to hijack any user’s session on the web application. The application contained troves of sensitive government data and could have given a threat actor the ability to perform highly-critical, admin-based government actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/session-chained.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Even though the Indian Government has a RVDP in place, we didn’t feel comfortable disclosing the vulnerabilities right away. The hacking process was far from the standard situation of business-as-usual security research. In total, our report compounded to a massive 34 page report worth of vulnerabilities. We knew that our intent was good, but we wanted to ensure that the US Government had eyes on the situation. Sakura Samurai coordinated with the <a href="https://twitter.com/DC3VDP" title="https://twitter.com/DC3VDP">U.S. DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)</a> to assist in facilitating initial conversations of disclosure. <a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking">John Jackson</a> spoke with DC3’s Program Manager via email and coordinated on a plan of action.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-1.png" alt=""><br>
Roughly 4 days later, after further communication with the DC3, we felt safe to begin our initial reveal of research on the NCIIPC’s RVDP program.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition, the DC3 also commended the hacking that we did in support of making the cyberspace a better place for everyone.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately, what seemed like a done deal turned out to be quite the unprofessional ride. Any organization knows that fixing breach-worthy vulnerabilities is extremely time sensitive. Once threat actors catch wind of major vulnerabilities against an organization they begin poking on their own, looking for more vectors of attack. Immediately upon revealing that Sakura Samurai was the group responsible for hacking the Indian Government, we followed up with them via Email.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p><strong>2021/02/04</strong> - DC3 begins initial contact with the Indian Government.<br>
<strong>2021/02/08</strong> - Sakura Samurai informs the public that they breached the Government.<br>
<strong>2021/02/08</strong> - Sakura Samurai makes contact with the NCIIPC, noting that the report that they received was a result of their research.<br>
<strong>2021/02/09</strong> - The NCIIPC responds, with a basic acknowledgement and thank you for the research.<br>
<strong>2021/02/09</strong> - Sakura Samurai asks for clarification on patching and the responsibility of breach disclosure to the public.<br>
<strong>2021/02/10</strong> - Sakura Samurai, having received no response, asks for an update on the involved remediation and breach notification processes.<br>
<strong>2021/02/16</strong> - Sakura Samurai once again asks for NCIIPC’s plans for remediation and disclosure.<br>
<strong>2021/02/17</strong> - The NCIIPC makes contact, 7-days later, stating that they will follow up in a short time. Again, we ask about plans of anticipated patching and breach notification to the affected citizens.<br>
<strong>2021/02/19</strong> - In the morning, we ask again about patching and disclosure, 8-hours later and still no response on the matter.<br>
<strong>2021/02/19</strong> - Sakura Samurai reviews the submitted vulnerability report and notes that only about an eighth or less of the submitted Critical Vulnerabilities have been resolved within a two-week period. No notification of breach has occurred even though Government Employees and Indian Citizens are at risk of exploitation from threat actors.</p>

<p>Governments have an obligation to protect the private data of its employees and citizens. In addition, the exposure of proprietary government data can be used for great means of manipulation and for other destructive purposes. While the NCIIPC operates a Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program, the recklessness and avoidance of communication represents the complete opposite of a responsible program. A failure to release notification of breach to affected citizens and to patch highly-critical vulnerabilities in a timely manner reflects poorly on the state of their Information Security posture. The clock to patch vulnerabilities began immediately when the DC3 contacted the NCIIPC via Twitter, as it is a highly visible space - one which threat actors avidly monitor.</p>
<p>Sakura Samurai urge the NCIIPC to patch the remainder of the vulnerabilities. The criticality of some of the issues cannot wait weeks or months for adequate resolution.</p>

<p>Whenever a software project needs to implement immutable records, people often start thinking of Blockchain or <strong>D</strong>istributed <strong>L</strong>edger <strong>T</strong>echnology like Hyperledger. Blockchain and DLT make use of cryptographic techniques that enable immutability, verifiability and integrity checks. However, Blockchain and DLT need much more than just these checks. It needs to prevent all the attempts of a double-spend by potential malicious users. In a trust-less environment it needs implementation of complex protocols which leads to consumption of huge amount of electricity. This makes writing data on Blockchain costly. DLTs like Hyperledger make use of simpler consensus algorithms between a “set of trusted nodes”, which reduces the cost. However, it still incurs significant costs if nothing more than immutability, verifiability and integrity were the concern.</p>



<p>This post is about how to implement data immutability, verifiability and integrity without using a Blockchain or a DLT in industrial strength software applications.</p>

<h2 id="foundation">Foundational technique – Cryptographic Hashing</h2>



<p>To understand the solution, some foundational techniques must be understood. This section describes what is cryptographic hashing. Those who are already aware of cryptographic hashing, they may skip to the next section.</p>



<h4 id="hash-function">Cryptographic hash function</h4>



<p>If you provide a stream of bytes to a cryptographic hash function, it generates a number called hash (also referred to as digest). The following properties make it a very useful tool:</p>



<ol><li>It is impossible to guess the generated hash value for a stream of bytes. To get the hash value, one has to run the algorithm, there is no shortcut.</li><li>For a given input it always generates the same hash value.</li><li>It is infeasible to deduce the input based on the hash value. That means it is an irreversible mathematical function.</li><li>No two different stream of bytes result in the same hash value. Even a small change in the input stream generates a totally different number.&nbsp;<em>(When two different stream of bytes produce the same hash value, we say the cryptographic hash function is broken. It is also referred to as there is a collision in the cryptographic hash function.)</em></li><li>Any size of input stream will always result in the same size of hash value. Some hash functions generate hash values that are 256 bits long. If those functions are used, the result will always be 256 bits long.</li></ol>



<p>Examples of commonly used cryptographic hash functions include:</p>



<ul><li>SHA-256 (returns 256 bit&nbsp;unsigned integers)</li><li>RIPEMD-160 (returns 160 bit unsigned integers)</li></ul>



<p>Sample hash values:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Input</strong></td><td><strong>SHA-256</strong></td><td><strong>RIPEMD-160</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hello world</td><td>0x64ec88ca00b268e5ba1a35678a1b5316d212f4f366b2477232534a8aeca37f3c</td><td>0xdbea7bd24eef40a2e79387542e36dd408b77b21a</td></tr><tr><td>Hello world.</td><td>0xaa3ec16e6acc809d8b2818662276256abfd2f1b441cb51574933f3d4bd115d11</td><td>0x6ad34a17d22d67a7ab02710ae9eb6f282cb1d787</td></tr><tr><td>Unrelated, totally.</td><td>0x2bd72f5c4300444890325b3363ef2027f30ed38797c3133dbc62a90564976458</td><td>0x51cb1844d22a00d5f659795e0b1c339c6fa1a8bc</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Hex representation of SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hash values for different inputs</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are two things we observe from the table above:</p>



<ol><li>With a slight change in input, the hash values change dramatically and by looking only at the hash values, one cannot conclude&nbsp;that&nbsp;the first and second are&nbsp;even closely related. This is also referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avalanche effect</a>. It is one of requirements of a cryptographic algorithms to have the avalanche effect.</li><li>The values mentioned are actually text strings and do not look like numbers, although we expected them to be numbers.</li></ol>



<p>They are actually numbers, represented this way to reduce the size of the presented text. For example, binary representation of the number 255&nbsp;is ‘11111111’. Decimal representation is ‘255’. Hexadecimal representation is ‘ff’ or ‘FF’. The representations in the table above are hexadecimal representations of 32 byte and 20 byte numbers. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" target="_blank">base64encoding</a> is commonly used to represent the hash values in cryptographic applications.</p>



<h2 id="verifiability">Verifiability</h2>



<p>For quite some time, open source software has been distributed through various mirror sites so that downloads are sped up. Any user could download the software package quickly from a nearby mirror site. These nearby sites could be malicious and could provide compromised open source software packages. In order to overcome this problem, open source software builds would publish a checksum file on their website. This checksum file is used to verify that the downloaded package from a nearby mirror site is authentic. The checksum file actually contains a cryptographic hash of the software package.</p>



<p>For example: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums/3.4.1_checksums.html" target="_blank">Apache OpenOffice – Download checksum files</a>.</p>



<pre>e08f9c8acecba1ee0046f820b0abed97dfe90511bd733a65936fdf0ea9c22540  Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz</pre>



<p>This is the content from SHA256 checksum file for <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/ooo/files/stable/3.4.1/Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz.sha256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apache Open Office SDK for Linux x86-64</a> build.</p>



<p>It would not matter which mirror site the SDK is downloaded from. A user can easily verify the authenticity of the download using a simple command like:</p>



<pre><code>$ sha256sum Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz
e08f9c8acecba1ee0046f820b0abed97dfe90511bd733a65936fdf0ea9c22540  Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz</code></pre>



<p>If the generated SHA256 does not match with the checksum file, the user knows that the software package has been tampered.</p>



<p>We will use the same technique to verify data objects. The data object we are interested in would have an ID. Any application or service asks for objects using IDs. If the data that the application gets does not generate the same hash value as the ID, then the application can easily conclude that the data is not what was asked for or the data has mutated. On a typical hardware the cryptographic hash function would take a few microseconds to generate the hash value. So, this is not costly and offers good verifiability.</p>



<p>In the context of this post, the verifiability that we are seeking is not because we operate in a trust-less or adversarial environment like Blockchains, but mainly because data can become corrupt or can be deliberately changed by hackers / attackers. This is for companies to verify that the data they hold has not been modified undesirably.</p>



<h4 id="verify-id">Application: Deterministic and Verifiable IDs</h4>



<p>In a typical RESTful request, a client posts a request to a service, and the service returns back an ID. The service uses the ID to index the object that got created due to the request. However, with a predetermined ID generation technique, it is possible for the client to know the ID even before the service receives the request. This is done even in blockchains. The transactionID (also referred as <a href="https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/TXID" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TXID</a>) is a hash computed from certain fields of a transaction request.</p>



<p>To be able to know the ID of an object that will be returned by a service even before the object is created in a service has significant benefits. </p>



<ol><li>Just by computing the ID from the fields of an object, and comparing it with the ID provided in the object, one can determine if the object is the right object. Housekeeping processes can easily determine data corruption or software bugs or potential attacks.</li><li>Request need not be processed synchronously.</li><li>The client can fire a batch of requests in just one call. Each individual request can easily be identified by the request id which will be deterministic for both the client and the service. This eliminates the need to create IDs on the client side, and map them to the server side IDs.</li><li>Non-idempotent requests such as HTTP POST requests can achieve deterministic behaviour. Multiple POST requests (which could be because of software bug or infrastructural replays) will not cause harm, as the request ID is predetermined. The server can easily identify a duplicate request.</li></ol>



<p>Example: To generate an OrderID, one could take the sha256 of a series of bytes of the quantity, price, dateTime of the order, clientID, and the assetID or assetSymbol.</p>



<pre><code>OrderID = sha256(bytes(qty)||bytes(price)||bytes(dateTime)||bytes(clientID)||bytes(assetID))</code></pre>



<h4 id="data-format">Data format and ID Generation</h4>



<p>While the scheme above for ID generation works, it has a certain drawback. For every type of objects, a developer would have to write an ID generator. This is not desirable. For a majority of the types of objects, the id generator should just be available easily. For this, the object itself can be serialised and the serialised stream of bytes can be hashed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that text based data structures like JSON, XML are not very well suited for this. The main reason behind this is that adding a space or TAB within the document will not alter the data for JSON or XML, however will yield a totally different hash value and therefore a totally different object ID. Hence, it is better to use serialisation formats designed for cross platform, multiple language environments and are deterministic. Compact data serialisation like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers" target="_blank">protocol buffers</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/" target="_blank">FlatBuffers</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://avro.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Avro</a> and even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049" target="_blank">CBOR</a> are much better suited for this.</p>



<h2 id="immutability">Immutability and Verifiability</h2>



<p>Software professionals often jump to Blockchain to achieve immutability even in a non-adversarial environment like most business applications. Any party explicitly trying to cheat would face the court, and fraudulent transactions can be reverted in the most common business applications seen throughout the world. Therefore, there is no need for all the complexity and consensus algorithms like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. Even on DLTs there are algorithms like Raft which are used to achieve consensus. Although much lesser in the power consumption, raft could still be an overkill for some …</p></div></div>

<p>Consider a trio of moments of entangled spacetime:</p>



<p>Jan. 7, 2021, cyberspace and Washington, D.C.: A staggering 4,112 people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/us/coronavirus-deaths.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">die</a> of the coronavirus in America, a new record. Elon Musk becomes the richest person in the world and reiterates his plan to leave Earth and start a colony on Mars.</p>



<p>Dec. 7, 1972, near-Earth orbit: The crew of <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a002600/a002680/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Apollo 17</a>, 18,000 miles from home and on their way to the moon, snap a photograph of Earth. Illuminated by the sun and nestled in the sable sea of outer space, the “Blue Marble” image becomes a resonant icon of humans’ dear and fragile life-filled planet. Earth’s denizens wonder: Are there other worlds beyond? Or is this the only example of life in the universe?</p>



<p>Nov. 7, 1957, Calcutta, India: Two prominent biologists, Joshua Lederberg and J.B.S. Haldane, meet for dinner. A month earlier, the Soviet Union had launched Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. Lederberg and Haldane <a href="https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/bb/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101584906X13253-doc" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">determine</a> that a thermonuclear bomb detonated on the moon would be visible to Earthlings, and it would be so destructive it would spoil the possibility of finding traces of lunar life.</p>



<p>Lifted from three interspaced epochs of the ongoing Space Age — the COVID-19 pandemic, the environmental movement and the Cold War — those moments reveal how terrestrial troubles are entwined with hopes of discovering life, and of living, beyond Earth. As dreams to explore the cosmos curl skyward, fears and anxieties particular to each moment raise doubts not only about humans’ longevity on our home planet, but also about how we might inhabit and sustain life on other worlds as space-faring explorers. If humans self-destruct through nuclear war, poison the planet by churning out carbon into the atmosphere or fail to control a deadly virus, such events would preclude us from existing on Earth, living long enough to communicate with possible extraterrestrial beings and venturing to other worlds we might discover to be habitable.</p>



<p>Thus, fears of terrestrial apocalypse animate pursuits for life and living beyond Earth. But conversely, imagining how life (including human life) might exist in an extraterrestrial context, and seeing the planet from outer space, has driven imaginations of Earth’s possible futures — both hopeful, course-correcting pathways, but also escapist fantasies of extraplanetary colonization.</p>



<p>Anticipations of worlds <em>beyond</em> Earth — places that might be (or might be made to be) habitable — are made possible by conceiving <em>of</em> Earth as both threatened and interconnected: The coronavirus’s march across the world reveals the viruses’ disregard for political borders, the environmental movement highlighted the fragility of the planet’s entangled life and the Cold War ushered in the concept of global nuclear disaster.</p>



<p>These threats have, in different ways, revealed how actions are never self-contained in global, networked systems. Each moment’s particular planetary anxieties — pathogenic, climate, nuclear — have animated and informed scientists’ pursuit of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h5><strong>Annihilation</strong></h5>



<p>On Oct. 4, 1957, Sputnik Istreaked across the sky. Touching off the “space race” between the United States and the Soviet Union, the satellite represented the opposition between democracy and communism. “Artificial earth satellites will pave the way to interplanetary travel,” the Communist Party’s official newspaper <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/14.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the following day, and “our contemporaries will witness how the freed and conscientious labor of the people of the new socialist society makes the most daring dreams of mankind a reality.”</p>



<p>Sputnik I was particularly visible from the southern hemisphere, where Nobel Prize-winning microbiologist Joshua Lederberg happened to be traveling. A month later, on his way back to Stanford University, where he taught and researched, Lederberg passed through Calcutta to visit his friend and collaborator J.B.S. Haldane. Haldane had formulated the “<a href="https://www.uv.es/~orilife/textos/Haldane.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">primordial soup</a>” model — how life could have originated from <span data-note="Abiogenic means not produced by the activity of living organisms; abiogenesis is the process by which life could have evolved from non-living materials.">abiogenic</span> materials on an ancient Earth. Both scientists looked forward to that night’s lunar eclipse.</p>



<p>Over dinner, Haldane — a “confirmed Communist” and “radical alternativist,” according to Lederberg — “gloated” that it was also the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the October Revolution, the event that had precipitated the formation of the Soviet Union. As a thought experiment, the two scientists wondered: What if the Soviets leveraged the symbolic occasion to plant a “red star” — a nuclear bomb — on the moon? Their back-of-the-napkin calculation revealed that it would be visible from Earth.</p>



<p>Of course, there was no “red star” that evening, and the U.S. astronauts of the Apollo 11 mission, not Soviet cosmonauts, would be the first to land on the moon twelve years later, in 1969. But the conversation with Haldane about the possibility for off-Earth atomic destruction spurred Lederberg toward the study of “exobiology,” the search to detect and preserve life beyond Earth. As the U.S. and the Soviet Union’s space race accelerated during the Cold War, the National Academy of Sciences established the Space Science Board (SSB) to research outer space and to recommend policies to NASA. That group, which included Lederberg and other prominent scientists (among them a young Carl Sagan), worked to protect the moon and other extraterrestrial sites as scientific laboratories.</p>



<p>Looking ahead to possible NASA missions that would explore Mars and Venus for traces of life, a 1959 SSB report that Lederberg chaired transported Cold War fears of nuclear war on Earth to celestial bodies beyond. It warned that “the effect of introducing radioactivity on another planet where there may be entirely different levels of background radiation from those found on Earth could greatly influence any form of life found there.” Planetary concerns of atomic fallout migrated to unexplored sites beyond our planet.</p>



<p>In addition to nuclear radiation on other planets, the possibility of microbial contamination presented risks in the search for life beyond Earth. A spacecraft landing on Mars, for example, might bring terrestrial hitchhikers, risking a false detection of organic biochemistry that would muddle attempts to theorize the origin of life in the solar system and possibly the cosmos beyond. Throughout the late 1950s and the 60s, exobiologists’ reports urged sterilization protocols be taken so as to preserve possible “planetary biota” on Mars.</p>



<p>At the same time, exobiologists worried that possible Martian microbes might infect Earth; through incautious activity by either the U.S. or the Soviet Union, a “dramatic hazard would be the introduction of a new disease, imperiling human health,” as Lederberg wrote in 1960. This particular threat took center stage in Michael Crichton’s 1969 science fiction book (and subsequent film) “The Andromeda Strain,” in which a mysterious and fatal extraterrestrial microorganism appears in Arizona and threatens to end life on Earth. Merging apocalypses, the characters consider annihilating the infected laboratory with a nuclear bomb.</p>



<p>Civilian scientists’ goals to detect extraterrestrials were often <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/344962?seq=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">at odds</a> with those of the national agencies they answered to. While John F. Kennedy’s 1962 “<a href="https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">We choose to go to the moon</a>” speech mandated the priority of manned missions to outer space that would showcase national prestige, exobiologists advocated for international efforts to preserve (extra)terrestrial life forms. A 1961 SSB report suggested that the U.S. and the Soviet Union work together on sterilization protocols to “simplify the problem of protection against possible contamination of the planets and of the Earth.” The planetary struggle for political dominance, which threatened to plunge Earth into a nuclear apocalypse, was thus shaping extraplanetary pursuits.</p>



<p>As they considered Earth and extraterrestrial sites of possible life (Mars’s subsurface, Venus’s atmosphere and even, possibly, the moon’s dust) in tandem, exobiologists began to imagine interconnected, but distinct, planetary wholes. Linking Earth to planets beyond, two exobiologists wrote in a 1961 <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/12425/chapter/1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">report</a>, “The planets of the solar system are part of a whole — in their origins, in their present states and in their futures.” Such exercises that forecasted other worlds soon came to intersect with growing concerns about the fragility of our own planet.</p>

<h5><strong>Interconnection</strong></h5>



<p>Amid the persistent threat of nuclear apocalypse that defined the Cold War era, exobiologists began to call for planetary protection protocols for both Earth and extraterrestrial sites — concerns that became increasingly aligned with a burgeoning consciousness about humans’ harmful activities on Earth. Rachel Carson’s 1962 book “Silent Spring” introduced the idea that synthetic chemicals, especially pesticides — which she <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/05/reviews/carson-obit.html?_r=2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">argued</a> should be called “biocides” — were fundamentally altering life on Earth. The ensuing environmental movement of the 1960s and 70s culminated in the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and made “the environment” a widespread public concern, fortifying the concept that life systems were interconnected, malleable and fragile.</p>

February 21, 2021 | https://www.ditto.live/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ditto.live/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><nav aria-label="breadcrumb"><ol><li><a href="https://www.ditto.live/">Home</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ditto.live/blog/posts">Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ditto.live/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer">The New Network Multiplexer </a></li></ol></nav><p>Since the first versions of Ditto, devices always made multiple connections to other peers. For example, two iOS devices will try to connect simultaneously over WiFi, Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL), and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We make multiple connections because each transport has different characteristics such as throughput and distance. For example, Bluetooth Low Energy works over long distances but has little bandwidth. AWDL has much more bandwidth but the devices need to be close together.</p>
<p>In the example below we see two iPhones syncing over AWDL and BLE. As one device gets further from the other, the AWDL connection will degrade and disconnect while the BLE connection sustains longer distances.</p>

<h2 id="pre-version-1.0.0">Pre-Version 1.0.0</h2>
<p>Before version 1.0.0, Ditto created a unique replication session for every transport. This is the software component which tracks queries and data changes and ensures that every Ditto device stays in sync. These separate replication pathways can appear or disappear as connections come and go, without disrupting sibling sessions.</p>
<p>When there is new data to sync, a session packs that data into an update file. With multiple concurrent sessions, all of them would then race against each other to transmit that update file as quickly as possible, regardless of duplication between transports. Transactional locking on the internal database made sure that only one session at a time could modify the update file, which prevented race conditions. Since any session is able to maintain the update file, any individual session can fail and replication will always continue, providing a high level of reliability.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ditto.live/assets/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer/old-way.svg" alt="old-way-sessions"></p>
<p>In this benchmark we see the consequences of each session sending data eagerly over every transport. In an attempt to send a document with about 2 megabytes of data, all five connected modes of transport aggressively sent data as fast as they could. We can see that the highly efficient AWDL transports could send all bytes first, and the remote peer quickly notified the slower connections that they could stop. However, the slower transports had already sent duplicate bytes. In the end, the peer had sent 5.4 megabytes even though the document size was about 2 megabytes. This was 2.6 times larger than the initial payload. Furthermore, this fully occupied the BLE radio, consuming bandwidth that could have been better used by a Bluetooth-only peer.</p>
<div>

    <thead>
      <tr>

        <td>5390896</td>
        <td>134</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<p>In version 1.0.0, we’ve introduced a completely new system for creating sync sessions between peers we call the multiplexer. Our first order of business was to reduce the duplication of sessions to the same peer over multiple transport types. We’ve introduced the concept of a virtual connection between two peers. No matter how many transport connections are active, there will only be one virtual connection and only one session. Now incoming data is buffered and intermediated from the transport layer to a single virtual connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ditto.live/assets/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer/new-way.svg" alt="new-way-multiplexer"></p>
<p>This new architecture allows each virtual connection to intelligently send data over multiple physical transports with fine-grained control. For example, the multiplexer can switch active transports on the fly without unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ol>
<li>The multiplexer on the left device deemed that TCP (WiFi) was the best transport to start sending data.</li>
<li>Suddenly, the infastructure WiFi goes out, and the multiplexer switches to AWDL.</li>
<li>As the device moves away from its peer, AWDL is lost and the multiplexer switches to BLE.</li>
<li>The devices move closer together and the multiplexer finishes the rest of the transmission over AWDL.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the total bytes sent is equal to the size of the update file.</p>
<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Transport</th>
        <th>Bytes Sent</th>
        <th>Packets Sent</th>

        <td>2097944</td>
        <td>246</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>The introduction of the multiplexer is a gigantic step forward for Ditto's networking capabilities. Today, it focuses on using one transport at a time but this new foundation allows us to build even more powerful, dynamic and flexible replication techniques such as using multiple transports at a time over unreliable connections, streaming use cases, and decentralized data sync techniques reminiscent of BitTorrent.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Software Development Kits (SDK) and Application Programming Interface (API) are critical components of your app’s development. However, these two terms sometimes overlap, often leading to confusion.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Knowing their differences and how you can take advantage of them can significantly help you improve your application. This piece tackles their distinct features and outlines how you can utilize them to supercharge your app.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What is an API?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>By definition, APIs are sets of instructions and protocols used to integrate specific functionalities into an application. An API can help connect your apps or projects to external services, enabling seamless data transfer and adding a new feature altogether.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at this example from software company <a href="https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api">Mulesoft</a> explaining the function of an API:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>Imagine you’re sitting at a table in a restaurant with a menu of choices to order from. The kitchen is the part of the “system” that will prepare your order. What is missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table. That’s where the waiter or API comes in. The waiter is the messenger – or API – that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen – the system – what to do. Then the waiter delivers the response back to you; in this case, it is the food.</em><br></blockquote><p>With an API, developers don’t have to worry about creating lots of custom code to enable functionalities, as various APIs exist to fulfill a specific function. As <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Youtube&amp;utm_content=000023UA&amp;utm_term=10010608&amp;utm_id=YTDescription-101-API-vs-SDK-LH-API-Guide&amp;cm_mmc=OSocial_Youtube-_-Cloud+and+Data+Platform_SFT+Cloud+Platform+Digital-_-WW_WW-_-YTDescription-101-API-vs-SDK-LH-API-Guide&amp;cm_mmca1=000023UA&amp;cm_mmca2=10010608">IBM</a> mentioned, APIs allow companies to open up their applications’ data and functionality for third-party developers to use. So if you have a food delivery app and want to verify your user’s number, provide the location, and enable payment without leaving the platform, there’s an available phone, maps, and payment API to perform these actions.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What is an SDK?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>On the other hand, SDKs are a set of tools used to develop applications for a specific platform. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-SDK">Red Hat</a> mentioned that a typical SDK contains a compiler, debugger, as well as APIs, and any of the following:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Documentation</li><li>Libraries</li><li>Editors</li><li>Runtime/development environments</li><li>Testing/analysis tools</li><li>Drivers</li><li>Network protocols<br></li></ul><p>Let’s take the restaurant scenario again. For example, you are a chef. When you’re cooking a dish, you will need ingredients for your recipe; you need the kitchen utensils so you can cook, you need a copy of a recipe to put the meal together, and so on. In the same way, SDK provides all the things you need to create your intended application.&nbsp;<br></p><p>SDKs are crucial when developing an app for a specific platform. For instance, Apple provides iOS SDKs to developers so they can create applications specifically for iOS. An SDK should add value to a developer. Hence it should be easy to use, provides a thorough explanation of the code used, and adds functionality to an existing app.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Things to remember&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Now that we defined both, let us recap:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>APIs facilitates the communication and integration of software</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>SDK provides the foundation to build an application specifically for a platform</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>SDKs contain APIs; APIs don’t contain SDKs<br></li></ul><p>API, as a part of an SDK, is lightweight and specialized based on the function intended. Meanwhile, SDKs have a collection of utilities to create a new application or add new functionalities.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>API and SDK can elevate your app&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Now that we know the differences, how can you take advantage of both to improve your app?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Utilizing SDKs with the APIs that meet your needs can significantly enhance your application’s functionality. According to <a href="https://marketfinder.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en/guide/improve-ux-ui-of-app/#overview">Google</a>, mobile users spend nine out of ten minutes using only their top five favorite apps. So how can your app be one of their top five?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>SDKs can enable powerful in-app features with the corresponding APIs that will substantially affect your app’s user experience. With so many apps out there, you would want yours to stand out in the app market.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And of course, you just don’t want users to download your app; you would like them to keep and share it with their peers, creating a loyal fanbase for your application.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you are a brand and you aim to engage and retain your users, adding <a href="https://www.amity.co/blog/remain-competitive-by-adding-social-features-to-your-app">social features with an SDK </a>to your app can help raise user engagement through <a href="https://www.amity.co/blog/building-your-in-app-community-why-it-matters">in-app groups.</a> Meanwhile, integrating chat SDK into your application can facilitate 1-on-1 conversations or group interactions, allowing you to host online communities.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.amity.co/products/amity-video">Video SDKs</a> can help you integrate in-app live streaming and stories to your product if you have an entertainment application.&nbsp; So whether it’s a sports event or a concert broadcasted in your app, this solution can help bring throngs of fans to use your application. On the other hand, if your SDK has a <a href="https://www.amity.co/products/amity-bots">chatbot</a> API that can collect user data, you can use the information you have to create a more personalized user experience, push tailored notifications, and deliver the right content to your users.<br></p><p>In conclusion, API and SDK, regardless of their differences, can both be beneficial for your application. Using SDK with the right APIs can create numerous possibilities to improve your application. Now is the time to find the best SDKs to enhance your in-app user experience, engagement, and retention.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div>]]>

    <p>I made a control board for the Microsoft Sculpt wireless keyboard that converts it to wired USB, and now my favorite keyboard is even better.</p>

<figcaption>USB cable and reset button.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The QMK config is available at <a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/qmk_firmware">@chadaustin/qmk_firmware</a> (<a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/handwired/sculpt">keyboards/handwired/sculpt/</a>), and the PCB design files at <a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/wired-sculpt-pcb">@chadaustin/wired-sculpt-pcb</a>.</p>

<p>I’m planning on making at least one more, so if you’d like one, maybe I can help.</p>

<p>It’s a huge improvement. Latency is reduced by about 13 milliseconds, and with full control over the microcontroller’s firmware, you can customize keymaps and layers, and actually use the keyboard’s built-in LEDs.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Feel free to stop reading here — I am going to tell the sequence of events that led to this project. Besides some exposure to basic voltage and resistance circuits in college, I have very little electronics background. But, in a short time, I went from only barely knowing what a capacitor was to having a working PCB manufactured and assembled, and maybe this will inspire someone else to give it a try.</p>

<p>Since developing RSI in college, I’ve exclusively used Microsoft’s ergonomic keyboards. And when I first tried the Sculpt, I instantly knew it was the best yet. The soft actuation, short key travel, and rigid frame are perfect for my hands. And because the number pad is a separate device, the distance to my mouse is shortened.</p>

<p>My brother went out and bought one too. Not much later, he gave it to me, saying the latency was inconsistent and high, and it was unacceptable for gaming. I thought he was being uniquely sensitive, since I had no problem in either Linux, Windows 7, or macOS. But then I updated to Windows 10 and saw exactly what he meant.</p>

<p>It was like the keyboard would go to sleep if a key wasn’t pressed for a few seconds, and the first keypress after a wake would be delayed or, worse, dropped.</p>

<p>And heaven forbid I use my USB 3 hub, whose EMI would disrupt the 2.4 GHz signal, and <em>every other</em> keypress would be unreliable. I’d gone as far as mounting the wireless transceiver directly under my keyboard, on the underside of my desk, and keys were still dropped.</p>

<p>So, best keyboard ever. But wireless sucks. (But mostly in Windows 10? No idea about that.)</p>

<h2 id="over-the-hump">Over the Hump</h2>

<p>What started this whole thing is that the <a href="https://github.com/facebookexperimental/eden/#edenfs">EdenFS</a> team was a bunch of keyboard enthusiasts. During the pandemic, as we’re all at home burning out and missing each other, we were trying to think of some virtual team offsites. Wez offered to walk everyone through building a <a href="https://www.1upkeyboards.com/instructions-downloads/sweet-16-instructions/">Sweet 16 Macro Pad</a>.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/sweet-16.jpeg"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/sweet-16.jpeg" alt="Assembled Sweet 16 underside"></a>
<figcaption>Assembled Sweet 16 underside. This is take two, after resoldering and cleaning the whole thing. Take one was a bit of a mess.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, okay, a keyboard is a matrix, with some diodes used to disambiguate the signalling, and a microcontroller that rapidly polls the matrix and reports events over USB…</p>

<p>So maybe I could fix the Sculpt! I bought a transceiver-less Sculpt off eBay for cheap and <a href="http://emmanuelcontreras.com/how-to/how-to-disassemble-microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-and-make-it-wired/">popped it open (thanks Emmanuel Contreras!)</a>, thinking maybe its controller could be flashed with new firmware that speaks USB. The Sculpt uses a <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF24LE1_PS_v1.6.pdf">Nordic Semiconductor nRF24LE1</a>, but I was nowhere near capable of making use of that information at the time, though it did point me to Samy Kamkar’s horrifying guide on <a href="https://samy.pl/keysweeper/">surreptitiously sniffing keystrokes from nearby (older) Microsoft wireless keyboards</a>.</p>

<p>I almost gave up here, but Per Vognsen <a href="https://twitter.com/pervognsen/status/1322422385174220800">suggested I scan the matrix myself</a> and it turns out Michael Fincham had already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/bhkgnp/modification_photos_qmk_wired_microsoft_sculpt/">mapped out the matrix and soldered a Teensy 2.0++ board onto the Sculpt’s test pads</a>, showing this was doable!</p>

<p>So I ordered my own microcontroller to try the same thing.</p>

<p>First, I bought an Arduino Pro Micro, like the Sweet 16 uses. Oh hey, 18 GPIO pins isn’t enough to drive the Sculpt’s 26-pin matrix. I looked at using an I2C GPIO expander, but it felt like taking on too much.</p>

<figcaption>Arduino Pro Micro. Wait, you need pins to scan a matrix?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>More pins? QMK’s Proton C has more pins! So I carefully soldered onto the test pads as Michael had shown was possible… and it worked!</p>

<figcaption>All test pads connected to Proton C. It works!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Getting those wires to stick to the pads without shorting was tricky. (I hadn’t yet discovered how magical flux is.)</p>

<p>The keyboard worked, but I couldn’t fit the board, its wires, and the new microcontroller into the case, and I wasn’t <em>really</em> happy leaving it in this state, even if I could pack it in somehow.</p>

<p>I thought, all I <em>really</em> need is the ribbon cable connector, so I ordered a 30 pin, 1.0 mm pitch ribbon breakout and the pricier (but tons of pins!) <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html">Teensy 2.0++</a>. Looking back, it’s cute that I was trying to save $10 on the microcontroller… You just have to get used to spending money on whatever saves you time.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/breakout-and-teensy.jpeg"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/breakout-and-teensy.jpeg" alt="Ribbon cable breakout and Teensy 2.0++"></a>
<figcaption>Ribbon cable breakout and Teensy 2.0++</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, it was almost as annoying to solder, and still didn’t fit. So much for saving money on microcontrollers.</p>

<p>I thought about giving up. Is it really that bad that my keys don’t always register in games? Can I just tolerate some flakiness and latency?</p>

<p>But Jon Watte offered to spend an entire day showing me how to use KiCad, design circuits, layout PCBs, select components on Digi-Key, scan datasheets for the important information, and how to work with a PCB manufacturing house. Of course you never turn down opportunities like that.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-final-board---schematic">Designing the Final Board - Schematic</h2>

<p>Assuming, like me, you’ve never done this, I’ll summarize the steps.</p>

<p>First you sketch out the circuit schematic.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/schematic.png"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/schematic.png" alt="Schematic"></a>
<figcaption>Schematic in KiCad. Most of this was informed by the datasheet and Atmel's design guides.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Jon showed me several tricks in KiCad, like global labels, and starting with some standard resistor and capacitor values, but it’s very important that you go through the datasheets, because details can matter a ton.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted the main processor to be the AT90USB1286 controller, and fortunately KiCad already had a symbol for it. Atmel has a comprehensive and accessible data sheet, which showed me I needed some 22 Ω resistors on the USB data lines, which of the ISP programmer lines needed resistors (and appropriate values), and that I needed to either pull HWB low, or provide a physical switch that pulls it low, in order to allow rebooting the device into USB firmware update mode.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of things that are implicitly known to electrical engineers but that were new to me. You want:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a ground plane under the data lines and most of the microcontroller if possible.</li>
  <li>an electrolytic or tantalum bypass capacitor on the main 5V power from USB.</li>
  <li>ceramic filter capacitors on each power pin.</li>
  <li>appropriate values for the resonance capacitors on your crystal.</li>
  <li>electrostatic discharge protection! Turns out transients are common and it’s easy to fry a chip just by plugging it in.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then when you get into concerns like EMI and high-frequency signal integrity, the rabbit hole goes deep.</p>

<p>I kept having to tell myself “it’s just a keyboard”, but it also helped that there are a great number of high-quality resources on these topics just a click away. I spent lots of time on <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/">EEVBlog</a>.</p>

<p>Before finishing the circuit design, Jon had me do a couple smart things. In case the factory-supplied USB bootloader didn’t work out, he suggested I add the footprint (but not a connector!) for an ISP programmer and a debug LED to prove code would work at all.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-final-board---physical-layout">Designing the Final Board - Physical Layout</h2>

<p>After arranging the schematic and ensuring it passed the electrical rules check, it was time to pick specific components. That is, the reference to a 220 Ω resistor is replaced with the Panasonic ERJ-3EKF2200V, 0603 surface mount.</p>

<p>There are a couple things to keep in mind. For common components, like resistors and ceramic capacitors, there is a huge amount of choice. For example, I see over 1400 surface-mount 220 Ω resistors on digikey. I tried to just stick with one high-quality brand like Panasonic or Samsung for all of that stuff.</p>

<p>The important thing is the physical form factor, which determines the footprint on the board. Once you pick a part, it has a size, and you need to tell KiCad which physical footprint should be assigned to that component. I used 0603 resistors, so I assigned each resistor in the schematic the “Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric” footprint.</p>

<p>Same for everything else. Jon showed me how to draw my own footprints, but to avoid complexity, I was able to find appropriate footprints in KiCad’s standard libraries for every component I needed.</p>

<p>When you import the schematic into Pcbnew, it’s time to figure out where things go. Where are the edges of the board? Make careful measurements here. Where do the mounting holes go? Where do you want 
the microcontroller? Where do you want the USB port?</p>

</figure>

<p>Also, you have to pick through-hole sizes and trace widths. Jon had me use .250 mm for the narrow traces and .500 mm for the wider ones, presumably from experience. I used the narrow traces for signalling and wide traces for power, though I’ve since heard it’s a good idea to use narrow traces between filter capacitors and VBUS.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, there’s some iteration between the schematic and the PCB. After physically placing the ribbon cable connector and MCU, the traces all crossed over each other, so I had to reassign all the pins so it made sense physically.</p>

<p>There are also physical constraints about how USB data lines are run, and how the electrostatic protection chip wants to be placed for the most protection.</p>

<p>So, as simple as this board is, I spent a fair amount of time getting all of that right.</p>

<p>I found myself getting lost in the abstractness of holes and traces and footprints, so it was helpful to ground myself by occasionally loading the PCB in KiCad’s 3D viewer.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this article, we share empirical measurements from our experiments in using Postgres to index and search over 10,000 top GitHub repositories using <code>pg_trgm</code> on only a Macbook.</p>

<p>This is a follow up to <a href="https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/postgres-trigram-search-learnings">“Postgres Trigram search learnings”</a>, in which we shared several learnings and beliefs about trying to use Postgres Trigram indexes as an alterative to Google’s <a href="https://github.com/google/zoekt">Zoekt</a> (“Fast trigram based code search”).</p>

<p>We share our results, as well as <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements">the exact steps we performed, scripts, and lists of the top 20,000 repositories by stars/language on GitHub</a> so you can reproduce the results yourself should you desire.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p><strong>This article is extensive and more akin to a research paper than a blog post.</strong> If you’re interested in our conclusions, see <a href="#conclusions">conclusions</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>We wanted to get empirical measurements for how suitable Postgres is in providing regexp search over documents, e.g. as an alterative to Google’s <a href="https://github.com/google/zoekt">Zoekt</a> (“Fast trigram based code search”). In specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many repositories can we index on just a 2019 Macbook Pro?</li>
  <li>How fast are different regexp searches over the corpus?</li>
  <li>What Postgres 13 configuration gives best results?</li>
  <li>What other operational effects need consideration if seriously attempting to use Postgres as the backend for a regexp search engine?</li>
  <li>What is the best database schema to use?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>We ran all tests on a 2019 Macbook Pro with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9</li>
  <li>16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4</li>
</ul>

<p>During test execution, few other Mac applications were in use such that effectively all CPU/memory was available to Postgres.</p>

<h2 id="corpus">Corpus</h2>

<p>We scraped <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/tree/main/top_repos">lists of the top 1,000 repositories from the GitHub search API</a> ranked by stars for each of the following languages (~20.5k repositories in total):</p>

<ul>
  <li>C++, C#, CSS, Go, HTML, Java, JavaScript, MatLab, ObjC, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Shell, Solidity, Swift, TypeScript, VB .NET, and Zig.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloning all ~20.5k repositories in parallel took ~14 hours with a fast ~100 Mbps connection to GitHub’s servers.</p>

<h3 id="dataset-reduction">Dataset reduction</h3>

<p>We found the amount of disk space required by <code>git clone --depth 1</code> on these repositories to be a sizable ~412G for just 12,148 repositories - and so we put in place several processes for further reduce the dataset size by about 66%:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removing <code>.git</code> directories resulted in a 30% reduction (412G -&gt; 290G, for 12,148 repositories)</li>
  <li>Removing files &gt; 1 MiB resulted in another 51% reduction (290G -&gt; 142G, for 12,148 repositories - note GitHub does not index files &gt; 384 KiB in their search engine)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="database-insertion">Database insertion</h2>

<p>We <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/blob/main/cmd/corpusindex/main.go">concurrently inserted</a> the entire corpus into Postgres, with the following DB schema:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>pg_trgm</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>files</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>bigserial</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>contents</span> <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>filepath</span> <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In total, this took around ~8 hours to complete and Postgres’s entire on-disk utilization was 101G.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-trigram-index">Creating the Trigram index</h2>

<p>We tried three separate times to index the dataset using the following GIN Trigram index:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS files_contents_trgm_idx ON files USING GIN (contents gin_trgm_ops);
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>In the first attempt, we hit an OOM after 11 hours and 34 minutes.</strong> This was due to a rapid spike in memory usage at the very end of indexing. We used a <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements#configuration-attempt-1-indexing-failure-oom">fairly aggressive</a> Postgres configuration with a very large max WAL size, so it was not entirely unexpected.</li>
  <li><strong>In the second attempt, we ran out of SSD disk space after ~27 hours</strong>. Notable is that the disk space largely grew towards the end of indexing, similar to when we faced an OOM - it was not a gradual increase over time. For this attempt, we used the excellent <a href="https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/#/">pgtune</a> tool to reduce our first Postgres configuration as follows:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>shared_buffers = 4GB → 2560MB
effective_cache_size = 12GB → 7680MB
maintenance_work_mem = 16GB → 1280MB
default_statistics_target = 100 → 500
work_mem = 5242kB → 16MB
min_wal_size = 50GB → 4GB
max_wal_size = 4GB → 16GB
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 8 → 4
max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 8 → 4
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In our third and final attempt, we cut the dataset in half and indexing succeeded after 22 hours.</strong> In specific, we deleted half of the files in the database (from 19,441,820 files / 178GiB of data to 9,720,910 files / 82 GiB of data.) The Postgres configuration used was the same as in attempt 2.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-memory-usage">Indexing performance: Memory usage</h2>

<p>In our first attempt, we see the reported <code>docker stats</code> memory usage of the container grow up to 12 GiB (chart shows MiB of memory used over time):</p>

<p><img width="981" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107313722-56bbac80-6a50-11eb-94c7-8e13ea095053.png"></p>

<p>In our second and third attempts, we see far less memory usage (~1.6 GiB consistently):</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107314104-350ef500-6a51-11eb-909f-2f1b524d29b2.png"></p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107315387-ce3f0b00-6a53-11eb-886c-410f000f73bd.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-cpu-usage">Indexing performance: CPU usage</h2>

<p>Postgres’ Trigram indexing appears to be mostly single-threaded (at least when indexing <em>a single table</em>, we test multiple tables later.)</p>

<p>In our first attempt, CPU usage for the container did not rise above 156% (one and a half virtual CPU cores):</p>

<p><img width="982" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107313915-cc277d00-6a50-11eb-9282-62159a127966.png"></p>

<p>Our second attempt was around 150-200% CPU usage on average:</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107314168-507a0000-6a51-11eb-8a18-ec18752f7f16.png"></p>

<p>Our third attempt similarly saw an average of 150-200%, but with a brief spike towards the end to ~350% CPU:</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107315239-8324f800-6a53-11eb-9a5b-fcc61d1a7b59.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-disk-io">Indexing performance: Disk IO</h2>

<p>Disk reads/writes during indexing averaged about ~250 MB/s for reads (blue) and writes (red). Native in-software tests show the same Macbook able to achieve read/write speeds of ~860 MB/s with &lt;5% affect on CPU utilization.</p>

<p><small>Addition made Feb 20, 2021:</small> We ran tests using native Postgres as well (instead of in Docker with a bind mount) and found better indexing and query performance, more on this below.</p>

<p><img width="599" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/106507903-ec6f9e80-6488-11eb-88a8-78e5b7aacfd6.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-disk-space">Indexing performance: Disk space</h2>

<p>The database contains 9,720,910 files totalling 82.07 GiB:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>postgres=# select count(filepath) from files;
  count  
---------
 9720910
(1 row)

postgres=# select SUM(octet_length(contents)) from files;
     sum     
-------------
 88123563320
(1 row)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Before indexing</strong>, we find that all of Postgres is consuming 54G:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ du -sh .postgres/
 54G	.postgres/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After <code>CREATE INDEX</code>, Postgres uses:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ du -sh .postgres/
 73G	.postgres/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thus, the index size for 82 GiB of text is 19 GiB (or 23% of the data size.)</p>

<h2 id="database-startup-times">Database startup times</h2>

<p>From an operational standpoint, it is worth noting that if Postgres is starting clean (i.e. previous shutdown was graceful) then startup time is almost instantaneous: it begins accepting connections immediately and loads the index as needed.</p>

<p>However, if Postgres experienced a non-graceful termination during e.g. startup, it can take a hefty ~10 minutes with this dataset to start as it goes through an automated recovery process.</p>

<h2 id="queries-executed">Queries executed</h2>

<p>In total, we executed 19,936 search queries against the index. We chose queries which we expect give reasonably varying amounts of coverage over the trigram index (that is, queries whose trigrams are more or less likely to occur in many files):</p>

<h2 id="query-performance-vs-planning-time">Query performance vs. planning time</h2>

<p>The following scatter plot shows how 79% of queries executed in under 3s (Y axis, in ms), while Postgres’s query planner had planned them for execution in under 100-250ms generally (X axis, in ms):</p>

<p><img width="1252" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848471-ef379100-6db0-11eb-8396-4d156a179aae.png"></p>

<p>If we expand the view to include all queries, we start to get a picture of just how outlier these 21% of queries are (note that the small block of dots in the bottom left represents the same diagram shown above):</p>

<p><img width="1250" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848517-3cb3fe00-6db1-11eb-9652-e65d7d88fe36.png"></p>

<h2 id="query-time-vs-cpu--memory-usage">Query time vs. CPU &amp; Memory usage</h2>

<p>The following image shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(top) Query time in milliseconds</li>
  <li>(middle) CPU usage percentage (e.g. 801% refers to 8 out of 16 virtual CPU cores being consumed)</li>
  <li>(bottom) Memory usage in MiB.</li>
</ul>

<p><img width="1255" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848716-efd12700-6db2-11eb-8e8b-a8141a6bdb0b.png"></p>

<p>Notable insights from this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The large increase in resource usage towards the end is when we began executing queries with no <code>LIMIT</code>.</li>
  <li>CPU usage does not exceed 138%, until the spike at the end.</li>
  <li>Memory usage does not exceed 42 MiB, until the spike at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>We suspect <code>pg_trgm</code> is single-threaded within the scope of a single table, but with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/ddl-partitioning.html">table data partitioning</a> (or splitting data into multiple tables with subsets of the data), we suspect better parallelism could be achieved.</p>

<h2 id="investigating-slow-queries">Investigating slow queries</h2>

<p>If we plot the number of index rechecks (X axis) vs. execution time (Y axis), we can clearly see one of the most significant aspects of slow queries is that they have many more index rechecks:</p>

<p><img width="1036" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107849660-fc0cb280-6db9-11eb-9c10-cb7e74366ab7.png"></p>

<p>And if we look at <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/blob/main/query_logs/query-run-3.log#L3-L24">the <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> output for one of these queries</a> we can also confirm <code>Parallel Bitmap Heap Scan</code> is slow due to <code>Rows Removed by Index Recheck</code>.</p>

<h2 id="table-splitting">Table splitting</h2>

<p>Splitting up the search index into multiple smaller tables seems like an obvious approach to getting <code>pg_trgm</code> to use multiple CPU cores. We tried this by taking the same exact data set and splitting it into 200 tables, and found …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>This is the first post in this blog, it was published on February 19, 2021.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>

<p>The year of 2020 will be remembered for the pandemic, the BLM movement, and the U.S. elections among other billion of things around the globe. It is funny I even mention the third one considering how little I give a damn about U.S. politics, yet this whole story begins with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler">Parler</a> deplatforming that happened about a month ago. Let me remind you: Apple, Google, Amazon, and a few other companies terminated their service to the free speech social network for insufficient moderation effectively destroying the platform in a matter of just a couple of days. What the fuck?</p>

<p>OK, let me be clear with my position: I believe every private company has a right to refuse service to anyone, whether an individual or a business, but I also have my own right to despise them for exercising that. What they did was probably legal, but screw them anyway, they failed us. Regardless what these psychopathic corporations like to tell the public, they are only concerned with maximizing shareholder value, and if there is anything  even remotely resembling an image liability (through pressure by political radicals, cancel culture SJWs, you name it), they will not think twice. What disgusts me the most here is neither greed nor hypocrisy but their unwillingness to grow a pair of balls and stand up for freedom of speech.</p>

<p>You see, freedom of speech and expression must be absolute. You cannot have censorship-resistance with exceptions; otherwise, these exceptions could be used to remove or block anything unwanted, not only offensive. This way, the Chinese cannot access Wikipedia because of what originally started as a counter-terrorism measure, and the Russians cannot access LinkedIn because of what originally started as a children protection measure. We cannot deprive humanity of their freedom just because some small fraction of users might, unfortunately, use that freedom to spread offensive content. In the same way, you do not ban electricity because people get electrocuted.</p>

<p>Let us now switch from corporates to governments. Ooh, wee! Do not even get me started on that. And I am not even talking about cases like Google happily not letting people disable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SafeSearch">SafeSearch</a> in Indonesia because its government knows best, that is just the tip of the iceberg. I am talking about political censorship which includes silencing people with torture, gulags, and bullets. Here is the world map of the freedom of the press status:</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/press-freedom.png" alt="2020 Press Freedom Index"></p>

<p>Just look at this mess. Blue tones mean OK-ish, others not so much. This map is <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NordNordWest">NordNordWest</a>’s work based on the <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking">2020 Press Freedom Index</a> and is distributed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/legalcode">CC BY-SA 3.0 de</a>. Keep in mind population densities, e.g. there are about 90 times more people per unit area living in Vietnam than Australia. I am actually surprised the U.S. did so well in 2020 considering how badly they wanted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Mr. Assange</a> to be extradited and executed.</p>

<p>What would you answer your children if they asked you how in the world North Korea still exists in its current form with 25 million Koreans suffering for over 70 years and no one is doing anything about that? Or how about 28 million people in Venezuela? Or 82 million people in Iran? Giving voice to all whistleblowers and activists, especially the ones risking their lives and freedom in hostile environments is the fundamental goal of Pepe.</p>

<h3 id="darknets">Darknets</h3>

<p>There is already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">Tor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P">I2P</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet">Freenet</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNUnet">GNUnet</a> etc. We can run emails, message boards, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kad_network">Kad</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> on top of them, maybe even use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a> smart contracts for decentralized computing. All the technology is there, why bother with something new? Well, first of all, these are all amazing projects, there is nothing wrong with them. The peculiar thing, however, is none of them except BitTorrent (and perhaps Tor) gained much popularity, neither do we see any readily available censorship-resistant communication platforms. Why is that?</p>

<p>I claim there are 2 main reasons for that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are hard to use. The “Unix is user-friendly, it is just picky about who its friends are.” aphorism still lives in most them: you may need to install a bunch of additional software (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">JVM</a> or shared libraries) potentially dealing with a dependency hell on some platforms; read through sparse documentation and dead forums on optimal network, security, and sharing settings; carefully configure your router, computer, and client; install, study, and configure applications running on top of the darknet, i.e. repeat the steps. The reason why Tor became popular outside of research was not because it was first, but because of the hacky all-in-one Tor Browser Bundle with sane defaults.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They prefer purity to practicality. Instead of concentrating manpower on few specific use cases, most existing tools try to conquer the world: a new internet, interplanetary, infrastructure, an application framework, APIs, a Turing-complete language on the blockchain etc. This is great and all, it is general, conceptual, modular, extensible, and stackable—everything we like—but sometimes overengineering is just overengineering given the goal. And our goal here is not to make a technical revolution, but to help as many people as we can communicate without fear of retribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>BitTorrent evolved into something that is used by 150 million people worldwide, it seamlessly adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_exchange">PEX</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol">µTP</a>, trackerless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme">magnet links</a>, and people do not even know what the hell it all means. Even though proprietary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">Skype</a> thrived very similarly (at least before it was crippled by Microsoft), millions of its users did not even know what peer-to-peer meant, not to mention how it worked under the hood, it just did. These two systems succeeded not because of luck but rather as a result of some excellent product decisions. We need to learn from that and reiterate.</p>

<h2 id="pepe-overview">Pepe overview</h2>

<h3 id="user-level">User level</h3>

<p>For the messaging platform, I chose to use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard">imageboard</a> similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan">4chan</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futaba_Channel">Futaba Channel</a>. While not the most popular type of forum, imageboards are extremely flexible and free of junk like authentication or karma, they promote anonymity in a very practical way, and over 30 million people are already familiar with them. Perhaps, I am not a big fan of their crowded old-school design, but the initial user traction is more important than my sense of beauty, we will refine the looks through time.</p>

<p>That is, the Pepe imageboard is going to be the only application running on top the Pepe darknet, they are in fact inseparable. This way, we can design the network specifically for this one use case. This brings both security and performance benefits. Joining the darknet can be as simple as double clicking the application, and users do not need to install or configure any third-party browsers or proxy servers, they can just go to <a href="http://localhost:8666/">localhost:8666</a> using Chrome, Safari, or whatever they like, and it is going to be safe without any third-party extensions.</p>

<p>Once online, users may browse existing or create new message boards about various topics in any language such as <code>/en/food/</code> or <code>/ja/math/</code>. A board is a collection of threads about something more specific, would it be an idea or a question. A thread has a collection of posts that people send replying to each other. Each post may have one or multiple attachments such as photos, videos, you name it. So that you have an idea of what it looks like, here is a screenshot of a random thread on the 4chan DIY board:</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/4chan-thread.png" alt="4chan thread"></p>

<p>What is fundamentally different with Pepe is moderation. Instead of relying on a centralized entity with a banhammer, each board and thread owner may anonymously moderate their spaces on their own. However, nothing can actually be deleted, it can only be shadowed, and each user decides whether they want to see the light or the full version of the page at any moment in time. People can still reply to shadowed posts inside their own shadowed posts, so no one cannot silence anyone, only maintain order on the light side.</p>

<p>If people are no longer interested in particular threads, they will eventually become forgotten by the network and naturally disappear from their board. But if there is at least one person who is subscribed to or has archived some thread, no one in the world (even Pepe creators) can censor or somehow shut it down without hurting most of the network Pepe is running on top of.</p>

<h3 id="network-level">Network level</h3>

<p>The three biggest problems with 4chan and similar communication platforms are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They use closed source software so no one can tell how secure everything is and what is really going on there.</li>
  <li>They are centralized, i.e. some individual or business owns the servers and fully controls the whole infrastructure.</li>
  <li>They collect lots of metadata including but not limited to “someone with this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a> posted this at this moment in time”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mitigating the first problem is the easiest: just use open-source software whenever possible. Regarding the centralization issue, we could switch to a decentralized solution like BitTorrent (imagine each torrent containing a thread with its posts and attachments), but that itself does not help with privacy, people can still see what others are doing. Similarly, we could tackle the privacy issue with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a> or a darknet like Tor or I2P, but that, contrary to popular belief, does not solve the centralization issue in any way. Clearly, we need the best of the two worlds. Let us fuse them together!</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/pepe-routing.png" alt="Pepe routing"></p>

<p>Here is an very simplified walk through how the network works. Imagine Bob is an undercover journalist who wants to anonymously share his report and Alice is a political activist who is interested in the investigation Bob had been doing. It all starts with Bob announcing he has the report:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Bob joins the network and gathers information about random peers on it through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>. This way, Bob discovers hundreds of participants including X and Y. Similarly, Bob registers himself on the network through the DHT so that others …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<p>Today, we’re changing our name from TransferWise to Wise.</p>
<p>Our customers now need us for more than money transfers. Sending, spending, and receiving money internationally is too expensive, slow, and inconvenient. We’re fixing that for people and businesses.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://transferwise.com/gb/blog/world-meet-wise#transferwise-is-now-wise">skip ahead to see what changes for you</a> (spoiler: not much, right away), but first, let’s go back a bit.</p>
<h2><a href="#a-decade-into-our-mission" id="a-decade-into-our-mission"></a>A decade into our mission</h2>
<p>Ten years ago, Taavet and I set out to fix international money transfers for all of us who’d been overcharged and underserved by banks. We named our idea ‘TransferWise’ — because our early customers were ‘wise’ to know their banks were charging hidden fees in exchange rate markups.</p>
<p>We set ourselves a mission to make money work without borders — to make money move instantly, transparently, conveniently, and — eventually — for free.</p>
<p>Now, we’re a community of 10 million like-minded people and businesses managing money all over the world, saving billions and fighting as hard as ever against hidden fees.</p>
<p>Our multi-currency account and the clever debit card is replacing international banking for many of you. By building this infrastructure for you, we’ve created a platform that more than a dozen banks use today.</p>
<p>You’ve told us for years the problem is bigger than money transfers. Any time money moves into another currency, it’s still a maze of hidden exchange rate markups, high fees, delays, and small print.</p>
<h2><a href="#well-fix-international-banking-together" id="well-fix-international-banking-together"></a>We’ll fix international banking together</h2>
<p>Sending, spending, receiving, and holding money internationally doesn’t work like it should, because the international banking system was built for the past.</p>
<p>For generations, banks have been defined by borders. Traditional bank accounts trap our money in one country, making international lives more difficult and expensive than they need to be. We shouldn’t have to accept this status quo.</p>
<p>Today, we don’t. We’ll fix it with Wise — the world’s most international account. It makes your money borderless — with instant, super-cheap money transfers, a debit card to spend in any currency, account details to get paid in 30+ countries, balances to hold your money safely in 50+ different currencies, multi-currency direct debits, and other revolutionary features.</p>
<h2><a href="#transferwise-is-now-wise" id="transferwise-is-now-wise"></a>TransferWise is now Wise</h2>
<p>Today our name catches up with who we’re already building for — a community of people and businesses with multi-currency lives. Wise is for all of us who live, work, travel, or support family around the world. It’s for those of us who want to cut out the middlemen that hold us back from being truly borderless.</p>
<p>For customers, not too much will change right away. We become “Wise” or “Wise Business” — depending how you use us. You can access your exact same account via <a href="http://wise.com/">wise.com</a>, using your current email and password. You won't need a new account. In a few weeks we will start to redirect transferwise.com to wise.com.</p>
<p>Our logo has changed, and our apps will be renamed. But our icon — the fast flag — remains as a symbol for money without borders. Beyond that, you’ll notice some new colours, words, and designs.</p>
<p>The core experience of using Wise will remain faster, cheaper, and more convenient than anything else. Our mission remains the same. We’re still making — and always will be making — money work without borders.</p>
<p>We’re humbled that 10 million of you already rely on us to help you lead your international lives. We can’t wait to bring the next 100 million of you with us as we continue to build a new, fair, and transparent world of money.</p>
<p>Onwards.</p>

      <p>My February 2021 Apple Fitness challenge is to walk 227km in the month. So I was out late last night closing in on the target when I stopped and looked at the bus timetable sign at a local bus stop.</p>

<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2021/7f4522c3f4.jpg"></p>

<p>That NFC tag piqued my curiosity. I wondered if it worked on iPhone?</p>

<p>So I tapped my iPhone 12 Pro up against the NFC logo and a website hyperlink notification popped up like when you scan a QR code.</p>

<p>And TransLink, the local public transport provider, had neglected to renew the domain name used in the NFC tag.</p>

<p>I now own the <a href="http://transl.in/">transl.in</a> domain name and the people of the Gold Coast now have easy access to my website. 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>As an example, a local bus stop links to <a href="http://transl.in/k_300428">http://transl.in/k_300428</a></p>

However, what if there were languages that were not created to be used? Ones that test the boundaries of programming language design and cause even the most experienced programmers to bang their heads against the wall trying to build a simple program? Enter esoteric programming languages.<h2>What Are Esoteric Programming Languages?</h2> Most programming languages are designed for the purpose of widespread use and productivity. However, Esoteric programming languages (esolang) are a segment of programming languages that are not built for usability, but rather for entertainment, artistic intent, or to prove a concept. The word "esoteric" is <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/esoteric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">derived from the Greek word "esoterikos"</a>, which means “belonging to an inner circle”. Esoteric languages are not intended to be widely understood.<h2>The Purpose of Esoteric Languages</h2> The first-ever esoteric programming language was <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/intercal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INTERCAL</a>. A parody created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Woods_(programmer)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Don Woods</a> and James M. Lyon in 1972 that mimicked popular languages at the time, such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/">COBOL.</a> The idea was later revived in 1993 when Wouter van Oortmerssen designed <a href="http://strlen.com/false-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FALSE</a>. The concept was to build a powerful, tiny implementation (compiler executable of 1024 bytes) programming language with an obfuscated syntax that was disorienting to its users. From here, more recognizable names such as <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainfuck</a> and <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Befunge</a> began to emerge and the concept of esoteric languages began to take shape as a concept.  As previously stated, esoteric languages have four main purposes. To act as a proof of concept, for competitive sport, display an artistic process and simply for entertainment. To better grasp these ideas, let's look into each of them with an example language.<h3>Proof of Concept (Brainfuck)</h3> The first purpose of esoteric languages we are going to look at is proof of concept. A language that was able to present a proof of concept to the computer science community was <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainfuck.</a> A minimalist programming language that contains an astonishing eight characters in total while still proving to be <a href="https://medium.com/@evinsellin/what-exactly-is-turing-completeness-a08cc36b26e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing-complete</a>. The language should not be used for practical projects due to its complexity at scale (as the name suggests). However, it is interesting to see that a programming language can have its utilities with such a small amount of primitives. Here is an example of the language:  <h3>Competitive (Malbolge)</h3> Esoteric languages can also be viewed in a competitive context, such as Malbolge. Languages like Malbolge were created with the sole intent to be exceptionally incomprehensible and difficult to use. Achieved through self-modification, non-intuitive operators and encryption, Malbolge is one of the hardest programming languages to learn. It also very well could be the first of its kind for this purpose in mind. The competition revolving around Malbolge is contained within the premise of the language. That anyone able to make a useful program with Malbolge deserves bragging rights. Here's a sample of how difficult the language is to use.  <h3>Artistic (Shakespeare)</h3> The third purpose of esolang's are for artistic purposes. A popular example of this is the <a href="http://shakespearelang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakespeare language</a>. A unique programming language that is meant to resemble the writing from Shakespearean plays. The language is unique, as it redefines the entire programming paradigm. Instead of focusing on producing an intended result, the goal is to make the code itself look more elegant. If only all our code looked as clean as this!  <h3>Entertainment (COW)</h3> Finally, some esoteric programming languages are simply meant to be entertaining.&nbsp; Such as the <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/COW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COW language by Sean Heber</a>. As a derivative of the Brainfuck language mentioned above, COW only has 12 primitive. All of which are different capitalizations of the word 'moo'. It's hard to imagine why someone would go through so much effort to create this language. In a way, this comical language really does grasp what programming is all about: incredibly frustrating, a little silly and most importantly, fun.  <h2>The Interesting Thing About Esoteric Languages</h2> So that's pretty much all you need to know about esoteric programming languages. In a strange way, they are like the 'conceptual art' of the programming world. Unconventional and weird, but often thought-provoking and fascinating. Esoteric languages break the recycled formula that most conventional languages follow. Making me believe that these languages could one day be the key to new applications of programming.  Although, if nothing else, they are fascinating designs to look at. Which remain untouched over years, without the over looming necessity to stay 'current' like the majority of popular languages today. Allowing them to only become more interesting with age.  You can check out a full list of esoteric programming languages, <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> If you have anything to add, I would love to hear it in the comment section below!

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Say you run an online book store and want to build a data pipeline that figures out who the top-selling authors are. Logically, the input to the pipeline is a log of every individual book purchase on the store for all time, along with details about each book like who authored it. And the output is a list of the top-selling authors per month.</p>

<!-- [image: book purchases + authorship info -> top-selling authors of the month] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>

    </span>
    <figcaption>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The output of this data pipeline is a function of the input. In other words, the output is derived from the input by running the input through the pipeline.</p>

<!-- [image: f(input) -> output] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>
        <img src="https://nchammas.com/assets/images/data-pipeline-materialized-view/f-input-output.png" width="400">
    </span>
    <figcaption>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>This is an important characteristic of the output. As long as the input data and pipeline transformations (i.e. the pipeline code) are preserved, the output can always be recreated. The input data is <em>primary</em>; if lost, it cannot be replaced. The output data, along with any intermediate stages in the pipeline, are <em>derivative</em>; they can always be recreated from the primary data using the pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="the-logical-view">The Logical View</h2>

<p>Let’s represent our hypothetical “Top-Selling Authors” pipeline as a directed graph, where the nodes represent datasets and the edges represent transformations of those datasets. Furthermore, let’s color each dataset in the graph based on whether it’s primary or derivative.</p>

<!-- [image: colored graph of transformations] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>
        <img src="https://nchammas.com/assets/images/data-pipeline-materialized-view/pipeline-graph.png" width="500">
    </span>
    <figcaption>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Most data pipelines, if you zoom out far enough, look something like this. You have some source data; it gets sliced, diced, and combined in various ways to produce some outputs. If someone were to wipe out all the derived data in this pipeline, you’d be able to regenerate it without any data loss. The pipeline could include any number of arbitrary steps, like copying files from an FTP share, or scraping data from a web page. It doesn’t matter as long as the pipeline produces the same output when given the same input.</p>

<p>Any time someone queries the output of the pipeline, it’s logically equivalent to them running the entire pipeline on the source data to get the output they’re looking for. In this way, a pipeline is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/views/views?view=sql-server-ver15">view</a> into the source data.</p>

<h2 id="materializing-the-view">Materializing the View</h2>

<p>Of course, data pipelines don’t work this way in practice. It would be a waste of resources and a long wait for users if every query triggered a series of computations stretching all the way back to the primary data. When you ask for this month’s top-selling authors, you expect a quick response.</p>

<p>Hence, the typical real-world pipeline <em>materializes</em> its output, and often also several of the intermediate datasets required to produce that final output. Materializing a dataset simply means saving it to persistent storage, as opposed to repeatedly computing it on the fly. So when you ask for that list of authors, whatever system answering your query can start from the closest materialized dataset, as opposed to starting at the source or primary data.</p>

<!-- [image: cached nodes in graph colored; key explaining colors; caption] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>
        <img src="https://nchammas.com/assets/images/data-pipeline-materialized-view/pipeline-with-cached-nodes.png" width="500">
    </span>
    <figcaption>
    A query against dataset B only needs to recompute the pipeline starting from A, since A is materialized.
    All derivative datasets, whether materialized or not, can be thrown away and recreated from the primary data.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>So we’ve turned our view into a <em>materialized view</em>. “View” represents the logical transformations expressed in the pipeline. “Materialized” represents the fact that we cache the output of the pipeline, and perhaps also some of the intermediate steps. A complex set of interdependent data pipelines can be conceptualized in this way, as a graph of materialized views.</p>

<p>Note that this concept can be applied very broadly, and not just to what we think of as “normal” data pipelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A traditional web cache alleviates read traffic from the primary database, which is the source of truth. The cache is derivative and can be regenerated from the database at any time. The data in the cache is materialized so that incoming queries do not need to go all the way back to the database to get an answer.</li>
  <li>A build system compiles or assembles source code into artifacts like executables or test reports. The artifacts are derivative, whereas the source code is primary. When you run a program over and over, you reuse the artifacts output by your build system, as opposed to recompiling them from source every time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="updating-a-materialized-view">Updating a Materialized View</h2>

<p>Materializing the output, though a practical necessity for most pipelines, adds an administrative cost. When the source data changes, the materialized views need to be updated. Otherwise, the data you get from the view will be <em>stale</em>.</p>

<!-- [image: highlighted new source row; out-of-date output aggregation] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>To update a materialized view, there are two high-level properties you typically care about: the update <em>trigger</em>, and the update <em>granularity</em>. The former affects the freshness of your output, which impacts end-users of the data, and the latter affects the performance of your update process, which impacts the engineers or operators responsible for that process.</p>

<h3 id="update-trigger">Update Trigger</h3>

<p>The update trigger is the event that prompts a refresh of the materialized view—e.g. by running your pipeline against the latest source data.</p>

<p>That event may be a file landing in a shared drive, or some data arriving on an event stream, or another pipeline completing. For some pipelines, the update trigger may just be a certain time of day, in which case it might be more useful to talk about the update <em>frequency</em> rather than trigger.</p>

<p>A typical batch pipeline, for example, might run on a daily or hourly cadence, whereas a streaming pipeline may run every few seconds or minutes, or whenever a new event is delivered via some sort of event stream. Whenever the pipeline runs, it updates its output, and the whole process can be viewed as a <em>refresh</em> of the materialized view.</p>

<h3 id="update-granularity">Update Granularity</h3>

<p>The update granularity refers to how much of the materialized view needs to be modified to account for the latest changes to the source data.</p>

<p>A common update granularity is the full refresh. No matter how small or large the change to the source data, when the pipeline runs it throws away the entire output table and rebuilds it from scratch.</p>

<p>A more sophisticated pipeline might rebuild only a subset of the table, like a date partition. And an extremely precise pipeline may know how to update exactly the output rows that are impacted by the latest changes to the source data.</p>

<p>The update trigger and granularity are independent. You can have a pipeline that runs every second and does a full refresh of its output, and you can have a pipeline that runs once a day but carefully updates only the rows that it needs to.</p>

<h3 id="typical-examples">Typical Examples</h3>

<p>Let’s explore these two properties a bit using our example pipeline that computes the top-selling authors of the month.</p>

<h4 id="the-daily-batch-update">The Daily Batch Update</h4>

<p>Every night at 1 a.m., an automated process looks for a dump of the latest purchases from the previous day. The dump is a compressed CSV file.</p>

<p>The update process uses this dump to recompute the month’s sales numbers for all authors. It replaces the entire output table with all-new calculations for all authors. Many of the authors’ numbers may not have changed since the last update (because they had no new sales in that time period), but they all get recomputed nonetheless.</p>

<p>This is a very typical example of a batch pipeline. It has a scheduled update trigger at 1 a.m. every night, and an update granularity of the entire output.</p>

<h4 id="the-live-updating-table">The Live-Updating Table</h4>

<p>In this version of our top-selling authors pipeline, individual purchases are streamed in as they happen, via a stream processor like Apache Kafka. Every purchase on this stream triggers an update to the calculation of top-selling authors.</p>

<p>The update process uses each individual purchase to incrementally recompute the sales total for the relevant author. If an author has no new sales over a given span of updates, their sales total is not recomputed (though their rank in the top-selling authors may need to be updated).</p>

<p>This is an example of a precise streaming pipeline. The update trigger is the purchase event that is streamed in, and the update granularity is the sales total for a single author.</p>

<h2 id="the-declarative-data-lake">The Declarative Data Lake</h2>

<p>We previously discussed the idea of conceptualizing your <a href="https://nchammas.com/writing/modern-data-lake-database">data lake as a database</a>. And here we’ve shown how you can conceptualize your data pipelines as materialized views.</p>

<p>But what if we could take this idea further than just as a conceptual tool? What if you could actually implement your data pipelines as a graph of materialized views?</p>

<p>Taken far enough, the promise of such an idea would be to build a <em>declarative data lake</em>, where the code that manages the lake focuses more on defining <em>what</em> the datasets are and less on <em>how</em> to mechanically build or update them.</p>

<p>Two relatively new projects express aspects of this vision in clear but different ways, and they merit some discussion here: <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> and <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dbt-pipelines-as-batch-updated-sql-queries">dbt: Pipelines as Batch-Updated SQL Queries</h3>

<p>The core of <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> is an engine for building <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction#what-makes-dbt-so-powerful">a graph of SQL queries</a>. Parts of any given query can be generated dynamically using a templating language (<a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/using-jinja/">Jinja</a>), and queries can reference other queries.</p>

<p>Every query has a configured materialization strategy, which defines whether the results of the query are generated ahead of time, and if so, how they are stored and updated.</p>

<p>If the results are materialized, they can be updated with a full refresh or <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/configuring-incremental-models/#understanding-incremental-models">incrementally</a>, though there are some restrictions on what kinds of updates can be done incrementally. Updates are typically triggered on a schedule.</p>

<h3 id="materialize-pipelines-as-live-updated-materialized-views">Materialize: Pipelines as Live-Updated Materialized Views</h3>

<p><a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a> is an engine for building live, incrementally updated materialized views from streaming sources like Apache Kafka. A view can reference other live-updated views, as well as fixed tables.</p>

<p>The primary interface for creating these views is plain and elegant: A <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/"><code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW</code></a> SQL statement.</p>

<p>Conceptually, this is roughly the same statement that is available in

			<p>The Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics says that&nbsp;you can have a particle spinning clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time – until you look at it, at which point it definitely becomes one or the other. The theory claims that&nbsp;observing reality fundamentally changes it.</p>
<p>The Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics says that when you observe or interact with a problem in any way, you can be blamed for it. At the very least, you are to blame for not doing <em>more</em>. Even if you don’t make the problem worse, even if you make it slightly better, the ethical burden of the problem falls on you as soon as you observe it. In particular, if you interact with a problem and benefit from it, you are a complete monster. I don’t subscribe to this school of thought, but it seems pretty popular.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2010, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/nyregion/09placebo.html?_r=2&amp;hpAlways=&amp;pagewanted=all">New York randomly chose homeless applicants to participate in its Homebase program</a>, and tracked those who were not allowed into the program as a control group. The program was helping as many people as it could, the only change was explicitly labeling a number of people it wasn’t helping as a “control group”. The response?</p>
<blockquote><p>“They should immediately stop this experiment,” said the Manhattan borough president, <a title="More articles about Scott M. Stringer." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/scott_m_stringer/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Scott M. Stringer</a>. “The city shouldn’t be making guinea pigs out of its most vulnerable.”</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On March 11th, 2012, the vast majority of people did nothing to help homeless people. They were busy doing other things, many of them good and important things, but&nbsp;by and large not improving the well-being of homeless humans in any way. In particular, almost no one was doing anything for the homeless of Austin, Texas. BBH Labs was an exception – they outfitted 13 homeless volunteers with WiFi hotspots and asked them to offer WiFi to SXSW attendees&nbsp;in exchange for donations. In return, they would be paid $20 a day plus whatever attendees gave in donations. Each of these 13 volunteers chose this over all the other things they could have done that day, and benefited from it – not a vast improvement, but significantly more than the 0 improvement that they were getting from most people.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/03/the-damning-backstory-behind-homeless-hotspots-at-sxswi/">response</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p><span tabindex="-1">IT SOUNDS LIKE </span>something out of a <a href="http://nytsxsw.tumblr.com/post/19145988299/getting-a-decent-data-connection-at-sxsw-can-be-a">darkly satirical science-fiction dystopia</a>. But it’s absolutely real — and a completely problematic treatment of a problem that otherwise probably wouldn’t be mentioned in any of the panels at South by Southwest Interactive.</p></blockquote>
<p>There wouldn’t be any scathing editorials if BBH Labs had just chosen to do nothing – but they&nbsp;did something helpful-but-not-maximally-helpful, and thus are open to judgment.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are times when it’s almost impossible to get a taxi – when there’s inclement weather, when a large event is getting out, or when it’s just a very busy day. Uber attempts to solve this problem by introducing surge pricing – charging more when demand outstrips supply. More money means more drivers willing to make the trip, means more rides available. Now instead of having no taxis at all, people can choose between an expensive taxi or no taxi at all – a marginal improvement.&nbsp;Needless to say, Uber has been repeatedly lambasted for doing something instead of leaving the even-worse status quo the way it was.</p>
<hr>
<p>Gender inequality is a persistent, if hard to quantify, problem. <a href="http://blog.jaibot.com/?p=392">Last year I blogged</a> about how amoral agents could save money and drive the wage gap down to 0 by offering slightly less-sexist wages – while including some caveats about how it was probably unrealistic and we wouldn’t see anything like that in reality.&nbsp;So of course <em><strong>less than a week after I wrote that&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/business-it/evan-thornley-causes-stir-with-sexist-comments-at-sunrise-startup-conference-20140922-10kiku.html" target="_blank">Evan Thornley says</a>&nbsp;:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s a great arbitrage there, we would give [women] more responsibility and a greater share of the rewards than they were likely to get anywhere else and that was still often relatively cheap to someone less good of a different gender.”</p>
<p>While Mr Thornley said he wasn’t advocating that the gender pay gap should be perpetuated, he said it provided “an opportunity for forward thinking people”.</p>
<p>A number of online commentators, as well as Australian start-up blogs, have since said Mr Thornley’s comments were sexist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Thornley improved on the status quo – but in the process he interacted the problem and was thus caught up in it. This is a strategy which, if widely embraced, would practically eliminate&nbsp;many forms of wage discrimination overnight simply by harnessing something we have way too much of already: greed. So of course it was denounced.</p>
<hr>
<p>Last year the city of Detroit began to crack down on unpaid water bills, and thousands of poor people suddenly faced the prospect of having their water shut off. The vast majority of people did nothing to help them whatsoever. PETA did offer conditional help: If a family went vegan for 30 days, PETA would pay off their water bill, and throw in a basket of vegan food to boot. This was strictly more helpful than what 99.99999% of humanity was doing for Detroit residents at the time, as it didn’t make anything worse and offered a trade for anyone who valued 30 days of not-being-vegan less than however much they owed on their water bill. For marginally improving he situation instead of ignoring it, they were <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/07/24/3464033/peta-is-the-worst/" target="_blank">denounced as “the worst”</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Peter Singer has a famous thought experiment about a child&nbsp;drowning in a pond. I’ll let <a href="http://www.philosophybro.com/post/120721529553/peter-singers-drowning-child-argument" target="_blank">Philosophy Bro</a> explain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like, let’s say I’m on my way to a bitchin’ party and I’m looking fly as shit and I smell good because <i>you already know</i>, and I’ve got a 30-rack of Natty because I’ll be goddamned if I show up empty-handed to the house I’m about to burn down. Once I get over this bridge, and turn the corner I’ve arrived and so has the party. Except I hear a bunch of splashing and I look over the bridge into the river and – fuck me – there’s a kid flailing around and calling for help, like he’s drowning for some reason instead of handling his shit like an adult.</p>
<p>I should save his life, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes in philosophy we like to ask obvious questions and waggle our eyebrows suggestively, like maybe you don’t exist after all, <i>hmm</i>? but bro, this is not one of those times. I should obviously jump in and SAVE THIS FUCKING CHILD’S LIFE. So I ruin a Polo and I don’t smell good anymore and a couple of the beers explode because I dropped them. Who gives a shit, right? A child was going to die.</p>
<p>…[snip]…</p>
<p>What if I told you that for $5, you could buy a life-saving vaccine for a child? Sure, he’s far away, but we already agreed: who gives a shit, right? It’ll still save his life, and it only costs you not having a fifth drink at the bar on a Thursday. Remember that $300 bar receipt you posted with the caption “just another Thursday night wearing matching plaid with my bros, we’re special and impressive and are the ACTUAL six dudes with the biggest dicks, unlike all you OTHER overconfidences of bros who think that, well guess what, it’s us?” What you were really saying was “I routinely pass up the chance to save two dozen lives with science so that I can black out and pretend that I like myself for a night.” That’s fucked up, bro.</p></blockquote>
<p>The difference is that the drowning child has been definitively noticed, and thus her moral weight bears down on us and we have to save her. But children thousands of miles away? Not noticed!</p>
<p>I think this might be where a lot of the discomfort with talking about things we can do to alleviate suffering comes from. If you implicitly believe in the Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics, then to confront the scope of suffering in the world is to make it your fault, and then if you don’t throw everything you have at the problem you’re as “bad” as PETA or Mr. Thornley or Uber or BBH Labs.</p>
<p>But what if – what if noticing a problem didn’t make it any worse? What if we could act on&nbsp;a problem and not feel horrible for making it just a little better, even if it was an action that benefited ourselves as well? What if we said that in these instances, these groups weren’t evil – it’s okay to notice a problem and only make it a little bit better. If everyone did that, the world would be a vastly better place. If everyone “exploited” opportunities where they could benefit and alleviate people’s suffering at the same time, we’d all be better off.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Today’s the day: We’re very proud to announce <a href="https://trussed.dev/">Trussed</a>®, an open source framework for modern cryptographic applications, which powers the FIDO and PIV authenticators of the Bee firmware on the new Solo V2 security key by SoloKeys.</p><p>It’s written in Rust.</p><p><img src="https://trussed.dev/images/uploads/trussed-square-200.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><p>This announcement will give a high-level overview of the motivation for and design of Trussed. It will be followed soon by a “tutorial” of sorts, walking through an <a href="https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed-totp-pc-tutorial">implementation of TOTP</a> (time-based one-time password, a commonly used second factor authentication method) in minimal form on PC.</p><p>We’re not just announcing, we’re also releasing the source code, dual-licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses, on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/">https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/</a>. This code is still very much a work in progress, and does not yet come with stable functionality or API promises. However, we think the time has come to continue further work in public, so we may learn from the open source community.</p><p>“We” here are not just SoloKeys, but also <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/" title="Nitrokey">Nitrokey</a>, our competitor-slash-collaborator from Germany that has always used SoloKeys firmware in their web authentication products, and will continue to do so. <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/" title="Nitrokey">Nitrokey</a> will have their own announcement on this topic and their further plans for security keys here.</p><p>Together, we loosely build the current “Trussed Alliance” of Trussed implementers, users, and evangelists. We are reachable by several means, for instance via email at <a href="mailto:alliance@trussed.dev">alliance@trussed.dev</a>, by Matrix chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#trussed:matrix.org">#trussed:matrix.org</a>, or async at <a href="https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/discussions">github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/discussions</a>. We are very interested in and open to additional allies. Particularly, at this stage, those with strong (correct) opinions, and the drive to contribute to the implementation :)</p><h3 id="but-what-is-trussed">But what is Trussed?</h3><p>You may be aware of PKCS #11 (<a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-ug/v2.40/pkcs11-ug-v2.40.html">usage guide</a>), which – despite all of its warts – is a standardized, high-level, platform-independent API, enabling software to make use of hardware-backed cryptography. There are other APIs in a similar spirit, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/">WebCrypto</a> by the W3C (with its own warts, and notably relaying JavaScript applications to software implementations of cryptography), or <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec">PARSEC</a> (backed by Arm and Docker, which has a rather more grand scope).</p><p>All of these have in common that applications can outsource their cryptographic needs to a trusted third party implementation through a common API. Secret keys can be generated for various algorithms or mechanisms (symmetric cryptography such as AES, asymmetric cryptography such as P256, Ed25519, X25519, RSA, etc.). The application obtains not the sensitive key material, but instead a handle object, with which it can then perform further operations: sign data, verify signatures, encrypt or decrypt data, etc.</p><p>The core idea of Trussed is this: What if there were similar facilities – without the warts – right inside the firmware of embedded devices?</p><p>Thinking further: What if these were provided by idiomatic, misuse-resistant, best cryptographic practice-following APIs? What if the list of available cryptographic mechanisms, together with their software or hardware implementations, were flexibly configurable at compile time, but came with “batteries included”? What if this “crypto-in-a-box” would be easy to plug into whatever setup one is already using? What if applications, then, could focus on implementing their domain-specific logic and interfaces with the outside world, while taking advantage of <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html">one cryptographic joint, kept well oiled.</a></p><p>And that is exactly what Trussed is!</p><h3 id="portable-trussed-apps">Portable Trussed apps</h3><p>You may see the term “Trussed app”. By this we mean any unit of firmware that uses the Trussed APIs, and otherwise is completely cross-platform (meanwhile, it will be called externally by the runtime/scheduler). To repeat, a Trussed app is called externally, but internally only calls Trussed APIs – this makes it portable to all platforms on which Trussed itself runs on.</p><p>Two prime examples would be the FIDO and PIV authenticator apps by SoloKeys. In the past (with the existing Solo V1 key C firmware), when others wanted to “somehow reuse” app code it didn’t really work – forks happened, or even simple copy-pastes. Similarly, Google’s FIDO2 implementation in <a href="https://github.com/google/OpenSK">OpenSK</a> is tightly coupled to the Tock OS around it, and limited to devices which have Tock OS support.</p><p>By decoupling from runtimes, and making minimal requirements on Trussed platforms, we envision that “Trussed apps” will be shareable between vendors (each adding their own runtime and physical product). That bug fixes and functionality additions can be shared. That alternative implementations of existing applications are possible (e.g., a <a href="https://github.com/dicekeys/seeding-webauthn">DiceKeys</a>-backed FIDO2 app).</p><p>Generally, we would like to open up an ecosystem of “Trussed apps” (WireGuard, password managers, GPG for those that like it, pocket HSMs, etc.), eventually replacing JavaCard and bringing embedded cryptographic firmware to the modern age.</p><h3 id="trussed-components">Trussed Components</h3><p>There are two major components in Trussed, the service, and the clients.</p><p>The service depends on platform resources (storage, entropy, UI facilities), bundles up cryptographic algorithm implementations at compile time, and is then just a beefy component with a “process” method. This method needs to be called by the runtime/scheduler, either regularly, or on-demand via a provided syscall abstraction.</p><p>The service’s storage is partitioned by client, and further by type of object the service is responsible for managing on a client’s behalf: A key store for cryptographic keys, a file store for binary metadata (exposed as a POSIX-ish filesystem interface), and a certificate store.</p><p>The clients correspondingly have APIs (for crypto, file and other needs) to send requests with, for instance a “CryptoClient + P256 + HmacSha256”. Client and service communicate via <a href="https://docs.rs/interchange">interchanges</a>, shared memory areas in which requests and replies are placed. Both the requests and replies are modeled as Rust types, so there is no low-level memory copying and length calculations. Additionally, interchanges serve as a strong demarcation between different privileged executions (such as the secure and nonsecure worlds in ARM TrustZone).</p><h3 id="what-is-trussed-not">What is Trussed not?</h3><p>Trussed intends to be a configurable box you can use with ease in your firmware, but it does not intend to take over your entire platform. It is not an embedded operating system. Trussed does not use the heap, all variables are allocated on the stack. Trussed does not internally use threads in any way, control flow is linear and predictable.</p><p>To create a functional product, besides a Trussed platform, you need to supply:</p><ul><li>runtime/scheduler: with SoloKeys, we use <a href="https://rtic.rs/">RTIC</a> (Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency), which is a thin software wrapper around the Arm Cortex-M NVIC hardware scheduler. Conceivably, something like <a href="https://www.tockos.org/">Tock</a> should work, or threaded scheduling on PC</li><li>interfaces: with SoloKeys, we use <a href="https://docs.rs/usb-device">usb-device</a> as a framework to implement USB classes (CTAPHID, CCID) on top of our <a href="https://github.com/lpc55/lpc55-hal">LPC55 HAL</a> (hardware abstraction layer), and our own NFC device framework</li><li>dispatch: depending on the richness of the runtime, there may be separate need to dispatch between multiple interfaces and multiple applications</li><li>secure manufacturing: Trussed has the concept of “device attestation”, binding a unique identifier for the chip it runs on to private device attestation keys (Ed255 + P256), via a vendor certificate authority. Further it has a concept of “key attestation”, attesting keys on the device as being generated on the device and not being extractable, via the device attestation keys and certificates. While Trussed exposes methods to do this, they rely on preparations that depend on the platform and need to be done in the manufacturing process.</li><li>optionally, a secure signed firmware update procedure: conceivably, Trussed might be used in a custom bootloader, but the compile-time security of Trussed comes from firmware “bundles” being verified by a vendor. There needs to be a way to ensure any changes to the firmware are “atomic” and authorized, replacing the entire bundle of runner + apps + Trussed with a new non-compromised setup (operating on the existing data).</li></ul><h3 id="first-implementation">First Implementation</h3><p>SoloKeys <a href="https://solokeys.com/blogs/news/our-solo-v2-campaign-launches-on-january-26th">will be releasing the first products built with Trussed</a>. Their Solo v2 authenticators are fully open source and designed for enterprise use for FIDO2 and PIV. More applications are to follow, all based on Trussed.</p><p><img src="https://trussed.dev/images/uploads/solov2.png" alt="Solo V2" title="Solo V2"></p><h3 id="what-about-the-trademark">What about the trademark?</h3><p>To conclude, we would like to explain why Trussed sometimes has a registered trademark symbol next to it. First off, as mentioned, the source code itself is permissively dual-licensed. There is no intent for any “open core” kind of license/monetization scheme (some reasoning that resonates is <a href="https://250bpm.com/blog:15/">here</a>). We consider the ideas expressed in Trussed to be public domain, and really just an (ongoing) distillation of best practices.</p><p>However, when a vendor wishes to sell a product, and advertise that it is “Built on Trussed”, has “Trussed® Inside”, or similar (in effect, profit from the trust we will build in Trussed!), we would like to be able to ensure that basic requirements are fulfilled for the platform, applications and product manufacturing chain – this is needed to make a secure product.</p><p>As an example, Trussed ensures keys are kept secret by storing them encrypted-at-rest at all times. It can do so either by using a backing storage that is encrypted by hardware, or adding a software encryption layer itself – one or the other, but it needs to be ensured.</p><p>As another example, Trussed needs a source of entropy. Ideally, a platform has a hardware source, alternatively, the manufacturing process can inject an entropic seed – again, one or the other (or both) need to be ensured.</p><p>To sum up, we hope that you find use for Trussed in your products. The more eyes, the better! If you do use Trussed, we’d like you to advertise that you do. In this case, please contact <a href="mailto:alliance@trussed.dev">alliance@trussed.dev</a> so we can discuss. There is no formal certification process at this point.</p><h3 id="some-more-details-about-portability">Some more details about portability</h3><p>Cryptographic implementations …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Svelte lures developers with the promise of better performance and smaller bundle size than competitors like React. But, since it is new, its eco-system is small. Let's change that!
    </p>
<p>There are many differences between Svelte and React. Svelte is a compiler, while React lives in the browser. Svelte components are written into '.svelte' files, while React uses <code><code>jsx</code></code>/<code><code>tsx</code></code>. React has the virtual DOM while, Svelte doesn't. So, are these frameworks so different, that we have to write every library from scratch?
    </p>
<p>No.
    </p>
<p>I took a React library, which I like, and translated it to Svelte. It is a good excercise to see what the real differences between React and Svelte are, and to see which concepts are related. The library I chose is <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized-auto-sizer"><code><code>react-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code></a>. It has unimpressive 295 stars as a standalone library at github, but it belongs to the <code><code>react-virtualized</code></code> library, which is currently at 21 thousand stars. For comparison, the highest rated Svelte specific library besides Svelte and Sapper is <code><code>svelte-material-ui</code></code> with 1.5k stars. The <code><code>auto-sizer</code></code> allows your component to grow or shrink to the available space on your page.
    </p>
<img alt="An image of a port, with a ship and a crane." title="Port" src="https://gradientdescent.de/images/port.jpg">
<h2 id="PortingAuto-Sizer">Porting Auto-Sizer
    </h2>

<blockquote>
      
    </blockquote>
<p>The library <code><code>react-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code> has only one exported component, so it is quite a low-hanging fruit to port. It is older, so it is implemented as a React class component. React component have more lifecycle methods than in Svelte, so it may be hard or impossible to reproduce the same behavior. In this case it will be no problem.
    </p>

<h3 id="AutoSizercomponent">AutoSizer component
    </h3>

<p>There are only two files of interest in the library. The first file is <code><code>src/vendor/detectElementResize.js</code></code> and it contains only code, that is independent of React. So, I could simply copy it into my project. The other file is <code><code>src/index.js</code></code>. The author used <a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a> for static type checking, so it starts with a lot of type definitions. Other than that, the file just holds the component source code.
    </p>
<p>In the root of my new project <a href="https://github.com/micha-lmxt/svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer"><code><code>svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code></a> I create a file <code><code>AutoSizer.svelte</code></code>.
    </p>
<h4 id="Props">Props
    </h4>

<p>First, in the scripts part I've put all props of the React component, except children and style. Both of these are handled a bit differently in Svelte. Some of the props have a default, so I copied that over:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// react-virtualized-auto-sizer/src/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>AutoSizer</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> React</span><span>.</span><span>PureComponent</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Props</span><span>,</span><span> State</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>static</span><span> defaultProps </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>onResize</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{},</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>disableHeight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>disableWidth</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>style</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>This becomes the following:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let onResize = () =&gt; </span><span>{}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let disableHeight = false;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let disableWidth = false;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let className = "";</span></span>
<span><span>    export let defaultHeight = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let defaultWidth = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let nonce = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    ...</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<h4 id="State">State
    </h4>

<p>The React component defines a state variable and a few class member:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// react-virtualized-auto-sizer/src/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>state</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>defaultHeight</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>defaultWidth</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>  _parentNode</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span>HTMLElement</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>_autoSizer</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span>HTMLElement</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>_detectElementResize</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>DetectElementResize</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>which both become simple state variables in Svelte:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>defaultHeight</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>width</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>defaultWidth</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>_parentNode</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_autoSizer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_detectElementResize</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>

<h4 id="componentDidMountandcomponentWillUnmount">componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
    </h4>

<p>The code from the <code><code>componentDidMount</code></code> and <code><code>componentWillUnmount</code></code> member functions is put into Sveltes <code><code>onMount</code></code> and <code><code>onDestroy</code></code> callbacks respecitvely.
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// react-virtualized-auto-sizer/src/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>componentDidMount</span><span>() </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>nonce</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>      </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>_autoSizer</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>The variable unloading (<code><code>const {nonce}...</code></code>) is deleted and also all <code><code>this</code></code>-s are also removed (thank you vs-code find-and-replace function :) ):
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>onMount</span><span>(</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>if</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>            </span><span>_autoSizer</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<h4 id="_onResize">_onResize

<p>The "<code><code>_onResize = () =&gt; {...</code></code>" member becomes a const function "<code><code>const _onResize = () =&gt; {...</code></code>". Again, props unloading is deleted. The React component uses <code><code>width</code></code> and <code><code>height</code></code> again, so I had to rename the new consts to <code><code>width_</code></code> and <code><code>height_</code></code>. And the <code><code>setState</code></code> part is changed:

    </pre>
<h4 id="render">render
    </h4>

<p>So far, there have been no significant changes. Syntax is a little bit different, but not much. For the <code><code>render</code></code> function we got a little more to do. Let's break this down to four steps.
    </p>
<p>Step 1 - Styling: The React code defines a <code><code>outerStyle</code></code> object
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>() </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>   </span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>outerStyle</span><span>:</span><span> Object </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>overflow</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>visible</span><span>'</span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and in the code the height and the width of this style object can be set to 0. In Svelte, inline styling is not supplied as an object, but as a string. An equivalent implementation is straight forward, but I take a different route here, since Svelte makes it easier to avoid inline styling. I create two boolean variables <code><code>let outerstylewidth = false, outerstyleheight = false</code></code>, which are set to true, when the <code><code>width</code></code> or <code><code>height</code></code> style would have been set to 0 by the React component. Then I add the following style element to the <code><code>.svelte</code></code> file and make the two classes conditional with the <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/classes"><code><code>class:</code></code> directive</a>:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;style&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    div {</span></span>
<span><span>        overflow: visible;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    .outerstylewidth {</span></span>
<span><span>        width:0;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    .outerstyleheight{</span></span>
<span><span>        height:0;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/style&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>&lt;div class={className} class:outerstylewidth class:outerstyleheight bind:this={_autoSizer}&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Step 2 - ref -&gt; bind: I use the The <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/bind-this"><code><code>bind:this</code></code> directive</a> as an exchange for the <code><code>ref</code></code>-logic. Note that this makes the <code><code>_setRef</code></code> member function unecessary.
    </p>

<p>Step 3 - make render code reactive: The logic part of the <code><code>render</code></code> function is marked as reactive, since it is called each time something changes:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>

<p>Typescript declarations make the life of the consumer of the library easier. The types of the React library are stored within the definitelyTyped project <code><code>@types/react-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code>.
    </p>
<p>The React component is changed into a Svelte component:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// @types/react-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.d.ts</span></span>

    </pre>
<h4 id="Howtouseit">How to use it
    </h4>

<p>That's it, the library is ported. You can load the library with
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npm install --save-dev svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>This is how you would use the original in React:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>&lt;AutoSizer&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    {(height,width)=&gt;(</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;div style={{!width!}}&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>      Test</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;/div&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    )}</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/AutoSizer&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and here is the equivalent in Svelte, using the <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/slot-props"><code><code>let:</code></code> directive</a>:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>&lt;AutoSizer let:width={childWidth} let:height={childHeight}&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;div style={"width:"+childWidth+"px;height:"…</span></span></code></p></pre></div></div>

    </span></p><p>One of my favourite programming languages in the last few years has been <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>. While the language has not yet reached its 1.0 version, it has been widely used in production and has a growing ecosystem. Crystal provides an easy setup and allows you to jump straight into developing your own Crystal programs. I’m going to walk you through getting it setup and how you can get started!</p><deckgo-highlight-code crystal="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">puts "Hello World"</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>Crystal is a general purpose, Ruby-inspired compiled programming language, making it extremely fast and easy to program with. The syntax is strongly inspired by Ruby, but also provides static typechecking. Crystal sits somewhere in the top 100 programming languages according to <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE</a>, not widely used but don’t let that put you off!</p><p>I was originally interested in Crystal due to its expressive syntax and the claims on its speed. I am likely in the minority in that I came into Crystal with no prior Ruby experience. Crystal soon became my go-to language for personal programming projects. My project <a href="https://github.com/azula-lang/azula">Azula</a> (WIP programming language) was built entirely in Crystal - a choice a made due to Crystal’s nice macro system and built-in LLVM bindings. Crystal was an excellent choice, allowing rapid development and producing a small binary (1.9mb in Crystal vs 3mb in Go).</p><h3>Shards</h3><p>The Crystal ecosystem is powered by its Shard system. Shards is Crystal’s dependency manager that is usually installed along with Crystal. It aims to allow reproducible installs across platforms by declaring dependencies and their versions. You can read more about Shards <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/the_shards_command/index.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Installing Crystal</h2><p>On Ubuntu, installing Crystal is as easy as running:</p><deckgo-highlight-code bash="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">$ curl -fsSL https://crystal-lang.org/install.sh | sudo bash</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>For other platforms, have a look at the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/install/">Crystal install guide</a>!</p><h2>First Crystal Program</h2><p>Crystal provides a nice scaffolding tool to setup a new project, including a README template, license and gitignore.</p><deckgo-highlight-code bash="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">$ crystal init app myproject</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>If we open up <code>myproject/src/myproject.cr</code>, we can start writing our Crystal program!</p><deckgo-highlight-code crystal="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">def say(message : String)
    puts message
end

say "Hello!"</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>In this example, we create a function called <code>say</code> that accepts a string and passes it to <code>puts</code>. As you can see, almost identical to Ruby except for the typing of the parameter in the function.</p><h2>Project Structure</h2><h3>src</h3><p>Inside the <code>src/</code> directory is where all the Crystal files will go. It can contain subdirectories, allowing you to divide up your code. You can include separate files by using the <code>require</code> keyword.</p><h3>spec</h3><p>The <code>spec/</code> directory is the home for your tests. Using the <code>crystal spec</code> subcommand, we can run all our tests.</p><deckgo-highlight-code crystal="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>
series, I give an accelerated introduction to game development in Unity.
<a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">Subscribers</a> have been following this series over the
past few months, often suggesting areas to cover or elaborate on. A few months
ago, a reader<!-- -->—<!-- -->also a software engineer<!-- -->—<!-- -->reached out to me (lightly
edited, emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p><strong>The biggest unknown for me is: How do I start?</strong> What does the process of
creating a game look like? Should I build the scenes first? Should I design
the gameplay mechanics first? With business software, it’s much more familiar.
It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>While there is no single correct answer, we can still make some distinctions
that can help get us oriented. The answer will also undoubtedly depend on <em>who</em>
is doing the development: an individual, small indie team, or larger studio? If
an individual, the answer will also depend on their primary skillset: a
developer, artist, or designer?</p><p>Here, I’ll give heuristics especially helpful for individual Software Engineers
building a game on their own as a side project, hobby, or proof-of-concept.</p><figure><p><span>

Do you have a sense of what game mechanics
your game will have? Do you know what genre, controls, and themes this game will
have?</p><p>If <em>yes</em>, you’re ready to decide <strong><a href="#start-coding">where to start coding</a></strong>.
Otherwise, you have a few more questions to ask yourself.</p><h3>Do you <em>want</em> to know what you’re building?</h3><p>It’s totally fine not to have a project in mind! Maybe you’re prototyping.
Perhaps you’re throwing a bunch of mini-games on the wall and seeing what
sticks. Or you’re looking for inspiration and trying to implement random
mechanics to see what feels fun.</p><p><strong>If you’re hoping to begin working on a specific, cohesive game</strong>, you will
likely want to know what you’re building. Consider brainstorming and sketching
out an informal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document">game design document</a>.
There are
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=game+design+document+template">plenty of templates</a>
of various levels of detail you could decide to use. Especially as a software
engineer toying with abstract ideas in my brain, I’ll start with a super
high-level GDD, covering the feel, themes, genre, and mechanics of the game I
have in mind. Maybe a few pictures or sketches for inspiration, and that’s it.
The key part of this exercise will be the list of mechanics I’m working on.</p><p><strong>If you want to prototype and experiment</strong>, you should already have a vague
sense of 1-2 mechanics that could be fun: Maybe unusual movement or a different
control scheme. It could be a traditional mechanic that you’re wondering how to
implement. For instance, I might decide to build a 3rd Person character and
camera controller to see the “feel” of it, experiment with it a tiny bit, and do
something smooth and polish that I feel good about. I might end up keeping that
code in my back pocket for later, or I might use play-through sessions with that
controller to move around a scene, add a few assets, and use that as a starting
place to see the “feel” various mechanics and designs.</p><h2 id="start-coding">I know the mechanics I care about. Now what?</h2><figure><p><span>

development. You do that by failing fast and getting feedback early. In game
development, the primary metric for success is a feeling: the game should be
fun. So, when deciding what to start with when working on a game, one good
question to ask is: <em>“How can I see if this game is fun as soon as possible?”</em>
or <em>“How can I implement the ‘fun’ part of the game ASAP?”</em></p><p>One way to do that is to look at a game’s mechanics and implement them in some
order. The advice that resonates with me is implementing game mechanics in order
of what the most <em>“core”</em> mechanic first.</p><figure><p><span>

plane shooting game—as an example. Here’s my attempt at writing its main
mechanics in descending order of importance:</p><ol><li>Movement: Navigate a vertically scrolling world</li><li>Obstacles &amp; Dodging: Player can collide with stationary obstacles and debris</li><li>Shooting: Player can shoot straight ahead to defeat obstacles</li><li>Enemies: Enemies are moving obstacles that can shoot back</li><li>Player Health: A player can take a finite number of hits before losing the
game</li><li>Enemy Health: Some enemies take multiple shots to destroy</li><li>Boosts: The player can pick up boosts that improve health, shooting, etc.</li></ol><p>… and so on.</p><p>If I’m trying to develop <em>1945</em> from scratch, I will implement that list in that
order. The game’s mechanics build on each other, so I can only tell if shooting
is “fun” is if I can move around the screen and if there are obstacles I’m
trying to clear (otherwise, there’s no urgency to just pressing <em>Space</em> and
seeing projectiles coming out of a plane).</p><p>In simpler games, we might order our mechanics so that every new feature adds to
a game’s feel. So, with every new mechanic you add, you can play the game and
tell if it’s adding what you hope for it to add.</p><p>In more complex games, some of the “core” mechanics might be too ‘standard’ to
be “risky” <em>per se</em>, but you’ll still need the core mechanics implemented to
assess how fun the other mechanics are. You might choose to use a simpler
throwaway implementation, like a few lines of input-handling code and Unity’s
<code>CharacterController</code> component. You’ll want your core mechanics just smooth
enough that they don’t ruin the fun of the things you’ll layer on top of it.
Another approach here is to use the asset store. I’ve previously mentioned the
<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/ufps-ultimate-fps-106748?aid=1011leWs6">Ultimate FPS (UFPS)</a>
asset, which you might choose to use when building an FPS game, and move on to
implementing the combat or some more unique (but still “core” feature of the
gameplay first).</p><h2>So I picked a mechanic, but where do I start programming <em>within</em> this mechanic?</h2><p><em>Within</em> a mechanic, your traditional software engineering intuition becomes
helpful. I hope to spend subsequent articles discussing patterns that are
especially helpful in Unity, but here are a few to consider:</p><ul><li>Work within Unity’s Object-Component paradigm. If you’re adding a new
<em>capability</em> to your player, write it as its own component.</li><li><em>Tuning</em> is especially important in game development; representing a
mechanic’s interesting pieces as <em>configurable</em>, <em>serializable</em> data that
can be input to a component will help you playtest and iterate.</li><li>Don’t shy away from using plain-old data objects to represent core concepts
you’re working with. E.g., health, ammo information, or powerups. Make it
serializable if you want it passed around in the editor (or saved to disk
across sessions).</li><li>Where pieces of a concept don’t correspond to a single object in a scene,
consider using Scriptable Objects to do the jobs. Scriptable Objects
introduce many patterns that might help represent what you’re doing.</li></ul><p>A few articles I have already written might prove helpful:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts/">Basic Concepts in Unity for Software Engineers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices/">6 Software Practices to Keep, Shed, and Adopt in Unity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/09/patterns-in-unity-adventure-tutorial/">Making Sense of Patterns in Unity’s Adventure Game Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt5-object-component/">Understanding Unity Engine Objects</a></li></ul><p>You might also take a look at patterns covered in:</p><ul><li><a href="https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects">Three ways to architect your game with ScriptableObjects</a>,

data and abstractions, the reader’s initial comment also becomes the answer:</p><blockquote><p>It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>Beyond learning about useful patterns and abstractions in game development to
make development clearer and cleaner, the real takeaway is to decide <em>what</em> to
work on at a macro-level.</p><h2>How much time should I spend on one mechanic?</h2><p>As you’re developing a mechanic, what’s a good signal you should move on to the
next on your list? Generally, that would be when you’re convinced:</p><ul><li>This mechanic <em>feels fun</em> and <em>adds to the game</em>,</li><li>Your implementation adds <em>just the
<a href="https://www.e4developer.com/2018/11/21/having-just-the-right-amount-of-technical-debt/">right amount</a></em>
of technical debt.</li></ul><p>Traditionally, folks will often say to worry about polish at the later stages of
your development. In his GDC 2016 micro-talk <em>“Pizzazz First, Polish Later”</em>,
Lee Perry makes a distinction in this traditional wisdom.</p><div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8QAVGeEj-U?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div><p>Certain levels of pizzazz might give you a better sense of your mechanic and how
fun it feels. A certain amount of polish or pizzazz can also help you see your
game in a new light and motivate you to keep going.
<a href="https://gameanalytics.com/blog/squeezing-more-juice-out-of-your-game-design/">Juice</a>
is another form of pizzazz; in certain dull moments of your game design, adding
juice might be a low-cost way to get back into the groove of things.</p><p>I hope the conflicting advice shows there isn’t a silver bullet on what to add
when. Rather—as in traditional software development—this choice is about a
series of trade-offs that depend on the developer, the project, and lots more.</p><h2>Are you developing a game or architecting systems?</h2><p>For some software engineers, we’re often drawn to writing code for systems that
seem <em>interesting</em>. Sometimes, I have a game in mind, but <em>really</em>, I’m
interested in implementing a cool inventory system where <em>everything</em> in the
game is an item. It might not be the core mechanic, but it might be the thing I
want to build.</p><p>It’s important to recognize when you’re not building a game but building a
system. If you just quit your job to be a full-time indie gamedev and have a
year of runway before your run out of cash, it is probably a bad idea to start
building a complex inventory system that you don’t even know you’ll need<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
But if you’re programming on the side to flex your game development muscle, then
go right at it.</p><hr><p>I don’t think I’m qualified <em>per se</em> to answer the …</p></div></div>

They usually result from: </p><ol><li>Generating HTML unsafely (parameterizing without encoding correctly).</li><li>Allowing users to edit HTML directly (WYSIWYG editors, for example).</li><li>Allowing users to upload HTML/SVG files and serving those back unsafely.</li><li>Using JavaScript unsafely (passing untrusted data into executable functions/properties).</li><li>Using outdated and vulnerable JavaScript frameworks.</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-prevent-xss-vulnerabilities-"><a href="#how-to-prevent-xss-vulnerabilities-">How to prevent XSS vulnerabilities?</a></h2><p>Follow these steps: </p><ol><li>Generate HTML safely using a templating engine, or use a static JavaScript frontend to avoid HTML generation altogether.</li><li>If you display untrusted HTML content on your website, purify it first and contain it in a sandboxed frame.</li><li>Serve all downloads with a proper Content-Disposition header to prevent user-supplied HTML/SVG from being rendered in your origin.</li><li>Don't pass untrusted data into executable JavaScript functions/properties such as <code>eval</code>, <code>innerHTML</code> or <code>href</code>.</li><li>Use well-known components with a good security history and keep them up to date.</li><li>Implement a proper CSP (Content Security Policy).</li></ol><h2 id="what-is-untrusted-data-"><a href="#what-is-untrusted-data-">What is untrusted data?</a></h2><p>Before we begin, let's quickly touch on this point. For the sake of this article, anything that is not controlled by your web application is untrusted data.</p><p>User input is one clear example. But you should also consider any data retrieved from external sources, even your database or API, as potentially dangerous and render it with proper safety measures.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is that if it's not a static resource, then it's untrusted data, at least on some level.</p><h2 id="why-are-xss-vulnerabilities-nasty-"><a href="#why-are-xss-vulnerabilities-nasty-">Why are XSS vulnerabilities nasty?</a></h2><p>There is sometimes a misconception that XSS vulnerabilities are low severity bugs. They are not. The power to execute JavaScript code on a website in other people's browsers is equivalent to logging in to the hosting server and changing the HTML files for the affected users.</p><p>As such, XSS attacks effectively make the attacker logged in as the target user, with the nasty addition of tricking the user into giving some information (such as their password) to the attacker, perhaps downloading and executing malware on the user's workstation.</p><p>And it's not like XSS vulnerabilities only affect individual users. Stored XSS affects everyone who visits the infected page, and reflected XSS can often <a href="">spread like wildfire</a>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm)" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm)</a>.</p><h2 id="1--avoid-xss-by-generating-html-safely"><a href="#1--avoid-xss-by-generating-html-safely">1. Avoid XSS by generating HTML safely</a></h2><h3 id="a-simple-example"><a href="#a-simple-example">A simple example</a></h3><p>Here is a PHP script that is vulnerable to XSS: </p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;Search results for: "</span> <span>.</span> <span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"&lt;/p&gt;"</span></code></pre><p>It is vulnerable because it generates HTML unsafely. The <code>search</code> parameter is not <em>encoded</em> correctly. An attacker can create a link such as the following, which would execute the attacker's JavaScript code on the website when the target opens it: </p><pre><code>https://www.example.com/?search=<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>alert</span><span>(</span><span>"XSS"</span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>Results in HTML like: </p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Search results for: <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>alert</span><span>(</span><span>"XSS"</span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="the-importance-of-encoding"><a href="#the-importance-of-encoding">The importance of encoding</a></h3><p>So how then can you safely display the value <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS")&lt;/script&gt;</code> in your HTML? The answer is: HTML entity encoding: </p><pre><code> <span>&amp;</span> <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>amp<span>;</span>
 <span>&lt;</span> <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>lt<span>;</span>
 <span>&gt;</span> <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>gt<span>;</span>
 " <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>quot<span>;</span>
 ' <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>#x27<span>;</span></code></pre><p>PHP has a function called <code>htmlspecialchars</code> that performs this operation. So if we change our script a little bit (This is a horrible legacy approach, but it suffices now for demonstration), the resulting HTML will be safe.</p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;Search results for: "</span> <span>.</span> <span>htmlspecialchars</span><span>(</span><span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"&lt;/p&gt;"</span></code></pre><p>Creates: </p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Search results for: <span title="<">&amp;lt;</span>script<span title=">">&amp;gt;</span>alert(<span title="&quot;">&amp;quot;</span>XSS<span title="&quot;">&amp;quot;</span>)<span title="<">&amp;lt;</span>/script<span title=">">&amp;gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="encoding-contexts"><a href="#encoding-contexts">Encoding contexts</a></h3><p>HTML entity encoding is suitable only when you want to put something inside HTML tags or quoted HTML attributes. If your variables go inside JavaScript variables or URL addresses, you need another encoding function to avoid XSS.</p><p>So make sure you are using the proper encoding for the context.</p><h3 id="quotes-"><a href="#quotes-">Quotes!</a></h3><p>Don't forget to quote your HTML attributes and JavaScript variables or no encoding in the world will save you. The following PHP script <em>is</em> vulnerable to XSS because you can enter a value such as: <code>foo onClick=alert(1)</code>.</p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>'&lt;input type="text" value='</span> <span>.</span> <span>htmlspecialchars</span><span>(</span><span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>'&gt;&lt;/input&gt;'</span><span>;</span></code></pre><h3 id="don-t-put-untrusted-data-in-executable-fields"><a href="#don-t-put-untrusted-data-in-executable-fields">Don't put untrusted data in executable fields</a></h3><p>Also, never put untrusted data, encoded or not, within HTML attributes that execute something. These include <code>onClick</code>, <code>onMouseEnter</code> and friends, but also <code>src</code> and <code>href</code> because someone can put <code>javascript:alert("XSS")</code> for the value, and once again, you have an XSS vulnerability.</p><h3 id="scary--isn-t-it--but-don-t-worry-"><a href="#scary--isn-t-it--but-don-t-worry-">Scary, isn't it? But don't worry.</a></h3><p>There are quite a few things that can go wrong, and OWASP has curated a nice list of them here: <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html" target="_blank">Cross-Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet</a></p><p>However, I wouldn't advise you to focus on that too much. After all, are we thrilled with code like this?</p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;Search results for: "</span> <span>.</span> <span>htmlspecialchars</span><span>(</span><span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"&lt;/p&gt;"</span></code></pre><p>No. That isn't very good. Mixing presentation and code is so 90's.</p><pre><code>$ <span>rm</span> legacy.php</code></pre><h3 id="template-engines-to-the-rescue"><a href="#template-engines-to-the-rescue">Template engines to the rescue</a></h3><p>Instead, you should have your controller method somewhere render a template with the data you want to display. In the case of PHP, Twig is a good option. You would have <code>search.html.twig</code> with the following content: </p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Search results for:</span> <span><span><span>{{</span></span><span>search</span><span><span>}}</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>And Twig would automatically encode your <code>search</code> parameter due to the template engine's automatic escaping.</p><ul><li><a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html#output-escaping" target="_blank">https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html#output-escaping</a></li></ul><p>There are good template engines for all programming languages worth their salt. There's Jinja for Python, Thymeleaf for Java, and so on.</p><p>Just note that not all template engines are created equal. Some of them have an excellent and standard way to add HTML attributes, Thymeleaf's <code>th:attr</code> being one of them.</p><p>Then there are others where you have to be careful to quote your attributes.</p><p>And probably none of them will protect you from putting untrusted data into <code>href</code>, <code>src</code>, <code>onclick</code>, etc., so you still have to keep those in mind.</p><h3 id="---or-just-don-t-generate-html-at-all-"><a href="#---or-just-don-t-generate-html-at-all-">...or just don't generate HTML at all!</a></h3><p>Another great way not to deal with XSS when generating HTML is not to generate HTML. You can do this by creating a static HTML/JavaScript frontend and perhaps a backend API. Try <a href="https://www.appsecmonkey.com/blog/xss-attack-and-prevention/NextJS" target="_blank">https://nextjs.org/</a>, perhaps. It's pretty cool!</p><h2 id="2--avoid-xss-by-purifying-and-sandboxing-untrusted-content"><a href="#2--avoid-xss-by-purifying-and-sandboxing-untrusted-content">2. Avoid XSS by purifying and sandboxing untrusted content</a></h2><p>There are scenarios where you might want to render content that you don't fully trust. Maybe you want your users to create HTML in a WYSIWYG editor, or perhaps you want to download an HTML response from a third party and display it to the user.</p><p>Whatever the use case, the solution is the same. Purify and sandbox.</p><h3 id="purify"><a href="#purify">Purify</a></h3><p>Purifying is the act of removing any dangerous parts from an HTML string. You can do this on the client-side with <code>DOMPurify</code> or on the server-side with several tools such as the OWASP <code>Java HTML sanitizer</code> for Java or Mozzila's <code>bleach</code> for Python. Just pick a well-esteemed one.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify" target="_blank">https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify</a></li><li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-java-html-sanitizer/" target="_blank">https://owasp.org/www-project-java-html-sanitizer/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bleach" target="_blank">https://github.com/mozilla/bleach</a></li></ul><h3 id="sandbox"><a href="#sandbox">Sandbox</a></h3><p>Purifying is an excellent first step, but I wouldn't leave my website's security hanging on that alone. Luckily, there is a great control that we can use to display untrusted HTML content. May I present: sandboxed iframes!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp</a></li></ul><p>Sandboxed iframes run by default in their own <em>origin</em>. That is, if anything goes south in the frame, the frame cannot access your website. Also, sandboxed iframes by default prevent script execution and even links. Very useful for our purposes!</p><p>Here is an example of a non-sandboxed frame. If you run it, you should see an <code>alert</code> box with the message <em>evilness</em>.</p><p>Here is another fiddle with the <code>sandbox</code> attribute specified. Notice that this time the script does not get executed.</p><p>Such is the magic of sandboxed frames.</p><h2 id="3--avoid-xss-by-serving-downloads-properly"><a href="#3--avoid-xss-by-serving-downloads-properly">3. Avoid XSS by serving downloads properly</a></h2><p>When you allow users to upload files, there is a risk that they upload a malicious HTML, SVG, or similar file to your server. And suppose the file is then downloadable from your domain, and your web server serves it like any other HTML file. An attacker could upload a file with malicious JavaScript content and redirect unwitting users to the page.</p><p>To prevent this, serve all content that is not supposed to be rendered directly in a web browser with a proper <code>Content-Disposition</code> header. Like so: </p><pre><code><span>Content-Disposition</span><span>:</span> attachment; filename="filename.jpg"</code></pre><p>By specifying <code>attachment</code>, you tell browsers to show the save file dialog.</p><ul><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition</a></li></ul><h2 id="4--avoid-xss-by-using-javascript-safely"><a href="#4--avoid-xss-by-using-javascript-safely">4. Avoid XSS by using JavaScript safely</a></h2><p>Not all XSS vulnerabilities arise from unsafe HTML. Sometimes your JavaScript code can have XSS vulnerabilities in it.</p><p>To get one, all you have to do is pass untrusted data into a function or property that either executes something or changes the HTML, HREF, or SRC of something.</p><p>Here are a couple of examples just so that you get the idea.</p><ol><li>Passing untrusted data to jQuery <code>append</code> (which writes HTML).</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Passing untrusted data to a <code>href</code> attribute. This example demonstrates that not even React applications are safe from XSS if you don't know what you are doing (click the user's homepage link to see).</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Passing untrusted data to <code>eval</code> This is an example of passing untrusted data to a function that executes something. This simple calculator will execute code if you enter values like <code>;alert('xss');</code> into one of the operands.</li></ol><p>There is virtually an infinite list of functions and properties into which you shouldn't pass untrusted data. They include things like <code>innerHTML</code>, <code>outerHTML</code>, <code>setTimeout</code> and so on. And of course, the JavaScript libraries you use will have their own, just like the jQuery example above.</p><p>It's better to be safe than sorry, so check the documentation for the function/property before assigning/appending untrusted data into it.</p><h2 id="5--avoid-xss-by-using-well-known-javascript-libraries-and-keeping-them-up-to-date"><a href="#5--avoid-xss-by-using-well-known-javascript-libraries-and-keeping-them-up-to-date">5.

    <p>If you’re creating technical content in order to teach others, you might be tempted to use words like “easy”, “simple”, or “straightforward” because you want to put the learner at ease. Unfortunately, those words can have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>How “easy” something is depends on the learner’s frame of reference. It’s relative to their existing experiences. When a learner encounters something that they hear is easy, or simple, or straightforward, and they encounter a problem, they tend to internalize it; “This is easy… why am I struggling? I’m not cut out for this!” This cancels out all the good intentions you had.</p>
<p>When I’m editing a document, article, book, or script, I have a list of words and phrases that I try to eliminate right away. I call them “bad words”. Here are some of the words that tend to be demotivational.</p>
<ul>
<li>basically</li>
<li>easy</li>
<li>just</li>
<li>obvious</li>
<li>obviously</li>
<li>straightforward</li>
<li>simple</li>
<li>simply</li>
</ul>
<p>I flag these and remove them, as in most cases they’re not necessary. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply reboot the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remove “Simply” and the sentence loses no meaning and becomes tighter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reboot the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I’ll ask the author to add the context that might be missing. A lot of times, authors are making assumptions about the experience the readers have. Consider this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using Okta is a simple way to add authentication to your app. Just add it to your project. Much easier than writing your own authentication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the documentation for Okta, it’s anything but simple. And you don’t “just” add it to your project. You need an account. You need to create users. You need to import the appropriate libraries, and integrate the code into your codebase.</p>
<p>If you’ve done this a hundred times, you may indeed find this easy. As an author, you have to remember that you’re writing something like this to teach others. You want them to be successful. So you may have to share the details so the learner has the right frame of reference, and can make the call if it’s “easy” for themselves. Consider this version instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okta lets you add authentication to your app instead of writing your own logic, which will be more complicated and more prone to security vulnerabilities. In this tutorial you’ll sign up for an Okta account, obtain the API keys you need, create your users, and integrate Okta’s JavaScript code with your app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This version tells the reader what’s in store, including an explanation as to why Okta is a good choice over writing your own implementation.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s much more text. But readers can skip it. Assume your readers are as smart as you. Give them all the pieces and let them decide what’s easy, and what they can skip.</p>
<p>I suggest adding words like “easy”, “simple”, and others to your text editor’s spelling dictionary as misspelled words so they show up as you’re writing or editing.</p>
<p>You can also install plugins for your editor that focus on improving writing. The <a href="https://github.com/TravisTheTechie/vscode-write-good">write-good</a> plugin for Visual Studio Code is handy, and you can find similar plugins for <a href="https://github.com/davidbeckingsale/writegood.vim">Vim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode">Emacs</a>. These will find some of the words I listed, among other phrases and words that cause your writing to be weaker than it could be. Be warned though; these plugins have opinions of their own, and may ignore some words while flagging others. Tweak them to find what works best for your learners. After all, you’re writing for them, not just for yourself.</p>

             <h2>-1. Overview</h2>
<p> After the prototyping phase of any electronics project, I like to make a "Motherboard" PCB. For this phase I will continue to use breakout boards for all of the individual components, but link them together using a PCB. This allows the PCB design to stay simple and flexible, and makes them easy to hand manufacture them in my workshop. This is a great setup if you want to do a small (10ish) beta run of your project before designing a full product. I have shipped many hardware products using this stage, it's a great way to validate your MVP before putting money into tooling and CM bring up. </p> <p> This tutorial will walk through the process that I follow to create a motherboard. The intended audience is someone who has already wired up a prototype on a breadboard, and wants to get started bundling them together into a motherboard. This will be the guide I wish existed when I got started doing this. </p>

<p> This is just the process I figured out for myself, it's by no means perfect. If you have any feedback or questions about any of this stuff, want a PCB design for your project, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me: mdl0394@gmail.com </p>
<p> This is Part 1 of the guide. In this guide we will go through initial setup, component model sourcing and schematic design. In Part 2 we will go through board layout and ordering PCBs. If you want to be notified when Part 2 comes out, sign up for email notifications, or subscribe to the RSS feed. </p>

        <h2 id="0-before-you-build-a-pcb">0. Before you build a PCB</h2>

<p>Before you build a PCB you should already have all of the breakout boards &amp; devkits you want to use for the project. When designing the motherboard you should already have a good understanding of how the electronics components are wired together, if you donâ€™t itâ€™s easy to make costly mistakes.</p>

<p>For this project I will be using my Caffstat (Hackable Smart Home Thermostat) project. If you are interested in a smart home thermostat feel free to check out that <a href="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/caffstat_beta">project here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7eacc185287abd48aa4bca8d5f02bff250b987d9/def8e/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/untitled.png" alt="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7eacc185287abd48aa4bca8d5f02bff250b987d9/def8e/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/untitled.png">

<p>These 3 images represent the stages of any electronics project: Breadboard -&gt; Project Board -&gt; PCB</p>

<p>This project contains 3 different breakout boards and a few through hole components. The brains of the operation are an ESP32 Devkit, there are breakouts for the Thermostat and Screen, and through hold components for the buttons, resistors, and relays.</p>

<h3 id="01-installing-eagle">0.1 Installing Eagle</h3>

<p>For this tutorial I will we be using Eagle. Itâ€™s got a free tier tool that, and it integrates well into the Autodesk suite. Eagle is free for up to two layer boards, which should be all you need for most electronics projects. The information here will be pretty generally applicable to any tool, although the screenshots will be of eagle specifically.</p>

<p>You can download eagle for free <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview">here</a></p>

<h2 id="1-anatomy-of-a-pcb-design">1. Anatomy of a PCB Design</h2>

<p>A PCB Design contains two main parts, the schematic and the layout. The schematic is an abstract diagram of the connections between components in your project, and the layout is the actual physical layout of those components, and the electrical traces that connect them. The great thing about PCB design software, is that the schematic will be enforced when you are creating the layout, this makes it very straight forward to create the layout after youâ€™ve created the schematic.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%203.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%203.png"></p>

<p>This is the completed schematic for the caffstat project. You can see all of the breakout boards as individual components (red). The connections between them are mostly being managed by net labels to simplify the schematic (more on this later).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%204.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%204.png"></p>

<p>Here is an image of the completed layout. Every component has found a space on the board, and all of the electrical traces have been drawn. Donâ€™t worry if it looks complicated/messy now, when we go step by step it will be very easy to create.</p>

<h2 id="2-finding-or-creating-component-models">2. Finding or Creating Component Models</h2>

<p>Before you can begin drawing a schematic and layout, you need to find or create models for each and every one of your components. A device model contains both a <strong>symbol</strong> for part (goes in the schematic) and a <strong>footprint</strong> of the part (for the layout). I will list out some great resources for finding or creating these here. I can create a full tutorial for creating your own component models if you are interested, let me know at mdl0394@gmail.com</p>

<p>One thing to note is that Eagle comes pre-packaged with a bunch of common components. These are mostly things like standard resistors/capacitors. Itâ€™s worth checking the pre-installed library before spending too much time scouring the internet. The easiest way to check the library is to use the â€œAdd Partâ€� button discussed in section 3.2 of this tutorial.</p>

<h3 id="21-octopart">2.1. Octopart</h3>

<p>The best tool I have found for looking up components and downloading models is <a href="https://octopart.com/">Octopart</a>. Their mission is to provide the best search engine for electronics components. Almost every part can be found in the search engine, I always check here first.</p>

<p>If octopart has the CAD Model for your part, it will appear like this, you want to download the Eagle format, this will download the library that you can install later.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%205.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%205.png"></p>

<h3 id="22-desparate-googling">2.2. Desparate Googling</h3>

<p>I have also found quite a few schematics by just googling the part. It can often be helpful to try different variations on the name, and include the term â€œEagleâ€� or â€œ.lbrâ€� (Eagle library file extension) in your query. If you do find a schematic, make sure you do some measurements (you can do this on the layout of your design) to ensure it matches well with your part (sometimes people upload bad designs, or are modeling something slightly different than yours, you donâ€™t want to order a PCB with bad footprints)</p>

<h3 id="23-installing-a-library">2.3. Installing a library</h3>

<p>Once you have a library itâ€™s easy to install, drag the Library (.lbr) file into the <code>libraries</code> section of the Eagle Control Panel. <strong>Important:</strong> after dragging the lbr file, make sure you right click and hit â€œUseâ€� otherwise you wonâ€™t actually be able to add it to your project. Libraries in use will have a green dot next to them</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%206.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%206.png"></p>

<h3 id="24-creating-your-own-library">2.4. Creating your own Library</h3>

<p>If you fail to find any schematics online (often the case with cheap breakout boards, or with chinese knockoffs) you might have to make your own. Itâ€™s not too hard to make your own models, mostly just a little bit tedious. Creating your own models &amp; libraries is a full tutorial in itself, if I get interest I can put that together, for now I will refer you to the resources I used to learn the process.</p>

<p>A good tutorial on how to make custom eagle components can be found here: <a href="https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/eagle-components/">https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/eagle-components/</a></p>

<h2 id="3-creating-your-schematic">3. Creating your Schematic</h2>

<p>Once you have your components, you can start creating your schematic.</p>

<h3 id="31-basic-project-setup">3.1. Basic Project Setup</h3>

<p>First thing is to make a new Project and new Schematic in eagle. Go into the projects section, right click and hit â€œNew Projectâ€�. Then right click and hit â€œNew Schematicâ€�. Once the schematic opens, you also want to create a layout (Weâ€™ll use this in Step 4). Do this by hitting the â€œGenerate/Switch to Boardâ€� button on the top bar.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6647e677a7889893fc65d08499400076efd2adee/d3801/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/screen_shot_2021-01-18_at_9.26.13_am.png" alt="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6647e677a7889893fc65d08499400076efd2adee/d3801/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/screen_shot_2021-01-18_at_9.26.13_am.png"></p>

<h3 id="32-place-your-components">3.2. Place your components</h3>

<p>Once you have a schematic you need to put all of your part symbols on. The add part button is on the left bar, clicking this will bring up a dialogue that lets you choose a component. If you donâ€™t see a component you installed here, go back to the control panel and make sure you selected â€œUseâ€� on the right click menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%207.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%207.png"></p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%208.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%208.png"></p>

<p>Add all of your components to your schematic. Make sure you give yourself a bunch of room around components to create connections. You should also try to sort the parts in logical groupings, the simpler your schematic, the less likely-hood of bugs.</p>

<p>While placing components there are a few useful tools at your disposal. The Move, Rotate and Copy tools at the top of the left panel are all useful for organizing your schematic. When you want to select an object, the easiest thing to do is to click the + symbol (probably either at the center, or the origin of the part).</p>

<p>Here is what my schematic looks like after I have placed all of my parts.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%209.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%209.png"></p>

<h3 id="33-placing-the-ground-label">3.3. Placing the Ground Label</h3>

<p>The standard for schematics is to use a specialty component to label the shared ground. You can find this by searching â€œgndâ€� in the Add Part menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2010.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2010.png"></p>

<p>I will usually place one of these per component, just off the bottom of the component, and wire them to the ground pin.</p>

<h2 id="34-wiring-using-labels">3.4. Wiring using Labels</h2>

<p>You can directly connect parts together using the â€œNetâ€� tool (Green line) however with more than a few parts, this will very quickly become unmanageable. Instead of doing that, I will show you how to use labels to cleanly connect parts together. Note that for some components I will not use labels for connections, this makes sense for analog circuits, or things like pull down resistors because they can be logically grouped together.</p>

<p>For every node that I want to connect, I will first draw a one or two unit Net. Like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2011.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2011.png"></p>

<p>Then using the â€œNameâ€� tool I will name all of the new nets something that makes them easier to keep track of. To name a net, select the tool, then select the green line for the net, a text dialogue should …</p></div></div></div>

When a domain is configured to receive mails usually a DNS record of the type MX is configured pointing to the host name of the mail server.</p><p>

Notably, according to the respective <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035">RFC 1035</a> the MX record must contain a domain name and may not directly point to an IP address. However some mail servers do configure an IP address. Many mail servers are lenient when it comes to this misconfiguration and will deliver mails nevertheless, so this may stay undetected.</p><p>

I happen to use a mail server that is less forgiving (Courier), and every now and then I cannot send a mail due to this. It’s rare, but it does happen. If your mail server has such a configuration you may not receive some legitimate e-mails.</p><p>

So I’m hoping to raise some awareness and get some of those servers fixed.</p><ul><li>Obviously if you run a mail and DNS server please don’t do this and correctly set your MX records.</li><li>If you do any kind of IT service or consulting that is related to mail and DNS servers this is a good thing to add to your list of things to check regularly (here's a <a href="https://github.com/hannob/ipmx">very simple python script you can use</a>).</li><li>If you run any form of service or tool that checks DNS and mail servers for misconfigurations, please add a check for IP addresses in MX records and warn your users. Unfortunately only few services do this currently (thanks to <a href="https://www.hardenize.com/">Hardenize</a> and <a href="https://intodns.com/">IntoDNS</a> who will warn users about this), and some popular services don’t.</li></ul><p>

I did a quick scan of the Alexa Top 1 Million list. Currently <a href="https://github.com/hannob/ipmx/blob/main/scans/ipmx-2021-02-20.txt">around 0,06 % are affected</a> (if you happen to know someone responsible for a host on this list please consider pointing them to this blogpost).

February 21, 2021 | https://lkesteloot.github.io/alice/alice4/fpga-rasterizer.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lkesteloot.github.io/alice/alice4/fpga-rasterizer.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>The Alice 4 rasterizer is broken into two main parts:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A <a href="https://lkesteloot.github.io/alice/alice4/libgl.html">software library</a> linked with the C application program. The library
                    implements the IrisGL API. It performs transformations, lighting, clipping,
                    and retained mode (display lists). Its output is a list of commands
                    (clear screen, draw triangle, swap buffers, etc.) that it writes to
                    memory outside Linux's range.</li>
                <li>An FPGA configuration that reads these commands from SDRAM and
                    executes them. For triangles it interpolates color (RGB) and depth
                    (Z). The FPGA also scans out the image buffer to the
                    LCD and performs other minor tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Buffers</h2>

            <p>There are three image buffers in shared memory:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A front color buffer, which is displayed to the user via the LCD.
                The scanning is continuous because the LCD has no memory of its own.
                The timing and wire format is similar to VGA.</li>
                <li>A back color buffer, which is being rasterized into.</li>
                <li>A depth buffer, used along with the back buffer during rasterization.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The first two buffers are only virtually “front” and “back”. Those two
            labels switch every frame as the back buffer becomes the new front
            buffer and is shown to the user.</p>

            <h2>Modules</h2>

            <p>The Verilog code is broken into about a dozen modules:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Main: Integrates all the other modules.
                    <ul>
                        <li>soc_instance: Module generated by Qsys to interface with
                            SDRAM and I<sup>2</sup>C.</li>
                        <li>LCD_control: Generates LCD control signals (H-Sync, V-Sync,
                            pixel enable, next frame signal, X coordinate, Y coordinate).
                            This runs at 25&nbsp;MHz (about 50&nbsp;FPS). It could run faster (up to 40&nbsp;MHz)
                            but the board clock is 50&nbsp;MHz, so it was convenient to
                            divide that by two and avoid having asynchronous clocks.</li>
                        <li>LCD_text: Given screen pixel X and Y, returns character X and Y
                            (text column and row) and sub-character X and Y.</li>

            <h2>Memory controller</h2>

            <p>The Altera Cyclone V SoC has a wonderful memory controller for accessing
            the synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM). It has a port for the ARM and six ports
            for the FPGA. Each FPGA port can be configured for input or output, and their
            relative priorities (including the ARM port) can be set. The priorities were
            critical for making sure the front-buffer scan-out was never starved of
            pixels. The SDRAM itself ran so fast (400&nbsp;MHz DDR) that all the ports could
            be active and not stall too often. The ports were set up as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reading the front-buffer for LCD scan-out. This was configured
                to be the highest priority.</li>
                <li>Reading the graphics command buffer.</li>
                <li>Reading the depth buffer for the pixel being rasterized.</li>
                <li>Writing the color of the pixel just rasterized.</li>
                <li>Writing the depth of the pixel just rasterized.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All five ports were hooked up to FIFOs to minimize the effects of
            memory latency.</p>

            <h2>Rasterization</h2>

            <p>Rasterization uses the edge-equation technique. The idea is to test every
            pixel to see whether it's inside the triangle. “Inside” is defined as “on the
            same side of every edge”. Only pixels in the bounding box of the triangle are
            tested. This technique wastes at least 50% of its time on pixels outside the
            triangle, but it's simpler to implement than edge-walkers.</p>

            <p>The state machine in <tt>Rasterizer.v</tt> reads commands from SDRAM
            (indirectly through the FIFO) and executes them. Because the SDRAM interface
            is (logically) 64 bits wide, and each pixel takes 32 bits (8 bits each of
            red, green, and blue, with 8 bits wasted), we always rasterize two pixels
            at a time. At 50&nbsp;MHz, that's 100 million pixels per second, but with (at least)
            half of them wasted, that's at most 50 million drawn pixels per second.</p>

            <p>To minimize SDRAM latency stalls, we use three FIFOs in the rasterization
            process:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The Command FIFO queues the drawing commands so that the
                    state machine need not block too long.</li>
                <li>The Read FIFO queues drawn pixels while we wait for the
                    depth read to return. After determining that a pixel is
                    inside the triangle, we initiate a read of its
                    corresponding depth value (if depth-comparison is enabled
                    for this triangle). This can take some time (tens of clocks) and we don't
                    want to block the rasterizer. Instead, we queue up all the
                    information we have about this pixel (depth memory address,
                    depth value, color memory address, and color) and move on to the
                    next pixel.
                    Another module (<tt>Read_FIFO.v</tt>) waits for the SDRAM read
                    to return. Since SDRAM reads return in the order they were
                    made, the module then gets the next item in our FIFO,
                    compares the depth values, and if the new pixel is closer to
                    the camera than the existing pixel, enqueues the same pixel
                    information into the Write FIFO. (All of this is done two
                    pixels at a time.)</li>
                <li>The Write FIFO queues pixels that must be written back to SDRAM.
                    The pixel's color must be written, and optionally the depth value
                    must be written (if enabled for this triangle). This is a complicated
                    module because we must take into account whether there are pixels
                    in the FIFO to write, whether the depth memory controller is ready
                    to accept another write, and whether the color memory controller is
                    ready to accept another write. See the section “Write FIFO” below
                    for details.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There's very little stalling in this pipeline, so we end up with a
            rasterization rate of about 50 million Gouraud (color-interpolated)
            Z-buffered pixels per second. The triangle overhead lets us do
            almost 2 million (empty) triangles per second. It's hard to compare
            these numbers to
            <a href="http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/gfxtables.html">real SGI machines</a>, 
            but we seem to be matching the performance of machines built in the
            early 1990s.</p>

            <h2>Reciprocal</h2>

            <p>For each triangle, the rasterizer computes its on-screen area, then takes
            the reciprocal of the area. This is necessary for the normalization of
            the barycentric coordinates used to interpolate color and depth.
            <a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation/rasterization-stage">Scratchapixel</a> has a great explanation
            of how this works; scroll down to the “Barycentric Coordinates” section.</p>

            <p>To compute the reciprocal we use the built-in
            <a href="https://www.altera.com/en_US/pdfs/literature/ug/ug_lpm_alt_mfug.pdf"><tt>lpm_divide</tt></a> module:</p>

            <pre>lpm_divide
    #(.LPM_WIDTHN(32),
      .LPM_WIDTHD(32),
      .LPM_NREPRESENTATION("UNSIGNED"),
      .LPM_DREPRESENTATION("SIGNED"),
      .LPM_PIPELINE(6)) area_divider(
        .clock(clock),
        .clken(area_reciprocal_enabled),
        .numer(32'h7FFF_FFFF),
        .denom(tri_area),
        .quotient(tri_area_recip_result)
    );
            </pre>

            <p>The module is configured to have six pipeline stages, which means that
            the result will come out six clocks after the denominator was put in.
            We don't pipeline (overlap) our reciprocals (we only need one per triangle), but our
            state machine must wait six clocks for this result. We found the
            number 6 by trying various values until the compiler stopped complaining
            about timing violations.</p>

            <h2>Write FIFO</h2>

            <p>The Write FIFO, which writes pixel data to the back color buffer and
            to the depth buffer, was one of the most difficult modules to write in
            this project. Conceptually the state machine should perform these
            steps in a loop:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Wait for a new pixel to be available in the Write FIFO.</li>
                <li>Write it to the back color buffer and to the depth buffer.</li>
                <li>Wait for both SDRAM controller ports to acknowledge that they had
                    accepted the writes.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Remember that wherever we talk about “a pixel” here, we mean two

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>This year, 2021, is the 50th anniversary of the first single-chip microprocessor's invention, the Intel 4004. The official birthday of the 4004 was November 15th, 1971, when it was announced to the public. There are other pretenders to the throne, but only the 4004 meets all of the key criteria to be considered the first. I offer multiple ways to become a proud owner of a fully-functional, genuine, new Intel 4004 microprocessor.</p>
<p>I offer two ways to acquire an Intel 4004. The first way is that I incorporate an Intel 4004 chip into an artwork, called a ChipScape. These ChipScape artworks have an image of the tiny 4004 chip itself and have technical information about 4004 and its creation story. I offer different styles to appeal to different interests, price points, and artistic tastes. These make great gifts for anyone who has an interest in computer technology.</p>
<p>The second way is&nbsp;that I offer just the chips. Here you have two choices: the Intel P4004 and the Intel D4004. Both types have the same chip on the inside, but their packaging is different. The P4004 is made from a black plastic resin and is the more "common" version available. Within the P4004, I offer different date codes (when this chip was made, the earlier, the more valuable) and different manufacturing locations (where the chip was made, this is purely a collector preference). The D4004 is made using a gray ceramic package. It was made to be more rugged and is much rarer.</p>
<p>I get lots of questions about the C4004. I don't have any of the C4004s available as chips, just in artworks (only a couple). C4004s are made with white ceramic and gold plated leads and caps. They are rare. Prices for&nbsp;good working versions can range from $1,000 to $5,000.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like most who entered college in the mid-aughts, I was taken by Facebook. It had a sleek interface. All my friends from high school and college were on it, being super cool with edgy profile pics. I browsed my newsfeed everyday — probably for years. But, starting the early 2010s, I noticed an inverse correlation. The more friend requests I received from long lost aunties and uncles, the fewer posts I would see from my peers. It was almost like the aunties and uncles were driving them away.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/post-images/facebook-mom.jpg" alt="Facebook friended by mom" src="https://consult.sauvik.me/assets/post-images/facebook-mom.jpg"></p><p>There’s a concept in social psychology known as an illusory correlation <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Illusory correlations are sort of like stereotypes for relationships between two variables — if enough of a certain type of person does activity X or uses thing Y, then other people start to associate activity X or thing Y as being only for that certain type of person. More concretely, if enough aunties and uncles seem to use Facebook (relative to other demographics), then non-aunties-and-uncles start thinking that Facebook must only be for aunties and uncle. At best, the correlation is silly; at worst, it is pernicious. Whatever it is, its effects are often unconscious and real.</p><p>Now, I want you to close your eyes and think about the first person who comes to mind when you think about the attribute “security conscious” or “concerned about privacy”. Readers of this blog may be biased; but, for many non-experts, the person they think about may look something like this:</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FiVHfwLc.gif&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1" alt="Printer Hacker"></p><p>And therein lies the illusory correlation in consumer security.</p><p>If you’ll allow me a moment to be more formal: early adopters of security and privacy features are usually those who are especially concerned about security and privacy. Perhaps this is because they genuinely have some sensitive information to keep away from prying eyes. Perhaps they are simply risk averse. Whatever the reason, many non-experts describe these early adopters and security experts more generally as “nutty” or “paranoid”. A classic example of this comes from Shirley Gaw and colleagues study on encrypted email usage in the workplace <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. The authors found that if someone used encrypted email but did not have a “good” reason for doing so (e.g., if they were only asking about lunch), they were perceived by their colleagues as being “paranoid.” I found something similar in my own research <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>: experts felt hesitant about sharing security advice with non-experts to avoid being perceived as “nutty”. The upshot? If only “nutty” or “paranoid” people use security features, and <em>I</em> am not nutty or paranoid…well, those security or privacy features must not be for me.</p><p>In short, early adopters of security features may —&nbsp;subtly or overtly — be perceived as paranoid by others; in turn, this stigma can cause non-experts to “disaffiliate” from security. This is what I call the paranoia-disaffiliation hypothesis in end-user security. I call it a hypothesis because it has not been tested it in a randomized, controlled experiment <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>; but, there is a good bit of observational evidence to back it up.</p><p>When I worked at Facebook, for example, I ran an analysis of how one’s friends use of security features like two-factor authentication affected one’s own use of two-factor authentication <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. I found a surprising effect: for the vast majority of people, social influence appeared to have a <em>negative</em> effect on one’s own adoption of two-factor authentication. In other words, for the vast majority of people, the presence of N friends who used two-factor authentication made them less likely to use two-factor authentication than if they had fewer than N friends who used two-factor authentication.</p><p>This is a surprising result. Typically, social “proof” tends to have a positive effect —&nbsp;if more of my friends use X, I should be more likely to use X myself. But, my research suggests that this more “typical” effect of social influence does not come to fruition for typical security tools until many of one’s friends start using security tools (e.g., as demonstrated by the recent WhatsApp exodus to Signal). Social influence for security behaviors is sort of like quantum mechanics in physics: the rules that apply at large scale do not apply at small scale.</p><p>So what can we do? My research suggests that one of the key drivers of the paranoia-disaffiliation hypothesis is the unfounded assumption that only geeks use security features. This image of the shady security geek is pernicious, and has been amplified by popular depictions of “hackers”. We also happen to live in a culture that values openness and transparency —&nbsp;”I’ve Got Nothing to Hide”, tired as it is as an argument against privacy, is seen as a badge of honor. But this notion of privacy and security being only for shady geeks is dangerous, and does more harm than good.</p><p>There is hope, though. My research suggests that the paranoia-disaffiliation hypothesis does <em>not</em> hold for security and privacy systems that are designed to be more social: i.e., those that can be easily observed when used, that involve others in the process of providing security, or that allow us to act in benefit of others. By making security and privacy more social, we start to associate security and privacy with more desirable social properties — e.g., altruism, leadership, and responsibility. And if people stop viewing the security conscious as shady geeks, and start viewing them as altruistic leaders, perhaps we can overcome the paranoia-disaffiliation effect.</p><hr><p>Thanks for reading!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2><p>Reaching decentralized consensus is hard. Really, there must be a reason why Bitcoin network is such an energy-inefficient monster with its Proof-of-Work algorithm. Of course, many other consensus algorithms exist that are not that power-hungry, for example, Proof-of-Stake variations. But they require some sort of centralization, usually hidden under details and complexity. And they still have limits, a boundary on the total number of transactions per second that a network can process.</p><p>I don’t believe it’s possible to find an efficient consensus algorithm, which would be truly decentralized. But why restrict ourselves to just software solutions? Here I want to explain that a super-efficient hardware solution exists. And it’s already within the reach of our current technologies.</p><h2 id="2-the-main-problem">2. The Main Problem</h2><p>What is the root cause of why it’s so hard to achieve a decentralized consensus?</p><p>Well, in the case of cryptocurrencies it’s called <em>double spending</em>. If Clara has 100 coins at some point in time then she can’t spend 200 coins – the network will just ignore such transaction as incorrect. But transferring 100 coins to Alice or 100 coins to Bob are both correct transactions. Yet they are conflicting. If Clara simultaneously commits both these transactions then the network has to decide what to choose as the right one and what to discard.</p><p>Making a decision based on time is not a deterministic way, because some participants can receive one of the conflicting transactions earlier in time, while the others will see a different order.</p><p>Somehow the whole network, i.e. every participant of it, has to decide what to pick as the correct transaction in a way, that will be in agreement with the decisions of every other participant.</p><p>This decision can’t be based on some mathematical function of a transaction (if Clara has enough freedom of composing it). For example, we can’t have a rule where we pick the transaction of 100 coins to Alice as correct because <em>A &lt; B</em>. Because if Clara commits another conflicting transaction of 100 coins to Aaron later in time, then the whole network would have to change its decisions.</p><p>Note that the same problem exists in a broader context, not related to currencies. For example, you can have a blockchain network where users can play chess games. At any moment in time a player has a set of allowable moves. But a player is allowed to choose only one move. If he commits two moves simultaneously, then, again, the network has to decide what to pick as the right one.</p><p>There are many consensus algorithms invented, but they are just ways to centralize a network, where these conflict resolution decisions are made by some selected (or elected) set of participants. In fact, Bitcoin PoW consensus algorithm is a form of election of a participant (miner), whose decision will be set as correct for the whole network.</p><hr><p>So, how can we use hardware to solve this problem?</p><p>Imagine hypothetical hardware that additionally signs Clara’s transactions (via some cryptographic microchips). Moreover, this hardware keeps a counter of Clara’s transactions and <em>attaches</em> this number to a signed transaction. So, the network will see a transaction with its number that has two signatures – the one by Clara’s private key and another one by hardware private key.</p><p>Conflict resolution is trivial in this case. The network will accept a transaction that has a lower counter (it has to be +1 of the previous transaction number).</p><p>The main assumption that we need for network security is that Clara can’t tamper hardware or simulate it in some way. Of course, making tamper-proof hardware is also a hard task, but the technology is almost there. There are a lot of tamper-resistant USB keys that are already on the market.</p><p>Actually, FIDO keys are already satisfying our blockchain needs!</p><h2 id="3-fido-keys">3. FIDO keys</h2><p>FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) is an alliance of the world’s major IT companies. They developed U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) – an open standard of two-factor authentification that uses USB or NFC keys. Luckily, this standard is indeed universal. Even though it was developed as an addition to password authentification in centralized services, we can use it in a blockchain network instead!</p><p>A nice overview of U2F protocol you can see <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Protocol_details/Overview.html">here</a>.</p><p>In particular, look at this diagram</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Protocol_details/auth_flow4.svg" alt="Mobile View"><em>https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Protocol_details/Overview.html</em></p><p>It is supposed that a Relying Party (server) starts second-factor authentification by sending a <em>challenge</em> to a client. But blockchain network has no servers. Instead of a challenge, Clara uses the hash of her transaction, where <em>app_id</em> is just a name of the blockchain network and <em>handle</em> is Clara’s personal public key. Then the U2F device will update the counter and return the signed transaction with the attached counter. This is exactly what we need! Clara then sends this information along with the actual transaction and her own signature to the network.</p><p>To ensure that Clara can’t simulate the device, U2F protocol additionally includes the attestation certificate of the device manufacturer, as explained <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-technotes-the-truth-about-attestation/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="4-typical-usage-scenario">4. Typical usage scenario</h2><p>First of all, a user has to register in the network. To do this, he needs to have FIDO hardware key and to generate his personal private/public keys. The registration is essentially linking personal keys with device keys. For this, an empty challenge can be used in the device signing flow.</p><p>Making transactions was described in the previous section.</p><p>If the device is lost/broken/stolen then the user can register another device with its personal key. Though, in this case, the network should wait for some time, for example, 24 hours, to be sure that the previous device (in a couple with the personal key) is not used anymore.</p><h2 id="5-threats">5. Threats</h2><p>Since every transaction must have two signatures – by device and user, the device alone can’t be used to harm its user.</p><p>But an incorrect or tampered device can be used to submit conflicting transactions to the network (for example, with the same counter). This will split the network if no other consensus algorithm is involved.</p><p>But we can assume that manufacturer has no incentives to make incorrect devices to harm the network.</p><p>So, the only threat is device tampering. Even though modern FIDO keys are tamper-resistant, their security is probably not enough to be used in blockchain networks, because there were no reasons to make them fully tamper-proof in usage with centralized servers. But nearly tamper-proof technology is certainly possible.</p><h2 id="6-super-efficiency">6. (Super) Efficiency</h2><p>As for this blockchain efficiency, it’s certainly unreachable for ordinary blockchains. Because in this architecture, no additional communication to resolve possible conflicts is needed <strong><em>AT ALL</em></strong>. Every possible conflict is resolved immediately in an independent and coherent fashion.</p><h2 id="7-final-words">7. Final Words</h2><p>This is, of course, only a high-level overview of blockchain architecture. A lot of details are skipped. But I hope it can be seen that this architecture is a real solution to a lot of blockchain problems.</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26214175">Discussion</a> on HackerNews.</em></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><small>Unsharpen may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.</small></p><div>

                                
                                <p>The Sharpie S-Gel is a relatively new gel pen that was first released in early 2020. Sharpie, being known for its permanent markers, has produced pens for some time, but those have mostly been fiber-tipped, marker-like pens. These pens, which are essentially just thin Sharpie markers, developed a solid following, they were simply an extension of the Sharpie marker’s popularity.</p>
<p>And then came the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/sharpie-s-gel/">S-Gel</a>.</p>

<h2><span id="S-Gels_Origin">S-Gel’s Origin</span></h2>
<p>The S-Gel is one of a huge number of retractable gel pens, so why was it able to come along and gain such popularity? The pen is sold in normal ink colors (black, blue, red, green, and purple) and a normal set of tip sizes (0.38 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.7 mm, and 1.0 mm / ultra fine, fine, medium, bold). The S-Gel is priced competitively, but isn’t particularly cheap at about 80 cents a pen, depending on the pack you buy.</p>

<h2><span id="S-Gel_Ink">S-Gel Ink</span></h2>
<p>The S-Gel ink offers the smooth writing experience you’d expect from a gel pen, but you’d be hard-pressed to call it extraordinary. Yes, it’s a high performance gel pen, but does it really offer an exceptional writing experience when compared to a <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/zebra-sarasa-grand/">Zebra Sarasa</a> or <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pentel-energel-alloy-gel/">Pentel Energel</a> or any of today’s other best gel pens?</p>
<p>Having used the blue and black gel ink colors extensively in both the standard black model, as well as the metal body executive version and the frosted blue barrel, I can say this is a very good gel pen and one I like using, but it’s not anything that we haven’t seen before. The pens are refillable, but refills aren’t currently available online, making this is a moot point for now.</p>
<p>The ink is quick drying, but not as resistant to smear and bleed through as the Energel. The ink is intensely colored, but doesn’t seem remarkable compared to a Uni-ball Signo. The fine tip is smooth, but not particularly smooth relative to a Jetstream.</p>
<h2><span id="Non-Permanent_Ink">Non-Permanent Ink</span></h2>
<p>The pen has the obvious and someone concerning quality of not using permanent ink. Sharpie is a brand build on permanent ink, so not seeing this in their gel pen is odd. Perhaps the permanence would have needed pigmented ink, which would have meant the pen wouldn’t be the smoothest possible gel pen, but it’s still going to be a surprise for many buyers.</p>
<p>The S-Gel has a contoured rubber grip that is similar to the sneaker grip of the Pilot Acroball. It’s comfortable and it holds up well, despite looking like the sort of grip that will break down over time, and get the shiny, oily feel of disintegrating rubber.</p>
<p>Today the S-Gel is a full pen lineup but at launch, in January 2020, it was just two sizes and two colors. At the same time Sharpie launched a rollerball pen — the Roller Pen — that hasn’t seen anywhere near the same success.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-1024x458.jpg" alt="" width="561" height="251" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-450x201.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-768x343.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-1536x687.jpg 1536w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-2048x915.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px"></a></p>
<h2><span id="So_What_Happened">So What Happened?</span></h2>
<p>So what caused the S-Gel, with its relatively standard black ink and blue ink in 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm sizes to become the most popular Sharpie pen and perhaps the best selling new gel ink pen in years? Online reviews point to appreciate for the pen as a good writer and a useful office pen, but few highlight it as being one of the most exception products of 2020.</p>
<p>The obvious factor we’ve yet to discuss it the strength of the Sharpie brand. Perhaps simply through brand recognition and reach of its distribution network (via its parent company Newell Brands, owners of Waterman, PaperMate, Rotring, and others) the Sharpie S-Gel was able to brute-force its way into strong place in the market for gel ink pens.</p>
<h3><span id="What_About_The_Roller_Pen">What About The Roller Pen?</span></h3>
<p>So why did the same not happen with the Roller Pen? It’s hard to say, but it’s clear from trends of the past 5+ years that the gel pen has been overtaking the rollerball in the US. Customer preference is a strong thing, and the shift to retractable gel pens from capped rollerballs seems to be undeniable. Perhaps larger market forces made the success of the S-Gel likely and the lack of success of the Roller Pen inevitable?</p>
<h3><span id="Playing_The_Game_Well">Playing The Game Well</span></h3>
<p>The Sharpie marketing engine seems to be in full force, with the S-Gel ranking for multiple top spots on Amazon for generic terms like “gel pen” and even winning the top result for “pens.” This is combined with aggressive advertising on Amazon search placements for pen-related terms as well as placement in almost all the big box office stores in the US.</p>
<p>So, yes, the Sharpie S-Gel is a good pen and far be it from us to say it’s not deserving of its success, but seeing one pen explode in popularity while so many other new products remain obscure or see just middling success certainly raised questions with anyone who watches the pen market.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>Yes, it's yet another blog about issues with current technical hiring practices and what I'd like to see. First let's define the current Big Corp Hiring pipeline, which many other companies <a href="https://stevemcconnell.com/articles/cargo-cult-software-engineering/">love to copy</a>. Because we all know if we act like Google, we will be Google.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some sort of phone screen. I imagine this is to confirm you have a pulse, at least bothered to read what the company does, filter people with unpleasant voices, filter people with thick accents (which feels like racism to me), filter people who are too awkward, and other asinine reasons that essentially come down to "gut feeling". Frankly, I don't care if you're any of those things (well, you probably need a pulse, but I'm not a zombiest). I only care that you're pleasant to work with and competent. The great part about this is it's a "skill" hardened interviewers love to say they've "mastered" and they "just know" after a brief conversation with someone. Shockingly enough, these people never seem to self reflect on their accuracy saying "it's too hard to measure". It would actually be fairly easy to measure based on how many people who pass the phone screen ultimately fail the pipeline, or who are hired yet don't perform well, and/or checking where the candidates they didn't let through end up. Measuring would likely reveal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html">fairly poor accuracy</a> and systemic bias, so we'll skip that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A leet code question. This is to verify the person in question can "actually code". Programmers love to think most other programmers can't actually code and are dumb gorillas. What it's really testing is how well you can code while under extreme pressure, and that's <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/">actually very hard to do</a>. It may also be under the guise of "seeing how the candidates think" or "how they explain themselves". Truthfully, I don't care how candidates think, I care about their solution. They should be able to explain their solution, but I could care less if the way they got there is a lesser demon whispering in their ear. Humans are bad at explaining how they discovered a solution to a problem, and when they try to explain, they're likely not explaining how they really solved the problem. What's likely happening is their leet code muscle memory kicked in, and now they have to ad-hoc rationalize some made up explanation. Another thing interviewers love to do is poorly define the problem to make sure you can "gather requirements". If you're not privy to this common haze, of course you're an idiot and a no hire.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat step two a few times. This is to "gather signal". Really, it's to weed out the smart developers who may have had good enough intuition to solve a few leet code questions without grinding them a few hours every night. You don't want developers like that, you want developers who will shut up and do the leet code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A culture fit round! Yep, like the phone screen we can filter out awkward people or people who are the wrong color or gender. A culture fit round gives us a free pass to do this after they've already proven themselves to be technically competent. I don't know about you, but I cannot tell if someone is a "culture fit" or pleasant to work with after a short lunch. Many studies have already shown humans are notoriously bad at judging someone based on first impressions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>tl;dr Hiring software devs is like choosing math professors based on how good they were at Math Olympiad. Clearly there's some correlation, but you'd be throwing away a lot of good professors.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? Here are some options.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Have a public repo and a board of open cases candidates can do. Pay them for their work if you do accept their PR. Give them code review and see how they respond. If you like the work they do, hire them fulltime. This is essentially lightweight contracting. It's representative of their actual skill. The bastardized version of this are 2 to 3 hour long unpaid "take homes" which are then thrown directly into the trash are incredibly disrespectful to the candidates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let the candidate put forth their own work. Let them put forth whatever they want. Ask questions and take context into mind. Clearly a small personal project might not have an entire suite of tests and complicated CI/CD pipeline. Have the candidate do some code review on your own project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Solve a problem together. Yep, solve a problem that you haven't perfectly rehearsed. As a smug interviewer looking to clap down candidates, this is incredibly scary, but representative of how working with a coworker actually is. When you and your coworker collaborate on a real problem, no one knows the answer before hand, you figure it out together. Let them lead, but work together as if this was your real coworker.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It deeply saddens me that the current hiring process is the best we've come up with and we need to do better.</p>

<p>Python will be used to read SMS messages and forward them to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api" target="_blank">Telegram Bot API</a>. Messages will be listened to by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wammu.eu/smsd/" target="_blank">Gammu</a> SMS service and it will trigger the Python script when an SMS message received.  </p>



<h2>Setup</h2>



<p>First of all, we have to enable communication between GSM hat and Raspberry PI Zero, run Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool (raspi-config);</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo raspi-config</code></pre>



<p>Then, follow following actions;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png" alt="" width="743" height="458" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png 990w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-300x185.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px"><figcaption>Go to Interface Options</figcaption></figure></div>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2.png" alt="" width="745" height="457" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2.png 993w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2-300x184.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px"><figcaption>Select and enter P6 Serial Port</figcaption></figure>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png" alt="" width="740" height="458" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png 987w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-300x185.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-768x475.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"><figcaption>Select No at this screen.</figcaption></figure></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png" alt="" width="740" height="459" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png 986w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-300x186.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"><figcaption>Lastly, select Yes at this screen.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Exit configuration tool. Now we need to enable UART on raspberry pi. Shutdown and eject SD card to open in another computer. Open /boot/config.txt file, find the below statement and uncomment it to enable the UART. You can directly append it at the end of the file as well.</p>



<pre><code>enable_uart=1</code></pre>



<p>Now, reboot raspberry pi device and open the console to install Gammu SMS Deamon and Python PiP package installer. </p>



<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip gammu-smsd</code></pre>



<p>Install Telegram Bot API python library.</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo pip install python-telegram-bot==12.3.0</code></pre>



<p><em>Note: Version 12.3.0 is the latest version that is compatible with Python 2.7, if you want to use it with Python 3+ version, you can install the latest available version.</em></p>



<p>Now you need to create a bot in Telegram and obtain a token. Afterwards, start a chat with that bot in your Telegram account and send a test message to your bot. This will help us to identify your chat ID. </p>



<p>Open following URL with you Telegram Bot token and copy the chat ID in the response; </p>



<pre><code>https://api.telegram.org/bot[YOUR-BOT-TOKEN]/getUpdates</code></pre>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="269" height="29" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>This is your chat ID.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Save following script in /home/pi/forward-telegram.py;</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

</code></pre>



<p>Make python file executable</p>



<pre><code>$ chmod +x /home/pi/forward-telegram.py</code></pre>



<p>Update Gammu SMS Deamon’s configuration to use GSM hat. Waveshare uses /dev/ttyS0 for communication. </p>



<pre><code>$ sudo nano /etc/gammu-smsdrc</code></pre>



<p>Find following lines in the configuration file and update with correct values, for me these values are following;</p>



<pre><code>port = /dev/ttyS0
connection = at115200</code></pre>



<p>Also, we need to specify the script path to be ran by Gammu so add following line below [smsd] section;</p>



<pre><code>RunOnReceive = /home/pi/forward-telegram.py</code></pre>



<p>You can find my complete configuration file <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/mtrcn/045d7eeef1e38c092939d5ee87f96fb0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>Restart Gammu SMS service.</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl restart gammu-smsd.service</code></pre>



<p>That’s all! You should now able to get your SMS messages to your Telegram account. </p>



<p>You can monitor Gammu SMS service for any problem with the following command;</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl status gammu-smsd.service</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p><span>EAST WENATCHEE,&nbsp;Washington — Hands on the&nbsp;</span>wheel, eyes squinting against the winter sun, Lauren Miehe eases his Land Rover down the main drag and tells me how he used to spot promising sites to build a bitcoin mine, back in 2013, when he was a freshly arrived techie from Seattle and had just discovered this sleepy rural community.</p>
<p>The attraction then, as now, was the Columbia River, which we can glimpse a few blocks to our left. Bitcoin mining — the complex process in which computers solve a complicated math puzzle to win a stack of virtual currency — uses an inordinate amount of electricity, and thanks to five hydroelectric dams that straddle this stretch of the river, about three hours east of Seattle, miners could buy that power more cheaply here than anywhere else in the nation. Long before locals had even heard the words “cryptocurrency” or “blockchain,” Miehe and his peers realized that this semi-arid agricultural region known as the Mid-Columbia Basin was the best place to mine bitcoin in America — and maybe the world.</p>
<p>The trick, though, was finding a location where you could put all that cheap power to work. You needed an existing building, because in those days, when bitcoin was trading for just a few dollars, no one could afford to build something new. You needed space for a few hundred high-speed computer servers, and also for the heavy-duty cooling system to keep them from melting down as they churned out the trillions of calculations necessary to mine bitcoin. Above all, you needed a location that could handle a lot of electricity — a quarter of a megawatt, maybe, or even a half a megawatt, enough to light up a couple hundred homes.</p>
<p>The best mining sites were the old fruit warehouses — the basin is as famous for its apples as for its megawatts — but those got snapped up early. So Miehe, a tall, gregarious 38-year-old who would go on to set up a string of mines here, learned to look for less obvious solutions. He would roam the side streets and back roads, scanning for defunct businesses that might have once used a lot of power. An old machine shop, say. A closed-down convenience store. Or this: Miehe slows the Land Rover and points to a shuttered carwash sitting forlornly next to a Taco Bell. It has the space, he says. And with the water pumps and heaters, “there’s probably a ton of power distributed not very far from here,” Miehe tells me. “That could be a bitcoin mine.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past two years, the region has taken on the vibe of a boomtown.</p></blockquote>
<p>These days, Miehe says, a serious miner wouldn’t even look at a site like that. As bitcoin’s soaring price has drawn in <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/09/how-bitcoin-works-illustration-infographic-217333" target="_blank">thousands of new players worldwide</a>, the strange math at the heart of this cryptocurrency has grown steadily more complicated. Generating a single bitcoin takes a lot more servers than it used to — and a lot more power. Today, a half-megawatt mine, Miehe says, “is nothing.” The commercial miners now pouring into the valley are building sites with tens of thousands of servers and electrical loads of as much as 30 megawatts, or enough to power a neighborhood of 13,000 homes. And in the arms race that cryptocurrency mining has become, even these operations will soon be considered small-scale. Miehe knows of substantially larger mining projects in the basin backed by out-of-state investors from Wall Street, Europe and Asia whose prospecting strategy, as he puts it, amounts to “running around with a checkbook just trying to get in there and establish scale.”</p>
<p>For years, few residents really grasped how appealing their region was to miners, who mainly did their esoteric calculations quietly tucked away in warehouses and basements. But those days are gone. Over the past two years, and especially during 2017, when the price of a single bitcoin&nbsp;<a href="https://99bitcoins.com/price-chart-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped</a>&nbsp;from $1,000 to more than $19,000, the region has taken on the vibe of a boomtown. Across the three rural counties of the Mid-Columbia Basin — Chelan, Douglas and Grant — orchards and farm fields now share the rolling landscape with mines of every size, from industrial-scale facilities to repurposed warehouses to cargo containers and even backyard sheds. Outsiders are so eager to turn the basin’s power into cryptocurrency that this winter, several would-be miners from Asia flew their private jet into the local airport, took a rental car to one of the local dams, and, according to a utility official, politely informed staff at the dam visitors center, “We want to see the dam master because we want to buy some electricity.”</p>
<p>The Mid-Columbia Basin isn’t the only location where the virtual realm of cryptocurrency is colliding with the real world of megawatts and real estate. In places like China, Venezuela and Iceland, cheap land and even cheaper electricity have resulted in bustling mining hubs. But the basin, by dint of its early start, has emerged as one of the biggest boomtowns. By the end of 2018, according to some estimates, miners here could account for anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of all bitcoin mining in the world, and impressive shares of other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple. And as with any boomtown, that success has created tensions. There have been disputes between miners and locals, bankruptcies and bribery attempts, lawsuits, even a kind of intensifying guerrilla warfare between local utility crews and a shadowy army of bootleg miners who set up their servers in basements and garages and max out the local electrical grids.</p>

<p>More broadly, the region is watching uneasily as one of its biggest natural resources — a gigantic surplus of hydroelectric power — is inhaled by a sector that barely existed five years ago and which is routinely derided as the next dot-com bust, or this century’s version of the Dutch tulip craze, or, as&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;columnist Paul Krugman&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/955107120671797248?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it in January</a>, a Ponzi scheme. Indeed, even as Miehe was demonstrating his prospecting chops, bitcoin’s price was already in a swoon that would touch $5,900 and rekindle widespread doubts about the future of virtual currencies.</p>
<p>For local cryptocurrency enthusiasts, these slings and arrows are all very much worth enduring. They believe not only that cryptocurrency will make them personally very wealthy, but also that this formerly out-of-the-way region has a real shot at becoming a center — and maybe&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>center — of a coming technology revolution, with the well-paid jobs and tech-fueled prosperity that usually flow only to gilded “knowledge” hubs like Seattle and San Francisco. Malachi Salcido, a Wenatchee building contractor who jumped into bitcoin in 2014 and is now one of the basin’s biggest players, puts it in sweeping terms. The basin, he tells me, is “building a platform that the entire world is going to use.”</p>
<p>And squarely between these two competing narratives are the communities of the Mid-Columbia Basin, which find themselves anxiously trying to answer a question that for most of the rest of us is merely an amusing abstraction: Is bitcoin for real?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><b>A few miles from the shuttered carwash</b>, David Carlson stands at the edge of a sprawling construction site and watches workers set the roof on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfrjhflKGzQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giga Pod</a>, a self-contained crypto mine that Carlson designed to be assembled in a matter of weeks. When finished, the prefabricated wood-frame structure, roughly 12 by 48 feet, will be equipped with hundreds of high-speed servers that collectively draw a little over a megawatt of power and, in theory, will be capable of producing around 80 bitcoins a month. Carlson himself won’t be the miner; his company, Giga-Watt, will run the pod as a hosting site for other miners. By summer, Giga-Watt expects to have 24 pods here churning out bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, most of which use the same computing-intensive, cryptographically secured protocol called the blockchain. “We’re right where the rubber hits the road with blockchain,” Carlson shouts as we step inside the project’s first completed pod and stand between the tall rack of toaster-size servers and a bank of roaring cooling fans. The main use of blockchain technology now is to keep a growing electronic ledger of every single bitcoin transaction ever made. But many miners see it as the record-keeping mechanism of the future. “We’re where the blockchain goes from that virtual concept to something that’s real in the world,” says Carlson, “something that somebody had to build and is actually running.”</p>
<p>Granted, all that real-worlding and road-hitting is a little hard to visualize just now. The winter storms that have turned the Cascade Mountains a dazzling white have also turned the construction site into a reddish quagmire that drags at workers and equipment. There have also been permitting snafus, delayed utility hookups, and a lawsuit, recently settled, by impatient investors. But Carlson seems unperturbed. “They are actually making it work,” he told me earlier, referring to the mud-caked workers. “In a normal project, they might just say, ‘Let’s just wait till spring,’” Carlson adds. “But in bitcoin and blockchain, there is no stopping.” Indeed, demand for hosting services in the basin is so high that a desperate miner offered Carlson a Lamborghini if Carlson would bump him to the head of the pod waiting list. “I didn’t take the offer,” Carlson assures me. “And I like Lamborghinis!”</p>
<blockquote><p>Across the expanding bitcoin universe, lots of miners are turning their basements and spare bedrooms into jury-rigged data centers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Carlson has become the face of the Mid-Columbia Basin crypto boom. Articulate, infectiously optimistic, with graying hair and a trim beard, the Microsoft software developer-turned-serial entrepreneur has built a series of mines, made (and lost) several bitcoin fortunes and endured countless setbacks to become one of the region’s largest players. Other local miners credit Carlson for launching the basin’s boom, back in 2012, when he showed …</p></div></div>

		<p>Most of the digital products we use today are designed for our eyes, simply because as highly visual beings, we rely on our sight a lot.</p>

<p>Whether we’re reading microcopy to understand what a button does, or scanning through textual instructions to familiarize with a new machine, interacting with devices using visual cues is what we’re very used to.</p>
<p>But what happens when visual feedback is secondary? How does that change the way we interact with interfaces, and the way they’re designed for us?</p>
<p>Voice User Interfaces (VUI) like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are designed differently from screen-first interfaces for many reasons — the main one being that the principles of spoken communication differ from those of written communication. Because of that, UX designers cannot approach voice-first interfaces the same way they do screen-first interfaces.</p>
<p>How and why should they be done differently? Let’s dive into some of the best practices in voice design.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Practices in Voice Design</strong></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-design/get-started.html">Amazon’s Alexa Design Guide</a>, voice interfaces should be four things — adaptable, personal, relatable, and available. Both Amazon’s guide and <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/df-asdk/design">Google Assistant’s Conversation design guide</a> stress that voice-first skills should be natural and user-centric for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the best practices in designing user experiences for voice user interfaces.</p>
<h3>1. Be Flexible and Receptive</h3>
<p>Language is dynamic. Let’s say a user wants to make a call, they can say <em>“Call X”</em>, <em>“Ring X”</em>, <em>“Get X on the phone”</em>, or a thousand more other variations that can be matched to the same “Call” intent. Your skill must be able to pick up on key details in varied utterances, even if there are multiple embedded in a single answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes, to save time, users may string multiple pieces of information in a single command or response to a question. For example, if one says…</p>
<p><em>“Set a reminder for my interview with Snappymob at 3pm tomorrow.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>…they likely don’t want to repeat any of the information they’ve already mentioned. It’d show a lack of receptiveness to follow the exchange with <em>“What time would you like to set your reminder for?”</em> or <em>“What’s the reminder for?”</em>, because then the user would have to repeat <em>“3pm”</em> or <em>“Interview with Snappymob”</em>.</p>
<p>When your interface is able to pick up on additional information that wasn’t asked for, and fill in the gaps unprompted, you create a more intuitive experience for your users.</p>
<h3>2. Ask Questions, One at a Time</h3>
<p>Simply speaking, users need to know when their cue is. With voice-activated devices, asking questions lets them know when they need to respond.</p>
<p>Phrasing in statements rather than questions, like <em>“Let me know where you would like to go.”</em> instead of <em>“Where would you like to go?”</em> makes it unclear if the user needs to prompt the next activity with an answer.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion on both sides, it’s also standard to ask for one piece of information at a time. For instance, asking a user <em>“What is your new contact’s name, mobile number, and email address?”</em> might cause information overload and make forming an answer difficult. Instead, ask single-answer questions to fill in the blanks one by one.</p>
<h3>3. Present Clear Options</h3>
<p>Unlike visual interfaces, with voice-first, users aren’t choosing from navigation menus they can visually scan through. Hence, it’s important to relay their options in a clear and concise manner. This is where you need to pay attention to language.</p>
<p>Syntax matters especially with distinguishing between either/or questions and yes/no questions. For example, <em>“Would you like twister fries or french fries to go with your meal?”</em> could sound like a yes or no question. Instead, to make the option prompt clearer, it could be phrased like <em>“Which side would you like: Twister fries or french fries?”</em>.</p>
<h3>4. Narrow Down to Only the Necessary</h3>
<p>This applies to both questions and choices. Text can be scanned through, but spoken words take time to relay — so be succinct.</p>
<p>Only ask for confirmation for actions with high importance, like making calls, sending text messages, and any action that involves recipients or monetary transactions.</p>
<p>Asking for unnecessary confirmation or making users reiterate information can easily frustrate them. For example, an <em>“Are you sure” </em>confirmation might not be necessary for simple commands like <em>“Turn off the lights”</em> or <em>“Tell me the current price for Bitcoin”</em>, but necessary for <em>“Send email” </em>and <em>“Call Cindy”</em>.</p>
<p>As for choices, make sure your users aren’t bombarded with ten choices at a time. Remember that unlike text, users can’t scan back and forth to digest a message with speech. Giving them too much information to process at a time will lead to more errors in comprehension and exchange.</p>
<h3>5. Restate Questions</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, on voice-first interfaces, users aren’t relying primarily on a visual navigation menu. So to make sure they know where they are, it’s always helpful to reinstate the questions they answer.</p>
<p>For example, when a user asks for the recipe for spaghetti bolognese, it’s clearer to respond with <em>“To make spaghetti bolognese, the ingredients are…”</em> instead of jumping straight into <em>“The ingredients are…”</em>. A simple restatement reassures the user that they’re getting the answer they’re looking for.</p>
<h3>6. Be Prepared for Blockers</h3>
<p>Being well-prepared includes being prepared for scenarios where things don’t go as planned. Here are some of the most common blockers to think ahead for when designing for voice user interfaces:</p>
<h3><strong>Corrections</strong></h3>
<p>When a VUI gets a piece of information wrong, users will naturally correct it with common phrases like <em>“No, I said-”</em> or a simply a reiteration of their command.</p>
<p>Your interface must be able to pick up on corrections, accept them instantaneously, and restate the command for confirmation.</p>
<h3><strong>Comprehension Failures</strong></h3>
<p>When the VUI fails to understand the user’s command, it’s important to handle the error with grace.</p>
<p>The standard way to approach this is with a statement followed by a repetition of the question, like <em>“Sorry, I didn’t catch that. Who would you like to share this link with?”</em>. This is to make it clear to the user that they should reiterate their answer following the cue.</p>
<h3><strong>Unavailable Functions</strong></h3>
<p>When a user asks for a function that doesn’t exist, instead of using the standard <em>“Sorry, I didn’t get that”</em> response repeatedly, let them know what can be done for them instead to move the conversation forward.</p>
<p>Here’s a scenario — a user says <em>“Cook me spaghetti”</em>. Instead of ending the exchange with “Sorry, I couldn’t understand that”, respond with <em>“I can only help you find recipes for spaghetti. Would you like me to look for the best ones?”.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Non-Responses</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes users forget to answer, or abandon ship halfway through a conversation. Some other times, the VUI doesn’t pick up on the sound input. In situations like these, re-prompts are necessary to give the user another go at answering a question, in case the non-response wasn’t intended.</p>
<p>In the re-prompts, it’s important to restate where they left off, so they know where to pick up. For example, a user doesn’t respond after saying <em>“Set a reminder”</em>. The re-prompt should restate what the user’s intent was, and what they should do next, something like this — <em>“I can help you set a reminder. What would you like to be reminded for?”</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Belief in the context of this article is free of any spiritual or religious meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article's idea is inspired by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Blazor/comments/l89iit/blazor_server_logging_from_service/">reddit thread</a>, I participated. The specific topic is not relevant but the reactions of one group of people, started by the statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making a service static is the worst idea you could've possibly done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612804592/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/discussion-reddit-self-afirming-beliefs_slgdnq.jpg" alt="screenshot of the Reddit discussion"></p>
<p>If someone is asking why to understand a matter, like in this thread, such a response isn't helpful. It is not an explanation; instead, it is a statement of a belief. It is "so" evident (to them) that a proper explanation is not needed anymore.  Others could have demanded a reason, but more remarkable, they kicked off a self-affirmation loop.</p>
<p>It is a behavior that I didn't expect to see in professional-focused discussions, especially not around us developers. I was curious. Is this an exception, or is it a habitual action? I found an overwhelming amount of debates (online and offline) with these recurrent patterns.</p>
<p>But why should we care about it? Why should we care that debates are turning this way?</p>
<p>Why is the presented quota a statement of belief? And why have beliefs an impact on our productivity? One of the text's central argument is that beliefs are a simplification of reality.</p>
<p>They are not inherently bad. The most professional beliefs we have are not something like believing that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-glance-at-rep-marjorie-taylor-greenes-incendiary-words/2021/02/04/b0748070-6745-11eb-bab8-707f8769d785_story.html#google_ads_iframe_/701/wpni.politics_4:%7E:text=SPACE%20LASERS">a secret Jewish space laser silence the advocates for functional programming</a>, and hence, it not a mainstream thing. Our professional beliefs are definitely not as deranged, although the impacts of beliefs in software development are severe too.  On the individual level, the person is missing a learning opportunity and hence facing a productivity loss. That is an argument we examine in this article. However, this personal effect is accelerated by peer dynamic, resulting in teams or even organizational level to a denial of facts. One of the multiple reasons the solar wind hack has been possible was <a href="https://thenewstack.io/solarwinds-the-worlds-biggest-security-failure-and-open-sources-better-answer/#13865249:%7E:text=Ironically%2C%20SolarWinds%20claimed%20open%20source%20software,can%20infect%20it%20with%20malicious%20code">the belief that security through obscurity works and open discussion about security hinders a successful implementation</a>.</p>
<p>It is a long path to understand the effects of beliefs on your productivity, but it's worth it. Being open to new ideas is one of the best ways to have sustainable productivity: once that is stable today and tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Beliefs as a simplification of a complex reality</h2>
<p>Metaphysics is a branch inside the philosophy that developed concepts around reality. As with many other social sciences, there are conflicting points of view, heated debates, and sometimes delicious humor around reality.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612804930/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/meme-tree-falls-in-forest_mftuft.jpg" alt="Meme about a tree is falling in the forest"></p>
<p>That people can live in different realities doesn't only become evident after the US 2020 election but also for people living with others suffering from mental illnesses like schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Reality is the objective truth of things, in all of its complexity and known and unknown relationships.  Reality doesn't need to be recognized to exist. For instance, the electric current is real (and measurable), whether you choose to plug in your device or not. Deregulating banks and the finance sector to create wealth for everyone is not reality because its sole existence is based on humans' minds choosing to follow this narrative. It wouldn't exist if humans didn't exist.</p>
<p>However, based on our limited sensory and intellectual capacity, we, as humans, can only perceive a fraction of reality at a time. We experience reality, and this experience is subjective. Very often, humans confuse this experience with reality itself.  As mentioned earlier, some mental illnesses prove that point. Patients see things we don't recognize. They hear voices we can't listen to. For them, what they experienced is real.  Thoughts of deep trauma can be experienced as authentic now, even if the occurrence lies years in the past.</p>
<p>Multiple past experiences are combined - sometimes more melted -  into a theory. A theory is an explanation of <em>how reality is</em> in a particular circumstance. Theories are the foundation for <em>judgments</em>. Judgment is the anticipation of a theory coming true. If judgments have been proven "right" enough times, they become a <strong>belief</strong>.</p>
<p>Toddlers are representing excellent examples of incorporating multiple experiences into a theory. Imagine a scenario where various toys have been given to a kid. Let's say green and red ones. The red toys make sounds and the green ones don't. After a couple of tries, their brains combine the experience of reality (red) with another experience of reality (make sounds when shaking) and create the theory that red toys make sounds. After enough tries, they started the judgment that they need to interact with red ones if they want to hear a sound.  If more toys with different colors are added and don't make a sound, the toddler created a belief: Only red toys make a sound.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612804959/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/kids-believes-only-red-toys-make-a-sound_uzoo8n.jpg" alt="After trying different toys, a child creates the belief that red toys make a sound"></p>
<p>With our experience (because we experience many contradicting examples), we can easily see that there is no correlation between the color of a toy and its ability to make a sound. But for them, this belief drives their behavior.</p>
<p>Beliefs are a necessity. Without beliefs, we would be overwhelmed with the infinite complexity of reality. Literally, we couldn't survive a day. Going back to the toddler example and imagine a situation where there are multiple toys, and the toddler wants to hear a sound. Believing (as a result of experience) that red toys make a sound is incredibly beneficial in this circumstance because they can "safely" ignore all other toys.</p>
<p><strong>Beliefs are a simplifications of reality, a model, and not reality itself.</strong></p>
<p>Based on that, we can visualize a reality funnel. Each level is a simplification of the class before.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612805033/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/the-belief-funnel_anvasy.jpg" alt="The reality funnel as a filter system to handle the infinity complexity of reality"></p>
<h2>Software development is complex enough so that an individual is unable to know the system entirely</h2>
<p>While the section before talked about reality as the foundation, I want to show that the same mechanism applies to non-natural systems too. Modern software development (maybe starting 20 years back) is so complex that it can't be understood fully. You can't possibly know all the implications of your source code or knowing all the side effects. It is not as complex as reality itself, but in its whole, it is unknowable.  I want to call this a <strong>meta-reality</strong>.</p>
<p>Indeed, most of the time, we experience this meta-reality not using our senses but through a thought based feedback process. It can be a debugger, indicated which control path a program goes. It can be logging at a console or LEDs turning on and off.  My personal best example is creating a layout in HTML with Bootstrap, something I haven't understood fully. Usually, I apply classes to certain elements and hope that they arrange in a way I want them to.</p>
<p>These examples have in common that we create an input (our source code) and experience the result. Based on that experience, we make a theory about how the meta-reality works. Because we can't easily sense this kind of reality, the experience (or should I say beliefs) of other individuals become more vital in the construction of our theories, judgments, and beliefs.</p>
<p>For instance - before we have even experience with classes - we can just by reading, listening, and watching incorporate the theory that classes are beneficial to structure code and separating concerns. The massive amount of different available sources give their theory the needed credibility to evolve into a judgment. It is important to note that this judgment could be created before you write your code for the first time. In the end, the belief that classes are the only way to structure your code is created.</p>
<p>In the meta-reality, beliefs have the same function: Reducing complexity and make choices easier. Instead of thinking about the best approach to structure code, the belief kicks in, and you choose classes within seconds. (This leads to the next belief about finding the perfect name. :wink: )</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612805207/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/classes-as-the-best-way-to-structure-code_dbs2u7.png" alt="Based on beliefs, classes are the only option to structure source code"></p>
<h2>Once created, a belief can stick for a long time</h2>
<p>Creating a belief is a thought and input-intensive process. Once created, most persons tend to protect their investment and shield their beliefs from contradicting experiences. Either they don't pay attention to new experiences by trying out different ways, or they don't listen to people with conflicting opinions. The situation is worsening, with our human tendency to group with people having the same beliefs. Once we are a member of a group, we protect the group. Regarding beliefs, this tendency can create the self-assuring loops seen in the Reddit thread (and so much more).</p>
<p>Another approach to structure code is functional programming. I'm not advocating for one over the other. You can hardly find people that are doing (and enjoying) both: functional and object-orientated programming. Object orientation is widely mainstream. So programmers feel less concerned in paying attention to non OOP approaches. While functional programmers, a minority, need to stick together even more. So evidence that OOP could be beneficial, at least in some cases, are dropped. In the end, you have to pick a side: Either you doing OOP or functional programming. But isn't that too simple?</p>
<h2>Sticking to beliefs drops long term productivity</h2>
<p>In reality - likewise in meta-reality - change is constant. In reality, though, it is easier to sense it. Hence contradicting experiences can more quickly emerge and lead to a shift in a theory, judgment, and eventually belief.</p>
<p>I'd argue that since (western) nations experience climate change in their daily lives more severely (new experience), it changes the way they experience reality. This alteration leads to hopefully and eventually new beliefs. Using fossil fuels has a severe downside and is not an investment option for the future, which is now a common belief in society.</p>
<p>The sensing in the meta-reality is much, much more complicated. There are incidents so evident that ignoring is practically impossible, like broken builds due to now obsolete calls to APIs. The relationship between cause and effect can easily be spotted, which shortened the feedback loop tremendously. It …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="h-introduction">Introduction</h2>



<p>In our <a href="https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/releases/tag/v0.30.0">recent version of lakeFS</a>, we switched to base <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1jzD7-jun-tdU5BGapmnMBe9ovSzBvTNjXCcVztV07A4/edit">metadata storage on immutable files stored on S3</a> and other common object stores.&nbsp; Our design is inspired by Git, but for object stores rather than filesystems, and with (much) larger repositories holding machine-generated commits. The design document is informative but by nature omits much of the reasoning behind it.&nbsp; This is (hopefully) the first in a series of posts that dive deeply into the details and rationale behind it.&nbsp; It discusses <em>why</em> the graveler 2-level storage design is useful for the immutable key-value store needed, and <em>how</em> we benchmarked in order to choose its parameters to get good caching of data from S3.&nbsp; Future posts will discuss why we specifically chose the <a href="https://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB SSTable file <em>format</em></a> and its <em>implementation</em> using the <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble/">Pebble SSTable library from CockroachDB</a>.</p>



<p>The new design for committed storage, in brief:</p>



<ul><li>A <em>commit</em> combines some commit metadata with a list of all its stored named objects.</li><li>This list is stored in an immutable key-value format termed <em>graveler</em>.</li><li>A <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzD7-jun-tdU5BGapmnMBe9ovSzBvTNjXCcVztV07A4/edit#bookmark=id.nvxia26m6klf"><em>graveler</em> key-value store</a> is an SSTable mapping keys (lakeFS pathnames) to values (object S3 URLs with some per-object metadata).</li><li>This SSTable is split across multiple S3 objects, each holding a <em>range</em> — an SSTable of contiguous key-value pairs.</li><li>Each range has an ID, and the list of ranges is stored in a <em>metarange</em> — an SSTable of IDs of range, keyed by that last key in each range.</li></ul>



<p>In essence this is a B+Tree of height 2.</p>

<p>We think this is a great top-level design!&nbsp; It…</p>



<ul><li>transfers a successful architecture for solving a similar problem (git) to our domain;</li><li>arranges standard building blocks, such as SSTables and object-store objects, in well-understood patterns;</li><li> uses immutability to allow for reproducibility and concurrency.</li></ul>



<p>But it has many knobs, and it leaves many low-level decisions open.</p>



<h2>Outline of graveler</h2>



<p>We store committed data in <em>graveler</em>.&nbsp; A commit in both Git and lakeFS is a binding of specific versions of the objects (files) in that commit with some additional <em>commit metadata</em> – such as parent commit IDs, commit message, author, user metadata.&nbsp; Actual versions of objects – the “data” – are stored on underlying object storage (typically S3); for our purposes here with an arbitrary path.&nbsp; graveler is our system that maps object paths in a specific revision to the object paths on underlying storage.</p>

<p>This example shows graveler holding 2 revisions.&nbsp; File “a/file” <em>changes</em> between revisions, file “a/nother” is deleted, file “be/good” is renamed to “bat/man”, and file “be/tter” remains unchanged.&nbsp; The object names on underlying storage are immaterial to graveler.&nbsp; Additionally, because lakeFS is a versioned object store, it has no direct concept of “directories”: files are attached to paths.&nbsp; Splitting on separator characters (typically “/”) occurs at a higher level; graveler need merely provide an efficient “seek until &gt;=” operation.</p>



<p>Just as in Git, <em>commits never change</em>.&nbsp; So graveler is an immutable key-value store, that behaves as a large SSTable.&nbsp; However, the design of graveler faces some different forces from that of Git:</p>



<ul><li>graveler must be able to hold many more paths.&nbsp; A repository with merely millions of paths is <em>small</em>.&nbsp;</li><li>graveler uses a remote underlying storage.&nbsp; Remote files are fetched using the tiered filing system described in a previous blog post, “<a href="https://lakefs.io/tiers-in-the-cloud-how-lakefs-caches-immutable-data-on-local-disk/">Tiers in the Cloud: How lakeFS caches immutable data on local-disk</a>”.&nbsp; But access to any object that is not cached locally is <em>slow</em>, and random access is only an option after successfully retrieving the entire object.</li></ul>



<p>This leads to different implementation choices.</p>



<h2>Metadata object sizes</h2>



<p>A lakeFS repository uses the underlying storage for two different tasks:</p>



<ol><li>Storing <em>user</em> data objects.&nbsp; The number and size of these objects is controlled by the user, and an efficient workload already controls these parameters to allow efficient operation on the underlying storage.</li><li>Storing <em>metadata</em> objects.&nbsp; lakeFS controls the number and size of these objects, and must do so efficiently.</li></ol>



<p>lakeFS has multiple typical access patterns to committed data:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fully sequential </strong>(rare): When delivering a full listing of objects, or when computing a diff or merge of very different commits.</li><li><strong>Sequential with random skips</strong>: When listing objects with paths matching a particular prefix, or when computing a diff or merge of rather similar commits.</li><li><strong>Random but local skips</strong>: A typical “big data” application will access particular subsets of paths, and access paths within each subset in roughly lexicographical order.</li><li><strong>Random</strong>: When accessing a single file.</li></ul>



<p>So SSTables are a good fit for committed data in lakeFS, just as it is for unchanging data in many other object stores.&nbsp; Indeed, Git stores its files in tree objects — essentially per-directory SSTables.</p>



<p>Picking “good” object sizes requires benchmarking.  We use the very comprehensive S3 benchmark numbers from <a href="https://github.com/dvassallo/s3-benchmark">github.com/dvassallo/s3-benchmark</a>.</p>



<p>Time to download a file from an object store can roughly be modelled as <em>t<sub>initial</sub> + size/bandwidth</em>: a roughly fixed cost to start downloading, followed by time to download all remaining bytes.&nbsp; Here are some of dvassallo’s numbers for times achieved for 10 threads running on c5.4xlarge instances.&nbsp;<em>t<sub>initial</sub></em> is roughly the <em>time to request</em>.</p>

<pre><code><strong>A note on benchmarking S3</strong>
S3 timing is unfortunately not generally repeatable.&nbsp; These numbers represent the <em>lowest latency</em> I could measure over 3 regions (us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-central-1) over a few days.&nbsp; Other measured latencies were around 18-19 msec for 90th percentile of time to request.</code></pre>



<p>In all cases time to request is barely affected by object size&nbsp; At object sizes below 512 KiB it is comparable to the time to receive the entire object.&nbsp; So object sizes below 512 KiB are always less effective for our access patterns: taking into account that they perform more accesses, <em>they require strictly </em><strong><em>more</em></strong><em> time to fetch metadata on any number of files</em>.</p>



<p>Large objects are less effective for all access patterns that access only parts of the repository, they potentially fetch more data than needed.&nbsp; At the same time, graveler design allows us to <em>re-use shared objects</em> between SSTables for different commits.&nbsp; In order to do this we need those objects to be shared; this is easier to do with smaller objects: An object needs to be rewritten whenever it changes.&nbsp; So splitting an SSTable between more objects makes each object more re-usable.</p>



<p>In light of this, we designed graveler to use object sizes of 1-10 MiB.</p>



<h2>Lightweight B+Trees</h2>



<p>A repository can contain hundreds of millions of objects at a single commit.&nbsp; Git overloads the directory structure of the files in the repository in order to determine <em>tree objects</em>.&nbsp; Each tree object holds a single directory, linking to additional tree objects for subdirectories.</p>



<p>lakeFS data repositories are somewhat different from Git source code repositories.&nbsp; Firstly, they tend to have orders of magnitude <em>more</em> objects – even billions of objects.&nbsp; But performance of directory scans is much <em>less</em> important in data lakes than performance of sequential scans, and directory structures can be very deep (8 or more levels are common).&nbsp; This allows us to separate concerns differently.</p>



<p>Graveler stores a sorted list of key-value pairs in multiple consecutive files.&nbsp; “Leaf” files are termed <em>ranges</em>.&nbsp; These hold the actual values: path to object on underlying object store and additional per-object metadata.&nbsp; We try to keep leaf files to have sizes in the range on 1-10 MiB.&nbsp; The different ranges hold non-overlapping ranges of keys.&nbsp; The list of references to range objects is stored in a separate file termed a <em>metarange</em>.&nbsp; It holds the range files in order of their keys, indexed by last key.</p>



<p>So the graveler SSTable is stored pretty much as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+Tree</a> with 2 levels: a root (metarange) and leaf nodes (ranges).&nbsp; Internal nodes are identified by digests of their contents, making this a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree"><em>Merkle tree</em></a>.&nbsp; Nodes with the same contents receive identical identifiers, allowing for re-using nodes between similar trees as well as constant-time comparisons.</p>



<h3>Only 2 levels?</h3>



<p>We <em>do not currently limit the size of metarange files</em>.&nbsp; A typical object entry is &lt;512 bytes, so a 10 MiB range file can hold 20K object entries.&nbsp; Given that we have more control over names of range file objects, a 10 MiB metarange file can hold rather more than 20K object entries, for a total of 400M object entries.<br>What happens if the metarange file is too large?&nbsp; We just keep it large.&nbsp; It turns out that we do not lose much!&nbsp; Almost all of the nodes in any B+Tree are near the leaves.&nbsp; The massive branching-factor of our nodes means that we would add at most 1 level if we split the metarange file: even splitting the root into just 100 entries would give a graveler file capable of holding 40G object entries.&nbsp; The gains from adding intermediate nodes are not much: a minimal increase in caching and dedupe efficiency (almost all of the cache and dedupe are for ranges, not metaranges), in exchange for <em>no</em> reduction in latency (all accesses would now require 3 steps rather than 2 as before).</p>



<pre><code><strong>A note about Git packfiles
</strong>As mentioned above, Git holds many more tree objects per file than we hold range objects.&nbsp; It reduces the number of files that it needs to access by collecting small objects into “pack files”.&nbsp; This significantly reduces the total size of repository metadata, and allows it to regain much of …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

    <p>Semantic Versioning is better than most Versioning systems today, but because it means different things to different people, it remains more of a Social Versioning system than a semantic one.</p>
<p>I propose a new Versioning Scheme named Mark Versioning, which aims to separate and preserve both social and semantic aspects of versioning.</p>
<p>A <em>Mark</em> is a specific version of a software. This number is decided by social consensus, and represents major iterations / changes to a software. It starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 whenever appropriate.</p>
<p>A <em>Revision</em> is similar to a Mark, but it represents a strict change in API. This may be a breaking or a no breaking change. Reversions start at 0 for each mark, and are incremented by one whenever an API change is detected. This should be done automatically by package management software.</p>
<p>A <em>Hash</em> is the particular SHA-3 hash (in hex form, truncated to 8 characters) of a the source code of a software version. A Revision may have multiple different hashes. Alternatively, one can start from 0 with each Revision and automatically increment by 1 with each change. This should be done automatically.</p>
<p>Mark Versioning can be written out in two forms: long and short.</p>
<p>Long form: </p>
<pre><code>Mark &lt;X&gt; Revision &lt;Y&gt; Hash &lt;zzzzzzzz&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Short form:</p>
<pre><code>m&lt;X&gt;r&lt;Y&gt;#&lt;zzzzzzzz&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>Mark 3 Revision 16 Hash ae473ff6
</code></pre>
<p>Same in short form:</p>
<pre><code>m3r16#ae473ff6
</code></pre>
<p>Optionally, one can leave off Hash or Hash and Revision (if Hash is present, Revision must be present):</p>
<pre><code>Mark 0
Mark 0 Revision 0
Mark 0 Revision 0 Hash 0

m0
m0r0
m0r0#0
</code></pre>
<p>That's all.</p>

<p><span>We know exactly when the Viking Age
began in England – it was more than 1,200 years ago – on June 8, 793. That was
the day when invading Norsemen destroyed the Abbey church on the island of
Lindisfarne, off the north-east coast of England. Lindisfarne was a centre of
learning famous across the continent – but that meant nothing to these fierce
invaders.</span></p>

<tr><td>The Vikings arrived in England in 793 AD</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><span>Monks were either killed in the abbey,
thrown into the sea to drown or carried away as slaves – along with the church’s
treasures. The devastation of Northumbria’s Holy Island shocked Europe. “Never
before has such an atrocity been seen”, declared the Northumbrian scholar,
Alcuin of York. The Vikings had announced themselves in a devastating way. This
was just a warning of what was to come.</span></p>

<p><span>Over the next 300 years, more and more
invaders would flood into England, and Leicestershire would be full of Vikings.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Divided country</span></b></p>
<p><span>At the
time, England was not one united country – it was divided up into Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms.</span><b> </b><span>Leicester was
included within Mercia, and was known as Legreceastre. It was the principal
city in that kingdom. Even a thousand years ago and more, Legreceastre was a
bit of a melting pot.</span><b> </b><span>It
was a meeting point of several different cultures – the Angles from the Wash
and the Humber, Saxons from Warwickshire, Mercians from the Trent, and Celts
from the hills of Charnwood. In Leicester, they met, traded and eventually
settled.</span><b> </b><span>What increasingly
united these peoples was Christianity.</span><b>
</b><span>Mercia was Christian – the “new” religion reached Leicester in the
year 658. A church was said to have stood from the 7th century on the current
St Margaret’s site.</span><b> </b><span>Leicestershire,
as we know it, was in the heart of the Mercian kingdom and is thought to have
been the capital for political and ecclesiastical affairs. It was far enough
away from the frontiers to avoid changing hands as the unstable boundaries of
the mini-kingdom advanced and receded.</span><b>
</b><span>But what the Anglo-Saxons had worked so hard to build in
Leicestershire, was about to come to an end. The Scandinavian enemy was at the
gates and Mercia would never be the same again.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Ruthlessly pillaged</span></b></p>
<p><span>In 10 short years, between 865 and 874,
the whole structure of life in Mercia collapsed. A huge Scandinavian army
marched and pillaged up and down England. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has
preserved a glimpse of these years of chaos in its records of “a great heathen
army” that pillaged East Anglia in the year 865. Between 865 and 868 the
Northmen widened their field for plunder and tribute to East Mercia. Leicester
was attacked in 868, partly destroying the ancient Roman city walls.</span></p>

<p><span>Thousands of Danes swarmed down the
River Soar in their small, easily-managed boats, penetrating the very heart of
the country, carrying fire and sword among the simple and terrified population,
whom they ruthlessly pillaged and massacred. In the winter of 874 to 5, after
defeating Burhed, King of Mercia in battle, the raiders established their
quarters at Repton on the River Trent. Monasteries, the repositories of rich
and beautiful objects in gold, silver and jewellery, formed particular targets
for the pagan invaders. The monastery that had been founded at Breedon in
Leicestershire was reputedly sacked. But these Danes didn’t just hit and run,
like the early invaders on Lindisfarne.</span></p>

<tr><td>The Vikings swarmed down the River Soar</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><span>In its records of the year 877, the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests a permanent settlement of the land. The Danish
army it says “went into the land of the Mercians, and shared out some of it,
and gave some to Ceolwulf”. Ceolwulf was the puppet king whom the Danes placed
on the Mercian throne. It seems Mercia was now divided in half.</span></p>

<p><span>Large parts of its eastern territories
had passed into the hands of the Scandinavian invaders and were open to
settlement. Within the next decade, in 886, the losses of Anglo-Saxon territory
in Mercia were clearly defined by a treaty that King Alfred the Great concluded
with Guthrum, the leader of the Danes, after his Wessex Saxons had recaptured
London.</span></p>

<p><span>A permanent “country of Danes” was now
established within England, known as the Danelaw. This Danish part of England
comprised the greater part of eastern England from East Anglia to North
Yorkshire, incorporating most of Leicestershire. You could say that Leicester
was part of Denmark.</span></p>

<p><span>Leicestershire was close to the Danelaw
boundary though, and it is believed that some of the wealthier inhabitants
migrated with as many possessions as they could carry. As the churches were
destroyed and Christian rites trampled, the Bishop of Leicester retired to
safety at Dorchester-on-Thames. It would be more than a thousand years before
there would again be a Diocese of Leicester. Leicester, with Derby, Nottingham,
Lincoln and Stamford, became one of the “Five Boroughs” of the Danelaw. Leicester,
as a former Anglo-Saxon royal city, continued its importance under Danish rule.
Danish forms of taxation and local government took root in Leicester.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Danish Leicester</span></b></p>
<p><span>Although the Danelaw’s existence was
relatively short-lived, it left an everlasting mark on the history of
Leicestershire. The Scandinavians left an indelible impression on the language
of the East Midlands. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Vocabulary,
grammatical structures and the very tones of local dialect were deeply affected
by the contact with Scandinavia. Despite this, there aren’t many archeological
finds to be seen; visible remains of the Norsemen are hard to come by. Leicestershire’s
archaeological record lacks burials, pottery and everyday implements.</span></p>

<p><span>Finds that we do have are generally
personal ornaments such as brooches, horse accessories, coinage and weaponry. There
are also some distinctly Irish objects found in Leicestershire that were
probably plundered by Vikings during raids, and transported back to the Danelaw
lands. Such finds include a “shrine mount” from Breedon and belt buckles from
Melton.</span></p>

<p><span>Our understanding of Danish settlement
and the geography of the Danelaw depends largely on the evidence of
Scandinavian place-names. The place-name ending of by, which means a farm or
more usually a settlement, is seen throughout Denmark. That same ending is
common in England too. In Leicestershire alone, 56 villages end in by (such as Oadby)
and of these, half the number contain a Danish personal name as their other
element. But towards Leicester, on the broad gravel spreads where the River
Wreake empties into the Soar, the character of place-names changes. The sounds
of the Scandinavian invaders gives way to names of an older Mercian origin with
names ending in -ton. Thrussington, Syston and Cossington all speak of an
earlier period in Leicestershire’s settlement history. Even though the ton
element suggests the presence of a settlement that survived the impact of the
Danish army, the first element in these names is frequently a Scandinavian
personal name. Many Leicestershire villages were named after powerful Danes.
Ingarsby is named after the Danish Prince Ingar and it is now believed that
Humberstone may be named after Ingar’s brother, Hubba. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Both Princes entered Leicester during the
Danish invasion and could have settled in the villages named after themselves.</span></p>

<p><span>But as well as being named after actual

Thurlaston and Thurnby all owe their name to one of the principal pagan gods of
the Scandinavian culture – Thor, who together with Odin, were the most commonly
worshipped gods. An archaeological find from Leicestershire of a miniature
“Thor’s Hammer”, the god’s famous magical weapon, is on display in the Jewry
Wall Museum.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Names are clues</span></b></p>
<p><span>With invading forces, you may assume
that they would settle on the broad and fertile river terraces of the Soar. But
settlements already existed here and new areas of land were needed to house the
large band of men who came to dwell in Leicestershire. By the study of
place-names, it appears that they turned towards the emptier and perhaps less
rewarding river terraces that flank the narrow valley of the Wreake. Along that
river we find Frisby, Hoby, Rotherby, Brooksby and Rearsby. The word “Wreake”
is also derived from Scandinavia, being the Old Norse word for “twisted”. So,
Wreake is both a description and the new name for the river once known as the
River Eye. Historian Sir Frank Stenton said the Wreake settlement was occupied
by a large body of the Danish army who took permanent occupation of the land
some time around 877.</span></p>

<p><span>The army would have been stationed here
so it could spring to the defence of Leicester if the town was ever threatened
by invaders from the west. Another Danish encampment is thought to have stood
on the area of Leicester known as Dane Hills. The creation of the Danelaw made
as great an impression on Leicester as in the surrounding countryside. The
colonising Danes, soldiers and farmers, turned the Mercian cathedral city into
a garrison town. The term “gate,” descended from the Old Norse, “gata,” meaning
a street, occurs in a handful of streets in the heart of Leicester. All in the
same part of town we find Gallowtree Gate, Humberstone Gate, Church Gate,
Belgrave Gate and Sanvey Gate. They lie outside the line of the former Roman
and medieval wall, beyond the bounds of the Anglo-Saxon town. As we all know,
the first four streets converge at the Clock Tower where High Street passed
through the former East Gate out of the walled enclosure of the medieval town. Thus,
the presence of the “gata” element in modern street names of Leicester suggests
that the Danes, when they made Leicester one of their strongholds, established
a new town outside the wall of the Mercian city. By the early years of the 10th
century, Leicester may have been like a town of two halves, sharply divided
into Anglo-Saxon and Danish quarters.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was reading the Slate Star Codex <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-cult-of-smart">review</a> of The Cult of Smart. Part of it discusses charter vs state schools and the allegations of fraud of various kinds undermining charter schools record of better achievement. Reading it, I realized that I took for granted that public schools engage in systematic fraud in a variety of ways. I donâ€™t think this is something everyone understands, hence this post.</p>
<p>I went to a state school in the UK. State schools are rated on a 1 âˆ’ 4 scale from unsatisfactory to outstanding. My school was rated good, meaning a 3. A few memories which stand out. During my first week I saw one of the boys in my class who was 11 at the time held up against the wall in a corridor while a 16 year old put a shiv to his throat and robbed him. He handed over his wallet and keys. A year or two later and I remember seeing a small boy who struggled with depression held up by the throat against a locker and slapped in the face by a troublemaker from the same class in front of everyone just before we went in to the classroom. I remember classes which were filled start to finish with people shouting and talking. Neither of the first two events were common but they also werenâ€™t uncommon. No one was surprised to witness them. Itâ€™s worth emphasizing again that my school was above average, in fact quite far above average, and in a middle class area. Itâ€™s also worth noting that I was mostly in top ability streamed classes, meaning my classroom experience was likely far better than average.</p>
<p>There were many ways in which the school and teachers gamed the system to boost their measured performance. One way was to do exams for students. I was on a bottom set language class for French. After two years I literally couldnâ€™t speak a single sentence in french and maybe knew 20 words in total. I still passed my exams. How? We did the tests in class. Often the teacher would go through them with us. Literally giving us the test and then going through each question on the whiteboard and telling us what to write. A different year and a different teacher, this time the teacher would sit next to us and write the answers down. Why sit next to us? It was the bottom set so people often wouldnâ€™t even bother to write down the answer if they were told it. This kind of thing was normal, so much so that I, and I think most people there, didnâ€™t realize anything unusual was happening.</p>
<p>Another way schools game metrics is to cheat inspections. A major component of how schools are judged in the UK is through independent inspections carried out by an independent quasi-governmental organization called Ofsted. Now, you may imagine that these inspections would be unannounced, so as to best get a real image of how a school works. Not the case. Theyâ€™re scheduled well in advance. Before every inspection, a few things would happen in my school:</p>
<ul><li><p>The worst troublemaker kids would be taken aside and put in a special room where inspectors wouldnâ€™t see them. Either that or they would just be told not to come into school at all on that day.</p></li><li><p>All of us were told in assembly that an inspection was coming and to be on our best behavior on that day. Often teachers would have conversations with less serious troublemakers and impress on them that they would behave on that day or face consequences afterwards.</p></li><li><p>Teachers would put a great deal more effort into their lesson plans than was normal. Classroom behavior management would also be far stricter.
Because of these and other measures my school during an inspection was utterly different than my school on a normal day. On some level this isnâ€™t surprising. If teachersâ€™ promotions and managementâ€™s jobs depend on good inspection results and inspections are easy to game, people will game them. Incentives drive behavior. But itâ€™s still sad.</p></li></ul>
<p>Another way the stats were gamed was by not recording bad behavior. When a school gives a detention or suspends/â€‹expels a student, thereâ€™s a record of it. This is especially true of suspensions, students being sent home or expulsions. The more of these you have, the worse you look as a school. The solution then is obvious, donâ€™t punish people or punish them in non-recorded ways. Again, in my school it was completely normal for students in lower sets to swear at the teacher, talk over them or disrupt the class for everyone else. It was normal for someone to be aggressive and abusive towards others and to face at most a 40 minute detention, but even getting a detention would be unusual.</p>
<p>I realize that one data point is not enough to draw solid general conclusions. My own perception is that this kind of fraud wasnâ€™t specific to my school. My cousin went to a state school fairly nearby. Heâ€™s 4 years younger than me. During one of my winters back from undergrad we discussed his school and his experiences mirrored mine. His exact words regarding inspections were â€œI learned 4 times more that day than any other day that year. It was amazingâ€�. I talked to a few British students at university, although specifically the not middle/â€‹upper class ones who would have gone to public schools. They had gone to schools similar to mine in different parts of the country and their stories were similar and often worse. Two particularly funny examples from my friendsâ€™ experiences stand out. A teacher in year 9 walked up to a student who was talking, picked them up and threw them out of an (open) first floor window. My friend sitting in class noticed two boys making fun of him and then proceeded to get up in the middle of class while the teacher was talking, walk to their table, flip the table upwards to hit them in the face before going to sit down again when the teacher told him to. (Remember, my friend was a studious, sporty Asian kid and not a troublemaker. This kind of thing is normal in that environment). Comedic stories aside, my experiences in school, while not universal, seem fairly common in the UK and from what Iâ€™ve read of the statistics, bad US schools are far, far worse.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m unsure what my point here is. I think I have two:</p>
<ul><li><p>Charters may cook their books in various ways. In the UK, State schools do too. I would be surprised if it wasnâ€™t also the case in the US.</p></li><li><p>I think that I feel like a lot of commentators on places like SSC have fairly middle class experiences of fairly good schools and that bleeds into how their comparison between state vs charter schools. Itâ€™s just good to remember that itâ€™s not those nice middle class schools that charters typically replace.</p></li></ul>

        <h4>20 Feb 2021</h4>
        <p><a href="https://tevps.net/blog/Tools/">Tools</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://tevps.net/blog/Rant/">Rant</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://tevps.net/blog/DevOps/">DevOps</a></p><p>
        TL;DR: Proposal for a way to define multiple-machine systems in a immutable way, without requiring by-hand layouts.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading a lot about <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixops#nixops">NixOps</a> recently, and although I’m still leaning towards <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> overall as my system configurator of choice (technically <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a>, but that’s not so relevant for this), I’ve realised there’s a gap in the market for better immutable infrastructure. Note that this is a half-formed proposal, not a plan to do things, as I’ve already got way too many things on my plate, but I felt it was worth sharing the idea with others if anyone feels like picking this up, or doing something derived from it.</p>
<p>The goal is as follows: I want to be able to declare things like “I want X replicas of this service running, on different nodes” and “don’t put too many things on one node so the load gets well shared”, while not having to layout by hand <em>which</em> nodes the services go on, as they’re <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/">cattle not pets</a>. We can do this with Kubernetes right now, but at the cost of a system that tends towards being hard to debug when things go wrong, and things can <a href="https://k8s.af/">go very wrong</a>. It also has the limit that you have to containerise everything and isn’t really suited to managing local node setups (i.e. everything you need installed before you run the Kubernetes agent, like say ntp).</p>
<p>Nix OTOH, is absolutely designed for the local node setup, and NixOps would let us then setup multiple machines. However, NixOps is designed towards a “here’s a set of Nix expressions defining a series of specific machines”, and isn’t designed for any of the “choose where stuff goes for me” bits. These machines aren’t full-blown pets as they’re still automatically configured, but they’re not really fully cattle either.</p>
<p>We need a 3rd option: something with the best bits of both. Maybe it can be done with a variant of NixOps that defines a “basic node” config (stuff you want everywhere, like a specific kernel, ntp, maybe some firewall stuff), and then a series of “service” configs, that probably contain <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58243920">an actual service config</a> and maybe any other packages/config that service needs, along with some metadata (e.g. replication count, memory/CPU requirements). It does need some sort of thing that decides “where does that particular service go” especially if the node that was carrying it goes down. Maybe we have some little service running on each node with <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft consensus</a> to decide what goes where, but all compiling down to Nix configurations for ease of debugging. It would also need to be able to cope with the upgrade case, plausibly by using the consensus system to replace a subset at a time of the services (or maybe some magic with unique names for services so we can run old version + new version at the same time)</p>
<p>Ideally, we also have something that lets us say spit out <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> config for the more infrastructure things (NixOps supports AWS, Hetzner and GCE; Terraform supports <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers">basically everything</a> and so it’s just easier that way), and then we can have a single config language that defines everything about our system’s setup other than the source code. And without needing to write <a href="https://octopus.com/blog/introduction-to-hcl-and-hcl-tooling">HCL</a>!</p>
<p>I would also note that I don’t regard Nix as the definitive option on system config languages. I think the immutable infrastructure approach is great, but the Nix language <a href="https://davedellacosta.com/posts/2019-03-29-why-nixos-is-hard-and-how-to-fix.html#what-is-so-hard">is kinda awful</a>. I’m somewhat more fond of <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>, but I’ve used Nix here as the example as it’s the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/800-pound_gorilla">800-pound gorilla</a> in this space currently. I’m not sure what “better” looks like, other than liking the approach of using an existing language (as Guix does with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile Scheme</a>) rather than building half of one along the way like Nix does.</p>
<p>Thoughts anyone?</p>

        <h2>Our API</h2>
        <p>
          You are visiting the front-end for the <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>doc online software. In the backend, it is running a RESTful API that provides a few endpoints for you to use. Please make sure you read the following instructions about what to expect and what not to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of these requests will return either HTTP status code 200 (OK) or, in the case of any error, HTTP status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity). The <code>/version</code>endpoint is guaranteed not to fail.

        <h2>Deploying your own instance</h2>
        <h3>Running an executable JAR file</h3>
        <p>
          <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>doc online is an open-source product available at its <a href="https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texdoc-online">GitLab repository page</a>. It consists of one server component that does host the API and the front-end at the same time. If you simply want to have these features available to you, download the latest build artifacts from there (i.e. the JAR file with dependencies) and run it with your local Java installation. Please note that the software requires a local <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> distribution installed and internet connection for fetching the topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          When running the JAR file, a local webserver will start up and host the service at <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>which is configurable through the command-line switches. Calling this address will open up the web interface. Appending API paths will execute the API calls and return the JSON objects. To stop the server from running, simply <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>the Java process.
        </p>
        <h3>Booting up a container</h3>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the preferred way to host your own instance should be running our Docker container (a list of available tags may be found<a href="https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texdoc-online/container_registry">at GitLab</a>). The Docker container runs the web service as its entrypoint so running the server will start up the web server . Because the Docker container is built on top of our <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>Live images, it does not require a local <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> installation which might be beneficial for web servers. Internet connection is required,though. This all comes at the cost of being quite a big docker image of some gigabytes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your Docker container runs for multiple days, it features an automated update of <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>Live. Every day at 00:01 in the morning, a full update of the distribution is performed updating to the latest and greatest package versions <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> Live has to offer. Please note, that updates between distribution releases will not be performed that way; in order to upgrade from TL&amp;nbsp;2020 to TL&amp;nbsp;2021 you would need to pull the latest Docker image again but that means that the need for re-pulling the Docker image reduces to once per year.

<p>We are probably all familiar with "555" telephone numbers. The basic idea is
that the 555 exchange code (or NXX in a NANP NXX-XXXX number) is reserved for
use in fiction. Of course, this isn't actually true at all, but that hasn't
stopped basically every work of fiction putting their imaginary telephone
numbers in the 555 exchange.</p>
<p>In reality, the 555 exchange has a somewhat bumpy history, as is the case with
most "special purpose" telephone ranges. Seemingly from the genesis of NANP as
a formal numbering standard, the 555 exchange was reserved for special use by
telcos, and was not to be used for normal subscriber lines. The 555 exchange
accumulated various and sundry uses, but most prominently, starting in the
early '60s it was used for directory service at 555-1212 in nearly all NPAs
(area codes). This was nearly the only successful use of the 555 exchange,
leaving it mostly empty.</p>
<p>Because the 555 exchange was conveniently largely out of use, it became common
for the entertainment industry to use 555 numbers in fiction. Wikipedia makes
the claim that the telephone industry had specifically recommended 555 numbers
for this use in the '60s, and while this is rather thinly sourced, it's not
hard to believe as any odd person in a technical role at a telephone company
might have suggested 555 as an exchange with extremely few assigned numbers.</p>
<p>In any case, the use of 555 numbers for fiction was somewhat informal. This
changed in 1994, when the telephone industry regretted leaving an entire
exchange out of use and formed a working group which allowed 555 numbers to
be assigned to nationwide communications services. The idea was that 555
numbers would have the unusual property of working nationwide when dialed as
only seven digits, somewhat like an early version of SMS short codes.</p>
<p>Because the use of 555 numbers in fiction was longstanding, the working group
explicitly reserved numbers starting 555-01 for use in fiction. This, in 1994,
is when this practice became formalized---but only for those 100 numbers.</p>
<p>In practice the 555 service as imagined was unsuccessful, and in the 2010s the
use was eliminated more or less by handshake agreement. Much like the pre-1994
state, the only valid phone numbers in the 555 exchange are 555-1212 for
directory assistance, and 555-4334. This latter number is apparently still
assigned for a nationwide use but no one specifies <em>what</em> use.</p>
<p>I did a bit of digging, and... came up empty. 555-4334 in a number of area
codes turns up nothing from the CNAM service I use. Similar attempts with
a couple of validation/carrier lookup vendors returned different types of
useless results. I haven't found any mention of the number in old newspapers,
with the interesting exception of some newspapers listing their classified
ads with exclusively 555 numbers, including 4334.</p>
<p>It was not an unusual practice at the time for newspapers to provide special
"voice mail box" numbers for classified ads, but to my knowledge the use of 555
was not typical.  The first newspapers to do so were almost all in Utah, which
hints that it may have originated as a choice by a local telco, potentially
Mountain Bell but maybe more likely an independent. I will do some more digging
into this over time. It's interesting in that it suggests a major use of 555
numbers which no document I've seen on the history of the exchange mentions.
This practice doesn't seem to have been eliminated until the 1994 reallocation.</p>
<p>I also learned that in 2009 you could get a rebate of $7,555 or $4,334 on a new
Dodge Nitro. Isn't OCR fun?</p>
<p>Finally, I located an older FCC report (dated 1997) that lists 555-4334 as
allocated to MCI mail, an early e-mail service. MCI mail access was initially
by modem, and so it's possible that 555-4334 was used as an access number,
although an 800 number was also provided for this purpose and 4334 is not
mentioned anywhere I can find as an access number. An interesting feature of
MCI Mail was its ability to forwarded email to postal addresses (by printing and
mailing it) or by fax or teletype, so I speculate that 555-4334 may have been
used as a return number for TTY messages, since the TTY integration was
apparently bidirectional. In any case, another document noted that 555-4334 was
permitted to remain in service until that service ended, which may have been an
allowance due to the fact that MCI was a telephone carrier (and thus had
greater sway over the working group) and that replacing the number may have
been technically difficult.</p>
<p>Today, it remains the case that only 555-01xx is properly allocated for
fictional use. However, the 555 exchange as a whole is as dead (or considering
the use by newspapers, much  more dead) than ever before, so it remains common
to use the entire 555 exchange in fiction.</p>
<p>Oddly, the 555 NPA (rather than exchange) is allocated for similar
applications, but as far as I can tell it is not in use.</p>
<p>The failure of the post-1994 use of 555 for a "short dialing service" reflects
a larger series of telco failures that has left some other special prefixes.
In the '90s, a great deal of attention was directed towards "non-geographic"
dialing. Because the telephone system connected the nation together, why not
have a method of telephone dialing which is independent of geography? Well, as
it turns out, there are several reasons, but this didn't stop anyone from
trying.</p>
<p>Although there were a hodgepodge of other attempts, the first major
non-geographic dialing scheme is contained in the special 700 NPA (area code).
This NPA was allocated as a direct result of the breakup of the Bell system for
use directly by interexchange (long-distance) carriers, since all existing
numbering ranges were allocated to the exchange (local) carriers. The primary
service offered in this range was "EasyReach 700" from AT&amp;T, which was
basically carrier-managed "follow-me."</p>
<p>Follow-me is a common feature of business telephone systems that allows a call
to a given number (extension or DID) to be directed to one or more real
extensions depending on the location of the intended recipient. For example, a
call to a professional might go to their desk or to an assistant depending on
whether they are in the office, while an auto mechanic might have a call to a
general contact number ring at the front desk or in the shop depending on where
they are.</p>
<p>EasyReach 700 moved this same concept from the PABX to the telephone network,
making it possible for follow-me to span the nation and making it accessible to
businesses without an (expensive) PABX. For example, a consumer with two
different homes could get a 700 number and set it to forward to whichever house
they were staying in, while a traveling salesman could set their 700 number
to forward to whichever hotel they were staying in.</p>
<p>EasyReach was a failure. There were several reasons, but the most significant
relates to the billing climate of the time. Today, unlimited long-distance is
so ubiquitous that the issue may not be obvious, or you might naively assume
that AT&amp;T had found a way to resolve the long distance cost issue. They did
not---in fact, they came up with something worse. The owner of a 700 number
could set it up to either bill forward (to the caller) or reverse (to the
callee). This meant that the caller of a 700 number had virtually no way to
determine whether the call would be free or charged at long-distance rate, and
this was a huge deterrent to use of these numbers.</p>
<p>Today, this and other uses of the 700 NPA have all died out, leaving 700
a nearly empty NPA. Like other empty NPAs, 700 is sometimes hijacked for
special uses by non-mainstream carriers and corporate phone systems. If my
hazy memory is correct, the 700 NPA was used by GE's interoffice leased-line
long distance network when I briefly worked for a GE business. Wikipedia
says that WalMart still uses it this way.</p>
<p>Since the 700 NPA was such a success, AT&amp;T naturally decided to do it again.
In 1993, NANP allocated the 500 NPA to Personal Communications Service (PCS),
not to be confused with Personal Communications Service (PCS). In fact, the
same term was allocated to two completely different purposes by two different
telecom organizations within a few years. The latter refers to a set of
services offered by a wireless network, e.g. Sprint PCS, while the former
refers to...  EasyReach 700 all over again, except for now it's called True
Connections.</p>
<p>True Connections failed for the exact same reasons as EasyReach 700, and was
officially eliminated in 2000, but by this point AT&amp;T had already largely
replaced it with a service using 800 numbers which were of course always
reverse billed...  which you and I might think is obviously what they should
have done in the first place, but back in the '90s toll-free and non-geographic
were viewed as being different animals. It seems to have taken AT&amp;T a long time
to catch on to the fact that the realities of long-distance billing required
that they be closely linked.</p>
<p>The concept of PCS (the non-geographic dialing one) did not die out with True
Connections, and additional NPAs were allocated to the same purpose,
generally in the format of 5 followed by the same digit twice, much like 800.
500 numbers continue to be non-geographic and the billing situation remains
odd, but that hasn't stopped the use of 500 for certain uses like modem banks
for ISPs and some calling cards. Very few 500 numbers remain in use today
despite the multiple allocated 500 codes, and due to the billing issues it's
common for outbound calls to 500 numbers to be blocked. Similar to 700, it's
not unusual for 500 to be used for internal purposes, although this is probably
less of a good idea since PCS services in the 500 NPA have not officially been
ended.</p>
<p>500 and related PCS area codes (500 has a surprising number of overlays
considering how obscure its usage is) also see use for other miscellaneous
telco applications. For example, the 588 area code, also assigned to PCS, was
(and may still be) …</p></article></div>

It’s designed to bring skilled professionals into Taiwan, and if you’ve made more than ~$67k USD/year<label for="sn-1"></label><span>All of the prices are denominated in the law in New Taiwan Dollars, and have been converted into USD at October 2020 rates for this post. The threshold for eligibility is that you make more than $160,000 NTD/month.</span> at any point in the past three years you’re trivially eligible.<label for="sn-2"></label><span>There are also trickier ways to apply, such as proving your expertise in one of the eligible fields: Science and Technology, Economy, Education, Culture and Arts, Sports, Finance, Law, or Architecture. However, the bar for proving expertise is quite high (probably similar to an O-1 visa in the United States, depending on the category).</span> There is no lottery, anyone who is eligible can get approved within a couple months. If you’ve met the income requirement, it’s currently one of the easiest ways to get to Taiwan, and the visa it provides you allows you to enter Taiwan regardless of the COVID-19 situation in your country of origin. This post will explain the process for getting a Gold Card, including several tips that aren’t written down in any official documentation.</p><p>The most important tip is this: if you’re applying via your income, you should apply in the “Economy” category, <em>even if you think a different category describes your work better</em>. The other categories (especially Science and Technology) look for proof of income <strong>and</strong> proof of expertise, despite the law stating that only one is necessary. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, unlike the Ministry of Science and Technology, does things by the books and will approve you solely for the income requirement even if you are not an economist.<label for="sn-3"></label><span>As of February 2021, this may be changing — the Ministry of Economic Affairs appears to be rejecting people who work in fields not related to economics. The Ministry of Science and Technology says that they are now accepting people who work at any company related to science/technology and meet the salary requirement, but it’s too early to tell how strict they are about this.</span> Applying via income in a category other than “Economy” may cause your application to be rejected, and will likely incur a delay in processing your Gold Card request.<label for="sn-4"></label><span>If you’ve already applied in a category other than Economy, you have two options: You can either cancel your current application and submit a new one, paying the application fee a second time, or you can wait the month or two until your application is seen by the relevant ministry, and if it is rejected, change categories then by calling <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&amp;s=DA2F7BC919B77E24">Mr.&nbsp;Huang</a> and explaining the situation (which will not incur the extra fee).</span></p><p>In order to apply, you’ll need a picture of your passport with at least 6 months remaining on it before expiration, a copy of your W-2 or other document that shows your income<label for="sn-5"></label><span>Note that your paystubs are not a valid form of proof. If you don’t have a W-2 or similar tax document showing your full income (for instance, if you were only employed for part of the year), you may be able to get by with a document from your work stating what your income is, but I haven’t heard from anyone who’s done this. The guidelines specify a “月薪” which is translated as “monthly salary” — but this does not necessarily match the legal definition of salary as used in the US, which implies an employment relationship and a W-2. Things that are “月薪”: definitely W-2, possibly 1099-MISC. Things that are not 月薪: income reported on 1099-K, such as taking payment through card networks or being an Uber driver.</span>, a passport-style photo of yourself (a selfie taken in front of a white wall is fine), and a credit card or other method of payment to pay the couple hundred USD application fee.<label for="sn-6"></label><span>The application fees vary from ~$108 - $323 USD ($3,100 - $9,260 NTD) depending on your nationality, the duration of your Gold Card, and whether you apply from inside Taiwan or not. You can find how much the fee is for you in <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=AC68F9FBABA3F294&amp;s=4D07D9F9F687B542">this FAQ</a>. I paid $282 USD as an American applying for a 3-year Gold Card from outside of Taiwan.</span> Once you’ve got all that together, go to the <a href="https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card">application website</a>, click “I want to apply”, then “Self application”, and create an account. Then start a new Gold Card application and fill out the form. It’ll ask for your address in Taiwan, you can leave it blank if you don’t know where you’ll be staying (which you probably don’t, yet).<label for="sn-7"></label><span>Once you do have an address in Taiwan, you should go to the <abbr title="National Immigration Agency">NIA</abbr> within 30 days to get a new copy of your Gold Card with the address on it.</span> It’ll also ask if you want to apply in Taiwan or at a consulate/embassy overseas - you should probably pick whatever consulate you’re closest to, I went with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco. You will also need to pick how long you want the card to be valid for, from 1-3 years. There is very little downside to picking a longer duration — it costs a trivial amount more, and is no harder to get.<label for="sn-8"></label><span>A possible reason to pick 2 years is if you want to reapply for a 3-year gold card in 2 years, using your current year’s salary — if, for instance, you expect to not be making enough for the salary cutoff once you move to Taiwan. I have no idea if this actually works (the Gold Card program is fairly new, so there aren’t many stories of people reapplying), but it’s worth considering, especially seeing as it could get you enough time to be able to apply for an <a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141465/141808/152932/">APRC</a>.</span></p><p>Once you’ve submitted your application, you’ll need to wait a few weeks for it to be processed — it took mine 25 days, and I think anywhere from 3 weeks to a month is pretty normal. Either you’ll get a message asking you to provide additional documentation (unlikely, if you’re using a W-2 and submitted everything correctly), or you’ll get an email asking you to submit your passport to the application location that you’ve selected.</p><p>Once you get to the passport submission stage, it can be a bit unclear what to do — you can’t visit in person in most places due to COVID-19<label for="sn-9"></label><span>in the United States, at least.</span>, and the SF TECO at least does not answer phone calls or emails<label for="sn-10"></label><span>While the main SF TECO phone number goes unanswered, if you have Gold Card questions, you can call Angela at (415) 364-5632 and she should be able to help. The line is often busy, but if you leave a message she’ll get back to you.</span> (although other TECOs may be better, you should at least try calling your local TECO). What you need to do is pretty simple, however: just mail in the passport submission notice PDF that you can download on the application website (Download → Download Passport Submission Notice), your passport or a notarized copy of your passport, and a self-addressed USPS priority mail return envelope.</p><p>If like me, you don’t want to send in your physical passport, getting a notarized copy is pretty easy.<label for="sn-11"></label><span>In California, at least — laws vary by state, make sure to check your local laws.</span> Make a document with a copy of your passport<label for="sn-12"></label><span>I used a photo that I scaled so the passport was 1:1 with real life when printed, since I don’t have a scanner.</span> (just the first page and signature is fine, no need to include the stamp pages) and the statement “I, &lt;my name&gt;, affirm that the attached is a true and complete copy of the document which it purports to represent.” Then take that document to a notary and have them notarize your signature on it.</p><p>Once the TECO receives your envelope with the passport, you should get an email saying you’re approved, and only waiting on getting the physical Gold Card in the mail. If you need to fly to Taiwan before it arrives, you can print out a form that will allow you to board the plane on the application website, under “Download → Download Resident Authorization.” If you do this, you’ll need to pay a ~$18 USD ($500 NTD) fee to replace the card once you get to Taiwan. About 21 days after you get the email saying you’re approved<label for="sn-13"></label><span>I was told it would be at most 21 days, but it took 25 for me.</span> you should get a call from the TECO asking to schedule an appointment for you to pick up your Gold Card.<label for="sn-14"></label><span>They may say that this is an “interview,” but you’ve already been approved, so you shouldn’t worry too much about that. They asked me what I do for work, what connections I have in Taiwan, when I planned to go, and where I planned to stay.</span></p><p>Note that the start date (and thus the end date) of your Gold Card is determined by the day the passport is approved, so you may want to be a little strategic if you apply for a Gold Card significantly before you want to go to Taiwan — you can get all the way to the passport submission stage, then wait until a month or so before you plan to leave to actually submit your passport. Obviously there’s a tradeoff here — there’s some risk that your passport won’t be processed in time, but it may be worth considering, depending on your situation.</p><p>If you have any problems during this process, you can find a person to call for assistance on <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&amp;s=DA2F7BC919B77E24">this contact page</a>. Dialing Taiwan phone numbers from the United States can be tricky, but the thing that worked for me was dialing +886, then the area code with the leading zero omitted, then the rest of the number. Dialing 011 before the number or leaving on the zero in the area code would cause the call to fail for me, but your carrier may be different.</p><p>You might also want to check out the <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=6501F7D3D7CCA8A0">official website</a>, <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=AC68F9FBABA3F294&amp;s=4D07D9F9F687B542">official FAQ</a>, <a href="https://tw.forumosa.com/t/employment-gold-card-for-some-foreigners/159653">thread on the forumosa forum</a>, the <a href="https://taiwangoldcard.com/application-faq/">unofficial FAQ</a>, or <a href="http://blog.tomfifield.net/2018/05/how-to-apply-for-taiwans-immigration.html">Tom Fifield’s blog post</a>.</p><p>Enjoy Taiwan!</p><p><i>Thanks to Brandon Liu for providing additional information about valid sources of income.</i></p></section><section><p><a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/">☙</a></p></section></article></div>]]>

	<p><small>February 20, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>Over on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1363196953065099265">I had a hot take</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hot take: Every distribution packager who's saying "you shouldn't
bundle dependencies" is implicitly telling software authors "you
should do more work for us and limit the features (and reliability) of
your software".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This was sparked by reading <a href="https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2021/02/19/the-modern-packagers-security-nightmare/">The modern packagerâ€™s security
nightmare</a>,
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/zb1c4k/modern_packager_s_security_nightmare">via</a>.
I'm not exactly on one side or the other, but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1363263921960980485">I do think distributions
should be honest about what they're asking for</a> and I
don't think they're going to get it.)</p>

<p>This hot take is a bit too narrow. What really matters is software
authors and modern software systems restricting the versions of
dependencies (for both maximum and minimum versions). Explicit or
implicit bundling on top of that just makes the problem slightly worse
for distributions.</p>

<p>For software authors, restricting the versions of dependencies that
they work with reduces the amount of work that they have to do,
both to test against a range of versions and to either forever chase
after whatever changes those dependencies like to make or to forever
limit what features of dependencies they use to ones available in
old versions (and sometimes both at once). In theory, both testing
and chasing after changes would be dealt with by <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> (if everyone followed it), at least for a
single program. In practice, not only are people fallible but also
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SemverHasLimits">people have a different understanding of what semantic versioning
means</a> because semantic versioning is ultimately
a social thing, not a technical one. Our field's history has shown
(sometimes vividly) that if software authors allow versions of
dependencies to move on them, soon or later things break and the
software author has to fix it.</p>

<p>(There's also the practical issue that not all dependencies even
claim or agree to follow semantic versioning in the first place.)</p>

<p>For distributors, once software authors start restricting versions
the distributor has both an upgrade problem and a distribution
problem. On the upgrade side, dealing with an issue in a program may now
require persuading it to accept a new version of a dependency. On the
distribution side, it's now likely that you'll have multiple programs
that have different version requirements for the same dependency. At the
very least this multiplies the packages involved.</p>

<p>(Many distributions also have package system design problems that
restricts the range of versions of things that they can have installed
at the same time. Even under <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, this is a
problem for the distribution the moment that you have two programs
with conflicting version requirements that can't both be packaged and
installed at the same time.)</p>

<p>However, there's no free lunch here. What distributors want when
they ask for unbundled dependencies without version restrictions is
for software authors to do the work to accept any version of their
dependencies, or at least any version that falls within <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a>, and for dependencies to faithfully follow semver and
also make it possible to package and install different major versions
(at least) at the same time. <strong>Accepting a broad version range of your
dependencies is actual work</strong>, even apart from the limitations it may
impose on what your code and your software can do. Software authors and
the creators of software package ecosystems (like Go and Rust) are not
refusing to do this because they don't like distributions; they are
refusing to do this because they have found, over and over again, that
this doesn't really work and does cause problems for software authors
(and often users of programs) in the long run.</p>

<p>(The software community that's gone through this experience the
most visibly is Go, which started out with intrinsically unversioned
dependencies that were used universally across all your programs
by default and wound up switching to strongly versioned dependencies
after many people had many problems with that initial state. Go
experienced so many problems that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/FallibleSemverAndMVS">they adopted an unusually strict
and software author friendly versioning scheme</a>.)</p>

<p>It's popular for people to argue that software authors should be doing
this work anyway even if the distributions weren't asking for it,
so them actually doing it is no big deal. This is quite convenient
for the people making the argument, but it doesn't make the argument
valid. Software authors don't owe anyone any work what so ever; they
do whatever work serves their needs and is interesting to them. With
limited time and interest, it's both rational and proper for software
authors to optimize for their own development.</p>

<p>PS: Generally distributions also want some combination of all software
to update to the latest version of their dependencies and for
dependencies to explicitly support older versions. This is also extra
work for software authors, especially when the distribution also wants
it to happen for older versions of programs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>Time has washed up more than some lost films</strong> as regards the life of Fritz Lang. Recent research has cast a new light on Lang’s first marriage and while the private lives of screen personalities rarely interest me, in this case it has already affected how his films are being viewed by at least by one recent biographer. The events concerning his first wife occurred either in the post-production of “Das wandernde Bild” or “Vier um die Frau” or the pre-production of “Der müde Tod,” although even that is a guess.</p><p><strong>Lang’s first wife was named Lisa Rosenthal</strong> although no source is absolutely positive about that and she is described – in some accounts – as a “Russian from Vilnius.” Little else is known about her and it is not her life that is fascinating as much as it is her death. One reference that I found was in Robert A. Armour’s <em>Fritz Lang</em>, published by Twayne Publishers in 1977. Armour wrote, “[Fritz] Lang divorced his first wife and married [Thea] von Harbou.”</p><p><strong>Lang didn’t divorce Lisa Rosenthal.</strong> Rosenthal died of a gunshot wound to the chest and therein hangs a tale that Lang left behind when he fled from Germany in 1933. The story is told in Patrick McGilligan’s <em>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast </em>and the recap goes something like this: Thea von Harbou was married to actor Rudolf Klien-Rogge and when her affair with Lang – that was no secret to the film community – heated up, she moved out of her home with Klien-Rogge and moved into the same apartment building as Fritz Lang. One day Lisa Rosenthal comes home unexpectedly and finds Lang and Harbou engaged in “violent petting,” as Lang described it later, on the sofa. Shortly thereafter, Rosenthal is found dead in the bathtub from a gunshot to the chest delivered by Lang’s WWI sidearm that he kept as a memento. Phone calls were made but it wasn’t the police that were called immediately and suspicions flew. Harbou and Lang swore that Rosenthal shot herself and there was little the police could do and Lang and Harbou were charged with denial of assistance although that charge was soon dropped.&nbsp;</p><div id="Layer4">
    <p><strong>Suspicion fell on Lang that he had shot Lisa Rosenthal</strong> and émigrés brought that story to Hollywood years later although only in hushed tones and never when Lang was within earshot. No one has ever suggested that Thea von Harbou was in any way involved although obviously, if Lang killed his wife, von Harbou was some sort of accomplice even if only after-the-fact. What’s interesting in all of this is that so little is known about von Harbou. </p>
    <p><strong>There is talk that after “Der müde Tod”</strong> was finished Lang was committed to an insane asylum for a brief stay. Lang would mention in interviews that he visited insane asylums as a part of his research. The truth is lost to time. At this point all that remains is stories and gossip. Patrick McGilligan wrote, “No record of an inquest – no record, even, of Lisa Rosenthal’s death – could be found in the course of research for [<em>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast</em>].” Studio executives – including Erich Pommer – showed up at the scene and much like Hollywood moguls they influenced and cajoled the police to protect their star. </p>
    <p><strong>Frederick Ott in <em>The Films of Fritz Lang</em></strong> describes the death of the unnamed Frau Lang as an “apparent” suicide. Lotte Eisner in <em>Fritz Lang </em>states that Lang’s wife “committed suicide” and wrote in her biography <em>Ich hatte einst ein schones Vaterland: Memoiren</em>, published in 1984 and never translated into English: “[Lisa Rosenthal] then went into the bedroom [sic] and shot herself.” </p>
    <p><strong>McGilligan states: “Perhaps suicide</strong> was such a familiar condition in his mind that it leapt to Fritz Lang’s tongue unbidden when the police arrived at his apartment on that fateful day, asking him to explain the inexplicable.” McGilligan bases this assumption on the content of Lang’s work stating that: “From the first film to the last, guilt, complicity, false accusation, irredeemable crime, inadvertent killings, and suicide haunt Lang’s work.” All of that is true except for the “guilt” and McGilligan seems to skip over the murders in Lang’s films. What “leapt to Fritz Lang’s tongue” implies that something else had occurred and there is only one other possibility. McGilligan then writes: “After the death of Lisa Rosenthal, the litany [of suicides in Lang’s films] is compelling.” McGilligan then lists the suicides in Lang’s films and describes them as “unmistakable thematic statements.” </p>
    <p><strong>According to one study of Weimar films,</strong> the three major themes in the top 25% of the films were guilt [about starting WWI], generational issues and suicide. Suicide was common in the films of Weimar as it would be later in films in France and Asia. It began to wane in the years of the Hays Code in the United States.</p>
    <p><strong>To attempt to solve whether Lisa Rosenthal’s death</strong> was murder or suicide by the content of the films Fritz Lang made after the event – especially the Hollywood films where Lang rarely had influence over the script – doesn’t make for a compelling case. Especially since a list of murders in Lang’s films would run even longer than a list of suicides. </p>
    <p><strong>Then again, a pistol being</strong> within grasping range shows up in Lang’s films quite often. McGilligan has produced an excellent biography of Lang and presents research that helps to understand the times that Lang lived. Where the author isn’t as impressive is in his understanding of the films and filmmaking as an art (eg, his description of the ending of “Spione” is inaccurate). There is no Hollywood ending to this story, no convenient set of symbols pointing to a resolution. There is only a dead woman with a gunshot chest wound bleeding in a bathtub and a lot of unanswered questions. That’s the end of the story. </p>

<p>According to aviation expert Joris Melkert, it is a special incident: “<em>I cannot remember a recent case in the Netherlands where parts of an engine fell down.</em>”</p>
<p>The cause of the incident is unknown. The engine may have sucked up something causing the turbine blades to break. This is what the debris looks like, says the airport spokesman.</p>
<p>The police are calling on people to leave the debris behind, in connection with recording the damage.</p>
<p>The Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid (Dutch Safety Board) has started an exploratory investigation.</p>
<p>Spotter Aubrey Verbaere was present at Liège Airport when the Longtail Boeing 747 landed and provided <em>Aviation24.be</em> with the following pictures:</p>
