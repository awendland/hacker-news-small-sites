<section>
    
    <article>
        <p>I've been writing on this blog for about 2 years now. This has been the longest I've stuck on to the same <em>technology stack</em> for my blog. I've previously jumped from a Jekyll based static site to a Medium blog before finally settling for <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>I've been using Hugo since 2018 but I don't recall as to <em>why</em> I went ahead with it. Maybe it was increasingly popular at that time and everyone touted Hugo as <em>the</em> solution to Static Site Generator (referred to as SSG from here on). There are 1000s of SSGs and at least a dozen of websites which lists all the SSGs out there. This is crazy by any standards. Hugo started as a generic blog generator but over the years it has become a <em>website generator</em>. It's no longer aimed at people who just want to have a small little static website/blog but supports all the use cases for people building full-fledged static websites. IMHO these two goals are overarching however this has resulted in a simple project to become incredibly complex over time.</p>
<h3 id="tipping-point">Tipping Point</h3>
<p>Anyway, so I wanted to change the look of the homepage on my website so I decided to look at Hugo's documentation. Hugo's documentation is great for someone who knows what exactly are they looking for. The documentation is so huge that you simply cannot grok it in one evening. I had zero ideas on how to customise the damn homepage of my blog and after spending hours buried in the documentation I was able to kind of figure the solution but it was unintuitive, to say the least. Apparently, to override any template from the theme, you have to mirror the directory structure of the theme in your root directory. Which meant, I needed to look at the source code of the theme, figure out the project structure, copy-paste all the folder names and put my override of <code>index.html</code> there. Which, BTW <strong>magically</strong> overrides it. This whole magic thing is BS and I am being strongly opinionated here.</p>
<p>There is more than one way to do something in Hugo. Different theme authors use different styles, which makes the whole thing even more complex. It also means for my customisations to work across themes, well you guessed it right: <strong>it's impossible</strong>.</p>
<p>Recently I discovered that I was unable to preview my Hugo website locally without internet because I had a Twitter <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#tweet">shortcode</a> in one of my blog post (which makes an API call to Twitter to render a nice card preview). The site completely failed to render instead of just logging a warning. Bollocks.</p>
<p>The tipping point for me, however, was when the theme I was using stopped working with the latest version of Hugo at that point. So, picture this -- You make dozens of custom changes and then one update just <em>breaks</em> your website. Now not only you have to fix your shit but the theme you were using, you've to make upstream changes to the theme or maintain your own fork. And no, this is not a one-off experience. Hugo upgrades are a joke, they are known to break very very often.</p>
<p>I was done at this point. I didn't want to deal with this BS of continuously fighting the generator for my blog.</p>
<h3 id="a-fresh-change">A fresh change</h3>
<p>Being a practitioner of <a href="https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">Yak Shaving</a>, I discussed the idea of a "tinyhugo" with <a href="https://nadh.in/">Kailash</a> and <a href="https://www.saratchandra.in/">Sarat</a>. We'd arrived at a spec and I started writing some code to pander to my NIH syndrome.</p>
<p>However, I was still not convinced that a simpler solution doesn't exist. I spent countless hours exploring other alternatives. I'd used <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a>, <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> before finally stumbling upon <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> from HN/Lobster discussions. I've got to say, the landing page gave a <em>fresh</em> feeling - one that I've not seen with any other alternatives. In fact quite opposite to the Eleventy landing page which looks like an over-engineered piece of software to generate websites (Not hating on it, there might be use cases for it, but the JS tooling and dependency system is something that I would not want to touch with a 10ft pole).</p>
<p>Zola's primary appeal to me was that like Hugo it's extremely fast and comes as a single binary no dependency package. I looked at the docs the first impression was they are concise enough to get a basic idea. Zola is strongly opinionated, even to the extent of dictating a project structure and sometimes filenames too. I actually preferred this over the <em>magic</em> Hugo does. In less than 2 hours I was able to port the home page of my blog (and tweak it to my liking) in Zola. I decided to abandon my own <code>tinyhugo</code> attempt because for the very fact Zola fits my needs very well.</p>
<p>The thing that I really loved about Zola is how it enforces a separation between <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/">Section</a> and <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/">Pages</a>. The section represents a "collection" of posts. So a <em>blog</em> can be a section, and I can have another section called "Book Reviews". I could easily tell Zola where to look for the templates by specifying the same in <code>content/book_reviews/_index.md</code>. I don't have to read Hugo docs or do <em>Google-fu</em> to figure this out, it's right there in the docs and very apparent.</p>
<p>For the record, I still don't know how to customise different templates for different sections in Hugo, but I couldn't care less.</p>
<h3 id="migration">Migration</h3>
<p>The migration was pretty straightforward -- I had to copy the <code>content folder</code>s of my blog (which are just a bunch of <code>.md</code> fikes) and replace <code>YAML</code> frontmatter to <code>TOML</code>. There were a few variable changes that I needed to do manually but since they were a manageable 20-25 posts, I did it by hand. I could potentially automate but then rabbit deep in the rabbit hole of Yak Shaving. The good part was that I was able to retain the same URL structure for my new blog because the URL scheme was based on the file paths.</p>
<p>I spent some time porting <a href="https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink">hugo-ink</a> to Zola and did minor CSS tweaks to it. Zola uses the Terra language for templating and it's much more pleasing to eyes than the Go Template syntax. Zola comes with pretty neat features like Search, RSS/Atom Feeds, Syntax Highlighting and SASS-&gt;CSS Processors.</p>
<p>What took me time however was to figure out how to get <code>opengraph</code> tags in each page. Hugo provides nifty <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/opengraph.html">template</a> for this use case but Zola is pretty barebones like that. People who care a lot about SEO need to spend some extra efforts here.</p>
<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>Zola is still a pretty new kid on the block but the author shares the same frustration about Hugo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it personally drives me insane, to the point of writing my own template engine and static site generator. Yes, this is a bit biased. -- <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola#-explanations">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also reflects in the issues/PRs I've seen for Zola and the author is opinionated about not adding features which would make Zola complicated. Overall I am very happy with the switch and it was long due. I feel more confident in tweaking certain sections of my website. I plan to open-source the current theme in the next few days.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://git.mrkaran.dev/karan/website">Source Code</a> of this website if you'd like to explore how this website is built.</p>
<p>Fin!</p>

<![CDATA[Parsing the Infamous Japanese Postal CSV]]>
            </title>

November 7, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/posuto.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/posuto.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Late last year I released <a href="https://github.com/polm/posuto">posuto</a>, a package presenting Japanese postal code
data in an easy-to-use format. It's based on <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/kogaki-zip.html">data released by Japan
Post</a>, which is infamous for being widely used but hard to parse.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/806ae69c/postcharacter.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/806ae69c/img/postcharacter.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>This adorable character by <a href="https://www.irasutoya.com/2019/08/blog-post_590.html">Irasutoya</a> is cute, but the raw postal CSV data is not.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>I first became aware of the postal data when I entered my postal code in an
online form and it auto-completed my address as "XXX-borough (except the
following buildings)". I had no idea what that parenthetical was referring to,
so I looked for a common source of postal data, found the CSV, and found the
issue.  It turns out the CSV file contains parenthetical notes for anyone
reading the CSV file and makes reference to the order of the rows.</p>
<p>This causes problems. The data is mainly useful one row at a time, where the
parenthetical is meaningless. Since CSV is a field-delimited format, there's
also no need for parentheticals - you could just add a note field.</p>
<p>This is only one of many issues with <code>ken_all.csv</code>. You can find people
complaining about it regularly <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ken_all.csv&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">on Twitter</a>, and there was
even briefly <a href="http://ken-all.hatenadiary.com/">a blog</a> just collecting posts from all over the web
about it. A <a href="https://twitter.com/bulkneets/status/1259457777862184966">particularly amusing tweet</a> describes people who expect
computers to bend to the will of humans being punished in Hell by having to
parse <code>ken_all.csv</code> forever.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/readme.html">README</a> for the file explains that lines with overly long fields will be
broken up into multiple lines. Specifically, if the neighborhood name is over
38 characters, or if the half-width katakana (<em>half-width katakana</em>)
pronunciation field is over 76 characters, the line will be split into two
lines. The overly-long neighborhood field will be continued and all other
fields will be duplicated. This is an abbreviated sample of what that looks
like:</p>
<pre><code>12345,Tokyo,Minato,This place name is really
12345,Tokyo,Minato,very long it didn't fit in
12345,Tokyo,Minato,a single line so we had to 
12345,Tokyo,Minato,split it
</code></pre>
<p>The motivation for this is not explained. Maybe there was a fixed-width buffer
for storing a line somewhere thirty years ago. I used to process CSV and other
files from hundreds of different providers at an old job and I saw many
horrors, but I've never seen this particular formatting choice anywhere else.
It should also be noted that while the length limits are as stated, the
location where line breaks are inserted in long lines appears random, occurring
neither at the character limit nor at normal word boundaries.</p>
<p>It's worth noting not all the issues with the CSV are inherently technical;
postal codes are always complicated. The postal code with the most rows in the
CSV - a stunning 66 - is 〒452-0961, which refers to the <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%98%A5%E6%97%A5%E7%94%BA_(%E6%84%9B%E7%9F%A5%E7%9C%8C)">Haruhi region</a> of
Kiyosu City in Aichi Prefecture. This has that many lines because every
neighborhood gets a separate line. (This particular case may be related to Haruhi
having been the smallest town by area in Japan from 2006 until 2009, when it
was incorporated into Kiyosu City.)</p>
<p>In contrast, the longest <em>continued</em> line, using the line break rules above, is
the entry for 〒602-8368 or 〒602-8374, both with eight lines. These are both in
one of a few areas in Kyoto that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system#Kyoto">a unique, bizarre system of
intersection-based addressing</a>. The entry looks a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code>12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"North Town (Up Lower Godsroad from"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"the West, Down Turtle Street from the"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"East, Up Old Temple Road from the"
12345,Kyoto,Kyoto,"West)"
</code></pre>
<p>I have used quoted fields here, but the actual CSV doesn't quote fields and
instead uses a different kind of comma.</p>
<p>There are other issues. There are catch-all postal codes for many areas, where
the neighborhood is given as "except the following", and the only thing to do
is look for that exact string and exclude it. There's a variety of similar
strings, and it's hard to be sure I've caught them all.</p>
<p>An example of another comment is 一円. Normally this would mean "one yen", but
it also means "the area surrounding", and is a note in the CSV that should be
removed from neighborhood names, <em>except</em> for exactly one neighborhood in Shiga where
that's actually the name (〒522-0317).</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/roman.html">separate romaji file</a> offered by JP Post. It's updated
less frequently than the main files, is often out of sync, and the provided
romaji are extremely low quality. For the moment I'm still providing the data
in posuto in the name of consistency, but honestly you should just use
<a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/nlp/cutlet-python-romaji-converter.html">cutlet</a>. To give an example of bad romaji:</p>
<pre><code>大手町 JAビル
OTEMACHI JIEIEIBIRU
</code></pre>
<p>What's happening here is that "JA" is being converted to the phonetic reading
in Japanese, "ジェイエイ". Then ジェ, which is written "large ji small e" but
pronounced "je", is being converted to "jie" by treating the small character as
though it were large, and the other characters are translated as-is, turning
something already in the latin alphabet into alphabet soup. For contrast,
cutlet has no problem converting "JAビル" into "JA building" (case handling
admittedly needs some work still). Similar issues turn "Roppongi Hills" into
"Roppongihiruzu", and "Sweden Hills" into "Suedenhiruzu".</p>
<p>Anyway, dealing with the file was a humbling lesson in the amount of complexity
it's possible to pack into one place. I've glossed over many details, but you
can find them covered in posuto's README.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/polm/posuto">posuto</a> as a library, or if you're not using Python, just
download the pre-processed JSON and make use of that. If you find a good use
for it I'd be delighted to hear about it.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you need a Win3.1 or DOS program to copy the data onto an IBM H
floppy disk, just check the bottom of <a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/dl/kogaki-zip.html">JP Post's page</a> - they've
got you covered. Ψ</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Web technologies have come so far, that you realize: not everything needs to be done in JavaScript nowadays anymore.</p><blockquote><p><em>»Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.« — Confucius</em></p></blockquote><p>My initial headline would have been:</p><p><em>How I wrote more JavaScript in the backend to eliminate JavaScript in the frontend.</em></p><p>But that's already a mouthful and also would have revealed too much and you might not have clicked my slightly clickbait-y title, right?</p><p>So here is my Public Service Announcement:</p><p> 📣 <strong>This site does not use any frontend JavaScript.<sup>*</sup></strong></p><p><em><small>*) There are only tiny exceptions on 2 pages, but for a good reason. More on that later.</small></em></p><p>First of all I am not against JavaScript (<span>JS</span>) at all. If you're building a web <strong>application</strong>, then this is not only totally fine but most likely a core requirement.</p><p>But I do have my pet peeve with <span>JS</span> for plain websites and blogs. Currently there is still such a strong draught in the static site generator world, telling us all our sites should be some kind of React or other frontend framework based project (looking at you, Gatsby, Next, Nuxt, VuePress, …). That you need to have that plentyful of code running in the browser of your visitors to have a smooth and <em>feels like a native app</em> user experience. That a site should be a <em>Single Page Application (SPA).</em> I can tell you, a plain HTML+CSS website does it really well, too. Surprise!</p><p>While on one hand the browser vendors add more and more <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a>, we also got a lot of improvement in the HTML and CSS area. Usually there is no big hype train around them, unless you are very enthusiastic and live in that niche.</p><p>Take a look at <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a> to get an idea what is possible today and what might come tomorrow. <em>Did you know that HTML5 is still iterated on and we're moving towards <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/">version 5.3</a>?</em> On the other hand »HTML 5« is also used as an umbrella term for a <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org/" title="WHATWG Standards">wide variety of standards</a>. Also for CSS the story got very interesting: while CSS until 2.1 was a single specification, since CSS 3 there is a whole potpourri of recommendations and drafts. The <a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/spec">wiki of the CSS Working Group</a> might be a good starting point for further discovery.</p><p>But I want to give you some more practical examples and an experience report:</p><h2 id="sticky-navigation-bar">Sticky navigation bar</h2><p>This is something you can observe here on this blog:</p><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline=""><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.hvec.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=hvc1"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.hvec.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=hevc"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.h264.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=avc1"><source src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/pos-sticky.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=vp9"></video><p>The key ingredient is the CSS <code>position: sticky</code> <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-sticky">🛈</a>. Even though most of them are labeled as <em>partial support,</em> this property value can be used in most scenarios except in some table related cases. If you want a sticky menu after scrolling and use only elements like <code>div</code> everything is just fine. I could throw away all the code for that after I realized that none of the common and modern browsers had any blocking issues. So I did. The only real latecomers were the web view components, no big deal for me here.</p><h3 id="before">Before</h3><h4 id="javascript">JavaScript</h4><pre><code><span>const </span><span>navbar </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.querySelector(</span><span>'.navbar'</span><span>);

At the core of PWAs sit <a href="https://serviceworke.rs/">Service Workers (SW)</a>, though you can use SW also without building an app. And that's what I was aiming for, but in the end my home-grown dynamic cache solution was more annoying to me than helpful for anyone else.

I'm sure some people probably see visual inconsistencies due to a still running service worker in their browser.

This is pretty useful for slow internet connections; living here in Germany I know how difficult this situation can be. That thing called internet is still very Neuland to us. 🤦</p><p>Anyway, <code>SQIP</code> can be translated with »<code>SVG</code>-based <code>LQIP</code>.«</p><p><code>SVG</code> are Scalable Vector Graphics, an image format I really love a lot, my logo is done with it (<a href="https://markentier.tech/posts/2018/05/minimalism-focus-clean-redesign/">I wrote about it a while ago</a>).</p><p>LQIP finally stands for <em>»Low Quality Image Placeholders«</em> and is based on an algorithm to find primitive shapes to describe the source image. Basically try to find only a few triangles, rectangles, circles, ellipsis, and other low poly shapes. It is also an art form in its own, you can enjoy some <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive#static-animation">nice examples there</a>. The advantage of SVG is that it is made to encode such figures in very few characters of human readable text, so a less complex image for a placeholder can be written in one kilobyte or less.</p><p>Compared to the original high resolution image which can easily weigh half a megabyte and more this is great. You can reserve the space in your page and very early in the loading process display some visual hint that there will be a proper picture soon. Especially for types which do not support progessive loading (as JPEG can) using SQIP/LQIP placeholders makes a lot of sense.</p><p>In this scenario at first it was not really about saving frontend <span>JS</span>, more about saving it on the backend site and replacing it with something else. Unfortunately in between some code creeped into the frontend anyway.</p><p>But what happened that this beautiful technique fell out of favor with me?</p><h3 id="picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></h3><p>Enter another interesting HTML tag combo: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></a> with <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>.</p><p>So one reason to use small low quality placeholders is because before such tags became a thing we solely relied on a single <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and some trickery with CSS (and sometimes aided by sprinkles of JavaScript). I tried to avoid <span>JS</span> completely, but of course I had to use some styling hacks eventually.</p><p>The essence of it was some style attached to the image in question:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>img </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"highres-and-heavy.png"
     </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>background-size</span><span>: </span><span>cover</span><span>;
            </span><span>background-image</span><span>: </span><span>url</span><span>(</span><span>'data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2…'</span><span>);</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Usually in some post processing all style attributes were collected
     into a &lt;style&gt; tag or CSS file. --&gt;
</span></code></pre><p>The JavaScript entered this scenery at one point: after I used images with transparency. Sadly with this background image workaround you would've seen the low quality placeholder through the transparent parts, and this was extremly ugly to be honest. I could not stand it and deployed some snippet to trigger a background removal once the actual image was loaded:</p><pre><code><span>// remove the background image styling, so transparent images won't have
// strange SQIP artefacts shining through
</span><span>document</span><span>.querySelectorAll(
  </span><span>"img[loading=lazy][class]:not(.thumbnail):not(.loaded)"
</span><span>).forEach((</span><span>img</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
  </span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>onload </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>_event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>img.className </span><span>= </span><span>"loaded"</span><span>;
});
</span><span>document</span><span>.querySelectorAll(
  </span><span>"img[loading=lazy].thumbnail:not(.loaded)"
</span><span>).forEach((</span><span>img</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
  </span><span>img</span><span>.</span><span>onload </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>_event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>img.className </span><span>= </span><span>"thumbnail loaded"</span><span>;
});
</span></code></pre><p>Theoretically it would have been tolerable, but I noticed some strange behaviour once I started wrapping my images into <code>picture</code> tags.</p><p>Let's <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">shave the yak</a> a bit further to understand why.</p><h4 id="webp-and-avif">WEBP and AVIF</h4><p><em>Come on, more acronyms?</em> I'm sorry, the web is a place with a lot of them.</p><p>All you need to know for now is that both of them are pretty modern image formats with quite good (lossy) compression rates while keeping a respectable quality. <a href="https://caniuse.com/webp"><code>WEBP</code></a> has been around for some time and most of the browsers do support it. <a href="https://caniuse.com/avif"><code>AVIF</code></a> is extremly new and right now only Chrome since version 85 and Opera 71 can display them. Firefox has a configuration flag, maybe they will enable it by default pretty soon.</p><p>So the current situation is that I have my original image (PNG or JPEG in most cases), a WEBP version, an AVIF version, and the SQIP placeholder. How do I deal with it? Back to our <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> tag:</p><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>picture</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>source </span><span>srcset</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.avif" </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/avif"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>source </span><span>srcset</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.webp" </span><span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"image/webp"</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>img </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"./cover.png"
       </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/* SQIP data: see example above */</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>picture</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><p>You can also use source sets for different view sizes based on media queries, but in my case I'm mainly concerned about supporting different image formats. My idea is to prioritize the formats with the smallest file size first, and given the compression ratios the order is usually: AVIF, WEBP, PNG/JPG. Not in every case will this be true; WEBP does not always have better savings then a decently compressed JPEG for example. AVIF has not disappointed so far, but sadly a part of my visitors will not see the effect yet.</p><p>What did not really happen anymore was a display of the placeholder before the final image was loaded. I experimented for quite some time until I realized that I do not want to spent more energy any further.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://markentier.tech/posts/2020/10/wrote-javascript-to-avoid-javascript/sizes-png-webp-avif.w.png" alt="Size comparison of an example image; PNG original (22 KB), WEBP (14 KB, 37% saved), AVIF (7.3 KB, 67% saved)" width="1024" height="120" loading="lazy"></picture></p><p>I made a <em>risk-return tradeoff</em> compromise and got rid of SQIP altogether. For the growing number of AVIF support the images are sometimes significantly smaller which makes it acceptable to allow for some display delay anyway.</p><p>In the following screenshot the JPEG was the source photo. The PNG was created for some transparency stuff; of course, for photos this format does not really make a lot of sense in general. Sadly also WEBP fails to compete in this scenario. That's why I have to make this picture group generation a bit smarter soon to reorder based on the actual file …</p></div></div>

<p>Recently I’ve got into the idea of building a personal platform for myself. By that I mean a system which makes it easy to distribute new things I’m working on and a way to grow the group of people who could be interested in what I’m working on.</p>



<h2>How I’m going about building a platform</h2>



<ol><li>Leveraging what I already have<ol><li>I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjRhOxof_h24gemf8If3Klw?view_as=subscriber">YouTube channel</a> with a following</li><li>I have a network from my personal and professional life</li></ol></li><li>More content<ol><li>This blog</li><li>“Computer Security: Attacking and defending web apps” course on Udemy (because my most successful content on YouTube is about Cyber Security and I’ve had a lot of demand for making a video on how to write shell code)</li><li><a href="https://scenario95.com/">Scenario95</a></li></ol></li><li>Creating a pipeline which I use for all new content<ol><li>Send an email to followers of my platform</li><li>Sharing on several platforms including: Facebook, HackerNews, Reddit, Twitter, and LinkedIn</li></ol></li></ol>



<h2>Why I’m doing this?</h2>



<p>When coming up with new ideas I’ve noticed that I often base them around what I already have access to and natural advantages I’ve got. For example when on a course topic for Udemy, I referred to the YouTube video which I released 4 years ago… and I’ve realised that since finishing university I haven’t done a good job of continuing to create things like this.</p>







<p>This is something I’m new to and and still learning the ropes so if you’ve got any advice please leave it in the comments below. </p>



<p>If you want to follow my adventure then subscribe to my platform! </p>

                    <p>I had a problem. I wanted public documentation with open collaboration, but I couldn't afford most of the products out there. As a startup we need to keep lean, and adding a paid documentation/knowledge base service is an expense I don't want to have to try to recover.</p><p>So we're moving all of our product documentation into public Github repositories, as it's the cheapest option with it being free 😉</p><p>The first repository is here, for our Signata MFA product: <a href="https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs">https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs</a></p><h3 id="why-github">Why Github?</h3><p>As much as I find it frustrating to write documentation in markdown (writing is easy, dealing with screenshots is clunky), the benefits of having a publicly accessible repository for documentation far outweighs my frustration.</p><p>I want to make sure documentation isn't sitting behind paywalls or needing a sign up. In fact, forcing people to sign up to read it has created a ton of accounts in our system that don't actually get used, which is an inconvenience for both parties.</p><p>The best part of putting it into Github is now there's the ability to collaborate - if you find a problem, or ambiguous statement, or you want something added, you can now directly interact with the content to submit pull requests or open issues.</p><p>We've also put a link to the documentation onto the Signata MFA website in a few places, which you'll also notice has undergone some rebranding:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/11/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image.png 600w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image.png 1000w, https://blog.congruentlabs.co/content/images/2020/11/image.png 1458w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It's actually quite expensive to run an online knowledgebase in most instances. <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a> would've been the ideal choice, but it's only free for open source projects, and at this stage we don't yet have plans to open source our products. I could've spun up a self-hosted service like Dokuwiki, but that would be an additional $10/month of operating costs, as well as the administrative overhead for keeping it up to date.</p><p>An alternative we thought about was to use publicly accessible Google Docs, but they lose the ability to be indexed by search engines for people to actually find these guides. There's not much use to public documentation if it's not actually discoverable by the public.</p><h3 id="signata-mfa-presentation">Signata MFA Presentation</h3><p>I've also thrown a presentation that we put together about Signata MFA into the repository as well. <a href="https://github.com/cl-tim/signata-mfa-docs/blob/main/signata-mfa-overview-presentation.pdf">You can find it here</a> - it'll give you a quick overview of the product, it's capabilities, it's pricing, and how to get in contact with us.</p><p>Have you looked at Signata MFA? <a href="https://mfa.signata.net/">You can check it out by clicking here</a>. You can try it for free for a month, no credit card required.</p>

<p>In 1790, the gap between the smallest and largest states was about 10x. Today, the most populous state, California, is about 70x more populous than the least populous state, Wyoming. A resident of California, New York, Florida, or Texas has no effective impact on the Senate impact, and a resident of a smaller state Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, the Dakotas, Delaware, Rhode Island, or Maine has a disproportionate impact on the Senate.</p>
<p>While the Electoral College favors smaller states as well, it is still mostly driven by membership in the House of Representatives, which is proportionate to population. That’s unfair—the popular vote loser became president in 2000 and 2016— but it’s far less unfair than the even-more-undemocratic Senate.</p>
<p><strong>The Senate has become the defining slow-motion crisis of American democracy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The US Senate could be the <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/senate-washington-dc-puerto-rico-statehood-filibuster-obama-biden-racist.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">most structurally racist institution</a>.</strong> In the 1960s, Black people from the South <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3162/036298006X201869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">migrated to populous Northern states</a>, eroding their political representation in the Senate. Similarly, recent decades have seen <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3162/036298006X201869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">growing Latinx populations in urban areas</a>, primarily located in populous states. As a result, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/opinion/dc-puerto-rico-statehood-senate.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">David Leonhardt found</a> that whites have 0.35 Senators per million people, Blacks have 0.26, Asian-Americans 0.25, and Latinos just 0.19.</li>
<li><strong>Partisanship and rule changes have caused the problem to boil over.</strong> According to <a href="https://govtrackinsider.com/the-senate-has-never-been-as-un-democratic-as-it-was-in-2017-2018-and-minority-rule-could-801e1046af28" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a 2018 analysis</a>, the Senate has never been as undemocratic as it was in 2017-2018. According to this analysis, “in 2017, for the first time, the Senate’s decisions were often made by a coalition of states representing less than half of the country’s population. The median share of senators supporting passed bills, confirmed judges and agency leaders, and other matters dropped to 58% (the lowest since 1930), with those senators representing just 49.5% of the U.S. population (the lowest ever)!”</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time for us to revisit the Connecticut Compromise, the Devil’s Bargain that allowed for the adoption of the Constitution at the expense of a democratic Senate.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-role-of-the-senate"><a href="#whats-the-role-of-the-senate" aria-label="whats the role of the senate permalink"></a>What’s the Role of the Senate?</h2>
<p>The Senate is a smaller, more deliberative body than the House of Representatives. You have to be 30 years old to run for the Senate, and in 1790, you would have had an average life expectancy of about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2885717/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">45 years</a>. Indeed, “Senator” comes from the Latin word “senex,” which means “senior” or “old man.”</p>
<p>Senators run on staggered 6-year terms, not the 2-year term of the House. That means that their terms exceed presidential terms and—unlike representatives—they don’t have to run in every election. While there are 435 representatives in the House, there are only 100 senators. Unlike members of the House, Senate representatives were meant to be appointed by the state legislatures, a process that changed after the 17th amendment in 1913. This meant that the Senate was meant to be a kind of U.N.-but-with-teeth for 13 (and now 50) coequal sovereigns.</p>
<p>These features—insulation from short-term political pressure and a more selective and deliberative group of representatives—are unrelated to the two-per-state design of the US Senate, and don’t benefit from it.</p>

<p>Some people defend the Connecticut Compromise as an enduring legacy of founder wisdom. But the Connecticut Compromise wasn’t meant to be wise, it was meant to be pragmatic. </p>
<p>Seven weeks into the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the founders were at an impasse.</p>
<p>Many large states felt that representation should be proportional to population in Congress. As larger states would be contributing more to the treasury and defense, they felt that should have more say.</p>
<p>Smaller states like Delaware and Rhode Island—and representatives from certain larger but slower-growing states like New York (except for Alexander Hamilton, of course)—weren’t having it, and had leverage. These states enjoyed authority and autonomy under the Articles of Confederation. Proportionate representation—plus anticipation of a rapidly growing South and West—would erode their political power.</p>
<p>Connecticut delegates Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, with the support of Benjamin Franklin, struck a compromise: a bicameral (two-chambered) legislature, with one chamber, the House of Representatives, allocating seats in proportion to population, and the other chamber, the Senate, allocated evenly by state. Benjamin Franklin proposed that the House originate all revenue matters.</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton hated it. Writing in Federalist 22:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its operation contradicts the fundamental maxim of republican government, which requires that the sense of the majority should prevail. Sophistry may reply, that sovereigns are equal, and that a majority of the votes of the States will be a majority of confederated America. But this kind of logical legerdemain will never counteract the plain suggestions of justice and common-sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madison, in Federalist 62, didn’t want to defend it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision to allocate Senate seats was a compromise needed to ratify the Constitution and satisfice an existing power structure—nothing more.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-the-hardest-thing-to-change-about-the-constitution"><a href="#this-is-the-hardest-thing-to-change-about-the-constitution" aria-label="this is the hardest thing to change about the constitution permalink"></a>This is the Hardest Thing to Change about the Constitution</h2>
<p>One possible mechanism of reform is amending the Constitution. Suppose you wanted to change the Senate to allocate seats in proportion to population. Not so fast—Article V of the Constitution writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution,</strong> or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; <strong>and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Article V articulates a state right—equal suffrage in the Senate—that cannot be deprived through the Constitutional change process. Put differently: you can change anything in the Constitution (after 1808) through amendments or a convention, but you cannot change this aspect of the Connecticut Compromise.</p>
<p>In practice, even Justice Scalia <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/the-weirdest-sentence-in-the-u-s-constitution" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">once remarked</a> that he didn’t see how the Supreme Court could declare a properly proposed and ratified Constitutional amendment unconstitutional. It is unclear how a future Supreme Court might view a dispute around this kind of Constitutional amendment, although any well-written amendment would begin by changing Article V.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this speed bump, passing constitutional amendments requires the consent of 3/4 of the states, meaning that the 12 least populous states could block any Senate reform amendment.</p>

<p>An improvement to the representation problem has the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is legal. In this sense, legal means that it would survive a challenge in the Supreme Court in which the justices were approved by a partisan Senate.</li>
<li>It preserves the “deliberative” aspects of the Senate.</li>
<li>It reduces population inequality in the Senate.</li>
<li>It is politically tractable.</li>
</ul>
<p>A better solution to this problem has these additional properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>New statehood, or reorganized statehood, is incentive-compatible. That means that citizens of prospective new states (Puerto Rico, for instance) should have the opportunity to form a state and be admitted to the Senate without disproportionately diluting power.</li>
<li>Senate proportionality is robust to population shifts. If Wyoming became a booming population center, then Wyoming should have more Senate representation.</li>
<li>It decreases wasted votes and reduces the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/How_the_Efficiency_Gap_Standard_Works.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">efficiency gap</a>.

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Especially after COVID-19 began plaguing the planet, QR codes have been a big part of our daily lives. In this day and age, it’s quite impossible for one to have never seen a QR code, or used one. Even before the pandemic, QR codes had been around us for a while, but many of us — having grown up in the Digital Age — simply accept new technology into our lives without wondering too much about how they work. For most of us, QR codes just look like... square pixelated versions of the alien heptapod symbols in Arrival (2016), that somehow, magically (and really quickly) bring us to a different screen when we scan them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So what are these cryptic codes? Are they magic? Clearly they’re not, but how do they work? Before we take you in for the ride, let’s get the basics down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QR stands for <em>Quick Response</em>, and a QR code is pretty much a barcode (which has been around since the 1950s) except two-dimensional. Because it’s 2D, it can contain more data than a barcode. It can encode over 7000 characters, which is a vast improvement from the standard barcode with a limited capacity of about 20 alphanumeric characters.</p>
<h2>How did they come about?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In Japan circa 1990s, Denso Wave Incorporated was contacted by manufacturing sites and asked if it was possible to come up with a faster barcode scanning system. This presented a problem as barcodes had a limited capacity, which made the scanning process time consuming for workers no matter how efficient the scanner was. To tackle this, Denso Wave began developing a compact code that can contain more data, including Kanji and Kana characters. The launch of the QR code was later announced in 1994.</p>
<h2>What are they used for?</h2>
<p>The QR code was first used by the auto industry to track parts and products shipped around the globe. Then, gradually, other industries all over the world began joining in. Today, QR codes are used by nearly every physical and digital establishment for quick check-ins, displaying geolocation or contact info, redirecting customers to their websites, etc.</p>
<h2>How do they work?</h2>
<p>Grasping how a QR code works would require understanding the functions of its different parts. With the help of the labelled diagram, we hope to make this palatable for the layman. Let’s break it down.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=715&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png" alt="QR Structure, modules, separators, alignment, timing, format info, version, labels, black and white" width="715" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=358&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 358w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=715&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 715w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1073&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1073w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1430&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1430w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=1788&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 1788w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/QR%20Structure.png?width=2145&amp;name=QR%20Structure.png 2145w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px"></p>

<p>The tiny squares in a QR code are called <em><strong>modules</strong></em> - black squares would be considered foreground modules, and white ones would be background modules. They don’t always have to be black and white, though, they could be in color too. Most QR codes are in black and white only so decoder softwares easily distinguish the contrast between the background and foreground. If you want your QR code to be colorful, you just have to make sure that the contrast is retained when it is in grayscale / black and white.</p>
<p>The bigger the code, the more rows and columns of modules it will contain. Yup, just like humankind, QR codes come in different shapes, sizes and colors (although there are standards to follow).</p>
<p>There are 40 preset sizes (or, <em><strong>versions</strong></em>) to choose from. Version 1 being the smallest type with 21 rows and 21 columns, and Version 40 being the largest with 177 rows and 177 columns. When a generator produces a code for you, it will determine the suitable QR code version number for you depending on the amount of data you are encoding.</p>
<p>The 3 big squares on 3 corners of the QR code are <em><strong>finder patterns</strong></em>, which help your device camera determine the boundaries of the code and its correct orientation. This is so if the code is rotated, or upside-down, decoders would still be able to read it. These finder patterns are surrounded by a single-module spacing called <em><strong>separators</strong></em> which help decoders separate the finder patterns from the code data.</p>
<p>Connecting each finder pattern are <em><strong>timing patterns</strong></em> that alternate between black and white. These lines tell your decoder software how big the data cells are within the code.</p>
<p>The smaller square (that is distinctively not a finder pattern) on the fourth corner is an <em><strong>alignment pattern</strong></em> that helps the decoder prevent image distortions. Level 1 QR codes (the smallest size of QR codes) do not contain alignment patterns. The bigger the code, however, the more alignment patterns are added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 15 bits beside the separators are <em><strong>format and version strings</strong></em> which contain information on the code’s error correction level and the chosen mask pattern for the particular code. Hold on… information on the what and what?</p>
<p><em><strong>Error correction</strong></em> code makes sure that the code is still readable if up to 30% of the code is corrupt. Designers or generators of a code can decide how many levels of error correction they want to include in the code. The higher the level of error correction, the higher percentage of corruption a decoder can read past. However, the higher the level of error correction, the more space it takes up on the QR code, leaving less space for data. In other words, the more space the error correction code takes up, the lower the max numerical characters a QR code can fit. How much error correction a QR code needs probably will depend on where it will be displayed. E.g. A QR code on a paper flyer would need higher error correction than one on a laminated poster placed indoors, and a digital QR code could do with none because it is unlikely to be damaged.</p>
<p>The code is also overlaid by a <em><strong>mask pattern</strong></em>, inverting and retaining certain data areas to “mix it up” / conceal it. Decoder softwares detect the mask type from the format information and demask the QR code before reading the rest of the data. Of course this happens in a matter of milliseconds.</p>
<p><em><strong>Encoded characters </strong></em>- The black and white modules read in a fixed zigzaggy direction (as shown in the image), starting from the bottom right corner, gives the decoder a sequence of data bits that goes something like 001010111…&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Different binary sequences represent different codewords, which include symbols, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, etc. For example, the binary sequence 01110111 represents the letter ‘w’, 00100001 represents the exclamation point ‘!’, and 00100000 represents a space.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you make a QR code?</strong></h2>
<p><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Mi8ate-UiC0ZpKEoRFn8EUpe5bZDS5O6ggTSK96wPR1OTHx_zoKu_dbS5NvJDpPRsDAt9qdHXkQdfo1sm8Jun4Id0dpS3JjSnmOO51mXv6NT1ql7rb5P0DJc01k-kuw9RYw5vMF2" alt="QR code, generated QR code, snappymob website" width="297"></span></p>
<p>Here’s a QR code generated with <a href="http://www.qr-code-generator.com/"><span>www.qr-code-generator.com</span></a>. Do the patterns make a lot more sense to you now? If you can’t answer in confidence, that’s okay. You’re not going to have to make one by hand, ever. (Unless you want to.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are plenty of offline and online QR code generators free for use. All you have to do is key in what you want to encode in the QR code, be it a link to a coupon redemption page, a YouTube video, your social media sites, your contact details, or simply a website homepage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most free QR code generators, though, require you to sign up or subscribe to a plan to gain access to more design options and features, such as error correction levels and insights tracking.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How can QR codes help you?</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you own a business or simply have a web page to share, a QR code could help people reach you easily and quickly. In case you were looking for ideas, here are some of the ways in which using a QR code could greatly benefit you:</p>
<h4><strong>Webpages and Location</strong></h4>
<p>Your customers can get to your website, social media platforms, or map location in a matter of seconds. They don’t have to manually type your website URL, usernames, or addresses into their browsers or maps. They simply need to whip out their phones and scan the QR code to be redirected to you.</p>
<h4><strong>Payment</strong></h4>
<p>Payment is also made easy with QR codes. Most stores enable QR codes for quick payment via e-wallets so customers don’t have to fumble through their wallets for cash and keep others waiting. Some good examples would be GrabPay or ShopeePay, which are enabled at many on and offline merchants in Malaysia.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=648&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg" alt="grabpay, shopeepay, qr code, merchant, scan to pay, app" width="648" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=324&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 324w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=648&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 648w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=972&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 972w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1296&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1296w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1620&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1620w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/grabpayshopeepay.jpg?width=1944&amp;name=grabpayshopeepay.jpg 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"><br>(Image Source: help.shopee.com.my, grab.com)</p>
<h4><strong>Email and Direct Messaging</strong></h4>
<p>You can embed URL links that lead straight to a ‘compose email’ or ‘compose direct message’ page (for instance, <a href="mailto:hello@snappymob.com">mailto:hello@snappymob.com</a>) into your QR code. For email, this saves your customers up to 10 seconds because it helps them skip the process of opening their email app, tapping on compose email, and typing your email address manually into the recipient bar. For social media, this saves them the effort of opening the app, typing your username into the search bar, and tapping on the message button. This might literally be “a matter of seconds” which seems small, but it keeps people who are interested in your services or products, well, interested. Making things quicker and easier for your patrons is always a good move.</p></span></p><p><label>app insights</label></p>

<p>Often times, when you want to compare two videos side-by-side or you want to create an effect during post-processing, you might want to stack videos together. It can get expensive if you end up buying a tool to do this, but, guess what? </p>



<p><strong>FFmpeg offers a variety of tools to help stack videos together – horizontally, vertically, or in a grid fashion. In this tutorial, let’s learn about FFmpeg’s <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters for stacking videos. </strong></p>



<hr>




<h2><span id="How_to_Stack_Videos_Horizontally_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>How to Stack Videos Horizontally using FFmpeg?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Horizontally stacking videos” refers to placing videos side-by-side (one on the left and the other on the right). </p>



<p>Before you do this, there are a couple of points that you need to consider. </p>



<ol><li>The videos that you want to stack need to have the same height. </li><li> The videos need to have the same pixel format. </li></ol>



<p>The command line is shown below where we try and stack two <code>mp4</code> videos. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex hstack=inputs=2 horizontal-stacked-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The <code>hstack</code> filter has a simple format. You need to specify the number of inputs and it parses that from the beginning portion of the commandline. The order of stacking follows the order of inputs. </p>



<p>Here is a screenshot of what it looks like. </p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4FwbqByqDpDpOGTNvpSWSOh6RVE9yzesrQyAyGvaOF1ZjVsycKOlQUjrTmdJRFJWblHjC9gF6zMds0s5w2Yy2w6CVXXme-H-zF8nYoJ496khN0aHXHaWbnwEe41BYmu6c2mdoQb8" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>And, here is a video! </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731721" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>Here is another use case. Companies or teams working on video compression often like to compare videos side-by-side in the lab or showcase their work in conferences. FFmpeg’s horizontal stacking is an easy way to do this and achieve a very good result. </p>



<p>Below are two videos encoded at different video quality settings and stacked horizontally. Comparison made simple, right? <em>(note: Vimeo’s choise of bitrate might mess with the comparison, but, when done offline (downloaded), the <code>hstack</code> filter makes comparisons easy!)</em></p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/476095363" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_Vertically_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>Stacking Videos Vertically using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Vertically stacked videos” results in placing videos one below the other. Unlike in horizontal stacking, inputs need to be having the same width. The command is as shown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For vertical stacking, we need to use the <code>vstack</code> filter whose syntax is similar to the <code>hstack</code> filter we used in the previous horizontal stacking example.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex vstack=inputs=2 vertical-stack-output.mp4</code></pre>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qtyxioWFR54pqwZhX7jgX6HkSG7gCw840GdK78HGHHP7X3sv3fr3Pou9hOMFu2O-e6O7nmCith3U6CM1SpDanhwmIFIBzZUQyaG4T0BJaF9QCdMIPrmMmH0qc9WTK5f-5Nf4-92y" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Both functions pretty much use the same commands with a simple distinction, the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#hstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>hstack</code></a> and the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#vstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>vstack</code></a> under the <code>-filter_complex</code> argument.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a video of stacking two videos vertically using FFmpeg. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731607" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths"></span><strong>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Well, there’s a really nifty ability for both of these to prioritize the length of the shortest video. And as luck would have it the parameter is named <code>shortest</code>, and it’s applicable to both the horizontal and vertical stacking filters. Using <code>shortest=1</code> ensures the shortest length is used. </p>



<p>For example – </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -filter_complex hstack=inputs=2:shortest=1 shortest-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>As a <b>side note</b>, if you run into an error that claims frames are being duplicated, the easiest workaround is to slip the <code>vsync 2</code> parameter into your command, and it worked like a charm.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_Without_the_shortest_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths Without the <code>shortest</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>To test what happens in this situation, let’s stack two videos vertically – a 10 second clip and an 18 second clip. You’ll see that the shorter clip just stops after it completes, but the output video continues till the longest of the input clips complete.  </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731684" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>











<p>If you want to truncate the clips to the length of the shortest clip, then you need to use the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter. Let’s look at that in the next section.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_With_the_shortest=1_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths With the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>In this example, we use the <code>shortest=1</code> command-line parameter and as you can see, the length of the final video is truncated to the length of the shortest of the inputs. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731643" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="2%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong><strong>2×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong></strong><span></span></h2>



<p>We can achieve a 2×2 grid of videos using a combination of the <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. Let’s start by looking at the command-line and then break it down. It’s actually pretty simple! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]; \
[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]; \
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p>What’s happening here?</p>



<ul><li>firstly, you need to provide 4 input videos with the same height and width</li><li>next, you stack the first two videos horizontally and call it “top” i.e. <code>[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]</code></li><li>then, you you stack the next two videos horizontally and call it “bottom” i.e. <code>[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]</code></li><li>then, you stack <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> vertically to create a 2×2 grid. — <code>[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]</code></li><li>then using the <code>map</code> command, we can extract and push the video track to the output container. </li></ul>



<p>Here is what the video looks like. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475771172" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<h2><span id="3%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>3×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Along the same lines, here is a 3×2 grid of videos using <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 \
-i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-i input4.mp4 -i input5.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v][2:v]hstack=inputs=3[top];\
[3:v][4:v][5:v]hstack=inputs=3[bottom];\
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \

<p>“Amazing”, “Beautiful”, “Incredible”, “Unreal”, “Brought tears to my eyes”.</p>



<p>These are all comments that repeatedly appeared in response to a viral Facebook video of a drone light show that <a href="https://verge.aero/">Verge Aero</a> flew to show gratitude for healthcare and essential workers in Philadelphia. The response was overwhelming, and these words demonstrate that when properly executed, drone light shows are a mesmerizing and powerful experience. Since then, we’ve received many questions about our technology, and we’d like to share our responses with a wider audience.</p>



<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/415494003" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<h2><strong>What is a drone light show, exactly?</strong></h2>



<p>Drone light shows are performed by illuminated, synchronized, and choreographed groups of drones that arrange themselves into various aerial formations. Almost any image can be recreated in the sky by a computer program that turns graphics into flight commands and communicates them to the drones.</p>



<p>In recent years, drone shows have migrated from the university laboratory to being deployed at scale on prominent events around the world. We were originally inspired by this 2012 <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/vijay_kumar_robots_that_fly_and_cooperate">TED video</a> featuring the University of Pennsylvania’s Dean of Engineering, Vijay Kumar, demonstrating drone fleets doing all kinds of stunning maneuvers. Later, pioneering work was done in Europe by the <a href="https://www.spaxels.at/">Spaxels Research Initiative</a>, <a href="https://collmot.com/">Collmot</a>, and <a href="http://www.veritystudios.com/">Verity</a>.<a href="https://www.intel.com/"> Intel</a> has done the most to popularize the concept, flying drone shows on big events such as the Super Bowl halftime show and the Winter Olympics.</p>

<h2><strong>How do drone shows work?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s clear up one thing first: drone light shows are <strong>not </strong>powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28Terminator%29">Skynet</a>, the artificial intelligence network depicted in <em>The Terminator</em>! Drones used in shows are not self-aware, can’t think for themselves, and make no real-time decisions. Instead, like obedient servants, they follow specific commands sent to them and can’t deviate!</p>



<p>The process for creating a show is quite straightforward. First, the design team creates a storyboard timeline showing the desired images and effects. These looks are then animated in a specialized piece of software that translates them into synchronized flight paths for each drone, and usually a soundtrack is created to accompany the show. Complete shows are sent to the drones via radio signal from a ground control station operated by a pilot. When the pilot is satisfied that everything is safe and ready to go, the show starts, and the drones take off to draw the storyboard in the sky.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="638" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2.jpg" alt="verge aero flying a drone light show in Mazatlan for Carnaval de Mazatlan" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2.jpg 960w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mazatlan-2-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"><figcaption>Verge Aero flies a show in Mazatlan for Carnaval 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Creating a system that can be flown safely and repeatedly requires a lot of clever engineering work. Verge Aero’s drones and software were designed by our engineers specifically for performing shows. Our custom drones are missing some things normally found on drones, like cameras, and include unique features, such as a blindingly bright LED light source.</p>



<p>Verge Aero’s design software lets users select graphics and special effects and place them in a timeline, similar to those found in video editing software. This software calculates the flight paths of each drone to guarantee they don’t collide in the air, and generates a full 3D rendering of the show to ensure it looks exactly as intended. Every drone is sent a unique program and the ground control station monitors each drone over a local, encrypted network for maximum safety.</p>



<p>The flight crew uses a detailed dashboard display on the ground station to prepare drones for flight and continuously monitor status. The drones themselves carry multiple radios operating simultaneously, away from busy WiFi frequencies, to ensure communications are maintained even in busy and noisy radio environments.</p>



<p>Shows are flown by certified pilots, experts in relevant aviation subject matter, including regulations and weather. Prior to every show, checklists are used to make sure everything is in order: drones are fully operational, batteries are charged, and the flight area is clear. Once these checks are complete, the pilot presses <strong>GO</strong> and the drones take off on their mission!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2700" height="1800" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-2700x1800.jpg" alt="guitar drone light show at Festival Internacional del Globo" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-2700x1800.jpg 2700w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-300x200.jpg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-768x512.jpg 768w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIG2019-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2700px) 100vw, 2700px"><figcaption>Guitar in drone light show at Festival Internacional del Globo</figcaption></figure>



<h2><strong>Will drones replace fireworks?</strong></h2>



<p>Fireworks shows are increasingly criticized for their negative environmental impact—they are noisy, polluting, and wasteful. Concerns are regularly raised around their impact on sensitive wildlife populations, as well as military veterans experiencing PTSD. What’s more, in many locations, fireworks displays have been banned altogether, due to the increased risk of wildfires.</p>



<p>These and other factors have led many people to consider replacing fireworks displays with alternatives—and drone light shows are perfectly positioned to fill the gap.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ.jpeg" alt="Philadelphia Drone Light Show Stethoscope" width="286" height="391" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ.jpeg 1000w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ-220x300.jpeg 220w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_tWamVl5u_EH8BWg5Nmm3ZQ-768x1049.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px"><figcaption>Verge Aero flies a stethoscope for frontline workers at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In many cases, drone shows have been used successfully as a great complement to fireworks displays. However, as a new and exciting form of entertainment, drones have much more to offer. They are capable of a far greater range of effects than fireworks, and their capacity for sophisticated choreography gives them vastly more potential for storytelling in the sky. Drones can also be deployed in more constrained environments where fireworks would never be allowed.</p>



<p>When you think about it, fireworks actually have quite a limited repertoire. Usually, a handful of effects are repeated over and over again, just in varying combinations, sizes, colors and intensities. Why settle for this when you can have dynamic, repositionable 3D pixels capable of generating virtually unlimited imagery? Drones offer far more creative options than fireworks. In fact, it’s easy to envision that as drone shows become more commonplace, people will one day look back on fireworks displays as being quite mundane in comparison.</p>



<p>Regardless, the transition from fireworks to drones will happen gradually. Fireworks shows will be with us for some time to come, if for no other reason than that they are fairly inexpensive to stage. But as drone shows become more affordable, we can expect to see events using them more frequently.</p>



<h2><strong>Why haven’t I seen more shows?</strong></h2>



<p>Even Wal-Mart now sells drones, so why aren’t we seeing more light shows? The problem is that successful show execution requires different technologies that are only now maturing. Innovations usually take time to disseminate, and drone shows are no different. A number of factors have limited the uptake of drone shows before now:</p>



<ul><li>High cost</li><li>Need for regulatory approval</li><li>Expensive and limited insurance options</li><li>Labor intensive operations</li><li>Lack of efficient show design tools</li><li>Safety requirements</li></ul>



<p>The use of specialized drones with high-precision avionics drives high cost. Labor intensive operations also contribute, whether it’s wrangling rudimentary control software or preparing finicky drones for flight.</p>



<p>High operating expenses are possibly acceptable for the Super Bowl or the Olympics, but are not viable for most events. Nonetheless, things are changing, and Verge Aero’s innovations are helping to make drone light shows more accessible to a far wider range of budgets.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1400" height="399" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA.jpeg" alt="Verge Aero X1 drones ready for flight" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA.jpeg 1400w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA-300x86.jpeg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_GwmlzLjRyU-BpqmpEpLzhA-768x219.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"><figcaption>Verge Aero X1 drones ready for flight</figcaption></figure>



<h2><strong>How much do drone light shows cost?</strong></h2>



<p>Like many new technologies, drone light shows were extremely expensive at first, and they’re still more expensive than desired. But as with computers and flat panel TVs, prices are decreasing over time. Drone light shows will go mainstream as the technology matures. The tools developed by Verge Aero already make it possible to do more for less!</p>



<p>The main driver of cost is the number of drones being flown. It clearly costs a lot more to put on a 500-drone show than a 50-drone show. In addition to the drones themselves, labor, freight, and logistics all add expense.</p>



<p>A small show that’s easy to deploy costs as little as $20,000. But larger and more complicated shows can easily cost many times this number. Here’s a list of factors that impact price:</p>



<ul><li>Drone quantity</li><li>Show design complexity</li><li>Show coordination and rehearsal time</li><li>Airspace authorization and regulatory compliance</li><li>Shipping and logistics</li><li>Crew travel and accommodation</li></ul>



<h2><strong>What is Verge Aero doing differently?</strong></h2>



<p>To make drone shows more affordable, we introduced a few innovations to streamline the process and reduce the amount of work required.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="550" src="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swarm_550.jpg" alt="drone swarm for PNAU All of Us" srcset="https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swarm_550.jpg 1200w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swarm_550-300x138.jpg 300w, https://verge.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swarm_550-768x352.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>Drones swarming for PNAU’s music video All of Us</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Simplified Show Design</h3>



<p>Historically, drone light shows were manually created using a series of applications including animation software like<a href="https://www.blender.org/"> Blender</a>—which was an extremely tedious and limiting process. Even worse, the programmer had to check that vertices in Blender <strong>never </strong>overlapped during animation, because that would mean drones colliding in the air. The output then needed to be transferred to at least one more program to prepare for flight. All this is an extremely unsafe process because it’s prone to human error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A far better way is to use a unified software application with an easy-to-use interface, like the Verge Aero Design Studio, which automatically handles the anti-collision calculations. Cues are created in the built-in animation software and easily manipulated. Once the design process is complete, the software removes the possibility of human error by deconflicting flight paths, identifying potential issues or mistakes in the show design, and simulating the performance via a rendering pipeline—all without any human intervention.</p>



<p>This software allows designers to generate content with a few key presses, instead of through the laborious processes of using animation tools or writing code. Effects such as complex flocking, as seen in this<a href="https://youtu.be/7DQ4covPEyE"> All of Us music video by PNAU</a>, are automatically created by an effects generator in the Verge Aero Design Studio. Effects created by one designer can easily be …</p></div></div>

In fact, most of the well-known productivity techniques are centered around the premise that employees can only maximize team cohesion &amp; communication when working in a controlled work environment like the office.</p><p>But with the rise of the digital age and need to travel, the world has started to realize the value and need for remote work and set in place internal measures to promote alternative work methods that benefit the workforce.<br>
&nbsp;</p><h2>Reimagining the 9-to-5 workday could improve productivity</h2><p>The contemporary 9-to-5, eight-hour workday was imagined by American labor unions in the 1800s and normalized by Henry Ford in the 1920s. Most employees today simply accept this narrative because it’s what they have gotten so acquainted with. But despite the growing popularity in the demand for remote and flexible work, the need for a change in work culture has been met with much skepticism from managers. A recent study conducted by Remote Workplace Study explores the prime obstacles to implementing a flexible workplace policy:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Company’s long-standing resistance to change &nbsp;</li><li>Privacy</li><li>Lack of understanding about the benefits of remote work</li><li>Fear of how it will impact the overall company culture</li><li>Technology requirements</li><li>Data security</li></ul><p>Understandably, managers have reservations about changing traditional work culture. Most concerns center around losing control of assessing team cohesiveness and potential reduction in employee productivity &amp; focus. But despite this, change is inevitable. In fact, most studies confirm an increase in productivity, working “smarter” and willingness to work over-time when employees are given the flexibility to choose when and how to work.&nbsp;</p><h2>Millennials are driving the demand for flexible and remote work&nbsp;</h2><p>As of today, millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) account for almost 50% of the global workforce and are expected to grow to 75% by 2025. This means that the need for companies to adopt flexible and remote work policies is more compelling today than ever before in order to attract and retain a younger, skilled workforce.&nbsp;</p><h2>There are equal benefits to jumping on the remote-work bandwagon for both companies and employees:</h2><p>There are equal benefits to jumping on the remote-work bandwagon for both companies and employees:</p><h3>For Companies</h3><ul><li>Cost savings (office &amp; overhead costs)</li><li>Increase in productivity</li><li>Employee retention &amp; reduced turnover</li><li>Profitability (companies save avg. $11, 000 &nbsp;per part-time telecommuter)</li><li>Environmental benefits (less commuting to work reduces carbon footprint)</li><li>Improved inclusivity and diversity (easier reach and accessibility to skilled talent from different demographics, races, and people with disabilities from all over the world)</li></ul><h3>For Employees</h3><ul><li>Improved work-life balance</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>No commute (time and cost savings)</li><li>Location independence (work from home/travel while working)</li><li>More time to spend with family</li><li>Expense savings (transportation, gas, &amp; freedom &nbsp;to live in low-cost cities) &nbsp;</li></ul><h2>The world’s largest firms have endorsed remote working policies in the wake of Covid19</h2><p>It’s no secret that the novel Coronavirus pandemic has played an integral role in the sudden surge of remote work policies implemented across companies worldwide. Big corporations such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, Amazon, &amp; Microsoft have adopted such changes with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey announcing that his employees can work remotely indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“... the work-from-home revolution is shaping the future of the workplace.”</p></blockquote><p>Improved inclusivity and diversity (easier reach and accessibility to skilled talent from different demographics, races, and people with disabilities from all over the world)</p><p>In closing, albeit reservations from conservative and outdated work practices, the future of the work environment is remote and flexible work. In the age of the internet, connecting with skilled professionals has become easier and accessible. Thanks to online professional platforms like remoteworkers.net, companies have access to a wider pool of highly experienced talent and job-seekers can find their ideal remote jobs. Companies would be wise to evolve with the growth in remote work trends in order to become more competitive &amp; improve productivity.</p><h2>Looking for a remote job?</h2><p>Thanks to the internet, connecting skilled professionals with remote-friendly companies has never been easier.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In the last blog post, we proved that <a href="https://www.ezzeddinabdullah.com/posts/how-to-clean-csv-data-at-the-command-line">xsv is ~1882x faster than csvkit</a> when joining two CSVs and saw how performant xsv is and when we can use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv" target="_blank">xsv</a> or <a href="https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">csvkit</a> when we are at the terminal.</p><p>Today, we're talking about part 2 of cleaning CSV data at the command line investigating a large CSV&nbsp;file (from&nbsp;Kaggle)&nbsp;that contains <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/reddit-usernames">~26 million users and their number of comments</a> posted from 2005 to 2017. We also talked about <a href="https://www.ezzeddinabdullah.com/posts/how-to-clean-text-data-at-the-command-line">cleaning text files in general using the command line</a> if you want to check out.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>You just need to install <strong>csvkit </strong>and <strong>xsv </strong>with the following commands:</p><h3>install csvkit</h3><p>Just need pip to be able to install csvkit:</p><h3>install xsv</h3><p>Binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are available <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/releases/latest">from Github</a>.</p><p>Or if you're using macOS&nbsp;Homebrew, install it just like this:</p><p>Compiling from its repository also works similarly:<br></p><div><pre>$ git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv
$ cd xsv
$ cargo build --release
</pre></div><p>but you need to have <a href="https://crates.io/install">Cargo installed </a>which is Rust's package manager since xsv is written in Rust</p><h2>Concatenating: xsv cat vs csvstack</h2><p>Let's first create a CSV file to play with instead of the large&nbsp;file. Create it with your favorite text editor or just at the command line:</p><div><pre>$ cat &gt;&gt; fake_users.csv
author,n
x,5
z,7
y,6

</pre></div><p>Here, we’d like to concatenate this <strong>fake_users.csv </strong>file with the large <strong>users.csv </strong>file.</p><p>To see the effect of the performance here, we will stack the large file first because that will be more accurate when using <strong>tail</strong> to validate that the second file is already read into memory and concatenated.</p><p><strong>xsv </strong>has a tool for that which is <strong>cat</strong>, let's use it:</p><div><pre>$ time xsv cat rows users.csv fake_users.csv | tail
youbd636,1
generalkickstand,1
Throwaway_injuries,5
LowlzMan,3
ImSoLitBroLMFAO,1

real	0m15.198s
user	0m17.499s
sys	0m0.364s
</pre></div><ul role="list"><li><strong>rows </strong>here is used to indicate that we will concatenate the rows so the rows of the second file will be appended to the rows of the first file</li></ul><p>Time here taken by <strong>xsv cat </strong>is ~15s</p><p><strong>csvkit </strong>also has a <strong>csvstack </strong>tool, let’s see it:</p><div><pre>$ time csvstack users.csv fake_users.csv | tail
youbd636,1
generalkickstand,1
Throwaway_injuries,5
LowlzMan,3
ImSoLitBroLMFAO,1
i_want_to_die_killme,2
beeman3459,1
x,5
z,7
y,6

real	1m7.213s
user	1m21.464s
sys	0m1.026s
</pre></div><p>Time here taken by <strong>csvstack </strong>is ~1.7mins </p><p>So approximately, <strong>xsv </strong>is ~7x faster here than <strong>csvkit</strong></p><h2>Sorting: pandas.sort_values() vs xsv sort vs GNU&nbsp;sort vs csvsort</h2><p>Let’s first see how <strong>csvsort </strong>and <strong>xsv sort </strong>work by sorting <em>fake_users.csv </em>by the number of comments <em>n</em>:</p><div><pre>$ csvsort -c n fake_users.csv
author,n
x,5
y,6
z,7
</pre></div><p>We can also sort in reverse order by setting the option <strong>-r:</strong></p><div><pre>$ csvsort -rc n fake_users.csv
author,n
z,7
y,6
x,5
</pre></div><p>The equivalent <strong>xsv</strong> command is:</p><div><pre>$ xsv sort -RNs n fake_users.csv 
</pre></div><p><strong>-RNs </strong>is a combination of: </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>-R </strong>for reverse order</li><li><strong>-N&nbsp;</strong>for numeric sorting</li><li><strong>-s </strong>for selecting the column that you sort by</li></ul><p>After downloading <strong>users.csv</strong>,<strong> </strong>the ~359MB CSV file, let's sort it with <strong>xsv </strong>first. This is a +25 million records so expect a latency here!</p><div><pre>$ time xsv sort -RNs n users.csv &gt; /dev/null

real	1m48.611s
user	1m27.743s
sys	0m16.621s
</pre></div><p>So <strong>xsv sort </strong>took here ~1.4 mins for this much data.</p><p>Let's try the <strong>sort </strong>command coming with the UNIX system:</p><div><pre>$ time sort -t, -rnk2 users.csv &gt; /dev/null

real	6m29.940s
user	5m49.416s
sys	0m32.340s
</pre></div><ul role="list"><li><strong>-t, </strong>to determine the field separator which is comma here as the file is a CSV file</li><li><strong>-r</strong> for reverse order<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>-n </strong>for numeric sorting </li><li><strong>-k2 </strong>for setting the key field (the column that you sort by which is the second column here)</li></ul><p>Here <strong>BSD&nbsp;sort </strong>took ~6.3min which is ~5x slower than <strong>xsv</strong></p><p>What about <strong>csvsort</strong>? </p><div><pre>$ time csvsort -rc n users.csv &gt; /dev/null
</pre></div><p>Do you know that I have terminated my terminal after <strong>more than an hour</strong> of waiting for this command to complete execution and it's not completed yet!</p><p>Knowing that <strong>csvkit </strong>is written in pure python can somehow proves that it's not advisable to write a very performant tool with such technology alone unless you use C or Cython with Python as <strong>Pandas</strong> did:</p><div><pre>$ python sort_with_pandas.py
Time: 77.732413994
</pre></div><p><strong>Pandas</strong> here beats ALL, <strong>csvkit</strong>, <strong>BSD&nbsp;sort</strong>, and even <strong>xsv </strong>with execution time of ~78 seconds which means it's very close to <strong>xsv </strong>result (1.4min = 84s) so just 6 seconds difference and with each run, the time varies so it's acceptable for <strong>xsv </strong>to be competing with <strong>pandas </strong>for performance.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>From our investigation of the 26 million records data of the Reddit username data, it seems that <strong>xsv</strong> is the fastest command line I ever used and I think ever existed at the terminal. It is more performant than <strong>csvkit</strong>. We’ve seen a tremendous improvement in speed when cleaning our data by:</p><ul role="list"><li>concatenating the rows of the CSV files using <strong>xsv cat rows </strong>and comparing it with <strong>csvstack</strong>‍</li><li>sorting by a column and in a reverse order using <strong>xsv sort -sRN </strong>comparing it with <strong>csvsort -rc</strong></li><li>also comparing the two utilities with <strong>BSD&nbsp;sort </strong>and <strong>pandas </strong>resulting in a very good performing of pandas and xsv</li></ul><p>In the end, as always you have the choice to choose whatever you want from the <strong>csvkit </strong>or <strong>xsv </strong>but it'd be fair to use what makes our life easy which is <strong>xsv </strong>especially when we're dealing with a large CSV file like what we saw today and if speed and performance are not what we look for especially when we're dealing with small CSVs, we can go for <strong>csvkit</strong>.</p><p>You might have noticed that the syntax is kind of similar in sorting and stacking. So you always have the choice!</p><p>‍</p><p>This tutorial is mainly motivated by <a href="https://amzn.to/33y5EkR">Data Science at the Command Line</a></p><h6>Disclosure: <em>The Amazon links for the book (in this section) are paid links so if you buy the book, I will have a small commission</em></h6><p>This book tries to catch your attention on the ability of the command line when you do data science tasks - meaning you can obtain your data, manipulate it, explore it, and make your prediction on it using the command line.

November 7, 2020 | https://www.dursi.ca/post/julia-vs-chapel.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dursi.ca/post/julia-vs-chapel.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        
          

          

    		<p><a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> and <a href="http://chapel.cray.com/">Chapel</a>
are both newish languages aimed at productitive scientific computing,
with parallel computing capabilities baked in from the start.
There’s lots of information about both online, but not much comparing
the two.  If you are starting a new scientific computing project
and are willing to try something new, which should you choose?  What
are their strengths and weaknesses, and how do they compare?</p>

<p>Here we walk through a comparison, focusing on distributed-memory
parallelism of the sort one would want for HPC-style simulation.
Both have strengths in largely disjoint areas.  If you want matlib-like
interactivity and plotting, and need only coodinator-worker parallelism,
Julia is the clear winner; if you want MPI+OpenMPI type scability
on rectangular distributed arrays (dense or sparse), Chapel wins
handily.  Both languages and environments have clear untapped
potential and room to grow; we’ll talk about future prospects of
the two languages at the end.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I’ve updated the timings - I hadn’t been using <code>@inbounds</code>
in the Julia code, and I had misconfigured my Chapel install so
that the compiles weren’t optimized; this makes a huge difference on
the 2d advection problem.  All timings now are on an AWS c4.8x instance.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-overview-of-the-two-languages">A quick overview of the two languages</h2>

<h3 id="julia">Julia</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia project</a> describes Julia as “a
high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
numerical computing.”  It exploits type inference of rich types,
just-in-time compilation, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch">multiple
dispatch</a> (think
of R, with say <code>print()</code> defined to operate differently on scalars,
data&nbsp;frames, or linear regression fits) to provide a dynamic,
interactive, “scripting language”-type high level numerical programming
language that gives performance less than but competitive with
C or Fortran.</p>

<p>The project sees the language as more or less a matlab-killer, and
so focusses on that sort of interface; interactive, through a REPL
or Jupyter notebook (both available to try <a href="https://juliabox.com/">online</a>),
with integrated plotting; also, indexing begins at one, as God
intended.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Julia blurs the distinction between scientific users of Julia and
developers in two quite powerful ways.  The first is lisp-like
<a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/metaprogramming/">metaprogramming</a>,
where julia code can be generated or modified from within Julia,
making it possible to build domain-specific langauges (DSLs) inside Julia
for problems; this allows simple APIs for broad problem sets which
nonetheless take full advantage of the structure of the particular
problems being solved; <a href="https://github.com/JuliaStats">JuliaStats</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaFEM/JuliaFEM.jl">JuliaFEM</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl">JuMP</a> offer hints of what
that could look like.  Another sort of functionality this enables
is <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2016/03/parallelaccelerator">Parallel Accellerator</a>, an
intel package that can rewrite some regular array operations into
fast, vectorized native code.  This code-is-data aspect of Julia,
combined with the fact that much of Julia itself is written in Julia,
puts user-written code on an equal footing with much “official”
julia code.</p>

<p>The second way Julia blurs the line between user and developer is
the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/packages/">package system</a>
which uses git and GitHub; this means that once you’ve installed
someone’s package, you’re very close to being able to file a pull
request if you find a bug, or to fork the package to specialize
it to your own needs; and it’s similarly very easy to
contribute a package if you’re already using GitHub to develop the
package.</p>

<p>Julia has support for remote function execution (“out of the box”
using SSH + TCP/IP, but other transports are available through
packages), and distributed rectangular arrays; thread support
is still experimental, as is shared-memory on-node arrays.</p>

<h3 id="chapel">Chapel</h3>

<p>While Julia is a scientific programming language with parallel
computing support, Chapel is a programming language for parallel
scientific computing. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitioned_global_address_space">PGAS</a>
language, with partitioned but globally-accessible variables, using
<a href="https://gasnet.lbl.gov/">GASNet</a> for communications.  It takes PGAS
two steps further however than languages like <a href="https://www.dursi.ca/post/coarray-fortran-goes-mainstream-gcc-5-1.html">Coarray
Fortran</a>,
<a href="http://upc.lbl.gov/">UPC</a>, or <a href="http://x10-lang.org/">X10</a>.</p>

<p>The first extension is to define all large data structures (arrays,
associative arrays, graphs) as being defined over <em>domains</em>, and
then definining a library of <em>domain maps</em> for distributing these
domains over different locality regions (“locales”) (nodes, or NUMA
nodes, or KNL accellerators) and <em>layouts</em> for describing their layout
within a locale.  By far the best tested and optimized domain maps
are for the cases of dense (and to a lesser extent, CSR-layout
sparse) rectangular arrays, as below, although there support for
associative arrays (dictionaries) and unstructured meshes/graphs
as well.</p>

<p>The second is to couple those domain maps with parallel iterators
over the domains, meaning that one can loop over the data in parallel
in one loop (think OpenMP) with a “global view” rather than expressing
the parallelism explicitly as a SIMD-type program.  This decouples
the expression of the layout of the data from the expression of the
calculation over the data, which is essential for productive parallel 
computing; it means that tweaking the layouts (or the dimensionality of
the program, or…) doesn’t require rewriting the internals of the
computation.</p>

<p>The distributions and layouts are written in Chapel, so that users can
contribute new domain maps to the project.</p>

}
delta = max reduce abs(data_new[Dom] - data[Dom]);</code></pre></figure>

</td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Chapel also exposes its lower-level parallel computing functionality —
such as remote function execution, fork/join task parallelism — so
that one can write a MPI-like SIMD program by explicity launching 
a function on each core:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="chapel">coforall loc in Locales do 
    on loc do
        coforall tid in 0..#here.maxTaskPar do
            do_simd_program(loc, tid);</code></pre></figure>

<p>At roughly eight years old as a publically available project, Chapel
is a slightly older and more mature language than Julia. However,
the language continues to evolve and there are breaking changes
between versions; these are much smaller and more localized breaking
changes than with Julia, so that most recent example code online
works readily.  As its focus has always been on large-scale parallelism
rather than desktop computing, its potential market is smaller
so has attracted less interest and fewer users than Julia
— however, if you read this blog, Chapel’s niche is one you are
almost certainly very interested in.  The relative paucity of users
is reflected in the smaller number of contributed packages, although
an upcoming package manager will likely lower the bar to future
contributions.</p>

<p>Chapel also lacks a REPL, which makes experimentation and testing
somewhat harder — there’s no equivalent of <a href="https://juliabox.com/">JuliaBox</a>
where one can play with the language at a console or in a notebook.
There is an effort in that direction now which may be made easier
by ongoing work on the underlying compiler architecture.</p>

<h2 id="similarities-and-differences">Similarities and differences</h2>

<h3 id="standard-library">Standard library</h3>

<p>Both <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable">Julia</a> and <a href="http://chapel.cray.com/docs/latest/">Chapel</a>
have good documentation, and the basic modules or capabilities one would expect from languages 
aimed at technical computing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex numbers</li>
  <li>Mathematical function libraries</li>
  <li>Random numbers</li>
  <li>Linear algebra</li>
  <li>FFTs</li>
  <li>C, Python interoperability</li>
  <li>Multi-precision floats / BigInts</li>
  <li>MPI interoperability</li>
  <li>Profiling</li>
</ul>

<p>although there are differences - in Julia, Python interoperability
is much more complete (the Julia set example above used matplotlib
plotting, while <a href="https://pychapel.readthedocs.io/">pychapel</a> focuses
on calling Chapel from within python).  Also, Julia’s linear algebra
support is much slicker, styled after Matlab syntax and with a rich
set of matrix types (symmetric, tridiagonal, <em>etc.</em>), so that for
linear solves, say, a sensible method is chosen automatically; the
consise syntax and “do the right thing” approach are particularly
helpful for interactive use<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, which is a primary use-case of Julia.</p>

<p>On profiling, the Julia support is primariy for serial profiling
and text based; Chapel has a very nice tool called
<a href="http://chapel.cray.com/docs/1.14/tools/chplvis/chplvis.html">chplvis</a> 
for visualizing parallel performance.</p>

<h3 id="other-packages">Other packages</h3>

<p>Julia’s early adoption of a package management framework and very
large initial userbase has lead to a <a href="http://pkg.julialang.org/">very large ecosystem</a>
of contributed packages.  As with all such package ecosystems, 
the packages themselves are a bit of a mixed bag – lots are broken or
abandoned, many are simply wrappers to other tools – but there
are also excellent, substantial packages taking full advantage of
Julia’s capabalities that are of immediate interest
to those doing scientific computing, such as 
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>
for ODEs, SDEs, and and FEM for some PDEs,
<a href="https://github.com/BioJulia">BioJulia</a> for …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Edit: This article on chess improvement was unexpectedly popular, reaching #2 on Hacker News and being linked to on LifeHacker. Thanks for your patience as I work through all the comments and emails I receive.<br>
</em></p>
<p>Last updated: October 1, 2020</p>
<p>There are many misconceptions about rapid chess improvement. In this post I’m going to lay out a simple but effective way to get good at chess, fast.</p>
<p>This system is based on lessons learned from my own chess improvement and from coaching others. The good news is that you can become better than the vast majority of other players with minimal but targeted effort.</p>
<p><b>What does it mean to be “good” at chess? </b></p>
<p><span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen">Magnus Carlsen’s</a></span></span> meteoric rise to the top ranked player in the world (at age 19), the highest chess rating in history (age 22), and as of a few days ago, the title of World Chess Champion (age 22) has brought with it a renewed interest in chess. This is exciting, because Carlsen represents the first real hope of renewing chess’s mass appeal since the days of <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a></span></span><sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>In the context of discussions about Magnus Carlsen, many people mentioned that they enjoyed playing chess but quit because of the sheer time commitment it took to get “good.”</p>
<p>I define “good” as the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile among the player pool you’re competing against. In competitive chess in the United States, that means a United States Chess Federation (USCF) <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating">Elo rating</a></span></span> of about 1800<sup>2</sup>. If you’re a casual player playing against your friends, my guess is that 90<sup>th</sup> percentile is around 900. Even though I was only rated 1100 when I first began playing competitively, I was already able to beat the vast majority of non-competitive players.</p>
<p>The goal here is to help you get good, fast, with minimal effort.</p>
<p><b>Results with this system</b></p>
<p>I actively trained for a period of about 3.5 years using a (much, much less disciplined) version of this system, during which my rating increased from 1100 to 1950, a 135 fold increase I strength<sup>3</sup>. In one 12 month period I improved from 1198 to 1639. I improved even faster with my quick rating (games with less than 30 minutes per side), where I went from 1001 to 1740 in 15 months (75 fold increase in playing strength).</p>
<p>My first experience using these ideas with other players was in high school, when I began coaching the lowest ranked player in our chess club. Within a few months he had improved so rapidly that he represented the school in the state championships and won every single game in the tournament.</p>
<p>Given that I managed to do this despite my own inexperience and mistakes with studying chess and my own laziness, I’m convinced others can improve much more quickly if they follow this system strictly<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p><b>The system</b></p>
<p>Since this article is meant for both casual and competitive players, I specify minimum rating requirements when appropriate. If you’re a casual player and this is overkill for your goals, skip to the footnotes for a much simpler system<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p><span>Playing</span></p>
<p>To improve quickly you need to play often. If you are (or aspire to be) a competitive player, play as many over-the-board (OTB) tournaments as possible. In my heyday I played 3-4 tournaments per month. Online is not enough! Use online games (15 minutes per side or slower) to practice openings or for practice if there is no tournament for a while. If you’re a casual player, play OTB chess with your friends as much as you can, and play online if nobody wants to play with you.</p>
<p>Since I first wrote this post, I’ve received a fair number of questions asking why OTB chess is so important and why online-only is insufficient. IM Andras Toth has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kmdFbyWiTY">an excellent discussion</a> of this topic that explains it better than I could&nbsp; (his channel is also chronically underrated–I highly recommend checking his other videos out!).</p>
<p><span>Tactics</span></p>
<p>I did two types of tactics training. The first was “Chess Vision” and “Knight Sight” exercises, as described in <span><a href="http://www.masschess.org/Chess_Horizons/Articles/2001-01_Sample_400_Points_Part_1.pdf">this article</a></span>. They may sound stupid, but they work. I did these exercises every day for two weeks initially, and then would do them the day of a tournament and once in a while as a refresher.</p>
<p>My primary method of tactics training was using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U0YZ0M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004U0YZ0M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=Y76EOXPI5OJF2DV4">Chess Tactics for Beginners</a>, which is absolutely fantastic. Since it may have compatibility issues with modern OSes, a good alternative is CT Art 4.0 available for both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chessking.android.learn.ctart4&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ct-art-4-0-chess-tactics/id1132601225">iOS</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U0YZ0M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004U0YZ0M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=J7V5XFOTBIDIIG2C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/6105Zn3iBeL._SL1000_.jpg?resize=278%2C278&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="278" height="278" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>If you only buy one thing to help your chess game, this should be it. I did 50 puzzles per day, every day, and once I finished the entire CD I repeated the process six more times. Online tactics sites usually don’t cut it, because they aren’t structured so that you learn based off previous ideas and many don’t incorporate the pedagogical features of Chess Tactics for Beginners/CT Art 4.0. Trust me, paying for the software is worth it.</p>
<p>If I had to recommend a book to accompany such study (which is helpful, since the above software doesn’t actually have any explanatory text), I’d recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1889323276?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1889323276&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chess Tactics for the Tournament Player </a>for intermediate players, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857443861/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1857443861&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=7ALJB5A3ECUHWDEW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winning Chess Tactics</a> for less experienced players.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, there is a bit of a leap between solving tactics puzzles and applying it to real games–obviously nobody’s going to tell you when a tactic is available, and you won’t be “primed” to find tactics the way you would be when solving a bunch of puzzles. To counteract this I created a binder of puzzles taken from tactics I missed in my games, and reviewed them from time to time.</p>
<p><span>Analysis</span></p>
<p>Analysis is by far the most undervalued part of chess training. As a kid I barely analyzed my games after tournaments, because I was lazy. This was a huge mistake—your games are worth their weight in gold! Learn <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">algebraic chess notation</a></span></span> so you can write down your moves, and analyze your games using the method outlined in <span><span><a href="https://www.chess.com/blog/CharlyAZ/a-hardcore-guide-to-analyze-your-chess-games">this article</a></span></span>. Use the analysis phase to brush up on your openings and endgames and practice your strategic play. If possible, have a stronger player go over your games with you after you’ve done your own analysis.</p>
<p>One big mistake is to rely heavily on computers for chess analysis. Too often, players use computers as a crutch to replace their own study of the game. Working through games on your own and trying to find the best moves and ideas is highly instructive. Computer analysis should be done only after you analyze the game on your own, so you can compare your analysis to the computer’s and unearth any mistakes you made in assessing critical positions in the game.</p>
<p><span>Openings</span><b> </b></p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes players make is to devote massive amounts of time to openings. This is because openings tend to be very concrete, and beginners think that simply memorizing an opening will give them an unassailable advantage over their opponents<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>Don’t bother spending any time studying openings outside of analyzing your games. Just make sure you know the basic opening principles. I teach my beginning students simple openings like the <span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_System">London System </a></span></span>as white, and a kingside fianchetto system as black<sup>7</sup>. These openings are simple, solid, can be played against virtually anything.</p>
<p>Once you hit 1600, get a good opening book that gives you both specific moves and the ideas behind the opening. Don’t mindlessly memorize!</p>
<p><em>Openings for White</em></p>
<p>If you’re a d4 player, I highly recommend Cox’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857444175/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1857444175&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=STJDQXBM7GK6XYNM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starting Out: 1. d4!</a><sup>8</sup>. An offbeat alternative is Summerscale’s <a href="https://amzn.to/36pGkPS">A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re an e4 player it gets a bit trickier. The truth is, e4 is simply harder to play than d4 because it’s a lot easier to get in trouble if you don’t play precisely. This makes finding a single volume repertoire book a bit more challening, but here are some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alburt’s<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1889323209/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1889323209&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=AF3LPY4VTPCU6ID3"> Chess Openings for White, Explained.</a> I haven’t personally used it, and I’ve heard some reasonable criticism around some of the lines chosen, but I think for most players it’ll probably be a good starting point.</li>
<li>Emms’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZA2DM12/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00ZA2DM12&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=dcee712605ab0911a0fafd2bf00b1532">Attacking with 1. e4</a> is a book I have used and enjoyed during my forays as an e4 player.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a c4 player, you’ll have to do some research on your own to find a good repertoire book. Being a hipster has its downsides.</p>
<p><em>Openings for Black</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Alburt’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1889323187/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1889323187&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=PBISMJGJT42NGJX6">Chess Openings for Black, Explained</a> is a great book.</li>

<p>Obviously this depends on your opening preferences. Even here openings should not be your main focus. I only consult these books when analyzing my games to see where I deviated from established opening theory, occasionally supplemented by a chess database if there’s a line not covered in the book or I’d like to go more in-depth.</p>
<p>And if your first thought is, “Gautam, one of those books was published in 2006! I’ll be using outdated opening theory!” then I’m afraid you’re missing the point. If you’re below master or even International Master level, playing what world champions played in 2006 rather than what they played in 2020 will <em>never</em> be the reason you lose a game. Ever. That simply is not your bottleneck, and the time invested to try to constantly keep up with the latest won’t result in any rating gains.</p>
<p><span>Strategy<br>
</span></p>
<p>Until you hit 1400-1500, you should be picking up strategic play from analyzing your games and going over annotated games. Once you hit that level, I recommend Silman’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1890085022/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1890085022&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=5GKXCF6U4LWI7Y24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Amateur’s Mind</a> and Seirawan’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1857443853/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1857443853&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gautnaru-20&amp;linkId=V5IEYHJJ5PL3FC6Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winning Chess Strategies.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><span>Annotated Games</span></p>
<p>Go over at least one annotated game a week (and more frequently if you’re a serious competitive player).

<p>I survived the transition to Linux—and you can too</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/12032/1*XXI-kg18liPn4XcfZmoqQQ.jpeg" alt="Photo by [Chris Ried](https://unsplash.com/@cdr6934?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/search/photos/code?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText)"><em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cdr6934?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">Chris Ried</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/code?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></em></p>

<p>Switching from Windows to <a href="https://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a> can be really scary. But if you can survive the first few months, the eventual returns are exponential. Here’s how I survived.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Though I am just an amateur in Linux, I was able to survive the transition and indeed benefitted from it. So these are my notes for somebody facing a similar situation.</p></li>

<li><p>Pick <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> to start with. Choose other flavours once you know better and can decide for yourself.</p></li>

<li><p>Get comfortable with following commands ssh, pwd, ls, cd, mv, cp, scp, grep, find, rm. Tip: you can use <a href="https://tldr.ostera.io/cp" target="_blank">https://tldr.ostera.io/cp</a> to get the list of most frequently used options of these commands.</p></li>

<li><p>Learn to use the | symbol. Using this symbol, you can pass the output of one command as an input to the next command.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-long-version">The Long Version</h2>

<p>In my first company, we were using Windows extensively, whether it was desktop machines we used for development or the servers on which we deployed our code. But when I moved to my <a href="http://azrisolutions.com/?source=gokulnk" target="_blank">second company</a>, it was all in on OSS and hence using Linux was mandatory there. It became a herculean task for me. For the first month or so it was a nightmare.</p>

<p>Having gone through that nightmare and survived it, I am making this list to help others like me who are trying to make this transition.</p>

<h2 id="new-environments">New Environments</h2>

<p>Transitions are hard in general. New environments can be scary. If you’re a Windows user who has never used the command line, then transition to Linux can get really scary. Don’t fret because that is generally the experience of many people who are making this transition. Knowing that others also find it difficult can be really consoling at times.</p>

<p>According to me, the two main reasons that make transitions difficult are: <strong>lack of familiarity</strong> and <strong>fear of screwing up.</strong></p>

<h3 id="lack-of-familiarity">Lack of familiarity</h3>

<p>To address the issue of familiarity, I started using Linux on my office laptop as well as my personal laptop. I started reading blogs about Linux and followed some interesting Linux-related accounts on Twitter. I reached out to people who were good at Linux. I would walk up to their cubicles and ask them to show me their command history. I learned a lot more from this than from reading the blogs. Most of the times, since it’s just muscle memory, the programmers can’t explain it. But their history is a treasure trove.</p>

<p>I would recommend running the following command. You will get many insights into the commands your Linux heroes use frequently.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">history | awk ‘<span>{</span> $1<span>=</span>””; print $0 <span>}</span>’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20</code></pre></div>
<p>Run the command on the terminals of the Linux gurus in your office. Ask them about the commands you are not familiar with and you should be able to learn a lot more than what a couple of books could teach you. Don’t forget that these are battle-tested commands and hence much more valuable than standard examples in blogs. If you cannot understand what the above command does, don’t worry—I’ll explain it later on in the piece.</p>

<h3 id="fear-of-screwing-up">Fear of screwing up</h3>

<p>I have been using Linux for a couple of years but I still have this fear. This fear was multi-fold when I started. One thing that helped me a lot was, I spoke to Linux pros in my company and made a blacklist—a list of commands that I should never use or use with caution. sudo rm -rf was the top of the list. If you are anxious like me you can use <a href="https://github.com/nivekuil/rip" target="_blank">https://github.com/nivekuil/rip</a> on your local machine.</p>

<p>When I was going through the stage of being afraid of screwing up this Youtube user was of great help: <a href="https://www.jacobgoldstein.tk/linux-survival-guide/youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech/" target="_blank">ChrisTitus</a>. I wish I had spent more time watching him and learnt a couple more of his tricks. Find your angels and they will help you face your fears.</p>

<p>Now that your fears are addressed, let’s get started.</p>

<h2 id="why-you-should-learn-linux">Why You Should Learn Linux</h2>

<p>There are countless reasons why you should learn Linux. A google search will fetch you thousands of articles about why you should learn Linux, such as “<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-benefits-of-learning-Linux" target="_blank">What are the benefits of learning Linux</a>,” “<a href="https://fossbytes.com/10-reasons-switch-linux-os-right-now/" target="_blank">Why you should switch to Linux</a>” and “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/38zytg/is_it_worth_my_time_to_learn_linux_while_learning/" target="_blank">Is it worth my time to learn Linux while learning programming</a>?” Those three articles are worth a read, but here are my top two reasons why you should learn:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Linux is ubiquitous</strong>: Linux is everywhere. So with or without your knowledge there is a high probability that you are already using or benefitting from Linux. Understanding the basics of Linux can therefore come in handy in many situations. If you are a programmer then that chance is fairly high. A fair number of applications are deployed on Linux servers. So learning it can be a lifesaver.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Linux is versatile</strong>: <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/11396/217036" target="_blank">Both Linux and MAC are built on UNIX.</a> So if you are comfortable with the Linux terminal you should be able to use most of the commands in MAC terminal as well. <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/25463/does-android-really-use-the-same-kernel-as-linux" target="_blank">Android uses the Linux kernel. </a><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi uses Linux.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Embedded_devices" target="_blank">Many embedded devices use Linux.</a></p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-did-you-start-learning-linux">Why Did You Start Learning Linux?</h2>

<p>As we’ve seen, there are many reasons for you to learn Linux. But if you are a programmer, there’s a fair chance that you fall into one of the two following categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You read up about the cool things that Linux can do or you heard from a friend who just can’t stop raving about Linux.</p></li>

<li><p>Your laptop or desktop has a non-Unix OS. But your application or website is deployed on a Linux server.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you fall under the first category, you have all the time in the world. So take your sweet little time. If you fall under the second category, then there is a fair chance that you are running against a deadline. So finish the next parts and get your hands dirty.</p>

<h2 id="man-command-is-your-friend-or-is-it">Man Command Is Your Friend. Or Is It?</h2>

<p>One of the first tips you get when you want to learn Linux is “Use man command, it is your friend.” While there is a certain truth to it, it can be overwhelming for many first-time users. All you generally need are the options for the most frequently used scenarios of the command—and that is what is precisely missing from man pages. Luckily for you, there’s a project called <a href="https://tldr.sh/" target="_blank">TLDR </a>which is trying to fix exactly that.</p>

<p>Just compare the outputs of these two commands to see what I mean.</p>

<p><strong>First, output from man pages.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2302/1*0QXjvacgzf1OHvziiX9s2w.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now the output from TLDR project.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZrSUDueSxi2uezlLqoq1iQ.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Do you see the difference?</p>

<p>TLDR is like the notes about commands I would have written for myself. I find it very handy. I installed the TLDR using <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs</a> command sudo npm i -g tldr. If you have not installed nodejs I suggest you do it, as there are many node packages that are very handy. You can install nodejs using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04" target="_blank">this installation manual by Digitial Ocean.</a></p>

<p>I thought of sharing my notes on all the commands in this post, but then I came across a post by Andrew where he covers 101 bash commands:
<a href="https://dev.to/awwsmm/101-bash-commands-and-tips-for-beginners-to-experts-30je#whereis-which-whatis" target="_blank"><strong>101 Bash Commands and Tips for Beginners to Experts</strong>
*Andrew Jan 13 ・39 min readThe commands below are laid out in a more-or-less narrative style, so if you’re just getting…*dev.to</a></p>

<p>He has categorised all the commands and has good examples as well, and I can’t do a better job than that.</p>

<h2 id="learn-about-bash-profiles">Learn About Bash Profiles</h2>

<p>I found bash config files or bash profiles to be handy, so it helps to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/415444/493742" target="_blank">learn the differences and how they work</a>.</p>

<p>One rule of thumb I follow is to add all my configs to .bash_profile and also make sure to load .bashrc within the .bash_profile file. I add my favourite aliases to this file. I keep a basic version of my .bash_profile in my private gist and I download the raw version of that on the servers where I need these.</p>



<h2 id="learn-to-use-emacs">Learn to Use Emacs</h2>

<p>One thing that I look for these days is commonality. This has helped me leverage what I know in multiple scenarios. For example, we are pushing a lot of Javascript in our team as we can use it in multiple scenarios, like our website front end, in browser console to scrape things quickly, debug our front end or learn from other websites, for joining collections in mongodb, and in nodejs for server side.</p>

<p>Stressing commonality helps us “Learn Once, Benefit Multiple Times”—a much greater ROI.</p>

<p>Coming back to Linux, I wanted to decide on a command line editor. I had the options of choosing Nano, Vim, or Emacs. I chose <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html" target="_blank">Emacs</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the commands used in Emacs can also be used in Linux shell. For example, you can use CTRL/CMD+A to go to the beginning of the line on both shell and Emacs. There are many such commands which work in both shell and Emacs. I think this is a huge advantage.</p>

<p>Since it is a command line editor, you can install it easily on any server. On every server where I am root I generally install Emacs. I am not sure if this is a good practice, but I generally find it very convenient. Yes I have decided not to learn Nano or Vim. Roast me for it if you want to.</p>

<h2 id="pipe-it">PIPE It</h2>

<p>Pipe command in Linux lets you use the output of one command as the input of the next command. This can be really helpful once you get the hang of a few Linux commands like grep, sort, awk, uniq, head, and tail. Piping along with these commands is immensely powerful. For example, I never remember what the options are in ls for showing only text files (and I don’t think you should either). I just run the following command.</p>

<pre><code>ls -l | grep txt
</code></pre>

<p>I know this is quick and dirty but it works in most scenarios.</p>

<p>For example, if we look at the history processing command we used in the first section:</p>

<pre><code>history | awk ‘{ $1=””; print $0 }’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
</code></pre>

<p>We are taking the output of the history command, and we are passing it to awk to remove the line numbers at the beginning of each line from the output. Then we are passing the output to the sort command so that we can sort it. Then we are passing the output uniq command to retain only unique lines along with the number of occurrences. Then we are passing it to sort command to sort it in reverse order. Then we are passing it to head command to list only the top 20 most frequently used commands that are present in our history.</p>

<p>How cool is that?</p>

<h2 id="grep-it">GREP it</h2>

<p>If you are used to SDKs and GUI editors, GREP might seem little limited. But most of the time, the differentiator is that you can chain the output of the grep …</p></div></div>

    </p>
    <p>Most of my work over the past 10 years has involved writing what is often called a <em>wizard</em>.</p>
<p>A wizard is essentially a multi-step process that guides a user through a particular workflow. For example, if you are installing a new application on your computer, the wizard might guide you through the following process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enter your license registration details</li>
<li>Agree to the software author’s legal terms</li>
<li>Specify an installation location</li>
</ol>
<p>Most web applications provide something similar. If a user needs to input a large amount of data for the application to then run a bunch of calculations, you could of course just provide the user with one big web form. At a certain size though, a single web form can be intimidating and provide a less than ideal user experience. The canonical way to improve the user experience here is to break up the web form into several separate pages. This is another example of a wizard.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://jezenthomas.com/static/img/wizard-diagram.jpg" alt="Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps"><figcaption>Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’ve tried writing wizards in a number of different web technologies, and so far Elm has proven itself as by far the most robust and painless, <em>especially</em> when it inevitably comes to changing some conditional logic to meet the mutable needs of various business processes.</p>
<p>For any small Elm application, project structure is easy. There is no reason why a 1,000 line Elm application can’t live in a single file. In fact this is really how every Elm application ought to begin its life. Start with a single file with the usual boilerplate and the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single sum type to model all of the messages your application supports</li>
<li>A single model which contains all the application state</li>
<li>A single update function for advancing the application state</li>
<li>A single view function for rendering the application state on the page</li>
</ul>
<p>If your web form is complex enough to warrant being broken into separate pages however, then your application is naturally not going to consist of a small number of lines of code. A common concern among less experienced Elm programmers is that one big sum type for all of your messages becomes unwieldy to maintain. The same is said of having one big shallow record for all of the application state, or one big <code>update</code> function to match all the constructors of the one big <code>Msg</code> type. This is where unnecessary complexity starts to balloon as programmers add <em>clever</em> abstractions and misdirections, usually involving both <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code>, separate <code>update</code> functions for each logical subsection of your application (usually with noticeably awkward type signatures), and some vague hand-waving in the direction of <em>encapsulation</em> and so-called <em>Clean Code</em>.</p>
<p>I’d argue that this kind of misdirection is almost <em>never</em> what you want. I’d argue further that this applies <em>especially</em> to you if your background is in maintaining complex React/Angular applications, where invented complexity is the status quo and this kind of misdirection is simply what you have become desensitised to.</p>
<p>So if the combination of <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code> are to be avoided, how can we scale an Elm application without sacrificing developer ergonomics? In short, the tricks to employ are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nested sum types</li>
<li>Nested record types</li>
<li>Nested update functions</li>
<li>Small, composable view functions</li>
<li>Function composition</li>
<li>Lenses</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at a more concrete application of these ideas. As an example, we can model the process of a person applying for a bank loan.</p>
<p>The bank will want to ask the applicant a whole bunch of questions, which we could group into three categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Personal information</li>
<li>Details on the purpose of the loan</li>
<li>Financial information and creditworthiness</li>
</ol>
<p>This would suggest a three-step wizard or a three-page web form. A reasonable place to begin splitting our application apart into three smaller pieces is in our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-msg-type">The Big Msg Type</h2>
<p>The naïve way to model the messages our application should support is with one big sum type, which might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type Page
  = PersonalInformationPage
  | LoanPurposePage
  | FinancialDetailsPage

type Msg
  -- System-wide messages
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  -- etc…

  -- Personal information
  | SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- …more messages for the personal information page

  -- Purpose of the loan
  | SetPurchaseItemCategory
  | SetPurchaseItemEstimatedValue
  -- …more messages for the loan purpose page

  -- Financial information
  | SetMonthlyIncomeBeforeTax
  | SetMonthlyRentPayment
  -- …more messages about the applicant's financial details</code></pre>
<p>This <em>does</em> work, but at some point it becomes cumbersome to support a large number of constructors. The value for “large” is of course determined by the individual programmer’s personal taste and/or pain threshold. To ease this pain, people typically <em>extract</em> groups of messages into their own separate sum types, which subsequently forces them to write update functions that return a type <em>other</em> than the top-level <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<p><em>Don’t do that!</em></p>
<p>The way to break these groups of constructors out is by first nesting them inside the <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>type PersonalInformationMsg
  = SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- etc..

type LoanPurposeMsg -- etc…

type FinancialDetailsMsg -- etc…

type Msg
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  | PersonalInformationMsg PersonalInformationMsg
  | LoanPurposeMsg LoanPurposeMsg
  | FinancialDetailsMsg FinancialDetailsMsg</code></pre>
<p>The new message types can live in the same file as the top-level <code>Msg</code> type. They can also be extracted to different files. That’s your choice.</p>
<p>The next thing to tackle is our <code>update</code> function, since it needs to mirror our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="nested-update-functions">Nested Update Functions</h2>
<p>I’ve seen people advocate for page-specific <code>update</code> functions which take a page-specific model and return a tuple of that page-specific model and a page-specific <code>Cmd Msg</code> equivalent. This is typically where you see <code>Cmd.map</code> sneaking in. These functions almost inevitably end up needing <em>something</em> from the top-level application-wide state, so you’ll often see some type signature like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation
   : Model
  -&gt; (PersonalInformationModel, Cmd PersonalInformationMsg)
  -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>way</em> too complex already, and this approach doesn’t even actually buy you anything.</p>
<p>The far simpler way to do this is to have every nested <code>update</code> function take a page-specific message, the <em>entire</em> application state, and return the same type for that state along with the top-level <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName a    -&gt; -- …
  SetLastName a     -&gt; -- …
  SetAddressLine1 a -&gt; -- …
  -- etc…

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model = case msg of
  NoOp -&gt; (model, Cmd.none)
  SetPage page -&gt; ({ model | page = page }, Cmd.none)
  PersonalInformationMsg subMsg -&gt; updatePersonalInformation subMsg model
  LoanPurposeMsg subMsg -&gt; updateLoanPurpose subMsg model
  FinancialDetailsMsg subMsg -&gt; updateFinancialDetails subMsg model</code></pre>
<p>No complicated type signatures. No juggling of message types. No <code>Cmd.map</code>. Easy.</p>
<p>Of course the whole point of our <code>update</code> function is to advance the state of our model, and the structure of that model is also something that can swell and become unwieldy, so that’s what we will dissect next.</p>
<h2 id="record-surgery">Record Surgery</h2>
<p>Near the inception of the project, all of our individual bits of state might exist at the top level of our <code>Model</code>, which is typically represented as a record. Perhaps something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , addressLine1 : String
  -- …more personal information fields

  , purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …more loan purpose fields…

  -- …and also financial details, and system-wide state, etc…
  }</code></pre>
<p>Like the parts of our project we’ve addressed previously, this also can turn into a bit of a mess as it grows. Both application-wide data and page-specific data are mixed in together which feels a bit haphazard. Fortunately, grouping and extracting these fields is typically rather intuitive. We can start by grouping page-specific parts of the state together, and then group further until it no longer <em>feels</em> messy.</p>
<pre><code>type alias Address =
  { line1 : String
  , line2 : String
  , city : String
  , postcode : String
  -- …
  }

type alias PersonalInformation =
  { firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , address : Address
  -- …
  }

type alias LoanPurpose =
  { purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …
  }

type alias FinancialDetails = -- …

type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , personalInformation : PersonalInformation
  , loanPurpose : LoanPurpose
  , financialDetails : FinancialDetails
  }</code></pre>
<p>The problem now however is that when we wish to update a deeply-nested field, we need to write all of the code to unwrap each level until we arrive at the depth we need. Illustrated another way, let’s say we want to update the first line of the applicant’s address.</p>
<p>Retrieving the value of this field is no problem, as we can use Elm’s dot syntax to succinctly get us all the way there, like this:</p>
<pre><code>model.personalInformation.address.line1</code></pre>
<p>What we <em>can’t</em> do here however is <em>update</em> that field in a similar fashion, <em>i.e.</em>, Elm won’t allow us to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>-- This won't work
{ model.personalInformation.address | line1 = newLine1 }

-- This also won't work
{ model | personalInformation.address.line1 = newLine1 }</code></pre>
<p>The naïve way to unwrap and subsequently update the field in this record is to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetLastName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetAddressLine1 newLine1 -&gt;
    let
        personalInformation =
          …</code></pre></article></div></div>

	<section>
		<p>Sometimes you encounter a striking figure of speech, comparison or just a metaphor that illustrates some concept in a much better way than anything you knew until now. It's so good you can't let it get unnoticed. In my case, it happened e.g. when I've learned to think about architects as "navigators". Or quite recently, while I was reading a very decent book by <a href="https://twitter.com/rands">Michael Lopp</a> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50083106-the-art-of-leadership">"The Art of Leadership: Small Things, Done Well"</a>.</p><p>Speaking about the latter: my epiphany moment happened during chapter IV, entirely dedicated to the author's actionable advice for engineering leaders. The concluding one was about a reasonable alternative to micro-management: Lopp calls it ... <em>"tasting the soup"</em>. And I think it's brilliant and 100% spot-on.</p><p><strong>Tasting the soup</strong> - what does it mean?</p><p>Imagine a professional chef. A chief boss-cook. A reigning monarch of the kitchen (e.g. in a top-notch, highly reputed, Michelin-starred restaurant). (S)he is the person accountable for the quality of the holistic culinary experience here. It's his(/her) reputation at stake if customers are dissatisfied (for any reason). But still, it doesn't mean (s)he does all the job him(/her)self (to guarantee a suitable level of quality) - quite the opposite. There's the talented, hand-picked crew doing all the "dirty" work, while the chef-in-charge:</p><ul><li>tastes</li><li>probes</li><li>verifies</li></ul><p>It's not that (s)he cares only about the final outcome - the 100% ready dish. (S)he engages <u>at all the various stages</u> (of meal preparation): by inspecting raw materials, half-cooked ingredients, nearly ready products about to get the final touch. &nbsp;What's more - the soup is <u>"multi-dimensional"</u> - it has several equally important aspects (to assess separately): consistency, smell, color, temperature, sweetness, bitterness, spiciness, etc.</p><p>Needless to say - the chef can't (&amp; shouldn't) be everywhere, all the time. (S)he <strong>can't assist every elementary activity</strong> - which is good and ... desirable. One <u>should not judge</u> the effect by the activities performed (which are - in many cases - meaningful "implementation" details or just elements of a highly-individualized style) but <strong>by the outcomes and how they match expectations </strong>(stated beforehand).</p><p>That's why (s)he restrains her(/him)self <u>to taste and probe</u> - it's sufficient because of <strong>past, practical experience</strong>. Precisely because of her/his experience, (s)he knows what to expect, whether the chosen direction is correct, whether there's a chance the final product will be edible &amp; satisfactory (aka will meet the given success criteria). (S)he's been there, (s)he's seen that. And as the one who knows what to expect, the chef is more probably able to detect all those very early warning lights and propose corrective actions.</p><p>Let me emphasize it again - micro-managing all the actions is not the way. Even with experience - <strong>it's NOT possible to know all the correct paths</strong>. Never ever. The number (of correct, good enough options) is endless.</p><p>I hope you've already figured it out by yourself - this chef soup tasting story can be easily mapped onto engineering management scenarios. Everything that has been said about the chef above can be directly translated into software development leaders' reality — starting with the role of experience and the importance of probing the effects (the current state of - process, tooling, various stages of deliverable completeness).</p><p>The default mode of an engineering manager's work should NOT be to dive deep into every possible (implementation) detail - it's just not feasible (but necessary in carefully chosen, critical situations that demand a more direct approach because of some warning lights flashing). A good engineering manager has to be able to:</p><ul><li>quickly orient her(/him)self in a situational context</li><li>identify the qualities that need to be assessed at this point</li><li>find a way to inspect them efficiently and objectively</li><li>confront the perceived learnings with expectations and past experience of similar endeavors</li></ul><p>In other words - to <em>"taste the engineering soup"</em>.</p><p>I think this metaphor is useful not just in calibrating your efforts (as an engineer manager), but also (as it's very "visual") can be very helpful in clarifying the meaning and importance of the engineering manager role: why is it needed, what value does it provide and what kind of input can one expect from a person bearing such a role.</p>

<p>The Obama administration inherited a vast economic crisis. They responded with Quantitative Easing, pumping trillions into the finance sector to rescue the banks that had knowingly gambled on bad mortgages, losing so much they were about to go under.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/the-fed-launched-qe-nine-years-ago--these-four-charts-show-its-impact.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/the-fed-launched-qe-nine-years-ago–these-four-charts-show-its-impact.html</a></p>
<p>At the time, deficit hawks predicted inflation, which is a commonsense prediction: inflation is what happens when the amount of money chasing goods and services goes up faster than the supply of those goods and services, creating bidding wars.</p>
<p>They were right…and wrong. What we got was asset bubbles, especially in housing markets, driving up the price of putting a roof over your head rewarding speculators and landlords, especially Wall Street landlords.</p>
<p>And Obama's handling of the financial crisis put a lot of us under the thumbs of landlords! Obama bailed out the banks, but not the mortgage holders, kicking off waves of foreclosures.</p>
<p>Thanks to lax oversight, banks that had cheated to originate or service mortgages were able to cheat on foreclosures, too – stealing houses from borrowers who were up-to-date on payments or who were entitled to forebearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101017014628/http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20101014/bs_yblog_upshot/is-david-j-stern-the-poster-boy-for-the-foreclosure-mess">https://web.archive.org/web/20101017014628/http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20101014/bs_yblog_upshot/is-david-j-stern-the-poster-boy-for-the-foreclosure-mess</a></p>
<p>I mean, literally stealing houses by the hundreds or even the thousands. The very same people who created the great financial crisis got bailed out, rather than punished, and used their new lease on life to commit even worse crimes with total impunity.</p>
<p>The houses that were foreclosed (and sometimes stolen) were flipped to Wall Street, who LOVE financial products based on peoples' homes. After all, people will move heaven and earth to keep shelter over their kids' heads.</p>

<p>Corporate landlords built a sturdy, three-legged stool to guarantee the flow of rents to their investors.</p>
<p>I. Jack up rents to consume the majority of tenants' income:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/09/wall-street-owns-main-street-literally.html">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/09/wall-street-owns-main-street-literally.html</a></p>
<p>II. Cease maintenance, knowing that your tenants have no recourse if their homes are crumbling and unsafe:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-housing-invitation/">https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-housing-invitation/</a></p>
<p>III. Perfect the eviction, heretofore an American rarity:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-03/wall-street-america-s-new-landlord-kicks-tenants-to-the-curb">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-03/wall-street-america-s-new-landlord-kicks-tenants-to-the-curb</a></p>
<p>America's housing crisis – substandard homes rented at unsustainable costs to people who had their own homes stolen from them by the same investors they're currently paying rent to – is a major legacy of QE, and it's definitely inflationary.</p>
<p>But it's a highly selective form of inflation. Many people won't experience it at all: if you owned your house before the crisis and weathered it, the asset bubble has made your home more valuable, while falling interest rates let you refi at rock-bottom rates. You're great.</p>
<p>You're paying less than ever for a home that's worth more than ever, but that's a spillover effect of the main show, which is the process by which millions of Americans were robbed of their homes and then moved into high-priced slums to the benefit of the 1%.</p>
<p>Both Obama and Trump have boasted of the economy's performance since QE, pointing to soaring share prices – share prices that are totally decoupled from company performance. Companies lose money and still gain value.</p>
<p>Indeed, predatory companies (like Grubhub, Postmates, Door Dash and Uber Eats) that destroy profitable companies (restaurants) while still losing money are booming in value.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza</a></p>
<p>Investors understand that consumers have no money, due to rising housing costs plus crashing wages, largely thanks to the "gig economy," a polite term for "worker misclassification."</p>
<p>Companies that get bailouts would be stupid to spend the money on jobs or new productive capacity to make stuff no one can afford to buy. Instead, they buy their own shares and declare dividends, driving up share prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/20/the-cadillac-of-murdermobiles/#austerity">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/20/the-cadillac-of-murdermobiles/#austerity</a></p>
<p>We have seen an incredible market bull-run since the Great Financial Crisis, a run that has largely continued since the pandemic. It's the other asset bubble: a bubble in investment assets.</p>
<p>Corporate leaders claim responsibility for these rises, but the reality is that it's the predictable result of bailing out banks and companies rather than workers and homeowners.</p>
<p>Société Générale's analysts say that about half of the stock market's gains since 2008 can be attributed to QE.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/without-qe-the-s-p-500-would-be-trading-closer-to-1-800-than-3-300-says-societe-generale-11604688442">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/without-qe-the-s-p-500-would-be-trading-closer-to-1-800-than-3-300-says-societe-generale-11604688442</a></p>
<p>Top-down bailouts have multiplier effects. The banks are made whole, then they get to steal our houses, then they get to steal our rents, then they get to goose their share prices.</p>
<p>This is how the super-rich got even richer, before and after the pandemic. It's also why the tiny minority of Americans with adequate retirement savings saw them swell – it's another spillover effect of the great upward transfer of national wealth.</p>
<p>Why does all of this matter now? Well, between my writing my first paragraph and this one, Biden was declared, giving us what the Biden campaign signalled would be "Obama's third term."</p>
<p>Biden's taking office amidst a financial crisis that's far worse than 2008.</p>
<p>Biden has a long track-record of giving legislative gifts to the finance sector at the expense of the American people. They called him "The Senator from MNBA" for a reason.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gq.com/story/joe-biden-bankruptcy-bill">https://www.gq.com/story/joe-biden-bankruptcy-bill</a></p>
<p>If he addresses this crisis the same way that he did in 2008 – the way that Congress and the Senate addressed the crisis in 2020 – by bailing out finance, not the public, we're seriously fucked.</p>
<p>Sure, the stock market will continue to rise and rise, as will house prices.</p>
<p>If you are in the 1%, you will get SO MUCH richer. If you're in the 10%, your retirement savings will swell, your mortgage will get cheaper, and your house's value will go up.</p>
<p>For everyone else: evictions, foreclosures, soaring rents, worse wages.</p>
<p>Last week, California voters passed Prop 22, safeguarding the right of gig economy companies to misclassify their workers as contractors and pay them sub-minimum wages, withhold benefits, evade payroll and unemployment taxes, etc.</p>
<p>Uber/Lyft spent $200m to secure that win.</p>
<p>As Prop 22's promoters remind us: Gig work is the new unemployment benefit: it's a private-sector jobs guarantee, work you can get at the tap of your screen. It's a perfect labor market – workers effectively bid to offer the best price to perform servant work for others.</p>
<p>The more workers there are, and the more desperate their situation is, the lower the payments go. A lot of those savings are siphoned off by the (money-losing, stock-soaring) gig companies, but some of it is passed onto customers.</p>
<p>This is by design.</p>
<p>Since the Reagan years, neoliberal regulators and lawmakers have hewed to a radical anti-monopoly theory called "consumer harm." Under "consumer harm," monopolies are only a problem if they drive up prices.</p>
<p>Since gig companies lower prices, they are totally kosher – even if they secure monopolies through predatory pricing.</p>
<p>But there's an even more insidious side to "consumer harm" and the gig economy.</p>
<p>Misclassifying workers as independent contractors converts a brutally exploited workforce into a collection of "small businesses." If they get together and demand higher wages, THEY violate the consumer harm standard. They're a group of companies fixing prices!</p>
<p>We're 12 years into the QE experiment and it has demonstrated the relationship between government money-creation and inflation: inflation isn't the result of government spending, it's the result of government spending that leads to bidding wars.</p>
<p>Giving trillion to the rich created inflation in the things that rich people buy: our houses (out from under us) and stocks.</p>
<p>Now, imagine what a People's Bailout could do.</p>
<p>Imagine replacing the gig economy job guarantee (a workfare program with no workplace protections, job security or minimum wage) with an actual Job Guarantee as described by the economist Pavlina Tcherneva:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/05/the-hard-stuff/#jobs-guarantee">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/05/the-hard-stuff/#jobs-guarantee</a></p>
<p>Federally funded, locally administered: good jobs at inclusive wages that served community needs proposed by community groups and approved by local governments.</p>
<p>Would that be inflationary? Recall that inflation is what happens when the number of buyers goes up and the supply of things they're buying doesn't keep up. Inflation is the result of bidding wars.</p>
<p>For a jobs guarantee to be inflationary, there would have to be a bidding war for the US workforce. That is the opposite of what we have now.</p>

<p>The reason no one wants to buy Americans' labor is that no one has any money to buy the things Americans make with their labor. The only people with money – the wealthy – primarily buy our homes out from under us, and stocks.</p>
<p>QE for the wealthy has made the economy incredibly perverse. Productive companies are being driven to bankruptcy by gig economy companies that lose money. Millions of workers compete to provide services for the lucky few, for dwindling wages.</p>
<p>Workers can't afford to buy stuff so companies have no reason to make stuff and so they become finance grifts, until they collapse, like Hertz did (after it converted itself from a …</p></div></article></div>

                <div>
                    <p>On April 2020, Mark Russinovich announced the release of a new event type for Sysmon version 11.0: event ID 23, File Delete. As indicated by the name, it logs file delete events that occur on the system. In addition to this, another functionality came alongside allowing files marked for deletion to be archived, enabling defenders to track tools being dropped by malware to better understand the actor's capabilities and develop signatures. This article will discuss the internals of Sysmon version 11.11's to gain insight into how it operates and its limitations. I have briefly checked Sysmon version 12.0 as it was released (September 17, 2020) during the writing of this article and the code for this event looks almost identical so the information should still be mostly relevant.</p><p>Before beginning the article, a huge thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/SBousseaden">Samir</a> for the collaborative effort on this journey.</p><p>Let's first understand the conditions for which the file delete event will be triggered. The file events are handled almost entirely by the <code>SysmonDrv.sys</code> driver through the minifilter component. Specifically, it monitors for three I/O request packets (IRP) <code>IRP_MJ_CREATE</code>, <code>IRP_MJ_CLEANUP</code>, and <code>IRP_MJ_WRITE</code> for file creates, complete handle closes (reference count on a file object reaching zero), and writes respectively.</p><h2 id="irp_mj_create">IRP_MJ_CREATE</h2><p>The purpose of this IRP in the context of file deletes is to handle two situations: file overwrites and file deletes using the <code>FLAG_FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code> option.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png"><figcaption>File overwrite versus <code>FLAG_FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code></figcaption></figure><p>Sysmon will check first whether the file was opened with <code>FLAG_FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code>, and if it is, the configuration's filter rules will be matched against. If the conditions are met, the delete event will be created and the file will be archived in the <code>IRP_MJ_CLEANUP</code> request when all the handles to the file are closed.</p><p>On the other hand, if the file already exists and is being opened with overwrite intent (disposition value is either <code>FILE_OVERWRITE</code> or <code>FILE_OVERWRITE_IF</code>), the driver will attempt to open the file with <code>FltCreateFile</code>. If the function fails with <code>STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND</code>, the file doesn't exist and Sysmon will pass it on to be handled as a file create event. Otherwise, if it returns successfully, the target file exists and will be archived immediately, creating the delete event in tandem.</p><h2 id="irp_mj_cleanup">IRP_MJ_CLEANUP</h2><p>As mentioned before, this request is sent when all of the referenced handles to a file have been closed. Sysmon handles this request by checking the <code>DeletePending</code> flag in the file object and archiving the file if it's set. In the case of <code>FLAG_FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</code>, Sysmon will explicitly set the file's delete disposition to true using <code>FltSetInformationFile</code> with <code>FileDispositionInformation</code> before checking the <code>DeletePending</code> flag.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image.png"><figcaption>File is archived if <code>DeletePending</code> is set</figcaption></figure><h2 id="irp_mj_write">IRP_MJ_WRITE</h2><p>Sysmon also considers file content overwrites instead of just classic file deletes. To meet this condition, the write must originate from user mode, the write size must be greater than or equal to the size of the target file and the write should start at the zeroth offset.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png"><figcaption>File write should start at offset 0 and be greater than or equal to the file size</figcaption></figure><p>Sysmon will then read the first byte of the file before iterating through each byte of the buffer that will be written. To trigger the file archiving and delete event, all of the bytes must match the first recorded byte. Sysmon refers to this as <em>shredding</em> where all bytes of the overwrite are the same, e.g. <em>AAAAAAA...</em>. </p><p>There is one more condition under <code>IRP_MJ_WRITE</code> which triggers the archive and delete event however, I was unable to trigger or trace the conditions required. Perhaps this would be an upcoming feature?</p><p>Now that the conditions of file delete events have been covered, let's investigate the implementation details.</p><h2 id="file-delete-requirements">File Delete Requirements</h2><p>The first function to cover is one I call <code>CheckAndQueueFileDeleteEvent</code> and its main purpose is to check if the target file should be archived and if a delete event should be logged. It achieves this in several ways with a few initial checks. If any of the following conditions are met, the file delete event will be bypassed:</p><ol><li>The operation is made by the registered service process (should be <code>Sysmon64.exe</code>),</li><li>The delete event was not set in the configuration,</li><li>The target file is a device or directory,</li><li>The file is empty,</li><li>The file's parent directory is the archive directory.</li></ol><p>After these initial checks, the function will retrieve the file's extension using <code>FltParseFileNameInformation</code> and also check if the file is an executable by using a few <code>FltReadFile</code> calls to read the <code>MZ</code> and <code>PE</code> signatures at offset 0 and <code>0x3C</code> respectively. These values are returned back to the caller along with the image file name responsible for the operation.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-3.png"><figcaption>Checking for PE executable signatures</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, it makes a call to a function I labelled <code>QueueFileDeleteEvent</code> to perform a final check if the file should be archived and logged. </p><h2 id="reporting-file-delete-events">Reporting File Delete Events</h2><p>The following represents the proprietary file delete event structure:</p><figure><pre><code>typedef struct _FILE_DELETE_EVENT {
	/*   0 */ ULONG Id;          // 0xF0000000 for file delete.
	/*   4 */ ULONG Size;        // Struct size.
	/*   8 */ PVOID Unk1;
	/*  10 */ PVOID Unk2;
	/*  18 */ HANDLE ProcessHandle;
	/*  20 */ PKSYSTEM_TIME SystemUtcTime;
	/*  28 */ ULONG HashMethod;
	/*  2C */ BOOLEAN IsExecutable;
	/*  30 */ ULONG SidLength;
	/*  34 */ ULONG ObjectNameLength;
	/*  38 */ ULONG ImageFileNameLength;
	/*  3C */ ULONG HashLength;
	/*  40 */ WCHAR StatusString[256];
	/* 240 */ PEPROCESS ServiceProcessHandle;	// Actually a PEPROCESS object.
	/* 248 */ PKEVENT Event;
	/* 250 */ PBOOLEAN IsArchivedAddress;
	/* 258 */ // User SID.
	/* xxx */ // Object name.
	/* xxx */ // Image file name.
	/* xxx */ // File hash.
} FILE_DELETE_EVENT, * PFILE_DELETE_EVENT;</code></pre><figcaption>File delete event structure</figcaption></figure><p>The event is allocated and set in <code>QueueFileDeleteEvent</code>. But besides the obvious purpose of reporting file delete event data, it has another important, secondary purpose. The tenth argument to this function is a pointer that represents the boolean value of whether the target file should be archived. Although this pointer is optional, if it is a valid, non-zero value, this function serves to pass the event data to <code>Sysmon64.exe</code> via an event queue to be checked against the filter conditions provided in the configuration file.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png"><figcaption>Valid tenth argument</figcaption></figure><p>This explains the existence of the <code>Event</code>, <code>IsArchivedAddress</code>, and the <code>ServiceProcessHandle</code> members of the <code>FILE_DELETE_EVENT</code> structure. After intialising these values and the structure, the event is queued in a function I labelled <code>QueueEvent</code> and the thread is blocked using <code>KeWaitForMultipleObjects</code> waiting on either the <code>Event</code> or the <code>Sysmon64.exe</code> process.</p><figure><img src="https://undev.ninja/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png"><figcaption>Thread blocking after queuing file delete event</figcaption></figure><p>To understand this further, we need to know how events are reported from the driver to <code>Sysmon64.exe</code>.</p><h3 id="queueevent">QueueEvent</h3><p>Sysmon utilises a doubly linked list to queue up events. In this article, I will refer to it as <code>g_EventReportList</code>. This function is relatively straightforward, if the event size is not greater than <code>0x3FCB8 + 0x348</code> (40000) it will be appended to <code>g_EventReportList</code>, otherwise, an incorrect event size error will be created. Since we are not concerned about the error event, we'll skip it for brevity.</p><p>An allocation for a new data structure is created to wrap the event argument:</p><pre><code>typedef struct _EVENT_REPORT {
    /*  0 */ LIST_ENTRY ListEntry;
    /* 10 */ ULONG EventDataSize;
    /* 18 */ PVOID EventData;

<p>Over the next few weeks (maybe months — blame my vacation), I plan to focus on decision making. It's a subject I'm passionate about because it was life-changing from the moment I started paying attention to it. Not only in my financial life (this is a financial blog) but also in my career and my relationships. My goal here is to (hopefully) introduce you to some new concepts, and get you excited about making decisions. You won't learn it all here. I'll link additional books and resources that can help you further your understanding at the bottom of each post. As always, reply to the newsletter or email me if you have questions.</p><hr><p>Every decision you make is a bet. Saying yes to something is betting on the future you expect by making that choice. Similarly, you're betting against the alternate realities where you provided a different answer. Not all decisions require contemplating. Ice-cream or no ice-cream, for example, won't result in drastically different futures. Not unless your potential soulmate is the one selling the ice-cream. It's not all deep, but sometimes it is. Some of the 'small' decisions I made in the past turned out to be huge leaps in retrospect. Like me, you won't know it at the time. But hindsight is twenty-twenty, therefore it's important to make fewer bad decisions.</p><hr><p>Annie Duke's <a href="https://amzn.to/3jCpX5E"><em>Thinking in Bets</em></a> has arguably had the most influence on how I view odds. The book tries to help you make smarter decisions when you do not have all the facts. It is one of the few books I continue to recommend — I've read it more than once (this is rare). Let's say you're having an ardent conversation with a friend about who will be the NBA Finals MVP. You could continue to go back and forth for hours or you could ask them: <strong><em>Wanna Bet?</em></strong> It's a simple and effective way to cut an argument like this one short. Talk is cheap (monetarily and mentally). Anyone can say anything as long as there's nothing to lose. The bet only gets interesting if something valuable is at risk. It could be money, reputation, or a future favor.</p><h3 id="wanna-bet">Wanna Bet?</h3><p>Consider the following statement: <em>LeBron will definitely be the NBA finals MVP next year</em>. Play along here; forget how you feel about James and the Lakers for a few minutes. It doesn't cost you anything to be wrong, therefore uttering that statement didn't require any critical thinking. But what if something is at stake? How much between $100 and $10,000 would you be willing to bet on your position? There's a good chance you'd want to take a step back to evaluate the odds. Maybe you are not $10,000 sure, but you are sure enough to bet $100.</p><p>If you're still willing to bet $10,000, you either don't value the money, or you have some hidden information about the outcome of the NBA season and the fate of its athletes. But what if you don't have all the facts? What if, like me, you can't predict the future? How do you approach betting? &nbsp;Now that you're thinking, the statement now reads... <em>LeBron will likely be the NBA finals MVP next year.</em></p><blockquote>We process information to support our beliefs instead of using it to calibrate our beliefs - Annie Duke (Some Podcast)</blockquote><h3 id="calibrate-your-belief">Calibrate Your Belief</h3><p>The chances that LeBron James will be the Finals MVP isn't a yes or a no question. Contrary to how we've been wired in school, most questions can't be answered with true or false. The world is more complicated than that. LeBron James could get injured. The Lakers may not execute as well as they did this season. The season could be postponed due to some unforeseen circumstance like a virus, war, or aliens. Before you finish laughing at the part about aliens, remember that unknown information can have an outsized impact on the outcome of your decisions.</p><blockquote>Remember that the things we don't expect tend to have asymmetric impacts on our lives compared to what we prepare for. This is especially true in a year like 2020, but keep it in mind moving forward.</blockquote><p>Stop thinking in black and white or right and wrong. <strong>You should try thinking in percentages instead.</strong> Sure, the outcome is binary. At the end of the season, LeBron will either have the MVP title or not. But the road to each of those realities isn't as clear. James is going to fall somewhere between the most undeserving player and the most deserving player in the NBA. It's difficult to know for sure because luck plays a big role here. But the answer isn't either 0 or 1, it is somewhere between. Try to calculate the odds by breaking down the statement.</p><ol><li>What are the chances that the Lakers will make the playoffs? Don't ignore the other teams; even 'bad' ones can surprise you.</li><li>What are the chances that they will make the finals? What other teams have a good chance?</li><li>What are the chances that the Lakers win it all?</li><li>What are the chances that LeBron James will be chosen? It could go to another teammate or a player on the losing team. (Rare, but it's happened before)</li></ol><p>If you're interested in how to come up with these parts and how to combine them, I recommend reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3jIbNQj">Superforecasting</a>. It's a great book to start with.</p><p>At the end of this step, the statement should read: <em>I'm 90% sure that LeBron will <s>definitely</s> be the NBA finals MVP next year.</em></p><h3 id="should-you-bet">Should You Bet?</h3><p>Be careful when asking people to bet; it can backfire. Usually, I win stalemates with my girlfriend by asking her to bet on her position. She'd agree, then I'd raise the stake till she backed off. But she caught on quickly. She realized that I was raising the stakes because I wasn't as certain with my odds. She figured out that I was taking advantage of her risk averseness. After that, she flipped the game on me and took whatever amount I presented. She'd smile with her hands drawn to lock in the bet with a handshake no matter how high the stake. I ask her to bet less frequently now after losing a few rounds.</p><p>Money is a weird topic for a lot of people. Personally, I view money differently and believe it should be a casual topic. You probably do too if you're reading this. But most people won't be pleased if you continually ask them to bet. Alternatively, you can shake on it for a chance to be right in the future. Depending on how you view the other participant, this feeling (or vindication) can be more rewarding.</p><p>You can also do this exercise with yourself. No one else has to be included. You can bet yourself how much you'd throw into your retirement account if things don't go your way. The whole point of this is to change your thinking, not to continually ask people (yourself included) 'Wanna Bet?' It's to get you to start questioning your beliefs. Start to consider what the other party knows that you don't. Start wondering why you may be wrong instead of searching for evidence that only supports your position.</p><h2 id="delve-deeper">Delve Deeper</h2><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3jCpX5E"><em>Thinking in Bets</em></a> - Annie Duke<br><a href="https://amzn.to/3jIbNQj">Superforecasting</a> - Philip Tetlock &amp; &nbsp;Dan Gardner<br><a href="https://fs.blog/">Farnam Street Blog &amp; Podcast</a></p><figure><a href="https://tolusnotes.com/how-to-bet-2/"><div><p>Illusion Of Understanding — Know What You Don’t Know (How to Bet #2)</p><p>How to avoid one of the biggest pitfalls in decision making — the illusion of understanding.</p><p><img src="https://tolusnotes.com/favicon.ico"><span>Tolu's Notes</span></p></div><p><img src="https://tolusnotes.com/content/images/2020/11/Blog-Post-1-.png"></p></a></figure><hr><p>

                  <p><b>This is a web site (under construction) for young students - and anyone else - who are (like me) thrilled by the challenges posed by real science, 
                     and who are - like me - determined to use their brains to discover new things about the physical world that we are living in. In short, it is for all 
                     those who decided to study theoretical physics, in their own time.</b></p>

                  <p>It so often happens that I receive mail - well-intended but totally useless - by amateur physicists who believe to have solved the world. They believe this, 
                     only because they understand totally nothing about the real way problems are solved in Modern Physics. If you really want to contribute to our theoretical 
                     understanding of physical laws - and it is an exciting experience if you succeed! - there are many things you need to know. First of all, be serious about 
                     it. All necessary science courses are taught at Universities, so, naturally, the first thing you should do is have yourself admitted at a University and 
                     absorb everything you can. But what if you are still young, at School, and before being admitted at a University, you have to endure the childish anecdotes 
                     that they call science there? What if you are older, and you are not at all looking forward to join those noisy crowds of young students?</p>

                 <p>It should be possible, these days, to collect all knowledge you need from the internet. Problem then is, there is so much junk on the internet. Is it possible 
                    to weed out those very rare pages that may really be of use? I know exactly what should be taught to the beginning student. The names and topics of the absolutely 
                    necessary lecture courses are easy to list, and this is what I have done below. It is my intention to search on the web where the really useful papers and books 
                    are, preferably downloadable as well. This way, the costs of becoming a theoretical physicist should not exceed much the price of a computer with internet connection, 
                    a printer, and lots of paper and pens. Unfortunately, I still have to recommend to buy text books as well, but it is harder to advise you here; perhaps in a future 
                    site. Let’s first limit ourselves to the absolute minimum. The subjects listed below must be studied. Any omission will be punished: failure. Do get me right: you 
                    don’t have to believe anything you read on faith - check it. Try alternative approaches, as many as you can. You will discover, time and again, that really what 
                    those guys did indeed was the smartest thing possible. Amazing. the best of the texts come with exercises. Do them. find out that you can understand everything. 
                    Try to reach the stage that you discover the numerous misprints, tiny mistakes as well as more important errors, and imagine how you would write those texts in a 
                    smarter way.</p>

                <p>I can tell you of my own experiences. I had the extreme luck of having excellent teachers around me. That helps one from running astray. It helped me all the way 
                   to earn a Nobel Prize. But I didn’t have internet. I am going to try to be your teacher. It is a formidable task. I am asking students, colleagues, teachers to 
                   help me improve this site. It is presently set up only for those who wish to become theoretical physicists, not just ordinary ones, but the very best, those who are 
                   fully determined to earn their own Nobel Prize. If you are more modest than that, well, finish those lousy schools first and follow the regular routes provided by 
                   educators and specialized -gogues who are so damn carefully chewing all those tiny portions before feeding them to you. This is a site for ambitious people. I am 
                   sure that anyone can do this, if one is gifted with a certain amount of intelligence, interest and determination. Now, here begins the serious stuff. Don’t complain that 
                   it looks like being a lot. You won’t get your Nobel Prize for free, and remember, all of this together takes our students at least 5 years of intense study (at least 
                   one reader was surprised at this statement, saying that (s)he would never master this in 5 years; indeed, I am addressing people who plan to spend most of their time 
                   to this study). More than rudimentary intelligence is assumed to be present, because ordinary students can master this material only when assisted by patient teachers. 
                   It is necessary to do exercises. Some of the texts come with exercises. Do them, or better, invent your own exercises. Try to outsmart the authors, but please refrain 
                   from mailing to me your alternative theories until you have studied the entire lot; if you do this well you will discover that many of these authors were not so stupid 
                   after all.</p>

               <p>Theoretical Physics is like a sky scraper. It has solid foundations in elementary mathematics and notions of classical (pre-20th century) physics. Don’t think that 
                  pre-20th century physics is “irrelevant” since now we have so much more. In those days, the solid foundations were laid of the knowledge that we enjoy now. Don’t 
                  try to construct your sky scraper without first reconstructing these foundations yourself. The first few floors of our skyscraper consist of advanced mathematical 
                  formalisms that turn the Classical Physics theories into beauties of their own. They are needed if you want to go higher than that. So, next come many of the other 
                  subjects listed below. Finally, if you are mad enough that you want to solve those tremendously perplexing problems of reconciling gravitational physics with the 
                  quantum world, you end up studying general relativity, superstring theory, M-theory, Calabi-Yau compactification and so on. That’s presently the top of the sky 
                  scraper. There are other peaks such as Bose-Einstein condensation, fractional Hall effect, and more. Also good for Nobel Prizes, as the past years have shown. A 
                  warning is called for: even if you are extremely smart, you are still likely to get stuck somewhere. Surf the net yourself. Find more. Tell me about what you found. 
                  If this site has been of any help to someone while preparing for a University study, if this has motivated someone, helped someone along the way, and smoothened his 
                  or her path towards science, then I call this site successful. Please let me know. Here is the list.</p>

              <p>Note that this site NOT meant to be very pedagogical. I avoid texts with lots of colorful but distracting pictures from authors who try hard to be funny. Also, the 
                 subjects included are somewhat focused towards my own interests.</p>

<p>LIST OF SUBJECTS, IN LOGICAL ORDER ARE ON THE SIDE.
(Not everything has to be done in this order, but this approximately indicates the logical coherence of the various subjects. Some notes are at a higher level than others).</p>

November 7, 2020 | https://blog.min.io/the-long-term-costs-of-storage-in-the-cloud/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.min.io/the-long-term-costs-of-storage-in-the-cloud/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>The promise/allure of the public cloud is based on the concept that it is elastic. One can, with little effort, scale up workloads and, if desired, scale down those same workloads. We have <a href="https://blog.min.io/repatriation_wave/">written on this subject before</a> - from the perspective of what workloads to consider as you evaluate what to take to the public cloud and what to repatriate to the private cloud. <br></p><p>We have not, however, taken a hard look at the costs associated with the two options. Our position can be related as an analogy. The public cloud is like a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities, secure, spacious etc. It is priced like a nice hotel too. As a result, people don’t live in nice hotels - they stay there for a period of time to achieve a certain objective (business trip, vacation) because it gets too expensive otherwise. <br></p><div><p>We wanted to quantify this objectively so we rolled up our sleeves, made some reasonable assumptions and wrote this post. Here we go:</p><p>If we assume that we will be using object storage in the cloud and want to understand the costs of deploying a PB of data (200TB active, 800TB inactive, with a Read:Write ratio of 80:20) we can compute what this storage would cost on various public clouds.</p></div><p>AWS S3 storage tiers costs are as follows (See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/</a>). This should not be a surprise as prices have not changed in the last four years (but costs have :).<br></p><ul><li><strong>S3 Standard</strong> storage the first 50TB costs $0.023 per month per GB, the next 450TB costs $0.22 per month per GB, and all storage over 500TB costs $0.021 per month per GB. So 1PB of S3 Standard storage would cost $1.2K/month for the 1st 50TB, $9.9K/month for the next 450 TB and $10.3K/month for the next 500TB or <strong>$21.6K/month for 1PB of data</strong>.</li><li><strong>S3 Intelligent Tiering </strong>storage costs the same as S3 Standard for frequently active data and $0.0125 for infrequently accessed data plus an $0.0025 per 1000 Objects fee for management. So assuming 200TB:800TB active:inactive the active data would cost $1.2K/month for 50TB and $3.3K/month for the 150TB and $10.0K for the inactive 800TB. To that, we must add object management costs. It’s not unusual to see PB data warehouse with billions of objects/files. So if we assume 1B objects (average ~1MB/object) in our PB of data object management costs would be $2.5K per month. Totaling all that together we have an overall <strong>storage and object management costs of</strong> ~<strong>$17.0K per month for our 1PB of data</strong>. <br></li></ul><p>It is true one could do a blend of standard S3 plus S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive, but that doesn’t really get to the apples to apples comparison we are seeking. So for the purposes of this we will consider the first two. <br></p><p>Although Azure and GCP don’t have exactly equivalent tiers of storage, if we just focus on S3 Standard equivalents then Azure Blob and GCP cloud storage costs are:</p><ul><li>Azure (Hot) Blob storage <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/">costs</a> a flat $0.0184 per GB per month or $18.4K per 1PB per month, or about 85% of AWS S3 standard costs.</li><li>GCP us-central cloud storage costs are $0.020 per GB per month or $20K for 1PB per month or about 93% of what AWS S3 standard costs. <br></li></ul><p>There are some additional costs that are associated with per 1,000 S3 operations. But we estimate in the scheme of things they don’t add more than $300/month to the above costs. As such we will ignore these costs here.</p><h3 id="what-if-we-wanted-to-copy-the-data-out-of-the-cloud">What if we wanted to copy the data out of the cloud?</h3><p>Of course none of the above cloud storage costs takes into consideration any egress charges which for AWS and GCP are $0.09 to $0.05/GB per month and $0.12/GB, respectively. So if you wanted to move the active 200TB of your 1PB of data out of the (AWS or GCP) cloud each month you would need to add it would cost you another ~$14K/month (on average) with AWS S3 and $24K/month with GCP. <br></p><p>For Azure they don’t appear to have a standard egress charge but rather charge per operation and bandwidth used. We would guess (although we haven’t verified this) that the costs would be comparable to AWS S3 standard egress charges. <br></p><p>Of course there would be no direct charge to move the 1PB of data center data around. You would incur bandwidth costs depending on where you moved it. But the server costs are already accounted for in the costs above. <br></p><h3 id="the-private-cloud-onprem-equivalents-software">The Private Cloud/OnPrem Equivalents: Software</h3><p>First off, you need equivalent software. MinIO offers that (and more) with its S3 compatible, feature rich object storage suite. It is literally a private cloud, drop-in equivalent for AWS. While MinIO is open source, it does offer two tiers for the MinIO Subscription Network. SUBNET, as we call it, combines a commercial license with 24/7/365 direct-to-engineer support, security and resilience audits and other diagnostic technologies that effectively insure production deployments of our software. <br></p><p>The Standard tier is priced at .01 per GB per month and the Enterprise tier is priced at .02 per GB per month.<br></p><p>For our PB of data, that equates to 10K and 20K per month respectively. Needless to say, there is the open source option as well, which would be appropriate if your data was not mission critical. That cost is zero.</p><p>There are no egress costs. There are no per object management costs. <br></p><p>For the purposes of this exercise let’s choose the middle - the Standard plan at <strong>$10K per month for software costs.</strong></p><h3 id="the-private-cloud-onprem-equivalents-hardware">The Private Cloud/OnPrem Equivalents: Hardware</h3><p>While MinIO can run on a range of hardware from Raspberry Pis to IBM Power, we wanted to target dense JBODs for the purposes of our analysis. <br></p><p>It just so happens that through our partnership with Seagate, we have publishable pricing for a 1TB configuration of the Exos AP 2U12 (Dual AP) with two Intel Silver Xeon CPUs. It has</p><p>60 drives at 16 TB per drive delivering .96 PB raw capacity and .72 actual capacity. This assumes erasure coding factor of .75. The price for that hardware is a very reasonable $70K. Let’s choose a three year amortization schedule on that hardware to determine a monthly per GB cost. At 36 months our monthly cost for the hardware works out<strong> to $1,510 per month or $0.0015 GB/month</strong>. <br></p><p>Interested in more? Jump over to the <a href="https://min.io/product/reference-hardware#pricing-calculator">Reference Hardware page to play with the calculator</a> to see other capacities. <br></p><h3 id="don-t-forget-the-data-center-costs">Don’t Forget the Data Center Costs</h3><p>For a data center deployment, we would need to add administration, rack, space, power and cooling costs. We could go into great detail here to determine each of these costs but in general according to the US Chamber of Commerce <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/ctec_datacenterrpt_lowres.pdf">data center space</a> can be had for about $1305/NRSF (net rentable square feet) in CapEx and another $112/NRSF ( ~8.6% of CapEx) in OpEx or a total of ~$1.4K/NRSF annual cost or an extra $116 per month. <br></p><h3 id="totaling-up-the-private-cloud">Totaling Up the Private Cloud</h3><p>The cost to run your own, 1 PB private cloud, with state of the art hardware, 24/7 direct-to-engineer support, panic button access and annual performance reviews is <strong>$11,510 per month</strong>. Let’s circle back and compare that to what we calculated above.</p><h3 id="summarizing-the-one-year-costs">Summarizing the One Year Costs</h3><p>At $11,510 MinIO and Seagate represent the best economics - by a considerable amount. The combination is 47% less expensive per month than standard S3 and 33% less than S3 with Intelligent Tiering. <br></p><p>These calculations ignore AWS egress costs - which would make MinIO and Seagate less than half as expensive as Standard S3. <br></p><p>MinIO and Seagate are also 38% less than Azure’s comparable option and 43% less than Google Cloud Platform’s comparable offering. <br></p><p>The breakeven point for building your own private cloud vs. S3 Standard comes in at seven months. Thought of another way - for the price of 1PB on S3 Standard you could have almost 1.5 PBs of MinIO and Seagate.</p><p><br>The overall point is not to compete on price. </p><p>We think it is a <a href="https://blog.min.io/the-new-metrics-of-object-storage/">poor metric</a> when thinking about object storage. What we seek to detail here, is that, over time, you will get better performance, superior security, more control and additional flexibility by going on prem - without sacrificing anything on cost (indeed you gain economic advantage). That is why many innovative enterprises are engaged in large scale repatriation strategies, because they realize the cloud is here to stay and they have a choice about what cloud that is - and they are picking the private cloud.</p><p>Feel free to disagree with us.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2>Abstract</h2><p>Programming design patterns are patterns that come up in a variety of
different situations while programming. In this article I discuss the
Newtype design pattern. Specifically, I discuss it in the context of
the Rust programming language, and how to solve some of the problems
that arise when using the Newtype pattern in Rust.</p></div></section><h2>Design Patterns in Rust</h2><section><p>Programming design patterns are patterns that come up in a variety of
different situations while programming. That isn't to say that design
patterns mean you don't need to think about the problem yourself, but
design patterns give you a toolbox of ideas to help you think about
solutions.</p><p>Different programming languages have different ways of expressing
things. The classic book on design patterns, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns: Elements
of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>, wrote patterns around object
oriented C++ and Smalltalk. While most of these patterns are still
applicable to other object oriented programming languages, they might
need a tweak here and there to make them work well.</p><p>Rust is an interesting programming language in that the design of the
language takes ideas from object oriented, procedural, and <a href="https://www.worthe-it.co.za/blog/2018-02-11-why-functional-programmers-should-care-about-rust.html">functional</a>
programming languages. This means that there are different patterns
that are useful, and the existing patterns may be better expressed in
a new way.</p><p>In this article, I'm going to explain a pattern that I've been finding
useful in my Rust code: The Newtype Pattern.</p></section><h2>The Problem: Primitive Types Aren't Descriptive</h2><section><p>Imagine that you're working on a large codebase. Like many projects,
your project includes some user information, so you have a struct that
looks like this:</p><div><pre><span>pub struct </span><span>Person {
    </span><span>pub </span><span>name: String,
    </span><span>pub </span><span>phone_number: String,
    </span><span>pub </span><span>id_number: String,
    </span><span>pub </span><span>age: </span><span>u32
</span><span>}
</span></pre></div><p>A few months down the line, you're looking at some code on the other
side of the codebase. You want to get a person out of your
database. This is the function signature:</p><div><pre><span>pub fn </span><span>load_person</span><span>(person: String) -&gt; Result&lt;Person&gt;;
</span></pre></div><p>Oh dear. What is that parameter supposed to be? Is it the person's ID
number? Their name maybe?</p><p>Then there's the uncertainty on what exactly <code>age</code> means. How would
you, for example, implement this function?</p><div><pre><span>pub fn </span><span>time_to_retirement</span><span>(current_age: </span><span>u32</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>u32</span><span>;
</span></pre></div><p>Is it age in years? It's common to store timestamps in as a number of
seconds, so maybe it's age in seconds?</p></section><h2>The Newtype Pattern</h2><section><p>The Newtype patterns is when you take an existing type, usually a
primitive like a number or a string, and wrap it in a struct. This
lets us add more information about the data to the type system to
potentially catch errors, and make our code more expressive.</p><p>Let's see how we would apply it to our person example.</p><p>You'd first define your Newtypes. The pattern is just a value, wrapped
in a <code>struct</code>.</p><div><pre><span>pub struct </span><span>Name(String);
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>PhoneNumber(String);
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>IdNumber(String);
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>Years(</span><span>u32</span><span>);
</span></pre></div><blockquote><p>If you haven't encountered a <code>struct</code> like this where we don't name
the fields, it's called a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types">tuple struct</a>. The Newtype is a special case
of tuple struct, where we only have one field.</p></blockquote><p>Then you can start using your new types in your <code>Person</code> struct.</p><div><pre><span>pub struct </span><span>Person {
    </span><span>pub </span><span>name: Name,
    </span><span>pub </span><span>phone_number: PhoneNumber,
    </span><span>pub </span><span>id_number: IdNumber,
    </span><span>pub </span><span>age: Years
}
</span></pre></div><p>As a benefit, our <code>load_person</code> function is much clearer. If the type
is <code>IdNumber</code>, rather than <code>String</code>, you know to use the person's ID
number.</p><div><pre><span>pub fn </span><span>load_person</span><span>(person: IdNumber) -&gt; Result&lt;Person&gt;;
</span></pre></div><p>Our age is also much clearer now too. The <code>Years</code> type makes it
obvious that our age is in years, not seconds.</p><div><pre><span>pub fn </span><span>time_to_retirement</span><span>(current_age: Years) -&gt; Years;
</span></pre></div><p>Strings are a common use case for Newtypes, since you can use them to
add validation around formatting of the string. For example, in South
Africa, <a href="https://www.worthe-it.co.za/blog/2017-02-12-validating-a-south-african-id-number-in-javascript.html">ID Numbers have a set format that you can validate against</a>.</p></section><h2>Problem 1: How Do I Construct The Newtype?</h2><section><p>You may have noticed in the examples above that the Newtype itself is
public, but the internal data is private. In its current form, this
code won't work:</p><div><pre><span>// Usually other modules would actually be in a different file, but
// this isn't a normal project, it's a blog article! After this example
// we won't explicitly be putting our Newtypes in a different module
// to simplify the examples.
</span><span>mod </span><span>some_module {
    </span><span>pub struct </span><span>PhoneNumber(String);
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// You would be able to access the private inner string directly
    // like this if this code was in the same module as the newtype,
    // but for the rest of the codebase this will fail.
    </span><span>let</span><span> num </span><span>= </span><span>some_module::PhoneNumber(</span><span>"555-12345"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>());
    println!(</span><span>"</span><span>{}</span><span>"</span><span>, num.</span><span>0</span><span>)
}
</span></pre></div><pre><span>error[E0603]: tuple struct constructor `PhoneNumber` is private
 --&gt; rust-src-b5wQbx.rs:9:28
  |
2 |     pub struct PhoneNumber(String);
  |                            ------ a constructor is private if any of the fields is private
...
9 |     let num = some_module::PhoneNumber("555-12345".to_string());
  |                            ^^^^^^^^^^^ private tuple struct constructor
  |
note: the tuple struct constructor `PhoneNumber` is defined here
 --&gt; rust-src-b5wQbx.rs:2:5
  |
2 |     pub struct PhoneNumber(String);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

error[E0616]: field `0` of struct `some_module::PhoneNumber` is private
  --&gt; rust-src-b5wQbx.rs:10:24
   |
10 |     println!("{}", num.0)
   |                        ^ private field
</span></pre><p>How exactly you handle this will depend on your type. Generally
speaking, you can give your type some functions, like a constructor
function and some function to get the data out. This would work:</p><div><pre><span>pub struct </span><span>PhoneNumber(String);
</span><span>impl </span><span>PhoneNumber {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>new</span><span>(s: String) -&gt; PhoneNumber {
        PhoneNumber(s)
    }
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>as_str</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;str </span><span>{
        </span><span>// We didn't name the inner type, so it follows the same
        // naming convention as tuples. In other words, the inner
        // field is called `0`.
        </span><span>&amp;</span><span>self.</span><span>0
    </span><span>}
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> num </span><span>= </span><span>PhoneNumber::new(</span><span>"555-1234"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>());
    println!(</span><span>"</span><span>{}</span><span>"</span><span>, num.</span><span>as_str</span><span>())
}
</span></pre></div><p>You can add as many other functions as you want here. It's a great
place to put any domain logic you might have around your data. For
example, phone numbers might have different standard formattings that
different contexts require, or you might be able to use the start of
the phone number to figure out the country it refers to.</p></section><h2>Some Useful Standard Library Traits</h2><section><p>The two example functions I used above, constructing your type from a
string and formatting the data as a string, seem like they would come
up when looking at many different types. In fact, the Rust standard
library has a number of traits that it makes sense to implement for
your Newtype. Implementing the standard library traits rather than
just your own functions will make it easier to use your Newtype
together with the standard library, and many other Rust
libraries. Let's take a look at some of them.</p></section><h3>FromStr and Display</h3><section><p>If, like in our phone number example, we're specifically interesting
in working with strings, then there are two traits from the standard
library that we should implement: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/str/trait.FromStr.html">FromStr</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fmt/trait.Display.html">Display</a>.</p><div><pre><span>pub struct </span><span>PhoneNumber(String);

</span><span>use </span><span>std::str::FromStr;
</span><span>impl </span><span>FromStr </span><span>for </span><span>PhoneNumber {
    </span><span>type </span><span>Err </span><span>= </span><span>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;;

    </span><span>fn </span><span>from_str</span><span>(s: </span><span>&amp;str</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>, </span><span>Self::</span><span>Err&gt; {
        </span><span>Ok</span><span>(PhoneNumber(s.</span><span>to_string</span><span>()))
    }
}

</span><span>use </span><span>std::fmt;
</span><span>impl </span><span>fmt::Display </span><span>for </span><span>PhoneNumber {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>fmt</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self, f: </span><span>&amp;mut </span><span>fmt::Formatter&lt;'</span><span>_</span><span>&gt;) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        write!(f, </span><span>"</span><span>{}</span><span>"</span><span>, self.</span><span>0</span><span>)
    }
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    </span><span>// parse() uses FromStr
    </span><span>let</span><span> num: PhoneNumber </span><span>= </span><span>"555-1234"</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;

    </span><span>// you can also call from_str directly
    </span><span>let</span><span> num </span><span>= </span><span>PhoneNumber::from_str(</span><span>"555-1234"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;

    </span><span>// Display gives you a to_string function
    </span><span>let</span><span> num_as_string </span><span>=</span><span> num.</span><span>to_string</span><span>();

    </span><span>// Display can also be called directly by println! or format!
    </span><span>println!(</span><span>"Phone number is </span><span>{}</span><span>"</span><span>, num);
    </span><span>Ok</span><span>(())
}
</span></pre></div></section><h3>Deref</h3><section><p>If you're wrapping a string, implementing <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html">Deref</a> can also be useful. It
will let you pass your string-wrapping Newtype into functions that
require a <code>&amp;str</code>.</p><p>More generally, <code>Deref</code> is useful if you want to tell the compiler
that, if it needs to, it can take an immutable reference to the data
you're wrapping.</p><div><pre><span>pub struct </span><span>PhoneNumber(String);

</span><span>use </span><span>std::str::FromStr;
</span><span>impl </span><span>FromStr </span><span>for </span><span>PhoneNumber {
    </span><span>type </span><span>Err </span><span>= </span><span>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;;

    </span><span>fn </span><span>from_str</span><span>(s: </span><span>&amp;str</span><span>) -&gt; Result&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>, </span><span>Self::</span><span>Err&gt; {
        </span><span>Ok</span><span>(PhoneNumber(s.</span><span>to_string</span><span>()))
    }
}

</span><span>use </span><span>std::ops::Deref;
</span><span>impl </span><span>Deref </span><span>for </span><span>PhoneNumber {
    </span><span>type </span><span>Target </span><span>= str</span><span>;

    </span><span>fn </span><span>deref</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;Self::</span><span>Target {
        </span><span>&amp;</span><span>self.</span><span>0
    </span><span>}
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> num </span><span>= </span><span>PhoneNumber::from_str(</span><span>"555-1234"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;

    </span><span>// Deref can be called when we take a reference. The function
    // takes a &amp;str and our type can Deref from &amp;PhoneNumber to &amp;str.
    </span><span>print_strings</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>num);
    </span><span>Ok</span><span>(())
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>print_strings</span><span>(s: </span><span>&amp;str</span><span>) {
    println!(</span><span>"I've been asked to print </span><span>{}</span><span>"</span><span>, s);
}
</span></pre></div><p><code>Deref</code> is called behind the scenes by the compiler and having an
implementation of <code>Deref</code> may affect which functions the compiler
calls when you're using your type. It's meant for when you're
implementing smart pointers. If you want functionality similar to
<code>Deref</code>, but don't want to let the compiler call it implicitly, a good
alternative is to add your own function with a name of your choice,
like <code>as_str</code>.</p><div><pre><span>pub struct </span><span>PhoneNumber(String);

</span><span>use </span><span>std::str::FromStr;
</span><span>impl </span><span>FromStr </span><span>for </span><span>PhoneNumber {
    </span><span>type </span><span>Err </span><span>= </span><span>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;;

<p>Modern marketing is all about data and however hard you might try, you can't spend any time around marketers online without <a href="https://blog.marketo.com/2013/11/prove-your-worth10-kpis-for-marketers.html">being</a> <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/paid-owned-earned-content/242075/">subjected</a> <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/oracledatacloud/effectively-measuring-advertising-performance-your-guide-to-success">to</a> <a href="https://searchengineland.com/using-auction-insights-for-better-ppc-competitor-analysis-343264">endless</a> <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2020/07/28/10-reasons-why-marketers-use-data-to-make-budgeting-decisions/">think</a> <a href="https://www.oberlo.co.uk/blog/spent-200000-facebook-ads-heres-learned">pieces</a>, how-to guides, ebooks or other dreck about how we need to track and measure and count every little thing.</p>
<p>We've got click rates, impressions, conversion rates, open rates, ROAS, pageviews, bounces rates, ROI, CPM, CPC, impression share, average position, sessions, channels, landing pages, KPI after never ending KPI.</p>
<p>That'd be fine if all this shit meant something and we knew how to interpret it. But <em>it doesn't</em> and <strong>we don't</strong>. </p>
<p>The reality is much simpler, and therefore much more complex.  Most of us don't understand how data is collected, how these mechanisms work and most importantly where and how they <em>don't</em> work.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/874736/ad-blocker-usage-in-united-kingdom/">36% percent of people in the UK</a> use an adblocker, which means your javascript based website tracking is meaningless</li>
<li>Email open rates <a href="https://developermedia.com/email-open-rates-misleading-metrics-best-practices-2/">don't <em>actually</em> indicate that an email was opened</a>, merely that a request was made to a server</li>
<li>The black boxes inside Facebook and other ad exchanges give you <a href="https://www.etcentric.org/facebook-agrees-to-40-million-fine-for-incorrect-ad-metrics/">flat out wrong</a> data about how your ads are performing</li>
<li>The audiences you're targeting on Google, Bing, etc <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/11/02/got-large-budgets-you-need-to-spend-fraudsters-will-help-you-spend-it/?sh=54b93f867a9f">are fraudulent</a> and don't even exist</li>
<li>The exchanges you're purchasing media space from are <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/is-ubers-new-ad-fraud-lawsuit-futile-or-game-changing/">cheating you</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And even if we know how the data is collected, what it means and what it's actually tracking, most of us don't have the technical chops to analyse the data we've collected<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I don't mean to rag on anyone by saying this, but we do need a reality check.</p>
<p>And look. I get it. Having tangible data allows us to demonstrate that we're doing our job and we're trying to measure and improve what we're doing. But as Bob Hoffman rightly points out - <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-mystery-of-modern-media.html">that's not how brands are built</a>. </p>
<p>The numbers are often all we have to prove our case, to get more budget and in extreme cases, to continue to stay employed. We'll remain in this mess until we can separate marketing from short sighted and poorly informed decision making. Until leaders can lead on the strength of their conviction and experience instead of second guessing themselves and their staff based on the inadequacy of data.</p>
<p>I don't know what the way out of this mess is, or what the path to success looks like. All I know is this.</p>
<p><em>We're addicted to bad data</em>.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

November 7, 2020 | https://panelbear.com/blog/why-panelbear/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://panelbear.com/blog/why-panelbear/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Panelbear grew out of a side-project of mine as I didn't feel at home in any of the existing analytics solutions. I wanted the power and flexibility of a complete toolkit, without complicated dashboards or invading the privacy of my visitors.</p><p>They say “data is the new gold”, and data is what fuels any analytics tool out there. My aim is to build a complete toolkit that puts your website’s data to work for you and not for the mega corporations. Panelbear aims to become the hub for your analytics, giving you automated insights and the features growing businesses need, while remaining private by design.</p><h2>Privacy by design</h2><p>I found it unnecessarily time consuming to keep up with the nightmare of cookie banners, legal notices, and keeping records of consent, when all I really wanted was to understand how my website is being used. Tools like Google Analytics are powerful but you’re giving up the personal data of your visitors and one your most valuable assets: your website’s data.</p><p>My tools should respect the privacy of my visitors by design, and it shouldn't depend on me checking the right boxes in some obscure UI or following lengthy manuals. Unfortunately, keeping up with privacy regulations is almost a full time job, and for small business owners this creates a huge disadvantage.</p><p>The principles of privacy are fantastic, but we won’t enjoy the widespread benefits unless they’re simple enough to follow and do not “dumb down” the tools that bring a lot of value to our businesses.</p><h2>Use your time for something meaningful</h2><p>Joe Armstrong once said: "You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle". As a small business owner, this is exactly how it feels like to keep up with the ever-changing privacy regulations.</p><p>You see, if you own a website, you probably need to have visibility into what’s going on to be able to improve it over time. Things like:</p><ul><li>How many visitors come each day?</li><li>Which pages are trending?</li><li>What are the top countries?</li><li>How fast is my site loading in each country?</li></ul><p>At this point, you are probably thinking of using something like Google Analytics, but then you have to worry about ensuring your setup is fully compliant with privacy regulations like GDPR, or things like the transfer of personal data between EU-US. Fines are pretty big even for small websites, not to mention that many of these tools invade the privacy of your visitors, and may even sell your data to third-parties. Have you heard of the phrase: "if you're not paying for the product, you are the product"?</p><p>Soon you find yourself in a nightmare of using various third-parties for things like cookie banners, keeping records of consent and a complicated setup when all you really wanted was to understand how your website is being used, not to track the personal data of your visitors and fuel the already huge corporations that possess them.</p><p>So after trying out most privacy-friendly solutions out there, I never felt at home with them. They were doing either too little, or too much for my needs. Having worked for several years building large-scale infrastructure for one of Europe’s largest search platforms, I decided to take the challenge and started building Panelbear on the weekends next to my full-time job.</p><h2>Getting better all the time</h2><p>There’s plenty of other analytics services out there, and while Panelbear offers similar features, the aim is to become a more complete toolset for your website, one new feature at a time.</p><p>Many of the alternatives focus on being simplified versions of Google Analytics, and I respect them, you as a customer have more options now than ever. But there’s more features that I’d like to have as part of my toolset, and I would prefer to not require five different services to get each feature (such as performance metrics). For example, here are some ideas I've been bouncing around with early customers:</p><ul><li>Automated insights (for example "Your signup page has a higher bounce rate than normal this week" or "Visitors coming from Twitter spend 50% more time on your website.").</li><li>Performance metrics (such as time to first paint and Apdex scores).</li><li>Privacy-friendly link shortening with statistics.</li></ul><p>If you own a Panelbear account, you probably noticed that every single week there’s a new feature or improvement that makes your life easier as a website owner. It’s getting better all the time, and we’re just getting started.</p><h2>How can it be free and private?</h2><p>Panelbear offers a very generous free plan which includes 10,000 pageviews per month for unlimited websites. For my full-time job I work together with teams that build large scale multi-regional infrastructure, and this helped me understand and optimize the technical and operational aspects of Panelbear to the point that sustaining a free plan became possible.</p><p>What’s in it for Panelbear? My strategy is a simple one: if I deliver a ton of value in a simple package, it would help me get the word out, and eventually this may translate into customers with larger websites getting to know my product and subscribing to a paid plan that supports the business. It’s really that simple, and there’s no ulterior motive.</p><h2>What’s in it for you?</h2><p>It’s super encouraging that many of Panelbear's customers have reached out on Twitter or via email to share their support. Some of the things they appreciate are:</p><ul><li>Super simple setup</li><li>No cookie notice needed</li><li>Really fast dashboards</li><li>Site speed metrics</li><li>Simple pricing, flexible upgrades</li><li>Friendly support - at least that’s what I’m told :)</li></ul><p>Regarding pricing based on usage: there are no hidden fees or charges for traffic spikes if your site suddenly becomes popular. Panelbear is a small business too, so I understand that you need flexibility as well. You simply book the volume you predict you will need and we can adjust it as you go.</p><p>I feel incredibly lucky, just launched the early-access program last September with a few posts here and there, and Panelbear is already handling millions of page views per month for various websites. It’s been a crazy ride so far!</p><p>I'm happy to answer your questions, feel free to say hi via email at <a href="https://panelbear.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1879766c70777661586879767d747a7d796a367b7775"><span data-cfemail="a0c1ced4c8cfced9e0d0c1cec5ccc2c5c1d28ec3cfcd">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> or you can DM me on twitter if you prefer: <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonynsimon">@anthonynsimon</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This article is going to be an introduction to <strong>embedded Linux security</strong>.</p>
<p>Since this topic is quite extensive, I divided into two parts. In this first part, we will have a small introduction to security concepts and threat modeling and then focus on some mitigation techniques to improve the security of an embedded Linux device, including secure boot, code/data encryption and secure key storage.</p>
<p>If you prefer a one hour talk instead of reading this article, you can also watch the webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUKAgVKSxQ">“Introduction to embedded Linux security”</a> I recorded for <a href="https://www.toradex.com/">Toradex</a>. I also gave the same talk at Embedded Linux Conference North America 2020, but as I write this article it was not yet published on YouTube.</p>
<p>Let’s first start with some concepts…</p>
<h2 id="security-concepts">Security concepts</h2>
<p>Security is all about risk mitigation.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we have <strong>owners</strong>, those who benefit from a product or service (user, manufacturer, business owner, etc). And owners want to protect <strong>assets</strong>, anything that has some value in the product or service (data, code, reputation, etc).</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have <strong>threat actors</strong>, a person or thing (malicious hacker, government, etc) that can manifest a <strong>threat</strong>, anything that is capable of acting against an asset in a manner that can result in harm.</p>
<p>To manifest a threat, the threat actor will explore <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> (weakness in the system) via an <strong>attack vector</strong>, a method or pathway used by the threat actor to access or penetrate the target system.</p>
<p>The diagram below express very well all those concepts:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/hardware-threat-landscape/at_download/fullReport"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-security-concepts.png" alt="Security Concepts"></a></p>
<p>In the end, is a cat-and-mouse game between owners and threat actors. How far will the owner go to protect the assets? How far will the threat actor go to compromise the assets? It really depends on the value of the assets. Indeed, the perception of value may not be the same for owners and threat actors.</p>
<p>Identifying assets (and their value) to mitigate the risks of being compromised can be done in a process called <strong>threat modeling</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="threat-modeling">Threat modeling</h2>
<p>Threat modeling is a process where potential threats can be identified, enumerated, and mitigations can be prioritized. It is basically a risk assessment process where you evaluate the value of your assets and the cost to protect them. The result of a threat modeling is the <strong>threat model</strong> of your product.</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-threat-modeling.png" alt="Threat modeling"></p>
<p>There are several techniques and methodologies that can help during threat modeling, including STRIDE, DREAD, VAST, OCTAVE, and many others.</p>
<p>To have a very basic introduction to the topic, let’s talk about STRIDE and DREAD.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)">STRIDE model</a> is a very useful tool to help classify threats. It was developed by Microsoft and the name is an acronym for the six main types of threats: <strong>S</strong>poofing, <strong>T</strong>ampering, <strong>R</strong>epudiation, <strong>I</strong>nformation disclosure, <strong>D</strong>enial of service and <strong>E</strong>scalation of privileges. STRIDE can be used to identify all threats the assets of a system could be exposed to.</p>
<p><a href="https://allabouttesting.org/stride-acronym-of-threat-modeling-system/"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-stride.png" alt="STRIDE"></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD_(risk_assessment_model)">DREAD methodology</a> is a tool for risk-assessing computer security threats. The name is an acronym for five categories of security threats: <strong>D</strong>amage (how bad would an attack be), <strong>R</strong>eproducibility (how easy is it to reproduce the attack), <strong>E</strong>xploitability (how much work is it to launch the attack), <strong>A</strong>ffected users (how many people would be impacted) and <strong>D</strong>iscoverability (how easy is it to discover the threat).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SecurityInnovation/threat-modeling-to-reduce-software-security-risk"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-dread.png" alt="DREAD"></a></p>
<p>While the STRIDE model helps to identify the threats, the DREAD methodology helps to rank them. For each threat in the system, you would go over each threat category and classify it in low (1 point), medium (2 points), or high (3 points). In the end, you would have a ranked list of threats and mitigation strategies. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-threat-modeling-example.png" alt="Threat modeling example"></p>
<p>We can see that threat modeling will provide a very clear view of what we want to protect, how we plan to protect it, and associated costs. This is part of the <strong>threat model</strong> of the product, which needs to be re-evaluated for every development cycle. As a result, the threat model will provide a prioritized list of threats to work on, so we can focus on implementing the mitigations to improve the security of the product.</p>
<p>How to protect the integrity and authenticity of your code? How to ensure the privacy of the data? Where to store cryptographic keys? How to minimize the risks of an application to be exploited? Let’s try to answer all of those questions and many more, starting with secure boot!</p>
<h2 id="secure-boot">Secure Boot</h2>
<p>How to make sure the code you are running was built by a trustworthy person or company? Implementing a <strong>secure boot</strong> process.</p>
<p>The objective of a secure boot process is to protect the integrity and authenticity of the code.</p>
<p>Secure boot is usually based on the verification of digital signatures. An embedded Linux system normally has three major components: bootloader, kernel and root filesystem (rootfs). All these components are signed and the signatures are checked during boot.</p>
<p>For example, some hardware mechanism can be used to check the signature of the bootloader, that will check the signature of the kernel, that will use a ramdisk image to check the signature of the root filesystem. Since we have one component checking the signature of the next one in the boot chain, this process is often called a <strong>chain-of-trust</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-secure-boot-1.png" alt="Secure boot"></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a real example on an <a href="https://www.nxp.com/imx6">NXP iMX6</a> device.</p>
<p>Everything starts in the ROM code inside the SoC. On NXP iMX6, there is a hardware component called High Assurance Boot (HAB) that it is able to validate the signature of the first stage bootloader, making it possible to implement a secure boot process. The High Assurance Boot inside iMX6 devices can also be called the <strong>Root of Trust</strong>, since if it is compromised, all the secure boot process is also compromised.</p>
<p>The ROM code inside the iMX6 SoC, using the HAB component, will check the signature of the bootloader. For that, it is necessary to generate a pair of keys (public and private), sign the bootloader with the private key and store the public key inside the SoC. On iMX6, OTP fuses are used to store the keys. Actually, to make it less expensive, only the hash of the public key is stored in the SoC.</p>
<p>When the bootloader boots (e.g. <a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot">U-Boot</a>), it will have to check the signature of the Linux kernel. For that, it is common to use an image format called <strong>FIT image</strong>. The FIT image is a container for multiple binaries with hashing and signature support, and usually contains the Linux kernel image, device tree files and an initial ramdisk. After generating a pair of keys, we need to sign the binaries inside the FIT image with the private key e configure U-Boot to use the public key to check the signature of the FIT image.</p>
<p>After the kernel boots, it will run the <em>init</em> program from the ramdisk image. The ramdisk will have the logic to verify the integrity of the final root filesystem before mounting it. There are some options to implement this. One common option is using the device-mapper verity (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html">dm-verity</a>) kernel module. The <strong>dm-verity</strong> kernel module provides integrity checking of block devices and requires a read-only rootfs (squashfs can be a good solution). Other approaches would be <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Integrity_Measurement_Architecture">IMA</a> or <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-integrity.html">dm-integrity</a> if you want a read-write root filesystem.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram of the complete secure boot process:</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-secure-boot-2.png" alt="Secure boot on NXP iMX6"></p>
<p>This is only one example of a secure boot implementation, although it could be applied to a different set of boards and ARM SoCs.</p>
<p>Yet nothing is 100% secure!</p>
<p>Secure boot vulnerabilities in the ROM code of several NXP devices (i.MX6, i.MX50, i.MX53, i.MX7, i.MX28 and Vybrid families) were <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/vulnerabilities-in-high-assurance-boot-of-nxp-imx-microprocessors.html">publicly disclosed</a> on July 17th, 2017. And if your chain of trust is compromised, everything is compromised! So we need to be aware of these types of vulnerabilities (in this case, they were fixed with new silicon).</p>
<p>While secure boot ensures authenticity and integrity, it does not protect the device from being counterfeited or threat actors from extracting code/data from the device. So if you want to protect your intellectual property or ensure data confidentiality, you will need to use encryption.</p>
<h2 id="code-and-data-encryption">Code and data encryption</h2>
<p>You may want to encrypt data or code in an embedded Linux device.</p>
<p>Data encryption is a common approach when you need to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the users. Data is any information generated during the executing of the device, including databases, configuration files, and so on.</p>
<p>Code encryption depends on the situation, and encrypting the full root filesystem is not that common. Usually, most of the components are free and open source software, so there is nothing to hide. There is also the issue of GPLv3 and Tivoization (using any GPLv3 software will force you to provide a mechanism for the user to update the software, and that would make it more difficult if you are encrypting it). A more common use case is to encrypt only the applications you developed for the device. It’s usually where your intellectual property is.</p>
<p>There are basically two main approaches to encryption in Linux: <strong>full disk encryption</strong> and <strong>file-based encryption</strong>.</p>
<p>Full disk encryption provides encryption at the block level and the whole disk or a disk partition is encrypted. For that, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt">dm-crypt</a>, the Linux kernel’s device mapper crypto target.</p>
<p>File-based encryption provides encryption at the file system level, where each directory may be separately and optionally encrypted with a different key. The two most common implementations of file-based encryption are <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fscrypt">fscrypt</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ECryptfs">eCryptFS</a>. fscrypt is an API available on some filesystems like EXT4, UBIFS and F2FS, and eCryptFS is a more generic solution implemented as a layer that stacks on top of an existing filesystem.</p>
<p>But what about the keys used for encryption?</p>
<h2 id="encryption-keys">Encryption keys</h2>
<p>Since an asymmetric key algorithm is too slow to be used in encryption, usually a symmetric-key algorithm is used in encryption. That means the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and the key should be available somewhere in the filesystem so the encrypted code/data can be decrypted.</p>
<p>But we can’t just leave the key lying around in the filesystem, right?</p>
<p>There are several cases where companies …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p><span>The concept of failure demand was first described by John Seddon in his book “</span><span>I Want You to Cheat”, published in 1992. It was initially called </span><span>“demand we don’t want” and later, after much careful thought, re-named “failure demand”. </span><span>Since then, it has become widely known by people who work in service organisations. But do they understand it and do they know what to do about it?</span></p>
<h4><b>What is Failure Demand?</b></h4>
<p><span>It is </span><i><span>demand caused by a failure to do something or do something right for the customer.</span></i><span> Customers come back, making further demands, unnecessarily consuming the organisation’s resources because the service they receive is ineffective.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to understand demand:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Note how it is defined in customer terms.</li>
<li><span>Imagine what service would be like if every customer got whatever they needed… Seddon sets a high bar.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Failure demand stands in contrast to value demand. The latter consists of customer requests that are a normal part of providing a service.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Failure demand" src="https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?resize=570%2C204&amp;ssl=1" alt="Failure demand" width="570" height="204" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?w=570&amp;ssl=1 570w, https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?w=570&amp;ssl=1 570w, https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/vanguard-method.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Failure-demand.png?resize=570%2C204&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p><span>In conventional command-and-control service organisations, failure demand routinely runs at 40 – 60% of total customer demand. In some organisations, particularly health and social care and utilities, it can be as high as 80% or more. It is astonishing burden on capacity and an astonishing cost.</span></p>
<h4><b>Failure Demand Analysis</b></h4>
<p><span>To find out how much failure demand there is you need to study: What demands, in their terms, do customers make? How many of these are caused by failure to do something or do something right?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Study demand as it arises, at the points where your customers transact with your organisation. Do not translate the demand into an internal definition, record exactly what the customer says/writes.</span></li>
<li><span>Classify demands in customer terms, develop a customer typology. What types of demand and with what frequency? How predictable is each type?</span></li>
<li><span>What proportions are value demand and failure demand?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Identifying failure demand is the easy task. Reducing and removing it is the more difficult part. Command-and-control thinkers assume that the problem is caused by failures of people and processes. But tinkering about with those won’t achieve much, because failure demand is systemic. To remove it, you have to change the system; to even contemplate that, a significant shift in management thinking is necessary.</span></p>
<h4><b>How to Remove Failure Demand</b></h4>
<p><span>The only solution is to redesign the organisation. To design it as a system whose purpose is to achieve each and every customer’s purpose, articulated and measured in customer terms. It means:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Rethinking all organisation controls</span></li>
<li><span>Designing services from the outside-in</span></li>
<li><span>Redefining job roles, including managerial roles</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>An overhaul of the entire organisation is required – front line services and supporting functions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Following the redesign, not only will you provide a better service and have happier customers, but you will reduce the cost of delivering the service. It is not uncommon to reduce costs by as much as 50%. The increase in capacity can now be spent in more productive ways, to drive growth.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><b>Common Mistakes</b></h4>
<p><span>As John Seddon says, “the concept of failure demand is easy to understand and easy to misunderstand”. The misunderstanding occurs when the idea is taken out of its system thinking framework and grafted on a command and control mindset.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The most common mistakes in tackling failure demand are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Buying software to measure it and report it.<br>
</span>A complete waste of time and money. Failure demand should not be a permanent measure. It is a temporary measure that sends a clear signal of ineffectiveness. Measuring and reporting failure demand takes management’s attention in the wrong direction.</li>
<li><span>Setting targets to reduce it<br>
</span>A target is a goal without a method. Setting targets will only lead to cheating. The only target you need is to work towards perfect services, the consequence being eradication of failure demand.</li>
<li><span>Focusing on people and processes, allocating blame<br>
</span>We often see organisations – encouraged by consultants who know no better – setting up “governance” units to allocate blame to functions or processes and work across boundaries to resolve poor processes. Achieving marginal falls in failure demand hoodwinks them into believing they have the right solution. It is to fail to realise that failure demand is systemic and can only be eradicated by a change to the system.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>These kinds of initiatives will achieve modest improvements at best. The purpose is eradication.</span></p>
<p><span>Many service organisations have achieved Seddon’s high bar, where failure demand is negligible. The design of the system coheres people around a common purpose as all performance measures rise, so does morale.</span></p>

<div id="post-body-6228875266477811300">
<p>About a year ago ago, I got a new laptop: a late 2019 Razer Blade Stealth 13.&nbsp; It sports an Intel i7-1065G7 with the best Intel's Ice Lake graphics along with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650.&nbsp; Apart from needing an ACPI lid quirk and the power management issues described here, it’s been a great laptop so far and the Linux experience has been very smooth.</p><p>

Unfortunately, the out-of-the-box integrated graphics performance of my new laptop was less than stellar.&nbsp; My first task with the new laptop was to debug a rendering issue in the Linux port of Shadow of the Tomb Raider which turned out to be a bug in the game.&nbsp; In the process, I discovered that the performance of the game’s built-in benchmark was almost half of Windows.&nbsp; We’ve had some performance issues with Mesa from time to time on some games but half seemed a bit extreme.&nbsp; Looking at system-level performance data with gputop revealed that GPU clock rate was unable to get above about 60-70% of the maximum in spite of the GPU being busy the whole time.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; The GPU wasn’t able to get enough power.&nbsp; Once I sorted out my power management problems, the benchmark went from about 50-60% the speed of Windows to more like 104% the speed of windows (yes, that’s more than 100%).</p><p>

This blog post is intended to serve as a bit of a guide to understanding memory throughput and power management issues and configuring your system properly to get the most out of your Intel integrated GPU.&nbsp; Not everything in this post will affect all laptops so you may have to do some experimentation with your system to see what does and does not matter.&nbsp; I also make no claim that this post is in any way complete; there are almost certainly other configuration issues of which I'm not aware or which I've forgotten.</p><h2>
Update your drivers</h2><p>
This should go without saying but if you want the best performance out of your hardware, running the latest drivers is always recommended.&nbsp; This is especially true for hardware that has just been released.&nbsp; Generally, for graphics, most of the big performance improvements are going to be in Mesa but your Linux kernel version can matter as well.&nbsp; In the case of Intel Ice Lake processors, some of the power management features aren’t enabled until Linux 5.4.</p><p>

I’m not going to give a complete guide to updating your drivers here.&nbsp; If you’re running a distro like Arch, chances are that you’re already running something fairly close to the latest available.&nbsp; If you’re on Ubuntu, the padoka PPA provides versions of the userspace components (Mesa, X11, etc.) that are usually no more than about a week out-of-date but upgrading your kernel is more complicated.&nbsp; Other distros may have something similar but I’ll leave as an exercise to the reader.</p><p>

This doesn’t mean that you need to be obsessive about updating kernels and drivers.&nbsp; If you’re happy with the performance and stability of your system, go ahead and leave it alone.&nbsp; However, if you have brand new hardware and want to make sure you have new enough drivers, it may be worth attempting an update.&nbsp; Or, if you have the patience, you can just wait 6 months for the next distro release cycle and hope to pick up with a distro update.</p><h2>
Make sure you have dual-channel RAM</h2><p>
One of the big bottleneck points in 3D rendering applications is memory bandwidth.&nbsp; Most standard monitors run at a resolution of 1920x1080 and a refresh rate of 60 Hz.&nbsp; A 1920x1080 RGBA (32bpp) image is just shy of 8 MiB in size and, if the GPU is rendering at 60 FPS, that adds up to about 474 MiB/s of memory bandwidth to write out the image every frame.&nbsp; If you're running a 4K monitor, multiply by 4 and you get about 1.8 GiB/s.&nbsp; Those numbers are only for the final color image, assume we write every pixel of the image exactly once, and don't take into account any other memory access.&nbsp; Even in a simple 3D scene, there are other images than just the color image being written such as depth buffers or auxiliary gbuffers, each pixel typically gets written more than once depending on app over-draw, and shading typically involves reading from uniform buffers and textures.&nbsp; Modern 3D applications typically also have things such as depth pre-passes, lighting passes, and post-processing filters for depth-of-field and/or motion blur.&nbsp; The result of this is that actual memory bandwidth for rendering a 3D scene can be 10-100x the bandwidth required to simply write the color image.</p><p>

Because of the incredible amount of bandwidth required for 3D rendering, discrete GPUs use memories which are optimized for bandwidth above all else.&nbsp; These go by different names such as GDDR6 or HBM2 (current as of the writing of this post) but they all use extremely wide buses and access many bits of memory in parallel to get the highest throughput they can.&nbsp; CPU memory, on the other hand, is typically DDR4 (current as of the writing of this post) which runs on a narrower 64-bit bus and so the over-all maximum memory bandwidth is lower.&nbsp; However, as with anything in engineering, there is a trade-off being made here.&nbsp; While narrower buses have lower over-all throughput, they are much better at random access which is necessary for good CPU memory performance when crawling complex data structures and doing other normal CPU tasks.&nbsp; When 3D rendering, on the other hand, the vast majority of your memory bandwidth is consumed in reading/writing large contiguous blocks of memory and so the trade-off falls in favor of wider buses.</p><p>

With integrated graphics, the GPU uses the same DDR RAM as the CPU so it can't get as much raw memory throughput as a discrete GPU.&nbsp; Some of the memory bottlenecks can be mitigated via large caches inside the GPU but caching can only do so much.&nbsp; At the end of the day, if you're fetching 2 GiB of memory to draw a scene, you're going to blow out your caches and load most of that from main memory.</p><p>

The good news is that most motherboards support a dual-channel ram configurations where, if your DDR units are installed in identical pairs, the memory controller will split memory access between the two DDR units in the pair.&nbsp; This has similar benefits to running on a 128-bit bus but without some of the drawbacks.&nbsp; The result is about a 2x improvement in over-all memory throughput.&nbsp; While this may not affect your CPU performance significantly outside of some very special cases, it makes a huge difference to your integrated GPU which cares far more about total throughput than random access.&nbsp; If you are unsure how your computer's RAM is configured, you can run “dmidecode -t memory” and see if you have two identical devices reported in different channels.</p><h2>
Power management 101</h2><p>
Before getting into the details of how to fix power management issues, I should explain a bit about how power management works and, more importantly, how it doesn’t.&nbsp; If you don’t care to learn about power management and are just here for the system configuration tips, feel free to skip this section.</p><p>

Why is power management important?&nbsp; Because the clock rate (and therefore the speed) of your CPU or GPU is heavily dependent on how much power is available to the system.&nbsp; If it’s unable to get enough power for some reason, it will run at a lower clock rate and you’ll see that as processes taking more time or lower frame rates in the case of graphics.&nbsp; There are some things that you, as the user, cannot control such as the physical limitations of the chip or the way the OEM has configured things on your particular laptop.&nbsp; However, there are some things which you can do from a system configuration perspective which can greatly affect power management and your performance.</p><p>

First, we need to talk about thermal design power or TDP.&nbsp; There is a lot of misunderstanding on the internet about TDP and we need to clear some of them up.&nbsp; Wikipedia defines TDP as “the maximum amount of heat generated by a computer chip or component that the cooling system in a computer is designed to dissipate under any workload.”&nbsp; The Intel Product Specifications site defines TDP as follows:</p><p>

Thermal Design Power (TDP) represents the average power, in watts, the processor dissipates when operating at Base Frequency with all cores active under an Intel-defined, high-complexity workload. Refer to Datasheet for thermal solution requirements.</p><p>

In other words, the TDP value provided on the Intel spec sheet is a pretty good design target for OEMs but doesn’t provide nearly as many guarantees as one might hope.&nbsp; In particular, there are several things that the TDP value on the spec sheet is not:</p><ul>
<li>It’s not the exact maximum power.&nbsp; It’s a “average power”.</li>
<li>It may not match any particular workload.&nbsp; It’s based on “an Intel-defined, high-complexity workload”.&nbsp; Power consumption on any other workload is likely to be slightly different.</li>
<li>It’s not the actual maximum.&nbsp; It’s based on when the processor is “operating at Base Frequency with all cores active.” Technologies such as Turbo Boost can cause the CPU to operate at a higher power for short periods of time.</li>
</ul><p>
If you look at the&nbsp; Intel Product Specifications page for the i7-1065G7, you’ll see three TDP values: the nominal TDP of 15W, a configurable TDP-up value of 25W and a configurable TDP-down value of 12W.&nbsp; The nominal TDP (simply called “TDP”) is the base TDP which is enough for the CPU to run all of its cores at the base frequency which, given sufficient cooling, it can do in the steady state.&nbsp; The TDP-up and TDP-down values provide configurability that gives the OEM options when they go to make a laptop based on the i7-1065G7.&nbsp; If they’re making a performance laptop like Razer and are willing to put in enough cooling, they can configure it to 25W and get more performance.&nbsp; On the other hand, if they’re going for battery life, they can put the exact same chip in the laptop but configure it to run as low as 12W.&nbsp; They can also configure the chip to run at 12W or 15W and then ship software with the computer which will bump it to 25W once Windows boots up.&nbsp; We’ll talk more about this reconfiguration …</p></div></div></div>

	<div>
      <p>Even though MP3 is probably the single most well known file format and codec on Earth, itâ€™s not very well understood by most 

programmers â€“ for many encoders/decoders is in the class of software â€œother peopleâ€� write, like standard libraries or operating system 

kernels. This article will attempt to demystify the decoder, with short top-down primers on signal processing and information theory 

when necessary. Additionally, a small but not full-featured decoder will be written (in Haskell), suited to play around with.</p>

<p>The focus on this article is on concepts and the design choices the MPEG team made when they designed the codec â€“ not on 

uninteresting implementation details or heavy theory. Some parts of a decoder are quite arcane and are better understood by reading the 

specification, a good book on signal processing, or the many papers on MP3 (see references at the end).</p>

<p>A note on the code: The decoder accompanying this article is written for readability, not speed. Additionally, some unusual features 

have been left out. The end result is a decoder that is inefficient and not standards compliant, but with hopefully readable code. You 

can grab the source here: <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/mp3decoder">mp3decoder-0.0.1.tar.gz</a>. 

Scroll down to the bottom of the article or see README for build instructions.</p>

<p>A fair warning: The author is a hobby programmer, not an authority in signal processing. If you find an error, please drop me an 

e-mail. be@bjrn.se</p>

<p>With that out of the way, we begin our journey with the ear.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3>Human hearing and psychoacoustics</h3>

<p>The main idea of MP3 encoding, and lossy audio coding in general, is removing acoustically irrelevant information from an audio 

signal to reduce its size. The job of the encoder is to remove some or all information from a signal component, while at the same time 

not changing the signal in such a way audible artifacts are introduced.</p>

<p>Several properties (or â€œdeficienciesâ€�) of human hearing are used by lossy audio codecs. One basic property is we canâ€™t hear above 20 

kHz or below 20 Hz, approximately. Additionally, thereâ€™s a threshold of hearing â€“ once a signal is below a certain threshold it canâ€™t 

be heard, itâ€™s too quiet. This threshold varies with frequency; a 20 Hz tone can only be heard if itâ€™s stronger than around 60 

decibels, while frequencies in the region 1-5 kHz can easily be perceived at low volume.</p>

<p>A very important property affecting the auditory system is known as <i>masking</i>. A loud signal will â€œmaskâ€� other signals 

sufficiently close in frequency or time; meaning the loud signal modifies the threshold of hearing for spectral and temporal neighbors. 

This property is very useful: not only can the nearby masked signals be removed; the audible signal can also be compressed further as 

the noise introduced by heavy compression will be masked too.</p>

<p>This masking phenomenon happens within frequency regions known as <i>critical bands</i> â€“ a strong signal within a critical band 

will mask frequencies within the band. We can think of the ear as a set of band pass filters, where different parts of the ear pick up 

different frequency regions. An audiologist or acoustics professor have plenty to say about critical bands and the subtleties of 

masking effects, however in this article we are taking a simplified engineering approach: for our purpose itâ€™s enough to think of these 

critical bands as fixed frequency regions where masking effects occur.</p>

<p>Using the properties of the human auditory system, lossy codecs and encoders remove inaudible signals to reduce the information 

content, thus compressing the signal. The MP3 standard does not dictate how an encoder should be written (though it assumes the 

existence of critical bands), and implementers have plenty of freedom to remove content they deem imperceptible. One encoder may decide 

a particular frequency is inaudible and should be removed, while another encoder keeps the same signal. Different encoders use 

different <i>psychoacoustic models</i>, models describing how humans perceive sounds and thus what information may be removed.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3>About MP3</h3>

<p>Before we begin decoding MP3, it is necessary to understand exactly what MP3 <i>is</i>. MP3 is a codec formally known as MPEG-1 

Audio Layer 3, and it is defined in the MPEG-1 standard. This standard defines three different audio codecs, where layer 1 is the 

simplest that has the worst compression ratio, and layer 3 is the most complex but has the highest compression ratio and the best audio 

quality per bit rate. Layer 3 is based on layer 2, in turn based on layer 1. All of the three codecs share similarities and have many 

encoding/decoding parts in common. </p>

<p>The rationale for this design choice made sense back when the MPEG-1 standard was first written, as the similarities between the 

three codecs would ease the job for implementers. In hindsight, building layer 3 on top of the other two layers was perhaps not the 

best idea. Many of the advanced features of MP3 are shoehorned into place, and are more complex than they would have been if the codec 

was designed from scratch. In fact, many of the features of AAC were designed to be â€œsimplerâ€� than the counterpart in MP3. </p>

<p>At a very high level, an MP3 encoder works like this: An input source, say a WAV file, is fed to the encoder. There the signal is 

split into parts (in the time domain), to be processed individually. The encoder then takes one of the short signals and transforms it 

to the frequency domain. The psychoacoustic model removes as much information as possible, based on the content and phenomena such as 

masking. The frequency samples, now with less information, are compressed in a generic lossless compression step. The samples, as well 

as parameters how the samples were compressed, are then written to disk in a binary file format.</p>

<p>The decoder works in reverse. It reads the binary file format, decompress the frequency samples, reconstructs the samples based on 

information how content was removed by the model, and then transforms them to the time domain. Letâ€™s start with the binary file 

format.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<h3>Decoding, step 1: Making sense of the data</h3>

<p>Many computer users know that an MP3 are made up of several â€œframesâ€�, consecutive blocks of data. While important for unpacking the 

bit stream, frames are not fundamental and cannot be decoded individually. In this article, what is usually called a frame we call a 

<i>physical frame</i>, while we call a block of data that can actually be decoded a <i>logical frame</i>, or simply just a frame.</p>

<p>A logical frame has many parts: it has a 4 byte <i>header</i> easily distinguishable from other data in the bit stream, it has 17 or 

32 bytes known as <i>side information</i>, and a few hundred bytes of <i>main data</i>.</p>

<p>A physical frame has a header, an optional 2 byte checksum, side information, but only some of the main data unless in very rare 

circumstances. The screenshot below shows a physical frame as a thick black border, the frame header as 4 red bytes, and the side 

information as blue bytes (this MP3 does not have the optional checksum). The grayed out bytes is the main data that corresponds to the 

highlighted header and side information. The header for the following physical frame is also highlighted, to show the header always 

begin at offset 0.</p>

<p>The absolutely first thing we do when we decode the MP3 is to unpack the physical frames to logical frames â€“ this is a means of 

abstraction, once we have a logical frame we can forget about everything else in the bit stream. We do this by reading an offset value 

in the side information that point to the beginning of the main data.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.bjrn.se/mp3dec/logicalframe.gif"></p> 

<p>Whyâ€™s not the main data for a logical frame kept within the physical frame? At first this seems unnecessarily clumsy, but it has 

some advantages. The length of a physical frame is constant (within a byte) and solely based on the bit rate and other values stored in 

the easily found header. This makes seeking to arbitrary frames in the MP3 efficient for media players. Additionally, as frames are not 

limited to a fixed size in bits, parts of the audio signal with complex sounds can use bytes from preceding frames, in essence giving 

all MP3:s variable bit rate.</p>

<p>There are some limitations though: a frame can save its main data in several preceding frames, but not following frames â€“ this would 

make streaming difficult. Also, the main data for a frame cannot be arbitrarily large, and is limited to about 500 bytes. This is limit 

is fairly short, and is often criticized. </p>

<p>The perceptive reader may notice the gray main data bytes in the image above begin with an interesting pattern (<code>3E 50 00 

00</code>â€¦) that resembles the first bytes of the main data in the next logical frame (<code>38 40 00 00</code>â€¦). There is some 

structure in the main data, but usually this wonâ€™t be noticeable in a hex editor.</p>

<p>To work with the bit stream, we are going to use a very simple type:</p>

<pre>data MP3Bitstream = MP3Bitstream {
    bitstreamStream :: B.ByteString,
    bitstreamBuffer :: [Word8]
}</pre>

<p>Where the <code>ByteString</code> is the unparsed bit stream, and the <code>[Word8]</code> is an internal buffer used to reconstruct 

logical frames from physical frames. Not familiar with Haskell? Donâ€™t worry; all the code in this article is only complementary.</p>

<p>As the bit stream may contain data we consider garbage, such as ID3 tags, we are using a simple helper function, 

<code>mp3Seek</code>, which takes the <code>MP3Bitstream</code> and discards bytes until it finds a valid header. The new 

<code>MP3Bitstream</code> can then be passed to a function that does the actual physical to logical unpacking. </p>

<pre>mp3Seek :: MP3Bitstream -&gt; Maybe MP3Bitstream
mp3UnpackFrame :: MP3Bitstream -&gt; (MP3Bitstream, Maybe MP3LogicalFrame)</pre>

<h4>The anatomy of a logical frame</h4>

<p>When weâ€™re done decoding proper, a logical frame will have yielded us exactly 1152 time domain samples per channel. In a typical PCM 

WAV file, storing these samples would require 2304 bytes per channel â€“ …</p></div></div></div>

<div itemprop="image" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><a href="https://jscitech.ir/news-views/nvidia-buy-arm-what-consequence/farhad/424/"><img loading="lazy" width="833" height="469" src="https://jscitech.ir/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NVIDIAs-Acquisition-of-Arm-What-are-the-Consequences1.jpg" alt="nvidia buys arm; what re the consequences?" title="NVIDIA's Acquisition of Arm; What are the Consequences?1" itemprop="thumbnailUrl"></a></p></div></div>

<section itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="text"><p>On 13 September 2020, NVIDIA announced that it will be acquiring Arm for $40 billion. Arm is powering lots of devices including most smartphones. The open licensing policy and unrivaled performance at low power applications suggested a bright future for this company. However, analysts are suggesting that this deal will be the Arm’s downfall.</p>
<p>NVIDIA and SoftBank previously announced a definitive agreement under which NVIDIA will acquire Arm Limited from SoftBank in a transaction valued at $40 billion. NVIDIA is claiming that they will collaborate with Arm and expand their R&amp;D in artificial intelligence applications. NVIDIA professes that it would retain Arm’s business model and its headquarters in Cambridge, UK.</p>
<p>The deal is said to take 18 months to complete. They have to secure regulatory approvals. UK might not approve this deal if NVIDIA’s policies don’t satisfy England’s law. There is also China, there is a high probability that China wouldn’t approve this deal due to the trade war.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is an American company which designs high performance GPUs for gaming, professional use, HPC and artificial intelligence.&nbsp; They also provide accelerators, embedded solutions and automotive solutions. Arm Ltd. on the other hand, is a semiconductor and software design company located in Cambridge, England. They design ARM processors, Mali GPUs, SoCs and software development tools. Arm has over 1000 partners and is powering 180 billion devices worldwide, and since 2016 it has been owned by SoftBank Group. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of the world’s technology with top of the line solutions.</p>
<p>Recently a few semiconductor companies, among them Samsung, were keen to buy Arm, but NVIDIA managed to win the competition and acquire Arm for a high stake of $40 billion. This deal has alerted analysts, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/chiakokhua">Mr. Chia</a>, this deal would not only damage Arm, but also the industry and the consumers as well, because NVIDIA wouldn’t be operating Arm as a totally independent company. This acquisition will grant NVIDIA control over Arm’s policies, licensing terms, fees and royalties.</p>
<p>Arm is an essential part of the industry, therefore preserving its neutrality is of great importance. NVIDIA by gaining access to Arm’s confidential information will be able to discover Arm’s future plans and deploy them ahead of the competition. Furthermore, NVIDIA will also be able to abuse Arm’s clients’ crucial information and acknowledge their future plans.</p>
<p>Eventually in a few years NVIDIA will own Arm exclusively and make its ecosystem a deep pit that traps customers, just like CUDA. If you want to know about the bad reputation of NVIDIA’s policies you should ask Linus Torvalds. He is the founder and the maintainer of Linux and has worked with big companies. In an interview back in 2012 at Aalto university, he literally showed his middle finger to NVIDIA due to NVIDIA’s atrocious behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“NVIDIA has been one of the worst trouble spots we’ve had with hardware manufacturers, and that is really sad because NVIDIA tries to sell chips, alot of chips, into the android market, and nvidia has been the single worst company we’ve ever dealt with, so NVIDIA f_ck you.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVpOyKCNZYw">Linus Torvalds, Aalto Talks, 14 June 2012</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA, by owning Arm will be able to disrupt the entire industry with a single shot, and promote its own legacy. That’s what a wise man would do for his own company, although it could be bad for the industry and us. NVIDIA will probably shift resources towards data centers and AI therefore smartphone and embedded customers would suffer.</p>
<div id="attachment_496"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-496" loading="lazy" src="https://jscitech.ir/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NVIDIAs-Acquisition-of-Arm-What-are-the-Consequences2.jpg" alt="arm's grave stone" width="800" height="770"></p><p id="caption-attachment-496">An image demonstrating Arm’s death because of the deal. <em>Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/Underfox3">Underfox</a></em></p></div>
<p>This shift in the industry would probably trigger Arm’s customers. They definitely don’t want their leash in NVIDIA’s hands. Arm’s customers will probably chose a plan B to employ it when things go sideways with Arm. Analysts believe that this plan B would be RISC-V. RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA). Unlike others this ISA is provided under open source licenses and therefore doesn’t require fees. Several companies provide RISC-V hardware; Linux has support for RISC-V and RISC-V is supported in popular software development tools.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.eenewseurope.com/news/risc-v-boom-edge-ai-says-facebooks-chief-ai-scientist">Yann LeCun</a>, Facebook’s chief AI scientist and inventor of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), due to acquisition of Arm by NVIDIA, industry will move to RISC-V as it is a promising alternative to Arm’s solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is a change in the industry and ARM with NVIDIA makes people uneasy but the emergence of RISC-V sees chips with a RISC-V core and an NPU (neural processing unit). These are incredibly cheap, less than $10, with many out of China, and these will become ubiquitous. I’m wondering if RISC-V will take over the world there.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eenewseurope.com/news/risc-v-boom-edge-ai-says-facebooks-chief-ai-scientist">Yann LeCun, eeNews, 15 October 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is also another analyst who believes RISC-V will be replacing Arm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The complete destruction of ARM ecosystem and a mass exodus for RISC-V is absolutely predictable and will happen very quickly, in the next few years. My recommendation to everyone is to study the RISC-V Instruction Set Manual as soon as possible.</p>
<p>— Underfox (@Underfox3) <a href="https://twitter.com/Underfox3/status/1319676329919451138?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Codeplay Software Limited has <a href="https://semiaccurate.com/2020/10/29/codeplay-joins-the-risc-v-foundation/">recently announced</a> that they will be joining the RISC-V foundation. Codeplay produces software tools and is a contributing member of the Multicore Association, the Khronos Group, and the HSA Foundation. Codeplay is bringing its tool to the RISC-V foundation. This move will be a huge leap forward for RISC-V and is a result of NVIDIA’s acquisition of Arm.</p>

				<p>Victorian society was famously paranoid about the dangers of masturbation. For teachers, priests and those with responsibility for young people, it was a question of morals and the corruption of youth – but the medical profession also agreed that self-abuse was a vice with terrible consequences. The old cliché that the practice ‘makes you go blind’ was not said just to frighten teenage boys – it was a view sincerely held by many physicians. Others suggested that masturbation caused <a href="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/an-unnatural-propensity-and-its-perils/">heart disease</a>, or proposed deeply unpleasant <a href="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/abominable-disgusting-habit/">treatment regimes</a> to make the problem go away.</p>
<p>Though many people will associate this fear with the nineteenth century, its roots go back a lot further – as least as early as the 1720s, when a pamphlet entitled <em>Onania; or, The heinous sin of self-pollution, and all its frightful consequences, in both sexes, considered</em> was published in London – and subsequently became a bestseller on <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/evans/N02163.0001.001/1:6?rgn=div1;view=fulltext">both sides of the Atlantic</a>.</p>
<p>This article, published in the <em>Transactions of the Physico-medical Society of New York </em>in 1817, is another striking example. It is also an interesting example of faulty diagnosis. The author was a physician from Connecticut, Dr William Tully:<a href="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-by-onanism.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-by-onanism.jpg" alt="An instance of death from onanism" width="461" height="230" srcset="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-by-onanism.jpg 871w, http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-by-onanism-300x150.jpg 300w, http://www.thomas-morris.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-by-onanism-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px"></a></p>
<p><em>E.B., aged sixteen, of active habits, of bodily size rather less than medium, and as it respects strength of constitution less vigorous than most youths of his age, complained the 3rd of October, 1812, of indisposition.</em></p>
<p>‘Feeling ill’ is not a terribly useful description, but thankfully the doctor had a history to fall back on:</p>
<p><em>For some weeks previous to this, his friends had observed, that his countenance was becoming pale and unhealthy; that universal emaciation was stealing upon him, and that he constantly manifested unusual peevishness. His appetite during this period was not observably augmented or impaired, except for liquids. This thirst, for some time, had been uniform and considerable.</em></p>
<p>Although this set of symptoms is still quite vague, many doctors today would find one potential diagnosis immediately suggesting itself. Hint: it isn’t excessive masturbation.</p>
<p><em>As the changes, however, in the state of his health, had been from day to day hardly appreciable, and as he made no complaints of illness, little attention had been paid to these circumstances. About the 20th of September, an occasion resented, and he was observed to manifest an extraordinary relish and craving for new cider. </em></p>
<p>Today in America ‘apple cider’ (as opposed to ‘hard cider’) is a non-alcoholic beverage, but I believe that in 1812 Connecticut it would have been weakly alcoholic. Do correct me if I’m wrong.</p>
<p><em>From thenceforth, he sought every opportunity of indulging this appetite, almost without limit; and made use of stratagems to obtain the gratification of his desires, to which he had previously been a stranger. His desire for food, from this period, diminished; and though tolerably active in his customary employments, yet a rapid diminution of strength was observed.</em></p>
<p>There are good reasons for thinking this entire pattern of behaviour highly significant from a diagnostic point of view. More of that later.</p>
<p><em>About the 1st of October, an unusual secretion of urine, and an almost incessant disposition to empty the bladder, was perceived. On the 3rd, as mentioned above, he first complained of indisposition, and on the morning of the 4th, first had medical advice.</em></p>
<p>When Dr Tully visited the patient shortly afterwards, these were the symptoms he found:</p>
<p><em>Extreme emaciation, but not so much diminution of strength as to prevent walking about; complexion very pale; expression of the eyes, and whole countenance haggard and wild, though no mental derangement could be perceived; no appetite for food; great thirst; skin dry and cool; tongue dry, and covered with a reddish brown crust; pulse about 130 beats in a minute very small, and receding under slight pressure; indescribable, dull, distressing sensations about the precordia, and in the back; shortness of breath, frequent micturition, and copious discharges of urine, which was limpid and colourless. The preceding night had been passed in a very sleepless and restless manner.</em></p>
<p>And this is when Dr Tully made a discovery that, he believed, explained the whole case:</p>
<p><em>At this time, it was ascertained, that he had been in the habitual nocturnal practice of onanism for about six months, frequently repeating it five or six times in a night.</em></p>
<p>That is, admittedly, quite a lot.</p>
<p><em>On being questioned, whether he had not been sensible of the pernicious effect of this baneful practice, it was found, that for some time previous, he had experienced unpleasant and distressing sensations, as an immediate consequence of every orgasm; but so much was he under the dominion of this deadly habit, as to be unable to resist its influence, notwithstanding his conviction of its fatal consequences.</em></p>
<p>Dr Tully barely needed to hear any more.</p>
<p><em>In short, it was judged, that his whole malady was the ultimate result of this practice.</em></p>
<p><em>Its primary effects, seemed to have been derangement of the digestive organs; and the secondary ones, the symptoms above detailed.</em></p>
<p>The doctor prescribed baking soda and vinegar in the hope of ‘obtaining the exhilarating effects of disengaged carbonic acid in the stomach.’ Wine, opium and cinchona bark (containing quinine, good for fevers) were also administered, and the patient given nutritious broths. But their patient quickly deteriorated, and by 10 pm had become comatose. In the early hours of the following morning he died.</p>
<p>Dr Tully was in no doubt what had caused his patient’s death: masturbation.</p>
<p><em>The ill effects of the practice, which apparently gave rise to the preceding case, have been questioned by John Hunter, in his </em>Treatise on the Venereal<em>; but with due deference to his exalted reputation, I must say, that his argument of its universality, and the little apparent evidence against it, in my opinion, apply equally well to intemperance in the use of distilled spirits.</em></p>
<p>John Hunter was indeed sceptical of the idea that masturbation caused serious illness, writing that ‘the only true objection to this selfish enjoyment is the probability of its being repeated too frequently.’</p>
<p>While happy to admit that many of his contemporaries exaggerate the dangers, Dr Tully is adamant that the ‘sin of Onan’ has potentially fatal consequences.</p>
<p><em>That popular treatises upon it, tend rather to increase than diminish the evil, I readily admit; but as a physician, I am firmly convinced, that many a vigorous constitution, which though it does mot sink under it, yet receives such a shock by it, as is frequently followed by premature old age, and a host of infirmities.</em></p>
<p>Dr Tully ventures to suggest a refinement to the prevailing opinion on the mechanism of illness caused by masturbation:</p>
<p><em>It has been the commonly received opinion, that the part of the system first affected by Onanism, is the brain, and its production through the spina dorsi; but I have long been convinced, that the stomach is first peculiarly deranged, and these other parts in consequence. In this case, paleness, emaciation, and an unusual appetite for liquids, were the first observable symptoms. Speedily, however, further depravity of appetite, is manifest, and this of such a nature, as to be followed with a certain degree of diabetes. </em></p>
<p>And here Dr Tully stumbles agonisingly close to the likely truth of the case – though he mistakes cause for effect. Emaciation, insatiable thirst and an almost incessant need to urinate are classic symptoms of acute type 1 diabetes. So much so that a modern doctor reading the case report above would probably get no further than the first paragraph before thinking, ‘Could this be type 1 diabetes?’ It’s impossible to be certain, of course, but there is little in the rest of the case report that would cast doubt on this diagnosis.</p>
<p>One other aspect of the article struck me as interesting. In the later literature on the evils of masturbation, an archetype of the habitual masturbator emerged. This description of the ‘typical patient’ is taken from William Acton’s <em>The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs</em>, first published in 1857:</p>
<p><em>The frame is stunted and weak, the muscles undeveloped, the eye is sunken and heavy, the complexion is sallow, pasty, or covered with spots of acne, the hands are damp and cold, and the skin moist.</em></p>
<p>The echoes of Dr Tully’s 1817 case report are striking: the smaller-than-average frame, the general impression of feebleness and emaciation, the unhealthy complexion. This may not be an original observation, but I’ve not seen it made before, either: perhaps this entire archetype arose because doctors mistook diabetics for masturbators.</p>

See also this series of articles titled <a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/">Unix as IDE</a>.</p><p>A shell utility like <code>bash</code> provides built-in commands and scripting features to easily solve and automate various tasks. External *nix commands like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>parallel</code>, etc can be combined to work with each other. Depending upon your familiarity with those tools, you can either use <code>perl</code> as a single replacement or complement them for specific use cases.</p><p>Here's some one-liners (options will be explained later):</p><ul><li><code>perl -pe 's/(?:\x27;\x27|";")(*SKIP)(*F)|;/#/g'</code> — change <code>;</code> to <code>#</code> but don't change <code>;</code> within single or double quotes</li><li><code>perl -MList::Util=uniq -e 'print uniq &lt;&gt;'</code> — retain only first copy of duplicated lines, uses built-in module <code>List::Util</code></li><li><code>perl -MRegexp::Common=net -nE 'say join "\n", //g if /$RE{net}{IPv4}/'</code> — extract only IPv4 addresses, using a third-party <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Regexp::Common">Regexp::Common</a> module</li><li>Some stackoverflow Q&amp;A that I've answered over the years with simpler <code>perl</code> solution compared to other cli tools <ul><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42554684/shell-replace-string-with-incrementing-value">replace string with incrementing value</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48920626/sort-rows-in-csv-file-without-header-first-column">sort rows in csv file without header &amp; first column</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63681983/sed-reverse-matched-pattern">reverse matched pattern</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49765879/append-zeros-to-list">append zeros to list</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62241101/arithmetic-replacement-in-a-text-file">arithmetic replacement in a text file</a></li><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45571828/execute-bash-command-inside-awk-and-print-command-output">reverse complement DNA sequence for a specific field</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>The selling point of <code>perl</code> over tools like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> includes feature rich regular expression engine and standard/third-party modules. If you don't already know the syntax and idioms for <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>, learning command line options for <code>perl</code> would be the easier option. Another advantage is that <code>perl</code> is more portable compared to GNU, BSD and Mac implementations of cli tools. The main disadvantage is that <code>perl</code> is likely to be slower for features that are supported out of the box by those tools.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See also <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/303044/when-to-use-grep-less-awk-sed">unix.stackexchange: when to use grep, sed, awk, perl, etc</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href="#installation-and-documentation" id="installation-and-documentation">Installation and Documentation</a></h2><p>If you are on a Unix like system, you are most likely to already have some version of Perl installed. See <a href="https://www.cpan.org/src/README.html">cpan: Perl Source</a> for instructions to install the latest <code>perl</code> version from source. <code>perl v5.32.0</code> is used for all the examples shown in this book.</p><p>You can use <code>perldoc</code> command to access documentation from the command line.

Some more options will be covered in later chapters, but not all of them are discussed in this book.</p><h2><a href="#executing-perl-code" id="executing-perl-code">Executing Perl code</a></h2><p>If you want to execute a <code>perl</code> program file, one way is to pass the filename as argument to the <code>perl</code> command.</p><pre><code>$ echo 'print "Hello Perl\n"' &gt; hello.pl
$ perl hello.pl
Hello Perl
</code></pre><p>For short programs, you can also directly pass the code as an argument to the <code>-e</code> or <code>-E</code> options. See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/feature">perldoc: feature</a> for details about the features enabled by the <code>-E</code> option.</p><pre><code>$ perl -e 'print "Hello Perl\n"'
Hello Perl

$ # multiple statements can be issued separated by ;
$ # -l option will be covered in detail later, appends \n to 'print' here
$ perl -le '$x=25; $y=12; print $x**$y'
59604644775390625
$ # or, use -E and 'say' instead of -l and 'print'
$ perl -E '$x=25; $y=12; say $x**$y'
59604644775390625
</code></pre><h2><a href="#filtering" id="filtering">Filtering</a></h2><p><code>perl</code> one-liners can be used for filtering lines matched by a regexp, similar to <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>. And similar to many command line utilities, <code>perl</code> can accept input from both <code>stdin</code> and file arguments.</p><pre><code>$ # sample stdin data
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n'
gate
apple
what
kite

$ # print all lines containing 'at'
$ # same as: grep 'at' and sed -n '/at/p' and awk '/at/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | perl -ne 'print if /at/'
gate
what

$ # print all lines NOT containing 'e'
$ # same as: grep -v 'e' and sed -n '/e/!p' and awk '!/e/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | perl -ne 'print if !/e/'
what
</code></pre><p>By default, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> will automatically loop over input content line by line (with <code>\n</code> as the line distinguishing character). The <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code> option will enable this feature for <code>perl</code>. <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/using-modules.html#convert-one-liners-to-pretty-formatted-scripts">O module</a> section shows the code Perl runs with these options.</p><p>As seen before, the <code>-e</code> option accepts code as command line argument. Many shortcuts are available to reduce the amount of typing needed. In the above examples, a regular expression (defined by the pattern between a pair of forward slashes) has been used to filter the input. When the input string isn't specified, the test is performed against special variable <code>$_</code>, which has the contents of the current input line here (the correct term would be input <strong>record</strong>, see <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/record-separators.html#record-separators">Record separators</a> chapter). <code>$_</code> is also the default argument for many functions like <code>print</code> and <code>say</code>. To summarize:</p><ul><li><code>/REGEXP/FLAGS</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ =~ m/REGEXP/FLAGS</code></li><li><code>!/REGEXP/FLAGS</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ !~ m/REGEXP/FLAGS</code></li></ul><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#m/PATTERN/msixpodualngc">perldoc: match</a> for help on <code>m</code> operator. See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar#SPECIAL-VARIABLES">perldoc: special variables</a> for documentation on <code>$_</code>, <code>$&amp;</code>, etc.</p></blockquote><p>Here's an example with file input instead of <code>stdin</code>.</p><pre><code>$ cat table.txt
brown bread mat hair 42
blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14

$ perl -nE 'say $&amp; if /(?&lt;!-)\d+$/' table.txt

By default, this operates on <code>$_</code> when the input string isn't provided. For these examples, <code>-p</code> option is used instead of <code>-n</code> option, so that the value of <code>$_</code> is automatically printed after processing each input line. See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#s/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/msixpodualngcer">perldoc: search and replace</a> for documentation and examples.</p><pre><code>$ # for each input line, change only first ':' to '-'

In addition, it will return number of substitutions made if successful, otherwise returns a <em>false</em> value (empty string or <code>0</code>). You can use <code>r</code> flag to return string after substitution instead of in-place modification. As mentioned before, this book assumes you are already familiar with <code>perl</code> regular expressions. If not, see <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut">perldoc: perlretut</a> to get started.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#field-processing" id="field-processing">Field processing</a></h2><p>Consider the sample input file shown below with fields separated by a single space character.</p><pre><code>$ cat table.txt

The <code>-a</code> option will cause the input line to be split based on whitespaces and the field contents can be accessed using <code>@F</code> special array variable.

More details is discussed in <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/field-separators.html#default-field-separation">Default field separation</a> section.</p><pre><code>$ # print the second field of each input line

November 7, 2020 | https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wundergraph.com/blog/why_not_use_graphql">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I think GraphQL will change the world. There will be a future where you can query any system in the world using GraphQL. I'm building this future. So why would I argue against using GraphQL? My personal pet peeve is when the community keeps advertising benefits of GraphQL that are very generic and really have nothing to do with GraphQL. If we want to drive adoption, we should be honest and take off the rose-tinted glasses. This post is a response to "Why use GraphQL" by Kyle Schrade (<a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/</a>). It’s not meant to be direct criticism. The article is just an excellent base to work with as it represents opinions I keep hearing a lot in the community. If you read the whole article, it’ll take some time, you’ll fully understand why I think Kyle’s article should be named “Why use Apollo”.</p><p>If you haven't read Kyles's article already, I think it makes most sense if you read it first: <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/</a></p><p>The author states that REST APIs come with a set of downsides and how GraphQL solves all of them:
Over-fetching
Multiple requests for multiple resources
Waterfall network requests on nested data
Each client need to know the location of each service</p><p>The first three issues could be solved by writing another REST API as a facade for a specific user interface. Take Next.JS as an example. Next lets you define APIs with a very lightweight syntax. Instead of making multiple requests from the client, you can wrap those calls into an API and make them server-side. Over and underfetching can be solved with this approach too, as you can manipulate the data before sending it back to the client. The pattern described is named "backend for frontend" (BFF). It's not limited to full stack frameworks like Next.JS. You can build a BFF for your mobile apps as well.</p><p>With the BFF pattern, the client itself doesn't have to know the location of each service. However, the developer who implements the BFF needs to understand the service landscape. Hopefully you have Open API Specifications for all your services, nicely presented in a developer portal. If that's the case, it should be easy to write a BFF.</p><p>With GraphQL, there still needs to be a developer who implements the resolvers. Implementing the resolvers is more or less the same task as building a BFF, the logic is very similar. So, what's the real difference?</p><p>The BFF is easier to implement as there's a lot more tooling available. E.g. if you use a framework like Next.JS in combination with swr hooks (stale while revalidate) you get automatic caching with Etags and cache invalidation out of the box. This reduces the amount of data sent between server and client. It's even less data than GraphQL, because you're not sending query payloads and the server responds with 304 (Not Modified) if the response is still valid. Additionally, you don't have to use a heavyweight client like Apollo. The library swr by Vercel is small and very easy to use. It comes with support for pagination, hooks, and helps to navigate back and forth very efficiently.</p><p>GraphQL has persisted queries but it comes with additional overhead to implement this. If you don't use a client like Relay, which persists Queries by default, you have to do it on your own or use some third party library to implement it. Compared to the BFF approach using e.g. Next.JS there's a lot more complexity involved in getting to the same results on the frontend. How would you implement Etags with GraphQL? How do you make your GraphQL server return 304 status codes if nothing changed? Don't you first have to turn all Queries into GET requests? If so, does your GraphQL client and server easily support this?</p><p>When it comes to user experience and ease of development, the BFF is the clear winner. Less data transfer between client and server. Easier to implement. Smaller client, less moving parts.</p><p>But there's a catch. You have to build a BFF for each individual frontend. If you have many of them this can be a lot of work. You have to maintain all the BFFs. You have to operate them. You have to secure them.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could have the benefits of both without making tradeoffs? This is exactly what WunderGraph is. A framework to build BFFs using GraphQL.</p><p>In the next paragraph, Kyle goes on with the problems involved with versioned APIs. He's absolutely right that having too many versions of an API makes it very hard to keep track of. He then concludes that in GraphQL, there's only one version of the graph and changes can be tracked in a schema registry, a paid feature of Apollo. For that reason you won’t have any problems with versioning, he says.</p><p>I have problems coming to the same conclusion. Just because GraphQL schemas don’t support versioning natively doesn’t mean the problem goes away. You get the same effect if you just don’t version your REST APIs. In fact, many experts say that you should always try to not introduce versions of an API if you don’t have to. That being said, what holds you off running two versions of your GraphQL schema? Not that I think this is a good idea but it's technically possible.</p><p>If having too many versions of your REST APIs is a problem in your organization, before throwing a new tool like GraphQL at the problem, maybe you should have a look at the organization first. What are the reasons for having so many versions? Maybe the change of a process or new team structures can help? GraphQL does absolutely nothing to solve your versioning problems. Instead I think it actually makes the situation worse.</p><p>Do you have to support mobile applications? You should be aware that shipping native apps takes time. You have to wait for app store approval and you can expect many of your users to never (or slowly) install the new version. What if you want to introduce a breaking change in this scenario without breaking a client? It's impossible. You have to introduce this change in a non-breaking way. It would be interesting to hear from Facebook how they avoided breaking clients.</p><p>Evolving your schema in the case of GraphQL would mean, you deprecate the old field and add a new one. New clients use the new field while you hope that the number of clients using the old field will get less and less. Hopefully, you have a system in place that forces your users to download a new version at some point in time. Otherwise, you might be forced to support the deprecated field indefinitely. If that's the case, the deprecation model of GraphQL doesn't help you at all.</p><p>With REST you could create a new endpoint or another version of an existing one. The problem is the same, the solution just looks a bit different.</p><p>To make it clear, if you cannot control your clients you really want some kind of versioning. If all you have is a single web application you won’t need this feature. But then again GraphQL might be overkill as well.</p><p>In this paragraph, the author states that RESTful APIs don't allow partial responses.</p><p>This is just wrong. Here's an example:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>GET /users?fields=results(gender,name)</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>What does the author actually mean? I'm pretty sure he's aware of partial responses. I guess what he's trying to say is that someone needs to implement partial responses. Actually, it looks very familiar to GraphQL as you're selecting subfields from a resource. With GraphQL we have this feature out of the box.</p><p>On the other hand, with the BFF approach, you don't need this. Just return exactly the data you need. Again, a full-stack framework like Next.JS makes it simpler to implement this, makes caching easier and gives you Etag based cache invalidation for free.</p><p>To sum this section up, GraphQL gives you exactly the data you need. Partial responses can achieve the same result. BFFs come with the additional cost of implementation and maintenance but have a better UX &amp; DX.</p><p>In this paragraph, Kyle addresses the issues of REST APIs not being strictly typed. He talks about the problems with APIs where it's not clear if you get an array of posts or something different and how query parameters complicate the situation. He also states that GraphQL, because of its strict type system, doesn't have this problem.</p><p>I think what Kyle is talking about is an organizational problem for which you need an organizational solution.</p><p>You have the kind of problems he describes, when you allow developers to deploy REST APIs without publishing Open API Specifications (OAS) or similar. With OAS all resources can be described very easily. OAS also allows you to describe OAuth2 flows and required scopes per endpoint. Additionally, you can describe the exact types and validation rules for query parameters, a feature that GraphQL is lacking.</p><p>Looking at GraphQL, there's no way to describe Authentication, Authorization and input validation. GraphQL is lacking these features because the inventors at Facebook solved this problem at a different layer. There was no need for them to add these features to GraphQL. You can add custom directives to your schema to achieve similar results like OAS but this would be a custom implementation which you have to maintain yourself.</p><p>You might be thinking that OAS doesn't guarantee the response of an API to be compliant with the specification. You would be right. But how does a GraphQL schema guarantee anything?</p><p>GraphQL introspection is the act of sending a specific GraphQL query to the server to get information about the GraphQL schema. The GraphQL server is free to answer with whatever types it wants to. If you send a Query, the server can answer with a response that doesn't adhere to the GraphQL schema from the introspection response. Take Apollo Federation as an example. You upload your schema into a schema registry and then, by error, deploy the wrong version of your GraphQL server. If you change the type of a field, the client might be confused.</p><p>When we talk about type safety in GraphQL, what we actually mean is that we trust in a GraphQL server to behave exactly as advertised by the introspection Query …</p></section></div>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Context: Actor-based programming languages offer many essential features for developing modern distributed reactive systems. These systems exploit the actor model’s isolation property to fulfill their performance and scalability demands. Unfortunately, the reliance of the model on isolation as its most fundamental property requires programmers to express complex interaction patterns between their actors to be expressed manually in terms of complex combinations of messages sent between the isolated actors.</p>

<p>Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have been introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said interaction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals is satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems.</p>

<p>Approach:  We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an actor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor languages for five radically different types of message synchronization patterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages. Fortunately, these five types of synchronisation patterns have been studied extensively by the Complex Event Processing (CEP) community. Our paper describes how such CEP patterns are elegantly added to an actor-based programming language.</p>

<p>Knowledge: Based on our findings, we propose an extension of the single-message matching paradigm of contemporary actor-based languages in order to support a multiple-message matching way of thinking in the same way as proposed by CEP languages. Our proposal thus enriches the actor-model by ways of declaratively describing complex message combinations to which an actor can respond.</p>

<p>Grounding: We base the problem-statement of the paper on an online poll in the home automation community that has motivated the real need for the CEP-based synchronisation operators between actors proposed in the paper. Furthermore, we implemented a DSL —— called Sparrow —— that supports said operators and we argue quantitatively (in terms of LOC and in terms of a reduction of the concerns that have to be handled by programmers) that the DSL outperforms existing approaches.</p>

<p>Importance: This work aims to provide a set of synchronization operators that help actor-based languages to handle the complex interaction required by modern reactive distributed systems. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first one to add advanced CEP synchronization operators to the —— relatively simplistic single-message based matching —— mechanisms of most actor-based languages.</p>

                    <h4>Linux / Unix tools in a modern age</h4>

                    <p>
                        <h5>
                            2020-11-04
                        </h5>
                    </p>  
                </div><div>
                    <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>30 years ago software development was very low-level and systems administration was just computer para-scientists.
Today with so much high-level technology, many back-end or front-end programmers see the need to learn to use classic UNIX tools such as ps, grep, cat, pkill, and many others but also languages like Go, Rust, Python, and Javascript have been very successful in creating command-line tools with a higher user experience than the old ones.
In this way, many programmers choose these new tools much more comfortable, colorful, and in some cases even with better performance.</p>
<p>Here are several tools that help programmer productivity, study routines, write clean code, and even write less and do more:</p>
<p>It has been 47 years since the first release of <code>ps</code> (process status) a command-line tool to monitor processes in the operating system, widely used since then, and has not ceased to be important for any programmer and systems administrator.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.turtle-techies.com/useful-linux-unix-tools-to-add-to-your-toolbox/image01.png" alt="ps aux"></p><p>Another very important command-line tool is <code>pgrep</code> to which we give a regular expression as an argument and it returns a list of process identifiers that can be very useful if we want to stop a process or monitor it.</p>
<p>Many of these tools are a little complex to use and in our modern age, a couple of alternatives have begun to appear to improve the developer experience.</p>
<h2 id="htop">Htop <a href="#htop"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>In 2006 Htop was created, a system to debug, monitor, and visualize processes in real-time.
It is a user interface where you can run commands like ps, pgrep, pkill without the need to directly type the commands.</p>

<p>In our modern times with the arrival of CLI’s created in languages ​​like Python, Go, Ruby, and Javascript, we can see how more interactive command-line tools have been created that provide a very comfortable user experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-arrival-of-bpytop">The arrival of BpyTOP <a href="#the-arrival-of-bpytop"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>This 

<a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop" target="_blank">repository</a> on github hosts what could be said to be a modern child of htop.</p>
<p>The installation is technically easy, basically, we only need python 3.</p>
<p>A detailed installation guide is in the 

<a href="https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop" target="_blank">repository</a>, but basically, it is a pip command to install the package.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">
pip3 install bpytop --upgrade

bpytop

</code></pre></div>
<p>BpyTop has a comfortable user interface to help developers find and manage the process.
The interface is a new level of intuition which can help newbie developers to don’t lose their mind and be proactive.</p>

<p>This is perfect for virtual machines that have high computing tasks to evaluate the state of the machine and the memory use of the process.
As it is written entirely in C, its installation is very easy.
You can provide log files from Apache, Nginx, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, or many others to create metrics and statistics.
Can be installed using apt but is recommended using the source code to get a more updated version.
Link of installation documentation here.
Can be dockerized to use easily in Kubernetes or other container orchestrators.</p>

This inevitably means that our brain needs to collect more and more information and we will not always be able to retain everything without forgetting other things.</p>
<p>That is why kb was created.</p>
<p>kb is a command line to create and read code fragments and short notes that explain the code, in this way a person can keep in kb his collection of knowledge about some technology that he needs to master like the serverless cli, aws cli, GCP cli, firebase cli, python, ruby, or even Linux / UNIX commands like the aforementioned pgrep, pkill, ps.</p>
<p>The user can create categories like ‘servers‘, ‘tools‘, ‘languages‘, ‘frameworks‘ to create an order and hierarchy of their knowledge.</p>

<p>In few words, this tool keeps in memory your navigation history and uses a ranking algorithm to help you to go back to a place just written the first letters of the directory.</p>
<p>So if you navigate to <code>/etc</code> <code>/nginx/sites-available</code> and then you go to <code>/home/documents/</code> but you want to move back to the first place you just need write  <code>z et</code> and the algorithm can know which <code>/etc/</code> match more than <code>/home/documents/</code> and they going to move you to that directory.
Now you can write less and be more intuitive.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>I grew up programming on my TV, with a Sinclair ZX81 followed by a ZX Spectum. Computers built into keyboards, that you can easily plug into a TV, are part of my DNA. So, given this, how could I resist buying the new <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/">Raspberry Pi 400</a>!?</p>

<p>The following are my initial thoughts on the hardware, and on using it for light weight development.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I like it :)</p>

<h2 id="tech-specs">Tech Specs</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 400 is, essentially, a Raspberry Pi 4 housed within a keyboard. You can read much better descriptions elseewhere, but the main points from the tech specs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.8GHz</li>
  <li>4GB LPDDR4-3200</li>
  <li>Dual-band (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz) IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac wireless LAN</li>
  <li>Bluetooth 5.0, BLE</li>
  <li>Gigabit Ethernet</li>
  <li>2 × USB 3.0</li>
  <li>1 × USB 2.0 ports</li>
  <li>Horizontal 40-pin GPIO header</li>
  <li>2 × micro HDMI ports (supports up to 4Kp60)</li>
  <li>MicroSD card slot for operating system and data storage</li>
  <li>79-key compact keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>(full specs can be found <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/specifications/">here</a>)</p>

<p>The 400 comes with a 16GB SD card pre-installed with Raspbian, and a host of apps (LibreOffice), dev tools (Geany, Mathematica, Scratch), utilities (Chromium, VLC Media Player), and games (Minecraft).</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions-on-the-hardware">First Impressions on the Hardware</h2>

<p>It was <em>very</em> easy to plug the 400 in and get it up and running. It’s a neat device, with a good collection of ports and connectors at the back. The keyboard is…ok. The device is £67 in the UK. I bought the kit (which includes a mouse, power supply, HDMI cable, and official guide) for £94. Given the price point the keyboard is absolutely fine, but it does feel a tiny bit “plasticy”.</p>

<p>The 400 doesn’t have an audio-out. Audio is delivered via the HDMI output. For me, that’s a problem because my monitor doesn’t have speakers. It’s not a BIG problem, but it’s something I hadn’t considered.</p>

<p>The other thing the 400 doesn’t have is the connector for the Raspberry Pi camera module. Again, this isn’t a big deal for me but if you were expecting to build any camera projects then the 400 isn’t the right choice.</p>

<p>The 400has the GPIO header at the back, so with a ribbon cable you can build electronics projects very easily. I have an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2028">Adafruit T-Cobbler Plus</a> which makes it very easy to connect the 400 to a breadboard and build…stuff!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/gpio.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>The 400 starts up quickly, and is very capable as a general purpose desktop device. I’ve spent most of today browsing the web on it, while also installing apps, running docker containers, and building code, and it’s felt fast/snappy pretty much most of the time.</p>

<p>Overall, the hardware is pretty good and I love the form factor. I can see schools/code clubs purchasing these devices and using the in their computing labs.</p>

<h2 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h2>

<p>I’ve spent the day setting my Raspberry Pi 400 up, and I’m pretty impressed. My setup has included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up Chromium, and installed the <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password extension</a></li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> using <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-visual-studio-code/">these instructions</a></li>
  <li>Installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">VS Code Remote Containers extension</a> so that I can use Docker dev containers to develop code within</li>
</ul>

<p>On the whole, this setup was easy. So easy it was almost boring! I had a couple of issues, but on the whole it was very easy to set my Raspberry Pi 400 up so that I can write code, use Docker, and push changes to GitHub. For example, I’m currently writing this blog post within VS Code, building it using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> within a Docker container.</p>

<p>The only issue that I hit is the ARM support for various Docker images. The default Ruby dev container image wouldn’t build because it had some dependencies that didn’t have ARM variants. In the end I took the Ruby 2.7 docker image as a base, and copy/pasted into my own <code>Dockerfile</code> the parts of the defintion I needed (removing Node, Zsh, Oh my Zsh and a few other things). I’m not sure exactly what it was that was failng to build, so I need to go back and work it out, but it’s worth remembering that if the Rasberry Pi is ARM based, and not all development tools have ARM builds.</p>

<p>Having installed tools, and played around, I’ve built some very basic Rust code (with build times comparible to my MacBook!), I’ve written some <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">GPIOZero</a> based Python 3 code (controlling butons and LEDs), and I’ve set up a Jekyll/Ruby dev container and built/updated my blog.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I own several Raspberry Pi computers (1, 2 and 3). Most of them are the Model B format, but I have couple of Zeros too. All of them sit in a box, unused. I’ve played with them, then put them away. Part of that is because the performance hasn’t been that great, but the form factor is a major factor. It feels like the Raspberry Pi 400 has the power I need (for casual projects), and comes in a form factor that I can happily leave plugged in on my desk.</p>

<p>On top of that…it gives me a massive nostalgia rush using it!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/desktop.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>In the picture below I have two instances of VS Code (both running dev containers), plus I’m browsing. It takes it all in its stride.</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/pi-400-desktop.png" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>I’ve not tried building anything huge…but that’s not what it’s for. It’s for having fun…</p>

<p>…and I’m <strong>absolutely having fun</strong>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

                <div>
                    <p>Wars can be fought in the real world but there is also a virtual battlefield - and it is just as harmful. The <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity">Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</a> is the latest attempt to access people's encrypted data and it serves as another reinforcement.</p><blockquote>This type of “warrant-proof” encryption adds little to the security of the communications of the ordinary user, but it is a serious benefit for those who use the internet for illicit purposes.</blockquote><p>This statement is plainly false. Encryption has as much benefit, if not more, for ordinary users. Encryption is used in every website that has the padlock sign (HTTP<strong>S</strong>), in every iPhone app since 2016, in every Android app since 2018 and in almost every modern application - and for good reason. Encryption helps protect sensitive information (such as that shared with your bank, or any time you use a password on a website). It may also help protect files which are not in use (at rest), or in the event the server is accessed by an unauthorised person (such as a criminal attempting to siphon off important data).</p><p>In 2016, Bruce Schneier wrote an article on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2016/04/the_value_of_encrypt.html">the value of encryption</a> clearly outlining why encryption is needed. Schneier went on to say that when the US Government was <a href="https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/">previously</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">fighting cryptography</a>, he wondered if they were aware how much they relied on it themselves. No-one is above the law, so if you ban strong encryption, the FBI should not use it either. Attorney General Barr, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/23/us_encryption_backdoor/">gives the impression</a> that the government, along with certain large companies, should have an exception to the law. Barr recognises that there are some things that are secret, but he doesn't recognise that regular citizens might also want to enjoy privacy as well.</p><blockquote>“We are not talking about protecting the nation’s nuclear launch codes,” Barr told the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University.</blockquote><blockquote>“Nor are we necessarily talking about the customized encryption used by large business enterprises to protect their operations. We are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, email, and voice and data applications."</blockquote><p>Somehow, because your average Joe does not have government level secrets, he is no longer entitled to encryption. We are all humans, and we all need privacy. By taking away encryption, you are taking away privacy online.</p><p>This act is aimed at Section 230, which ensures that no interactive computer service provider shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of content published by their users - an essential part of the survival of all search engines, social media platforms and video sharing sites. Without it, the internet would become a self-censored platform – one that is more concerned with fending off lawsuits than providing a medium for ideas and innovation as it originally was.</p><p>It is easy to sympathise with an act that is being pushed through on the grounds that terrorists, paedophiles and drug-dealers all use encryption. Reading the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html">New York Times</a>' <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/podcasts/the-daily/child-sex-abuse.html">reporting</a> on online images of &nbsp;sexual abuse would leave some wondering why this sort of Act has not been passed already. Equally, if no-one had encryption then it would certainly be easier to catch above mentioned crooks and fellons.</p><p>Encryption, however, did not create these problems; these crimes were around long before it came into existence. In addition, those who partake in illicit activity will always find loopholes and ways to do so, such as using products or encryption tools that don't have backdoors. Criminals do not obey laws by definition. Furthermore, many innocent people use similar encryption to these criminals, but only to protect privacy, not hide any illegalities and yet they could still be subject to some kind of prosecution. It is assumed the use or possession of non-backdoored software would also become an offence if too many people used that instead. Statistically, it's agreed there are many more innocent people in society than criminals; those innocent people would be punished as a result of the bad actions of a few.</p><p>It is not feasible for a government to make a law of this sort that can apply outside of it's own country. Governments around the world would almost certainly disagree on which countries should be allowed access to the backdoor. As a result, this backdoor would most certainly lead to every unauthorised party having access, as the key to decrypt the data would be discovered by third parties, this would result in completely broken encryption for all. In federated networks, such as Matrix, it's not even possible to add a backdoor to every homeserver. Federation decentralises trust, which means that the person deploying the server isn't necessarily the same entity who makes the client software or server software. Matrix has even written a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">thorough article</a> on how to combat this sort of abuse without backdoors. </p><p>Weakening encryption will only result in criminals using strong encryption anyway, without fighting any of the problems that the the law claims to solve. There is no easy solution, and it is down to politicians to provide one. Yes, encryption can be used by people with bad intentions, but it is also used by so many ordinary people who would never think to use it in a malicious way. Nearly every tool in life can be used for nefarious purposes, but does not mean it should be unavailable for legitimate non-criminal uses. You could hit someone with a hammer, but it doesn't mean hammers should be made out of foam, because if they were, people would just use knives instead. Weakening encryption will not solve these issues, and that's probably because they were not the the focus of the Act. Instead, it seems that this law seeks to criminalises strong encryption that does not have backdoors, even though the government knows full well that this will not stop criminals. The US Government should stop devising new ways to breach its citizens privacy, and focus on combating the issues that this Act fails to.</p><p>In 1988, Timothy May <a href="https://activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html">predicted</a> that “the State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of [encryption], citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration”. He was spot on.</p><p><em>Cover artwork by <a href="https://setofprinciples.com/">Zan</a></em></p>

  <blockquote>
<p>Written below are some opinions and rationalizations for them. I have come to these opinions by interviewing and working with people for years. However strongly I feel about them, they can still be wrong. If you have feedback for these, please do contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/channikhabra/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/channikhabra">Twitter</a>. All kind of feedback is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>From “Functional programmer” I mean a programmer familiar with concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>.</p>
<p>A good teammate is someone:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Who takes care of themselves</strong>. They invest in themselves. They care about their software as a craft, as something more than just cramming a whole bunch of frameworks and libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Who take care of their teammates</strong>.
<ul>
<li>They help their teammates grow, by mentoring and/or by serving as an example</li>
<li>They are empathetic towards other developers. This is most visible in kind of code a person writes. An empathetic developer writes code for other people.
<ul>
<li>They give preference to readability of code over micro-optimizations that make them feel clever</li>
<li>They write modular code with independent modules each of which do one thing well. And are easily composed to build more complex functionality.</li>
<li>They write clean, predictable and intuitive APIs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>FP is steadily gaining popularity, but it is still not popular enough to breach the talent pool I get to interview from. Familiarity with FP is a very good indication that the person invest in themselves. And they do that in a manner which goes beyond just increasing the number of “frameworks” they have built a Todo App in.</p>
<p>Developer empathy is surprisingly rare. In almost a decade of writing code, I have met so few developers who really give a fuck that someone else will also read their abomination. Most software is written in vacuum. Familiarity with FP don’t fix that magically.</p>
<p>However there is another factor at play here. Ironically, as a side-effect of FP, code written in a functional manner is often a lot more readable than its imperative and OOP equivalents (Impromptu quiz: What’s so ironic about this statement?). Not only is functional code itself naturally declarative, an FP person is more likely to wtf when they see unreadable code in PR reviews.</p>
<p>Basic principles of FP also make for great advice for inexperienced developers. Good software architecture is hard to learn, it is a lot harder to teach. You need a mind capable of holding large amounts of complex code before the fancy design patterns even start making sense. In comparison, “pure functions + composition” and you are good to go. That is it. That is all you need to know to get started with writing modular, testable, simple code; which is easy to write and easier to maintain. As a mere side effect of avoiding side effects, you write naturally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> (in spirit) code.</p>
<p>FP is not a silver bullet, but looking for functional programmers skew the universe in your favor a little. You are a lot more likely to get good people among functional programmers.</p>

November 6, 2020 | https://blog.blazeinfosec.com/attack-of-the-clones-github-desktop-remote-code-execution/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.blazeinfosec.com/attack-of-the-clones-github-desktop-remote-code-execution/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>This post is a rather unusual story of a vulnerability that could be leveraged as a supply chain attack and used to attack millions of software developers around the world. It is also a tale of a bug collision that paid a bounty to one reporter and assigned the CVE to another!</p>
<p>The main focus of this blog post is GitHub Desktop. Other Git clients such as GitKraken, Git-Tower and SourceTree were also found to be vulnerable, however these have different exploitation scenarios that require user interaction.</p>
<h4 id="briefdescriptionoftheissue">Brief description of the issue</h4>
<p>As part of GitHub Desktop's default repository cloning process, among other actions it calls the executable git-lfs.</p>
<p>From git-lfs's official page "Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise."</p>
<p>git-lfs is then called on the current cloned repository, already present in disk.</p>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered when cloning a repository with a especially crafted file in the root directory. Upon cloning such malicious repository, code execution is achieved with the same privileges as the affected user running GitHub Desktop.</p>
<p>When inspecting the desktop application under Proccess Monitor, it was noticed several actions of git-lfs called a git executable from inside the newly cloned repository.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.blazeinfosec.com/content/images/2020/11/procmon.PNG" alt="procmon"></p>
<p>By placing a malicious git in the root of the malicious repo, a user that clones it will have the malicious git executed by git-lfs, all of this behind the scenes and transparent to the user.</p>
<p>The cloning process happens normally and there is no visual indication that a malicious binary was ran instead of the original git executable.</p>
<h4 id="rootcauseanalysis">Root cause analysis</h4>
<p>We attempted to understand the root cause of this vulnerability by reading git-lfs's code. The authors of this write-up tried to put together as much information as possible in order to understand the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/command_clone.go">https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/command_clone.go</a></p>
<p>From line 23:</p>
<pre><code>func cloneCommand(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
	requireGitVersion()

	if git.IsGitVersionAtLeast("2.15.0") {
		msg := []string{
			"WARNING: 'git lfs clone' is deprecated and will not be updated",
			"          with new flags from 'git clone'",
			"",
			"'git clone' has been updated in upstream Git to have comparable",
			"speeds to 'git lfs clone'.",
		}

		fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, strings.Join(msg, "\n"))
	}
</code></pre>
<p>The function above seems to be called when a clone action takes place. Right in the beginning the function calls requireGitVersion() and then checks whether the version is at least 2.15.0.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/commands.go">https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/commands/commands.go</a></p>
<p>Line 537:</p>
<pre><code>func requireGitVersion() {
	minimumGit := "1.8.2"

	if !git.IsGitVersionAtLeast(minimumGit) {
		gitver, err := git.Version()
		if err != nil {
			Exit("Error getting git version: %s", err)
		}
		Exit("git version &gt;= %s is required for Git LFS, your version: %s", minimumGit, gitver)
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>It calls !git.IsGitVersionAtLeast(minimumGit) which can be found in <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/git/version.go">https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/git/version.go</a></p>
<p>From line 28:</p>
<pre><code>func IsGitVersionAtLeast(ver string) bool {
	gitver, err := Version()
	if err != nil {
		tracerx.Printf("Error getting git version: %v", err)
		return false
	}
	return IsVersionAtLeast(gitver, ver)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Version() can be found in the same file version.go on line 18:</p>
<pre><code>func Version() (string, error) {
	gitVersionOnce.Do(func() {
		gitVersion, gitVersionErr =
			subprocess.SimpleExec("git", "version")
	})
	return gitVersion, gitVersionErr
}
</code></pre>
<p>The function calling chain is the following:<br>
cloneCommand() -&gt; requireGitVersion() -&gt; IsGitVersionAtLeast() -&gt; Version()</p>
<p>We can see that in line 21 in version.go, there is inside the function Version() a call to subprocess.SimpleExec() - it executes the git binary with the argument "version".</p>
<p>There is an implicit assumption from git-lfs that by executing an external binary, the operating system will first look it up from the system's PATH environment variable. This is the true root cause of the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Calling the subprocess 'git' works as intended in GitHub Desktop for MacOS. In Windows, however, the search order favors the current directory first and only then it searches in the order specified in PATH.</p>
<h4 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h4>
<p>By copying calc.exe, renaming it to git.exe and committing/pushing it into the root of the repository, the attacker sets up the crafted repository that will be used to later exploit users.</p>
<p>When a developer clones this repository using GitHub Desktop for Windows, its subcomponent git-lfs will work on the cloned folder as its current directory, meaning all subsequent calls to the binary 'git' will be instead calling the malicious git.exe not the one present in the PATH.</p>

<section>
	<h2>WorldWideWeb</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The idea of hypertext preceded the World Wide Web by decades. But nearly all hypertext systems worked on local files. Tim Berners-Lee wanted to create a system that would work across networks so that people could link from a file on one machine to another file on another machine.</p>
		<p>WorldWideWeb wasn't just a programme for browsing files. It was a browser and editor. The introductory text reads:</p>
		<blockquote>HyperMedia Browser/Editor, An excercise in global information availability by Tim Berners-Lee</blockquote>
		<p>Today it's hard to imagine that web browsers might also be used to create web pages. It turned out that people were quite happy to write HTML by hand—something that Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues never expected. They thought that some kind of user interface would be needed for making web pages and links. That's what the WorldWideWeb browser provided. You could open a document in one window and "mark" it. Then, in a document in another window, you could create a link to the marked page.</p>
		<p>You'll notice as you use the WorldWideWeb browser that you need to double-click links to open them. That's because a single click was used for editing.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Browsing</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The user interface of the WorldWideWeb browser somewhat blurred the lines between documents on your own computer and documents out on the network. To "browse" directly to a document out on the network, you need to know its URL. But you can't simply type that URL into an address bar; there is no address bar. Instead you have to follow a sequence of steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Document".</li>
			<li>Now from the newly-opened "Document" menu, select "Open from full document reference".</li>
			<li>Type the URL into the field marked "reference".</li>
			<li>Press the "Open" button</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a web-based document (or web page, as we would say today) open in WorldWideWeb, you can navigate by double-clicking on links. Every link you double-click will open in a new window.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Linking</h2>
	<div>
		<p>At its heart, WorldWideWeb is a word processor …but with links. And just as you <em>can</em> use a word processor purely for reading documents, the real fun comes when you write your own. Especially when you throw hyperlinks into the mix.</p>
		<p>To create a document:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "New File..."</li>
			<li>Type the name of the file you want to create e.g. example.html</li>
			<li>In the boilerplate document, click on the heading to edit. Same with the text.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a document written, it's time to turn from regular text into <em>hyper</em>text:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Links"</li>
			<li>To link to another document, you need to have that other document open in another window. Click on its title bar to focus it.</li>
			<li>With that document in focus, select "Mark all" from the "Links" menu.</li>
			<li>Now switch back to your example.html document and highlight the text you want to be a link.</li>
			<li>From the "Links" menu, select "Link to marked".</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can even save your new document on to your hard drive. Click on "Save a copy offline" under the "Documents" menu.</p>
		<p>Once you've downloaded the file to your computer, you can open it up with a text editor to see what the HTML would have looked like.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<div>
	<p>To edit any document, whether it's one you created, or a page on the world wide web:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the text you want edit.</li>
		<li>Edit it.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's it.</p>
	<p>If you want to keep a copy of the edited document, choose "Save a copy offline" from the "Documents" menu.</p>
	</div>

		<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>Work on your network. It will help you in numerous ways as you progress in your career. Whatever you are looking for: a new job, to hire someone, to get a mentor, to learn about a new technology, having a list of people that you know and/or have worked with that you can reach out to will help you accomplish your goals.</p>
<p>But it can be tough, especially if you are awkward around people. I am awkward around people and learned how to be less awkward. My main technique is to both give and ask for a “hook” in any conversation I start.</p>
<p>Here’s a typical “networking” conversation of which I’ve had many:</p>
<p>Dan: Hi, I’m Dan.</p>
<p>Jan: Hi, I’m Jan.</p>
<p>Dan: Where do you work?</p>
<p>Jan: I work at Company X. Where do you work?</p>
<p>Dan: Company Y.</p>
<p>&lt;crickets&gt;</p>
<p>Compare that with this conversation:</p>
<p>Dan: Hi, I’m Dan.</p>
<p>Jan: Hi, I’m Jan.</p>
<p>Dan: Where do you work?</p>
<p>Jan: I work at Company X. Where do you work?</p>
<p>Dan: Company Y. We recently launched website Z and are evaluating technology ABC. What has your company recently rolled out?</p>
<p>See the difference? Dan has provided Jan with two avenues for conversation–one is asking further about technology ABC or website Z, and the other is talking about Company X. Jan can decide where to take the conversation, but Dan has provided the start of it.</p>
<p>Learning this trick, which comes naturally to many many people, changed the way I network. Another thing that mattered was my realization that everyone, every single person, has an interesting story or anecdote to tell, and that I can learn something. That understanding has made conversation much more fun.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-crop.jpg" width="180">
One of the most delightful parts of being a software engineer and hardware
tinkerer is having the ability to solve my own specific (and often niche)
problems. In this post, the particular problem I’ll be solving is the burning
need to know what is currently playing on <a href="https://www.wqxr.org/">WQXR</a>, NYC’s classical radio station.</p>

<p>A typical Saturday for me looks like this: I wake up and make a coffee, bring
it to the couch in the living room, pick up my knitting, and turn on the radio. Maybe midway through the morning
a halfway-familiar piece comes on, but I’ve left my phone in the other room and won’t be
able to go check the WQXR website without disentangling myself from my
knitting and missing a bit of the piece that has captured my attention.</p>

<p>Or how about a weekday: I’m working on a project, elbows deep in the code, with the WQXR livestream open in one of my million
browser tabs. I feel a glimmer of recognition, but I’m fully focused on my
work and don’t want to break my concentration to go hunt down the livestream
player and find out what it is.</p>

<p>To solve this particular problem, I needed two things: a way to find out what
was on the radio, and a place to display it.</p>

<p>There are a couple of different ways you could find out what’s playing,
including music identification services like Shazam. But those rely on already
having a recording in their database to match against, and I’m listening to
classical music where I could be hearing any one of dozens of different
recordings (and even live performances) for any given piece, making it
unlikely that such a service would be able to find a match. So I started with
the source I was already using to get this information: the WQXR website.</p>

<p>If you leave the website open long enough, you’ll notice that it automatically
updates to reflect what’s currently playing. This was great news for me,
because it meant that somewhere in the page a script is periodically making
ajax requests to get that information, requests that I could also make myself.
To find out what these requests were, I eavesdropped on my browser’s network
calls using the developer console.</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/wqxr-network.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>There are two calls being made here, one to an endpoint called streams,
and one to something very promisingly named <code>whats_on</code>. Making a request to
that second endpoint, we get a beautiful json response containing information
about what’s playing on New York Public Radio’s various livestreams. Great!
This is exactly what I need to satisfy the first piece of this project.</p>

<p>(I honestly can’t remember how I figured this out, but you can append the call
letters for the particular station you’re interested in to the URI to just get
information for that stream, but the full response would also have worked just
fine.)</p>

<p>Okay, cool, so I have the data. How do I get this information in front of my
eyeballs when I’m listening to the radio?</p>

<p>You already know from the teaser photo at the top of the post that
I ultimately put it on my mantel, but I took an iterative approach to getting
there.</p>

<p>I use tmux to manage my terminal sessions, and it occurred to me that the
status bar, always there along the bottom of my terminal, might be a nice
place to have information about what’s currently playing. I wrote some
lightweight python classes for fetching and parsing the radio’s API response,
and a tiny script, <code>tmux.py</code> that outputs the information in the format I want for this
purpose.</p>

<p>Adding something to the tmux status bar is just a matter of adding a couple of
lines to <code>.tmux.conf</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>set</span> <span>-g</span> status-right-length 200
<span>set</span> <span>-g</span> status-right <span>'#[bg=#d7ff5f] #(python3
/home/sarabee/development/nowplaying/tmux.py)  |  [%H:%M] '</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This overwrote the clock that was there by default, so I added one back in. By
default, scripts run in <code>.tmux.conf</code> are executed once every 15 seconds, which
was more than fast enough for my purpose. My status bar then looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/now-playing.jpg"></p>

<p>This fixed the problem of not wanting to leave my terminal to find out what
I’m listening to, but what about when I’m in the living room? I knew I wanted
a display, that I wanted it to update automatically, like the tmux status bar,
that I wanted it to be constantly running, like an indoor thermometer readout,
and that I wanted it to be readable from any position in the room, with good
view angles and readability under a variety of lighting conditions.  This all
sounded to me like the <em>perfect</em> excuse to work with e-paper.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.pimoroni.com/">Pimoroni</a> was having a sale, so I picked up two e-ink displays: the smaller inkypHAT, and the
larger inkywHAT. I also got a couple of Raspberry Pi Zero Ws to pop them on
top of (quick aside: these things cost $10 and have wifi and bluetooth, wowww).</p>

<p>Starting with the inkypHAT and the code I’d already written for handling radio
data, I prototyped my idea, creating a tiny display that sits on top of my
monitor. I set the Pi Zeroes up the way I set up my larger Raspberry Pi 3,
with Raspbian Lite. Without worrying too much about styling the display
aesthetically, I learned how to work with the
<a href="https://github.com/pimoroni/inky">Inky</a> and
<a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a> libraries and
wrote a script to get the composer and title chopped up to fit across multiple
lines on the screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/wqxr-phat.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>I have it running once a minute on a cron, and to avoid refreshing the e-ink
display unnecessarily, I keep the last piece written to the display in memory and
update only if I’ve gotten something new back from WQXR.</p>

<p>Reworking this script for the larger inkywHAT display wasn’t difficult; it
mostly involved tweaking font size to take advantage of the larger screen. But
since this is meant to live on my mantel and be highly visible in my living
room, I wanted to make it look a bit nicer than just throwing the text on
there. I found a clip-art scrollwork frame, and using only the MacOS Preview
app and ImageMagick, got it into the right size and format
for the e-ink display.</p>

<p>In Preview, I grabbed a corner of the frame and pasted it in again three more
times, rotated 90 degrees each time, and carefully bumped each corner around
until they were lined up and could be scaled down reasonably to the right
dimensions (400x300px). Even though the image appeared to be entirely black
and white, a closer look shows this wasn’t true at all! It’s actually full of
many different shades of gray:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-corner.png" width="300"></p>

<p>To get the image into the right format and flatten it down to just two colors,
I used the <a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php">ImageMagick command-line
tools</a>. While <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/quantize/#two_color">this
extremely thorough page</a> in the IM docs goes pretty far in-depth with the
various ways you can convert an image to black and white, I ultimately ended
up going with:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">magick input.png <span>-colorspace</span> gray <span>-colors</span> 2 <span>-normalize</span> PNG8:output.png</code></pre></figure>

<p>Which produces a frame that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-frame.png"></p>

<p>It’s a little rough when you see it on a relatively high resolution monitor, but looks great on the 400x300 e-ink
display! After that, adding the text was pretty straightforward;
earlier when only displaying text, I was still actually using Pillow to create an empty
image in the correct dimensions that I drew the text onto:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"P"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>WIDTH</span><span>,</span> <span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>HEIGHT</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To use the frame, I simply started with the frame image instead:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>os</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>current_dir</span><span>,</span>
<span>"whatnow.png"</span><span>)).</span><span>resize</span><span>(</span><span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>resolution</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The last little bit of clean-up work involved getting the text centered in the
frame, and setting the margins in my script so that the line breaks were
a comfortable distance from its edges.</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-closeup.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>I’m happy with where this project is at; the text is clear and legible from
anywhere in my living room, and my Saturday morning listening experience has
been greatly improved. Eventually, it’ll get custom wooden housing, which will
be its own post, I’m sure! Feel free to dig around in <a href="https://github.com/SaraBee/nowplaying">the project’s repo on
GitHub</a> to get an even better idea of how this all works.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <span>Technical Concept</span> </p> <h2> How does GAIA-X work? </h2> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Federated services provide value if they are based on common standards which ensure transparency and interoperability. GAIA-X addresses this requirement by aligning network and interconnection providers, Cloud Solution Providers (CSP), High Performance Computing (HPC) as well as sector specific clouds and edge systems. Here, mechanisms are developed to find, combine and connect services from participating providers in order to enable a user-friendly infrastructure ecosystem. GAIA-X identifies the minimum technical requirements and services necessary to operate the federated GAIA-X Ecosystem. The development of these services will follow the principles of Security by Design and also include the concept of Privacy by Design in order to ensure highest security requirements and privacy protection.</p> <p>Technical implementation of these Federation Services will focus on the following areas:</p> <ul><li>the implementation of secure federated identity and trust mechanisms (security and privacy by design);</li><li>sovereign data services which ensure the identity of source and receiver of data and which ensure the access and usage rights towards the data;</li><li>easy access to the available providers, nodes and services. Data will be provided through federated catalogues; </li><li>the integration of existing standards to ensure interoperability and portability across infrastructure, applications and data; </li><li>the establishment of a compliance framework and Certification and Accreditation services; and</li><li>the contribution of a modular compilation of open source software and standards to support providers in delivering a secure, federated and interoperable infrastructure.</li></ul> <p>The initial set of federation services will be expanded. The roadmap is aligned with the development of ecosystem participants’ requirements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="id1839168" tabindex="-1"> <div> <div> <p> <span>GAIA-X in practice</span> </p> <h2> Use Cases: GAIA-X from the user perspective </h2> </div> <p>GAIA-X gives users access to a broad and highly useful range of specialised products and services from cloud providers, thus enabling the use of tailored solutions. In this context, GAIA-X offers full transparency through the self-description, provides certified data protection and supplies regulatory criteria for the products and services offered.</p>  </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Clear conditions for participation in GAIA-X and for collaboration, and common rules for cross-company authentication and access management will strengthen the underlying level of trust, bring down the obstacles to participation and reduce the amount of work involved in bilateral coordination between individual users.</p> <p>A further important added benefit of GAIA-X is the guarantee of data sovereignty: Each user decides for herself where her data is stored, as well as who may process it and for what purpose, based on the user’s own data classification. In that sense GAIA-X enables modular solutions. Users can also access AI applications and data pools via the trustworthy data infrastructure. Based on standardisation rules and the different options for managing and controlling the transfer of data, data can be exchanged between the companies, linked with other data, processed, evaluated, and monetised in value creation networks. The opportunities of data and service sharing can promote innovations, exploit synergies and enable new business models to be developed and scaled up. </p> <p>The aim of Workstream 1 ‘User ecosystems and requirements’ is to achieve the stated added benefits through a broad and sustained mobilisation of the user and demand perspective. This occurs through continual identification, integration, development and implementation of domain-specific use cases, which illustrate the need for and the added benefit of a sovereign European data infrastructure. The work also focuses on defining domain-specific and cross-domain requirements. These form the foundation for the growth of data infrastructures.</p> <p>In the meantime, more than 40 use cases have been submitted in eight domains (‘Industry 4.0/SME’, ‘Health’, ‘Finance’, ‘Public Sector’, ‘Smart Living’, ‘Energy’, ‘Mobility’ and ‘Agriculture’). They come from various companies and organisations from European countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. On the one hand, they illustrate need for and the added benefit of GAIA-X. On the other hand, they each represent a domain and serve as basis to identify and validate domain-specific and cross-domain requirements and to allow these to be incorporated into the development of GAIA-X.</p> <p>All project participants are invited to participate in Workstream 1 ‘User Ecosystems and Requirements’: Both by submitting new use cases and by active and …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

            <h2>By Bertrand Russell</h2>
            <p>[Originally published in: <strong><cite>The Minority of One</cite>, 6 September 1964, pp.6–8.</strong>]</p>
            <p>The official version of the <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/" title="John F. Kennedy assassination">assassination of President Kennedy</a> has been so riddled with contradictions that it is been abandoned and rewritten no less than three times. Blatant fabrications have received very widespread <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/the-media-and-the-jfk-assassination" title="Media coverage of the JFK assassination">coverage by the mass media</a>, but denials of these same lies have gone unpublished. Photographs, evidence and affidavits have been doctored out of recognition. Some of the most important aspects of <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/how-did-oswald-kill-kennedy" title="The case against Lee Harvey Oswald">the case against Lee Harvey Oswald</a> have been completely blacked out. Meanwhile, the F.B.I., the police and the Secret Service have tried to silence key witnesses or instruct them what evidence to give. Others involved have disappeared or died in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
            <p>It is facts such as these that demand attention, and which the <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/warren-commission-jfk-assassination" title="The Warren Commission's investigation of the JFK assassination">Warren Commission</a> should have regarded as vital. Although I am writing before the publication of the Warren Commission’s report, leaks to the press have made much of its contents predictable. Because of the high office of its members and the fact of its establishment by President Johnson, the Commission has been widely regarded as a body of holy men appointed to pronounce the truth. An impartial examination of the composition and conduct of the Commission suggests quite otherwise.</p>
            <h2>1: Membership of the Warren Commission</h2>
            <p>The Warren Commission has been utterly unrepresentative of the American people. It consisted of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>two Democrats, <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/richard-russell-warren-report" title="Senator Richard Russell's objection to the Warren Report">Senator Russell of Georgia</a> and Congressman Boggs of Louisiana, both of whose racist views have brought shame on the United States;</li>
                <li>two Republicans, Senator Cooper of Kentucky and Congressman Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, the latter of whom is a leader of his local Goldwater movement and an associate of the F.B.I.;</li>
                <li>Allen Dulles, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency,</li>
                <li>and Mr. McCloy, who has been referred to as the spokesman for the business community.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Leadership of the filibuster in the Senate against the Civil Rights Bill prevented Senator Russell from attending hearings during the period. The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Earl Warren, who rightly commands respect, was finally persuaded, much against his will, to preside over the Commission, and it was his involvement above all else that helped lend the Commission an aura of legality and authority. Yet many of its members were also members of those very groups which have done so much to distort and suppress the facts about the assassination. Because of their connection with the Government, not one member would have been permitted under U.S. law to serve on a jury <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/lee-harvey-oswald-fair-trial" title="Did Lee Harvey Oswald get a fair trial?">had Oswald faced trial</a>. It is small wonder that the Chief Justice himself remarked that the release of some of the Commission’s information “might not be in your lifetime.” Here, then, is my first question: <strong>Why were all the members of the Warren Commission closely connected with the U.S. Government?</strong></p>
            <h2>2 and 3: Conduct and Official Secrecy</h2>
            <p>If the composition of the Commission was suspect, its conduct confirmed one’s worst fears. No counsel was permitted to act for Oswald, so that cross–examination was barred. Later, under pressure, the Commission appointed the President of the American Bar Association, Walter Craig, one of the supporters of the Goldwater movement in Arizona, to represent Oswald. To my knowledge, he did not attend hearings, but satisfied himself with representation by observers.</p>
            <p>In the name of national security, the Commission’s hearings were held in secret, thereby continuing the policy which has marked the entire course of the case. This prompts my second question: <strong>If, as we are told, Oswald was the lone assassin, where is the issue of national security?</strong> Indeed, precisely the same question must be put here as was posed in France during the Dreyfus case: <strong>If the Government is so certain of its case, why has it conducted all its inquiries in the strictest secrecy?</strong></p>
            <h2>4: The Crucial Question Was Not Asked</h2>
            <p>At the outset the Commission appointed six panels through which it would conduct its enquiry. They considered:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What did Oswald do on November 22, 1963?</li>
                <li>What was Oswald’s background?</li>
                <li>What did Oswald do in the U.S. Marine Corps, and in the Soviet Union?</li>
                <li>How did Ruby kill Oswald?</li>
                <li>What is Ruby’s background?</li>
                <li>What efforts were taken to protect the President on November 22?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This raises my fourth question: <strong>Why did the Warren Commission not establish a panel to deal with the question of who killed President Kennedy?</strong></p>
            <h2>5: Challenging the Commission</h2>
            <p>All the evidence given to the Commission has been classified “Top Secret,” including even a request that hearings be held in public. Despite this the Commission itself leaked much of the evidence to the press, though only if the evidence  tended to prove Oswald the lone assassin. Thus, Chief Justice Warren held a press conference after Oswald’s wife, Marina, had testified. He said that she believed her husband was the assassin. Before Oswald’s brother Robert testified, he gained the Commission’s agreement not to comment on what he said. After he had testified for two days, the newspapers were full of stories that “a member of the Commission” had told the press that Robert Oswald had just testified that he believed that his brother was an agent of the Soviet Union. Robert Oswald was outraged by this, and he said that he could not remain silent while lies were told about his testimony. He had never said this and he had never believed it. All that he had told the Commission was that he believed his brother was innocent and was in no way involved in the assassination.</p>
            <p>The methods adopted by the Commission have indeed been deplorable, but it is important to challenge the entire role of the Warren Commission. It stated that it would not conduct its own investigation, but rely instead on the existing governmental agencies — the F.B.I., the Secret Service and the Dallas police. Confidence in the Warren Commission thus presupposes confidence in these three institutions. <strong>Why have so many liberals abandoned their own responsibility to a Commission whose circumstances they refuse to examine?</strong></p>
            <h2>6: Oswald the Subversive</h2>
            <p>It is known that the strictest and most elaborate security precautions ever taken for a President of the United States were ordered for November 22 in Dallas. The city had a reputation for violence and was the home of some of the most extreme right–wing fanatics in America. Mr. and Mrs. Lyndon Johnson had been assailed there in 1960 when he was a candidate for the Vice–Presidency. Adlai Stevenson had been physically attacked when he spoke in the city only a month before Kennedy’s visit. On the morning of November 22, the <cite>Dallas Morning News</cite> carried a full–page advertisement <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/jfk-assassination-political-context" title="Political context of the JFK assassination">associating the President with Communism</a>. The city was covered with posters showing the President’s picture and headed “Wanted for Treason.” The Dallas list of subversives comprised 23 names, of which Oswald’s was the first. All of them were followed that day, except Oswald. <strong>Why did the authorities follow many persons as potential assassins and fail to observe Oswald’s entry into the book depository building while allegedly carrying a rifle over three feet long?</strong></p>
            <h2>7: The Route of the Motorcade</h2>
            <p>The President’s route for his drive through Dallas was widely known and was printed in the <cite>Dallas Morning News</cite> on November 22. At the last minute the Secret Service changed a small part of their plans so that the President left Main Street and turned into Houston and Elm Streets. This alteration took the President past the book depository building from which it is alleged that Oswald shot him. How Oswald is supposed to have known of this change has never been explained. <strong>Why was the President’s route changed at the last minute to take him past Oswald’s place of work?</strong></p>
            <h2>8: Changing the Evidence</h2>
            <p>After the assassination and Oswald’s arrest, judgment was pronounced swiftly: Oswald was the assassin, and he had acted alone. No attempt was made to arrest others, no road blocks were set up round the area, and every piece of evidence which tended to incriminate Oswald was announced to the press by the Dallas District Attorney, Mr. Wade. In such a way millions of people were prejudiced against Oswald before there was any opportunity for him to be brought to trial. The first theory announced by the authorities was that the President’s car was in Houston Street, approaching the book depository building, when Oswald opened fire. When available photographs and eyewitnesses had shown this to be quite untrue, the theory was abandoned and a new one formulated which placed the vehicle in its correct position. Meanwhile, however, D.A. Wade had announced that three days after Oswald’s room in Dallas had been searched, a map had been found there on which the book depository building had been circled and dotted lines drawn from the building to a vehicle on Houston Street, showing the <a href="http://22november1963.org.uk/single-bullet-theory-jfk-assassination" title="JFK assassination bullet trajectory">alleged bullet trajectory</a> had been planned in advance. After the first theory was proved false, the Associated Press put out the following story on November 27: “Dallas authorities announced today that there never was a map.”</p>
            <p>The second theory correctly placed the President’s car on Elm Street, 50 to 75 yards past the book depository, but had to contend with the difficulty that the President was shot from the front, in the throat. <strong>How did Oswald manage to shoot the President in the front from behind?</strong> The F.B.I. held a series of background briefing sessions for <cite>Life</cite> magazine, which in its issue of December 6 explained that the President had turned completely round just at the time he was shot. This too, was soon shown to be entirely false. It …</p></article></div></div>

		<p>Leaking data via out of unconnected devices (both connected and unconnected) is a very interesting topic, often called “soft tempest”. Often this is the realm of absurdly costly lab equipment, source code isn’t published etc.&nbsp; Here i would like to demonstrate this using the simplest equipment and means, and make it very easy to reproduce.</p>
<p>To transmit an elecromagnetic wave one needs to have a conductor driven by a high frequency source. Various busses are used: monitor cables, pci buses etc. Here i propose the use of ethernet.</p>
<p>An ethernet cable consists of 4 twisted pair lines with 100ohm impedance., which carries RF signals in the tens to hundredths MHz range. Any imperfections in the cable (asymetry etc) or in the interface will cause radio signals to be radiated.</p>
<p>Signals can be modulated using different methods. Here i will use morse code for simplicity. This also allows one to judge the signal to noise ratio by just listening. It is also possible to decode it by ear without additional devices if one knows morse code, if not there is a lot of software that can do it (although usually with much worse performance than an experienced human operator).</p>
<p>Transmission is implemented via very simple shell scripts. Only bash, ethtool and ping is needed. This enables the script to be used easily on embedded devices and other platforms where shipping binaries, installing a python environment etc might be a problem.</p>
<p>The proof-of-concept scripts are avaliable at <a href="https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify">https://github.com/sq5bpf/etherify</a></p>
<p><strong>Etherify 1 – transmitting by switching speed</strong></p>
<p>Various ethernet speeds have different modulation speeds, types and encoding. By switching between we can modulate the RF signal leaking from the wires.</p>
<p>10base-T uses manchester encoding with 10MHz symbol rate. This is used as the space signal (logical 0).</p>
<p>100base-T uses 4B5B encoding with NRZI at 125MHz symbol rate . This results in an easy to receive signal around 125MHz, this is used as the mark signal (logical 1).</p>
<p>Ethernet transmits an idle sequence when no packets are carried, so the signal is constant. No packets have to be transmitted for the signal to be present, on the speed of the interface has to be changed.</p>
<p>The transmission is implemented by a simple bash script, which sends the content of a short text file given as the argument, or “etherify demo” if none is given. The signal can be received as morse code around 125MHz, please use USB or CW mode in the receiver and use a narrow filter.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<p>Ensure that the two raspberry PIs are connected and that there is an ethernet link between them (signalled via the LEDs).</p>
<p>Run as root:</p>
<p>./etherify1</p>
<p>to transmit “etherify demo” or to exfiltrate the contents of /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>./etherify1 /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>Listen to the signal at 125MHz as described below.</p>

<p>The is decodable by ear with a simple Moxon directional antenna and a ham radio receiver (SDR could be used too).</p>
<p>This results in a strong signal at 15m distance:</p>
<p><iframe title="Etherify 1 at 15m" width="525" height="295" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MK15ofaWS_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The results at 100m distance (weak signal, please use headphones):</p>

<p>If in doubt let an experienced amateur radio operator decode it. I was not able to decode the signal at 100m with software.</p>
<p><strong>Etherify 2 – transmitting by sending data</strong></p>
<p>Sending a stream of data at 1Gbps also produces a detectable signal change at 125MHz. There may be other frequencies where the signals were more readable, but equipment was avaliable to receive at 125MHz. This probably works by loading the supply voltage when the packets are generated. A change of voltage probably changes the frequency of some clock slightly, thus generating FSK (F1A to be exact). Note that this doesn’t work with all hardware, which could be explained by the hypothesis about the frequency being modulated by the interface load.</p>
<p>A large volume of traffic represents a logical 1, while no traffic represents logical 0.</p>
<p>The transmission is implemented as a simple bash script, which sends the content of a short text file given as the argument, or “etherify demo” if none is given. The signal can be received as morse code around 125MHz, please use USB or CW mode in the receiver and use a narrow filter, also AM mode can be used.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<p>Ensure that the two raspberry PIs are connected and that there is an ethernet link between them (signalled via the LEDs). Set one raspberry PI to 192.168.1.1/24 and the other to 192.168.1.2/24 (the IP address can be changed in the etherify2 script). Ensure that the two raspberry PIs have IP connectivity and can ping each other, and that he interface rate is 1Gbps.</p>
<p>On the 192.168.1.2 raspberry PI run as root:</p>
<p>./etherify2</p>
<p>to transmit “etherify demo” or to exfiltrate the contents of /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>./etherify2 /tmp/secret.txt</p>
<p>Listen to the signal at 125MHz as described below.</p>
<p>The signal was decodable by ear at a distance of 30m with a simple Moxon directional antenna and a ham radio receiver.</p>
<p>This results in a strong signal at 15m distance:</p>
<p><iframe title="Etherify 2 at 15m" width="525" height="295" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zKCrdAY1oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And a readable signal at 30m:</p>

<p><strong>Equipment used and experiment description</strong></p>
<p>The RF radiation differs with different equipment and ethernet cable type being used. In order to make this demo reproducible i used two Raspberry PI 4, because it makes it easy for everyone to obtain the exact hardware that was used for this experiment. The raspberry PIs were connected using the ethernet cable supplied with the official Raspberry PI 4 starter kit. The stock Raspbian 10 operating system, which was supplied on the SD cards&nbsp; in the Starter Kit, was used. The devices were accessed via the serial console.</p>
<p>Power was provided via powerbanks. This was to avoid a connection to the mains voltage, because the powerline could be an unintentional radiator.</p>
<p>The Raspberry PIs were laid on a wooden bench about 1.4m from each other.</p>
<p>The experiment was conducted in an electromagnetically quiet area.</p>
<figure id="attachment_83" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lipkowski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rpi_etherify.jpg" alt="" width="843" height="355"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-83">Raspberry PI etherify demo</figcaption></figure>
<p>The signal was received via a Moxon antenna built for 125MHz and a Yaesu FT-817 transceiver with a 500Hz CW filter. Morse code was received and decoded by ear.</p>
<p>The experiments can be repeated with other devices with ethernet ports, for example two laptops, running any linux distribution and the required tools installed (most will come with them out of the box). The devices should be able to establish an ethernet link very quickly upon switching speed. An SDR receiver can be used for reception, with any antenna that can receive 125MHz (test first at close range). Morse code decoding can be done via software, for example fldigi [3].</p>
<p>The easiest receive setup would probably be gqrx with an rtl-sdr dongle, and fldigi for deciding the signals. If the signal is not decoded, it should be played to someone who can receive morse code by ear. Often such person will be able to decode it with ease.</p>
<p>The experiment should be first conducted in an electromagnetically quiet area, nearby ethernet networks will generate a lot of interference. If testing in the vicinity of other ethernet networks move the antenna closer, and reduce the receiver gain as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>How to replicate with your own hardware</strong></p>
<p>This can be replicated with other ethernet hardware, but with varying results.</p>
<p>The speed at which the ethernet hardware can renegotiate different speed sets the maximum speed of etherify 1 transmission. The&nbsp; ethernet port on the raspberry pi 4 can change speed very quickly. Other hardware will have a delay when chaging speed, for example on an Dell Latitude 5310 running with Debian bullseye (e1000e 3.2.6-k driver) it takes about 5 seconds to change speed. Lower modulation speed means lower datarate, but also better signal/noise when decoding.</p>
<p>The clock frequency modulation under packet load observed on the raspberry pi 4 (etherify 2) is specific to the raspberry pi 4. However loading the interface with packets often has effects on the electromagnetic spectrum on different hardware.</p>
<p>To check your hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at the spectrum around 125MHz</li>
<li>ensure that the interface is up</li>
<li>change speed with ethtool to 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps and observe the spectrum</li>
<li>try enabling/disabling eee (energy efficient ethernet), observe the effects at different speeds</li>
<li>try loading the interface with packets, observe the effects at different speeds</li>
<li>look at different ethtool settings and module options, especially those concerning power saving, carrier delay etc.</li>
<li>allow a few seconds after changing each parameter, on some interfaces it takes some time to change parameters</li>
<li>keep in mind that both ends of the ethernet link have an effect on he transmission. For experiments it’s best to use the same hardware on both ends.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find something interesting, then please send me an email.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The signal was shown to be decodable by ear at 100m for etherify 1, and 30m for etherify 2. This was done via a simple antenna and modest receiver. An antenna with more gain and better receiver would surely yield better range.</p>
<p>Nearby ethernet networks will generate a lot of interference at the same frequencies. The 125MHz frequency falls in the 108-137MHz air band, and one can expect interference from strong signals on nearby frequencies from nearby airplanes and airports. Therefore first tests should be conducted in areas with less interference, such as outdoor areas or underground parking lots.</p>
<p>The 125MHz frequency was chosen because of avaliable equipment. It would be hard for one person to hold and operate an antenna, laptop and SDR receiver. Other frequencies may be better.</p>
<p>Etherify 1 yields better range, however etherify 2 may enable to use a device located somewhere else in the network as the transmitter. This device may be physically closer to the receiver or may have greater leakage from the ethernet cable. Etherify 2 can be exploited as a non-root user by flooding the network with UDP datagrams or possibly other data.</p>
<p>The “software” side is intentionally a very primitive silly hack.</p>
<p>I haven’t done an extensive search for similar prior publications, but a few quick searches didn’t yield any results. If you know of any, please let me know.</p>
<p>If you cite this, …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div></div></div>

    <article>
        <h4>Published: November 6, 2020</h4>
        
<p>I’ve been studying quite a bit of modern C++ (using C++17) lately because of a side project and I have picked up some oddities and gotchas when it comes to pointers, specifically smart pointers.</p>
<p>I must note that I am by no means a seasoned C++ Engineer, nevertheless, I ran &amp; debugged all the examples below on Mac OS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>These are the helpers to instantiate a smart pointer.</p>
<p>Now consider the following example where we would just instantiate a base class <code>Animal</code>.
There are many ways to instantiate <code>Animal</code> as a <code>unique_ptr</code>. I listed the most common below.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;memory&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>class</span> <span>Animal</span> {
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>~</span>Animal() <span>=</span> <span>default</span>;
    <span>virtual</span> std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm an animal"</span>;
    }
};

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// using 'new' keyword
</span><span></span>    std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> buddyA(<span>new</span> Animal);
    std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> buddyB <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Animal);
    <span>auto</span>                    buddyC <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Animal);

    <span>// using make_unique helper
</span><span></span>    std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> charlieA <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>make_unique<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(Animal());
    <span>auto</span>                    charlieB <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>make_unique<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(Animal());
}
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, the last option where we instantiate <code>Animal</code> into <code>charlieB</code> variable looks pretty easy. The main advantage
of using <code>make_unique</code> is the lack of <code>new</code> keyword. That’s because <code>new</code> resonates manual memory management and modern C++ would
like you to avoid using it when using smart pointers, because the smart pointer will always call delete in its destructor.</p>
<p>Use make_unique they said, avoid using <code>new</code> they said, and so I did. Until I hit a roadblock when debugging a polymorphic object
that was supposed to be a derived class in runtime, but behaved as a base class.</p>
<p>Remember the Animal base class from above? We’ll add <code>Dog</code> class below that will inherit from <code>Animal</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm a dog"</span>;
    }
};
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can try to implement polymorphism by creating an instance of <code>Dog</code> into an <code>Animal</code> pointer.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>auto</span> charlieB <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>make_unique<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(Dog());
    
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Name is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> charlieB<span>-&gt;</span>name() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    <span>// Output -&gt; Name is: I'm an animal
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Isn’t that weird? We created a Dog object! Well, yes and no. Let’s break it down:</p>
<ol>
<li>We created an instance of <code>Dog</code></li>
<li>The instance was passed as an argument to <code>make_unique</code></li>
<li>Here it comes, if you look at source code of <code>make_unique</code> function, you’ll see it’s primitive. It just creates
a new object of type <code>T</code> (<code>Animal</code> in our case) on the heap, using <code>new</code> operator. We could express the internal operation as:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++">Dog d;
Animal<span>*</span> a <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Animal(d);
</code></pre></div><p>So yes, we did pass a Dog object, but it will be downcast to Animal in order to create a new instance of Animal using one of the built-in constructors:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>// Animal has this generated constructor (among others) by default
</span><span></span>Animal(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span>);
</code></pre></div><h3 id="edit---thanks-to-crifferiushttpstwittercomcrifferius-and-arganoidhttpstwittercomarganoid">Edit - thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/crifferius">@crifferius</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arganoid">@arganoid</a></h3>
<p>The scenario from above leads to an incorrect and confusing behavior. It was my understanding of <code>make_shared</code> &amp; <code>make_unique</code> that was incorrect.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think it’s still important to mention it, as the program compiles successfully (no warnings), with an unexpected behavior,
especially for people coming to C++ from another language.</p>
<p><code>make_unique</code> and <code>make_shared</code> actually forward parameters, so you should use them with the derived class type as shown below for <code>charlieC</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>auto</span> charlieB <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Dog());

<p>References are great. They are like pointers, but cannot be <strong>nullptr</strong> (you could technically workaround and store <strong>NULL/nullptr</strong> in a reference, but that leads to undefined behavior and I won’t present such a bad practice here).</p>
<p>Not only references are not optional, but they also depict another paradigm. When we accept a reference parameter in a function/method,
it means we don’t own the underlying value, nor we store it, although we might modify it (depending on whether the parameter is marked as <code>const</code>).</p>
<p>The first section of this article mentioned polymorphism. Given our examples above, we might need an array of <code>Animal</code> objects. Some could be <code>Dog</code>, <code>Cat</code>, or other. We might not know in compile time.</p>
<p>Now what if we need to walk through though the array and if it’s a dog, we want to print out the breed? For that, we will need casting.
There are multiple types of casting, let me just briefly introduce just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>static_cast</code> - casts as a given type, no runtime check</li>
<li><code>dynamic_cast</code> - casts as a given type, if it’s compatible. It will run a runtime check. In case of an error, if we’re casting to a pointer, the result will be a <code>nullptr</code> value. If we’re casting to a reference, a <code>std::bad_cast</code> exception will be thrown.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also cast helpers when you work with <code>shared_ptr</code>. Those are convenient as they unwrap the smart pointer for us.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>std::dynamic_pointer_cast</code></li>
<li><code>std::static_pointer_cast</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s modify our original example a bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a virtual method breed() in <code>Dog</code> class</li>
<li>Create <code>Husky</code> class that inherits from <code>Dog</code> and implements breed()</li>
<li>Create <code>Cat</code> class just to have another type of animal</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>class</span> <span>Dog</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
    <span>virtual</span> <span>~</span>Dog() <span>=</span> <span>default</span>;
    <span>virtual</span> std<span>::</span>string breed() <span>const</span> {
        <span>throw</span> std<span>::</span>runtime_error(<span>"Dog.breed() should be implemented by a derived class"</span>);
    }

    std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm a dog"</span>;
    }
};

<span>class</span> <span>Cat</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Animal {
    std<span>::</span>string name() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>"I'm a cat"</span>;
    }
};

<span>class</span> <span>Husky</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> Dog {
<span>public</span><span>:</span>
  std<span>::</span>string breed() <span>const</span> <span>override</span> {
      <span>return</span> <span>"Husky"</span>;
  }
};
</code></pre></div><p>Time to create our animal array. Remember, not all animals are dogs, so we’ll first have to try to upcast an <code>Animal&amp;</code> to a <code>Dog&amp;</code> and if it works,
we can print out the breed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++">
<span>void</span> <span>printDogBreed</span>(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span> animal);

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
    std<span>::</span>vector<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;&gt;</span> animals;

    animals.emplace_back(std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Husky));
    animals.emplace_back(std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Cat));

    <span>for</span> (<span>const</span> <span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> animal : animals) {
        <span>// ignore this function for now, we'll define it in a minute
</span><span></span>        printDogBreed(<span>*</span>animal);
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>We created an array with one dog and one cat. The function <code>printDogBreed</code> is yet to be defined. We will want to pass
a reference of <code>Animal</code> to the function and let it either print out the breed (if the animal is a dog) or do nothing.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, the asterisk operator in <code>shared_ptr</code> is overloaded to return a reference of the stored object.</p>
<p>Let’s define <code>printDogBreed</code> function now:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>void</span> <span>printDogBreed</span>(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span> animal) {
    <span>try</span> {
        <span>auto</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>dynamic_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> Dog<span>&amp;&gt;</span>(animal);
        std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Breed is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> dog.breed() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    } <span>catch</span> (<span>const</span> std<span>::</span>bad_cast<span>&amp;</span> e) {
        <span>// do nothing, it's not a dog
</span><span></span>    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This is pretty straightforward no? We take a const reference of <code>Animal</code> (as we don’t need to modify it) and try
to upcast it to a Dog reference.</p>
<p>We would expect (or I would anyway), that the program would output our husky dog breed. Unfortunately, that’s not what happens.</p>
<p>The application will crash on a <code>std::runtime_error</code> exception thrown from the base <code>Dog</code> class’ <code>breed()</code> method.</p>
<h3 id="why-why-why">Why, why, why?</h3>
<p>Well, that’s a good question. The underlying object is a <code>Dog</code>, but most importantly it’s <code>Husky</code>, so we would expect
the virtual method <code>breed()</code> to print out <code>Husky</code>.</p>
<p>For some reason (I would really love to give you a full in-detail explanation on this, if you know, please message us on <a href="https://twitter.com/digreverie">twitter</a>.), the cast
itself is valid, but it’s also hard-wired to <code>Dog</code> type, or its vtable is erased, who knows.</p>
<p>If we were to replace the line and cast directly to <code>Husky</code>, everything would work as expected. But we don’t want to specify the type of dog. As we might add more types in the future.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>auto</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>dynamic_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> Husky<span>&amp;&gt;</span>(animal);
</code></pre></div><h3 id="cast-to-pointer-for-the-rescue">Cast to pointer for the rescue</h3>
<p>Luckily, the solution is rather simple. We “just” have to cast to a <code>Dog</code> pointer, that will behave correctly in runtime, dispatching the right virtual method.
Notice the <code>&amp;</code> before animal. We’re basically taking an address of the <code>Animal</code> reference, which will lead us to the pointer.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>void</span> <span>printDogBreed</span>(<span>const</span> Animal<span>&amp;</span> animal) {
    <span>if</span> (<span>auto</span> dog <span>=</span> <span>dynamic_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span> Dog<span>*&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>animal)) {
        std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Breed is: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> dog<span>-&gt;</span>breed() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This one almost got me bald from pulling my hair. Consider the following code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span> 1</span><span>// Note this function defines a reference of shared_ptr as the function parameter.
</span><span><span> 2</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>shuffleAnimal</span>(std<span>::</span>function<span>&lt;</span><span>void</span>(std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;&amp;</span>)<span>&gt;</span> f) {
</span><span> 3</span>    <span>auto</span> animal <span>=</span> std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span>(<span>new</span> Husky);
<span> 4</span>    f(animal);
<span> 5</span>
<span> 6</span>    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Picked animal name: "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> animal<span>-&gt;</span>name() <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
<span> 7</span>}
<span> 8</span>
<span> 9</span><span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {
<span>10</span>    <span>// but caller can implement it without a reference, as such:
</span><span><span>11</span><span></span>    shuffleAnimal([](std<span>::</span>shared_ptr<span>&lt;</span>Animal<span>&gt;</span> animal) {
</span><span>12</span>        animal.reset(<span>new</span> Cat);
<span>13</span>    });
<span>14</span>}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The function <code>shuffleAnimal</code> lets the caller shuffle the initial Animal it provides. As you can see, we provide a mutable
reference of <code>shared_ptr</code>.</p>
<p>Notice the caller does <strong>NOT</strong> implement the parameter correctly, as it omits the reference mark!</p>
<p>This would not fly with <code>unique_ptr</code> those cannot be copied, so you’d encounter a compilation error.</p>
<p>Since this program will build …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Californians voted Yes on <a href="https://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2020/general/pdf/topl-prop24.pdf">Prop 24</a>, approving extensive amendments to the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1121">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> with the mindset of strengthening the U.S.’s most comprehensive data privacy regulation to date. But one of its provisions undermines that goal in a way that puts both individual privacy and corporate security at a heightened risk.<br></p><p>Specifically, a collection of amendments grants service providers expanded powers to combine consumer datasets obtained from different sources (see Secs. 1798.140(ag)(1) and 1798.185(e)(10)).<strong> In the world of data anonymization, the risks of combining datasets </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3/"><strong>are</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/researchers-spotlight-the-lie-of-anonymous-data/"><strong>well</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/12/181207144403.htm"><strong>known</strong></a><strong>.</strong> When paired with additional data, individuals in many anonymized datasets are surprisingly easy to re-identify. This can be due to uneven approaches in anonymization, as well as the simple benefit of added data points. Real-world instances include <a href="https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Re-identification-of-Governor-Welds-Medical-Information-Daniel-Barth-Jones.pdf">anonymized medical records</a> being re-identified when pooled with voter databases; the infamous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610105">Netflix user re-identification</a> achieved by combining anonymized Netflix data with IMDB user movie ratings; and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2019/09/04/researchers-use-big-data-and-ai-to-remove-legal-confidentiality/?sh=24ba16ec15f6">anonymized Swiss Supreme Court cases</a> involving pharmaceutical companies being re-identified using publicly available databases.<br></p><p>We’ve talked previously about how the <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/ccpa-will-hit-your-dev-team-harder-than-gdpr">CCPA impacts dev teams</a> thanks to its extremely broad definition of the types of data requiring protection. Today, we’ll look at how Prop 24 throws that data under the bus by loosening its restrictions on data pooling.<br></p><h3>A practical example<br></h3><p>Imagine there’s a handful of companies in the same industry, say EdTech, all working with the same third-party service provider to debug software, perform testing, or develop apps. Each of these companies anonymizes their users’ data prior to sharing it with the service provider. Thanks to Prop 24, the service provider pools those datasets to maximize their work. Then the service provider experiences a breach. Individually, those anonymized user datasets may have been safe from re-identification. But combined, they make it much easier to connect the dots and re-identify users with as much as a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3/">99.9% rate of accuracy</a>.<br></p><p>The end result? Multiple companies grappling with crisis management thanks to a single data leak of “anonymized” data. The inclusion of this provision in the newly-passed Prop 24 significantly weakens the individual privacy protections that the CCPA otherwise aims to safeguard. What’s more, it weakens a company’s ability to ensure the privacy of their data when working with third parties.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f0ae1534d32e5a91598eb9c/5fa5e8d498f39f28e061d229_wpTaqICtlYpRVLx4exhENOlsJh4wo898y97N_2Hhc6DJKYk06ryDg5nZj1yv5gBOa0s9DHtrJhQYE8CEg8WAzHkT_NqrcOsbFFUp_m75LDSJTiJVx742PBA69hqfJQSgvMrT25dm.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3><strong>What to do about it</strong><br></h3><p>More and more companies are relying on third-party providers to expand their development teams, outsource QA testing, or engage in other ways that rely on shared datasets. Where the law opens the door to data pooling, concerned companies should specify in their contracts if they want that door kept firmly shut.<br></p><p>But maybe a company stands to benefit from the provider having a larger pool of data to work with. In that case, here are two approaches that allow for reaping the benefits of working with third-parties without upping the risks to data security.<br></p><h4>Ironclad data de-identification</h4><p>Simple redaction, pseudonymization, and sampling aren’t going to cut it. Advanced subsetting paired with full database obfuscation? Now we’re talking. Data beyond what the law defines as “sensitive personal information” and “unique identifiers” could be used to re-identify individuals when combined with other datasets. Taking a more comprehensive approach to data de-identification provides the safeguards needed against re-identification due to data pooling. And with tools like those available in <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/product">Tonic</a> to link columns and preserve relationships in the protected output dataset, companies can strengthen their data security without sacrificing their data’s utility.</p><h4>Data synthesis with differential privacy&nbsp;</h4><p>For the strongest in data security, data synthesis performed with differential privacy at its core not only provides mathematical guarantees for data protection, it also allows for scaling up datasets to any size to equip developers with the amount of realistic, yet wholly fictitious, data they need to do their best work. Here, too, Tonic is <a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/differential-privacy-comes-to-tonic">leading the charge</a>.<br></p><h3>Why companies should act<br></h3><p>Two additional components of Prop 24 and the CPPA are worth highlighting. First, Prop 24 establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency, expanding the resources available to implement and enforce the CCPA (see Sec. 1798.199.10). This strengthens the state’s ability to take legal action against companies that violate privacy rights.<br></p><p>Second, Prop 24 missed an opportunity to bring the CCPA in line with GDPR in requiring that companies have <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/yes-how-opt-in-consent-really-works/">users opt into data collection</a>, as opposed to leaving the burden with users to opt out. Essentially what this means is that under the CCPA privacy is not the default. And most consumers won’t take the time to click through pop-ups, on/off forms, or privacy settings to make the opt-out change.<br></p><p>This leaves the onus on companies to do right by the data they're collecting by default in order to avoid the legal ramifications that are now easier to enforce.<br></p><p>CCPA and Prop 24 are designed to protect consumers. In the best of worlds, protecting consumers also means protecting businesses from the fallout of poor data practices. Despite its best intentions, Prop 24 stumbles in achieving these goals. Enabling service providers to combine datasets makes companies who work with third-parties more vulnerable to data leaks, despite the protections those companies may have put in place through data anonymization.</p><p>Where Prop 24 does succeed is in paving a clear path for taking legal action against companies who misuse or fail to protect their users’ data. It’s up to companies to implement strong data protection practices regardless of the law’s lax requirements, to avoid costly fines and damaging leaks.<br></p></div><div><h2>What’s a Rich Text element?</h2><p>The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually. Just double-click and easily create content.</p><h5>Static and dynamic content editing</h5><blockquote>Static and dynamic content editing</blockquote><p>‍</p><h6>Static and dynamic content editing</h6><p>A rich text element can be used with static or dynamic content.
