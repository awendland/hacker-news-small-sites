September 9, 2020 | https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>These are the five most annoying inaccessible web elements I face as a blind screen reader user every day, and how to fix them.
</span>
					</p><div>
						<p><span>For blind and visually impaired people like me, accessibility is the difference between us being able to use a website and clicking off it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>How screen readers work</h2>
<p><span>Screen readers allow blind and visually impaired people to use computers, phones and tablets independently. Most screen readers use software, and a Text To Speech (TTS) engine, which is what converts the text from the screen reader into speech. Screen readers convert the text displayed on screen into a format that blind users can process.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read out loud everything that’s on the screen and allow people to navigate using touch gestures and shortcut keys. They also work with other output devices such as a braille display.</span></p>
<p><span>As a screen reader user, here are the most common issues I encounter on a daily basis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Unlabelled links and buttons</h2>
<p><span>Screen reader users rely on links and buttons to navigate around a website and to find the information we need. If links and buttons are not labelled correctly or if at all, then it makes it difficult for screen reader users to find the information they need. Ultimately, unlabelled links make it much harder to navigate the website easily, quickly and independently.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when linking to an about page, ‘click here’ doesn’t give any clue as to where it leads to, but ‘find out more about who we are’ is clear.</span></p>
<p><span>If links and buttons are labelled correctly, screen readers can read the label out loud. It means that blind and visually impaired people don’t have to press the link or button without knowing where it will take them.</span></p>
<p><span>As well as unlabelled elements, links and buttons that do not have a clear description are also really frustrating. They must have a clear description of where they will lead to when pressed, rather than ‘click here’. Never make your users guess where a link will take them or force them into a trial-and-error situation. This makes for tedious user experience.</span></p>
<h2>No image descriptions</h2>
<p><span>This is probably the most common issue I encounter when browsing the web.&nbsp;</span><span>Using image descriptions is essential for accessibility. Image descriptions are also known as alt text (alternative text) which is a written description of an image.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read image descriptions out loud. This means that blind and visually impaired people can understand the content of the image in an accessible way.&nbsp;</span><span>If images do not have alt text, then screen readers will simply say “image” or “graphic” which gives no context or meaning.</span></p>
<p><span>Images often convey valuable information. It’s therefore important that people with a visual impairment can access this information as well.&nbsp;</span><span>Alt text should be clearly written and give an accurate description of the image.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://bighack.org/how-to-write-better-alt-text-descriptions-for-accessibility/">our tips for writing better alt text</a> to ensure your images are fully accessible.</strong></p>
<h2>Poor use of headings</h2>
<p><span>For quick and easy navigation, many screen reader users navigate using various elements on the page such as headings. They are a great way to find the information we need quickly and effectively. Especially when they follow a logical heading structure with H1s, H2s and H3s helping to prioritise the content.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" alt="Logical heading structure begins with Heading 1, with Heading 2 sitting beneath heading 1. Heading 3 sits within heading 2 and so on." width="1958" height="1236" srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1958px) 100vw, 1958px" data-srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>If websites don’t use headings, it means screen reader users are unable to use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the webpage this way. If that’s the case, we have to resort to tabbing or arrowing through a long web page to find the information we need.</span></p>
<p>Headings also help to break up the web content visually and improve readability. Other elements that screen reader users use to navigate webpages include links, lists or landmarks.</p>
<h2>Inaccessible web forms</h2>
<p><span>Most websites use forms in one way or another. Whether it’s to help you search for a product or to get in touch through a contact form. However, when these forms are not labelled, or not labelled correctly, it means we cannot use them.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a search box is not labelled, it means screen reader users have no idea of the purpose of that box. It means people who use screen readers cannot access the same functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact forms are an effective way for customers to get in touch with your brand or business. And as a screen reader user, there’s nothing more frustrating than these forms being labelled incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially CAPTCHA checkout requirements. Without an option to hear the audio, it’s not accessible. It means we are unable to fill in the form independently. I often have to enlist help from a sighted person, but this isn’t possible for everyone.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2>Auto-playing audio and video</h2>
<p><span>Most people will know how annoying it is to load a web page with noisy adverts that start playing suddenly. But for screen reader users, it can be even more alarming. When video or audio starts playing automatically, it can drown out the voice of the screen reader. This makes it harder to find the pause or stop buttons.</span></p>
<p><span>(And if these buttons are unlabelled, then it’s practically impossible for me to stop the video quickly which causes extra frustration.) If I’m unable to stop the sound or video, I normally click off.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution? Make sure there’s no auto-playing video or audio when your website loads. If you really want to use video, make sure the audio is muted and the user can pause, stop or hide the media player.</span></p>
<p><span>These issues may seem small to sighted users. But they’re the difference between me being able to use a website independently or not. And they make a huge difference when implemented correctly.</span></p>

<p>This blogpost presents intuition and experimental results for Gated Linear Networks, a new family of neural networks introduced by DeepMind in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01526.pdf">recent paper</a>. Accompanying implementations in JAX, NumPy, PyTorch and TensorFlow can be found <a href="https://github.com/aiwabdn/pygln">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-gated-linear-network">What is a Gated Linear Network?</h2>

<p>A <strong>Gated Linear Network (GLN)</strong> is a collection of <strong>data-dependent neurons</strong>, arranged in a sequence of layers. Instead of predicting the target output only at the final layer, as is usually the case in deep learning, each neuron predicts the output directly, computes the error and updates its weights locally in an online fashion. In the following, we will explain the various components of a GLN in more detail. We will start off by describing how a <strong>neuron</strong> works.</p>

<p>Imagine an expert who, given an input, is supposed to make a <strong>binary decision</strong> and report their prediction as a probability value. This expert considers two types of data when making their decision: the input itself, and a set of prediction probabilities for the same decision from a panel of other experts. The expert then performs the following steps to arrive at their own decision:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Conditioned on the input, choose one decision rule from a fixed set of rules which the expert maintains internally. In the paper, this process is implemented as <strong>halfspace gating</strong> and called the <strong>context function</strong>, since the input provides the “context” which determines how the decision is made. This context function is akin to <strong>locality-sensitive hashing</strong>, as similar inputs are supposed to map to the same decision rule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the chosen decision rule to combine the prediction probabilities of the panel of other experts. In the paper, each decision rule consists of a set of weights which are used to aggregate the panel probabilities via <strong>geometric mixing</strong>. So the expert effectively refines the decisions of the panel, relying more on some experts than on others, depending on the context, i.e. the input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By comparing their prediction with the expected output, the expert adjusts the selected set of weights which has produced this decision, by shifting them slightly in the direction which encourages the correct decision in the future.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The following awesome stick figure sketch attempts to visualize this:</p>

<p><img src="https://aiwabdn.github.io/pygln/assets/images/expert2.png" alt="panel-of-experts"></p>

<p>We can think of the layers in a GLN as panels of such experts. Each expert/neuron in a layer considers the previous layer as their panel of experts. Consequently, the prediction of the target output gets iteratively refined through the sequence of layers, until a last single-neuron layer makes the final decision, which is taken as the network output. Different from typical deep neural networks, however, the output of each neuron is directly interpretable and updated locally, as opposed to globally via backpropagation through the entire network.</p>

<h2 id="core-concepts">Core concepts</h2>

<p>With that intuition in place, let us look at the main mathematical concepts underlying a neuron in more detail. Henceforth, we will refer to an “expert” as a <strong>neuron</strong> and to a “panel” as a <strong>layer</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="halfspace-gating">Halfspace gating</h3>

<p>We have seen how each neuron has its own <strong>context function</strong> which it uses to choose a decision rule conditioned on the input. Since the neuron should use the same decision rule for similar inputs, the context function should map regions of the input space to the same context. One way to achieve this is to divide the space into <strong>halfspaces</strong> and compute region membership based on which halfspace an input point belongs to, but other methods, for instance, based on a fixed number of representative points, could be used instead.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a two-dimensional input space and an input point \((x_0, y_0)\). Any straight line divides the space into two halves, and our point lies either to the left (0) or right (1) of the line. So every line gives us a binary value indicating, very roughly, in which region of the input space our point is located.</p>

<p><img src="https://aiwabdn.github.io/pygln/assets/images/context_function.png" alt="context-function"></p>

<p>We can consider the point’s position relative to multiple lines and combine the binary results to form a binary string. In general, if we draw \(n\) lines, we get a binary string of length \(n\) with \(2^n\) possible values, i.e., sub-regions. This operation forms the basis of how the <strong>context function</strong> computes context identifiers given an input point. A neuron interprets this binary string as number and uses it as index into an array of \(2^n\) different set of weights, thus making a <strong>data-dependent choice</strong> of which linear function to apply.</p>

<p>In the figure above, the context function consists of \(3\) lines, shown in red, green and blue, which divide the space into \(2^3 = 8\) regions, indexed by integers from \([0, 7]\). When passed through the context function, input \((x_0, y_0)\) produces the binary string <em>“010”</em>, i.e. index \(2\), and point \((x_1, y_1)\) produces <em>“110”</em>, i.e. index \(6\).</p>

<p>Let’s see how that might look in code.</p>

<h3 id="geometric-mixing">Geometric mixing</h3>

<p>A neuron takes the probabilistic predictions of the previous layer and combines them using the context-selected weights to produce a prediction of its own. This is implemented as <strong>geometric mixing</strong>, that is, a dot product of the weights and the prediction logits of the previous layer and subsequent sigmoid:</p><p>

\[\mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p) = \sigma(w^\mathrm{T} \cdot \sigma^{-1}(p)) = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{d}p_i^{w_i}}{\prod_{i=1}^{d}p_i^{w_i} + \prod_{i=1}^{d}(1 - p_i)^{w_i}},\]

</p><p>where \(\mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p)\) represents the mixed output when the ground truth is \(1\).</p>

<p>Conceptually, this implements a kind of voting mechanism:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If all weights are \(0\), i.e. no weight is given to any input, then the output is \(0.5\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all weights have the uniform value \(\frac{1}{d}\) (\(d\) being the number of neurons in the previous layer), i.e. equal weighting, then the output is the geometric mean of the predictions of the previous layer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, <strong>vetoing</strong> is possible in the sense that if one neuron from the previous layer has predicted a probability close to \(0\) and the weight assigned to that prediction is greater than \(0\), then the output is pushed towards \(0\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the neuron sees more samples, it learns which of the predictions of the previous layer to pay more attention to. So in a sense a neuron behaves like an expert who, given a certain type of input, learns the best way to combine decisions from other experts based on their area of expertise, to arrive at their own judgement. This also demonstrates the difference between a GLN and a normal neural network. Usually, the neurons of the intermediate layers of a neural network learn to combine “features” from the previous layers to produce a higher-order “feature” value. However, the features themselves do not have any (extrinsic) semantic meaning or obvious interpretation. That is why the weights of intermediate layers can only be updated via backpropagation after the final output has been computed, since it is the only interpretable value and can thus be optimized. A neuron in a GLN, on the other hand, is directly predicting the output and can consequently learn immediately from its mistakes.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="online-gradient-descent">Online gradient descent</h3>

<p>Now that we know how a neuron chooses weights based on the input, and uses them to mix the outputs of a previous layer of neurons to produce its own output, let’s see how it learns to update the weights in training.</p>

<p>Using the standard logarithmic loss, it can be shown that the gradient consists of scaling the difference between the output and the ground truth \(y\) by the logit of the output probability:</p><p>

\[\nabla \mathcal{L}^\mathrm{GEO}(w) = \nabla \big( -\log \mathrm{GEO}^y_w(p) \big) = \big( \mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p) - y \big) \cdot \mathrm{logit}(p).\]

</p><p>This value is then multiplied with the learning rate to arrive at the update for the weights used for the current data point by the neuron. This update can be performed for every neuron as soon as it predicts the output, so there is no need for a separate forward and backward pass during training. Contrary to a regular deep neural network, where the loss is computed at the final layer and the gradients are propagated backwards, layer by layer, a GLN will hence not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients. Moreover, given enough expressive …</p></div></div></div></div>

<h2 id="why-basic-flat-html-sites-are-best-for-most-of-us">Why Basic Flat HTML Sites Are Best for Most of Us</h2>
<h3 id="html-site--longevity">HTML Site = Longevity</h3>
<p>Being a zealous Christian, I’m a big fan of longevity. And, to me, there is nothing more enduring on the web than a basic HTML website.</p>
<p>You can host an HTML site, literally, for FREE, beautiful and complex…and it will be here later on when future post-world-war-3 generations finally find the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">GitHub Archive Program</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831170906/https://archiveprogram.github.com/">archive</a>) (provided you use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831111818/https://pages.github.com/">archive</a>), I think…).</p>
<p>Lets be realistic. If you are like most people, you will probably abandon your site when you realize its pointless. But if you did it in HTML, it will still be here 20 years from now, even if you never touched it again. Just ask Linus Torvolds.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200731110209/https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/syntaxerror.png">WordPress and other CMS’s will not do that for you…</a>)</p>
<h3 id="static-sites-can-handle-traffic">Static Sites Can Handle Traffic</h3>
<p>If you go viral and get inundated with traffic, an HTML flat site can handle it. Even if its running on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/">Raspberry Pi</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200708214027/https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/">archive</a>). By comparison, statistically speaking, CMS’s that begin with the letter “W” can crash a high-end dedicated server under the same conditions.</p>
<h3 id="faster-sites-keep-attention">Faster Sites Keep Attention</h3>
<p>A static HTML page is lighting fast. And since all humans presently living have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder">ADD</a> audience retention will always be at max with an HTML site.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://clipartillustration.com/">my illustrator’s site of 24,000 images</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200824034652/https://clipartillustration.com/">archive</a>) (produced via graphical spam methods) doesn’t even need a search bar, since users can page through the images so fast.</p>
<h3 id="indistinguishable-from-dynamic-sites">Indistinguishable from Dynamic Sites</h3>
<p>Because of new web technologies, you can actually run a store on a flat HTML site. You can have a contact form (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070223013719/http://101526.iboox.com/">a Guestbook?!</a>), and user comments. Alot has changed.</p>
<h3 id="html-sites-are-pro-sanity">HTML Sites are Pro-Sanity</h3>
<p>Databases, plugins, environments, ports, updates, downdates, backwards compatibility…this list could be very long… all gone. Along with your mental oppression. Just upload the files and be done with it.</p>
<p>This means you will have much more time for your more basic human needs, such as finding time to look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200827155759/https://cheezburger.com/1633029/33-funny-cat-memes-that-never-fail-to-make-us-lol">cat memes</a>.</p>
<p>Because in the end, the internet was not created for you. It exists for cat memes.</p>

The set up is fairly straight forward: model an A/B test as sampling from two beta distributions, sample from each distribution a lot, then compare the results.</p><p>This simulation approach often first appears as a clever little trick to solve a more complex math problem, but in fact is a primative form of Monte-Carlo Integration and turns out to one of the only ways to really solve this problem. By exploring this topic deeper in this post we'll see some of the myths that many people have about analytic solutions as well as demonstrating why Monte-carlo methods are so essential to Bayesian statistics.</p></div><h2>Background: A conversation about election results</h2><div><p>An interesting conversation happened on Twitter recently.

So it is not inconsistent, nor suprising for someone to believe a candidate has 71% chance of success and they still lose. Even when looking at typical p-values, we wait for 95% percent certainty before making claims (and many feel this is a pretty weak belief). But for some reason whenever election polls come up, it seems even very statistically minded people suddenly think that 51% chance is a high probability.</p><p>I retweeted Nate Silver's forecast, mentioned my annoyance and provided an example of another case with a similar probability of winning:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. <br><br>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:<br><br>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials<br><br>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href=\&quot;https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao\&quot;>https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p>\u2014 Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;Will Kurt&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_6372"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. </p><p>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:</p><p>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials</p><p>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href="https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao">https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p></div>— Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href="https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

What we are really doing here is equalivant to using a Monte-Carlo simulation to integrate over the distribution of the difference between two Beta distributed random variables.

It's also a bit messy because if we had iterated by an incredment that didn't include -3 exactly (say by 0.031) we would not get the exact answer.</p><p>If we know some basic calculus we know that our minimum has to be where the derivative is at 0.

            <!-- content --><p>Today we are going to discuss a change to server security that is going to make waves in the home lab and secondary markets for servers and components in the future. During our recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 review</a> we briefly mentioned that AMD EPYC CPUs in the system are vendor locked to Dell EMC systems. This is not a Dell-specific concern. We have confirmed that other vendors are supporting the feature behind this. For the large vendors, their platform security teams are pushing to build more secure platforms for their customers, and that is going to have future impacts on the secondary server market and home labs.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to cover the basics of what is happening. We are going to discuss the motivations, and why this is going to be more common in the future. Finally, we are going to discuss what those in the industry can do to keep the secondary server market operating well. If you work with partners or resellers who dip into used parts bins or even have the potential to purchase grey market CPUs, send them this article or accompanying video. The current market has a large disconnect between what some large customers are asking for, and large vendors are delivering on and what others in the market know is happening.<span id="more-46716"></span></p>
<h2>Accompanying Video</h2>
<p>This is an important topic. To ensure that we can cover those who like to read/ skim and those who like to get information via audio, we have an accompanying video:</p>

<p>Feel free to pop open that video on YouTube and check it out or to send to those who prefer not to read.</p>
<h2>Background: How we learned this was a “thing”</h2>
<p>In 2018 we did a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-r7415-review/">Dell EMC PowerEdge R7415 review</a> and as part of that review, we started our normal process of trying different CPUs in the system. Early in that process, we used an AMD EPYC 7251 CPU, the low-end 8-core model, and noticed something curious. It would not work in our other test systems after.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, we found it was because Dell EMC was vendor locking the chips to Dell systems. We did not know exactly why, but we were told was a security feature. At this point, and even to this day two years later, not every vendor takes advantage of all of the AMD EPYC security features. What that practically means is that what we saw with the Dell EMC system is not what we saw with other systems. For example, we were able to interchangeably use CPUs in Supermicro and Tyan systems, but we could not use those systems once they went into a Dell EMC server.</p>

<p>We found we were not alone. Laboratories, VARs, and other organizations were finding that transferring AMD EPYC CPUs from one vendor’s system to another, was not the simple process it was on the Intel Xeon side. It did not always work.</p>
<p>We knew it was a security feature and thought that most who are buying servers would be informed of this by their sales reps or channel partners. After I personally got a lot of texts, e-mails, instant messaging, and comments on our C6525 video and article, I realized that this actually may be a situation where many people do not know what is going on.</p>

<p>This experience that we had, apparently is one that is not overly common yet. That makes sense because the systems that utilize the enhanced security levels are still largely new, and being used by their first buyers. Also, AMD still has a smaller market share than Intel. A big reason, by the way, that Intel Xeon does not have this issue is that they do not have the security feature that AMD has. Vendors have come out and stated that their AMD EPYC systems are more secure than their Intel Xeon systems, and this behavior is a byproduct of that enhanced security.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to dive into the feature of AMD processors (and what will be more common in future CPUs from other vendors.)</p>
<h2>AMD EPYC Secure Processor Platform Secure Boot (PSB)</h2>
<p>Let us start with the high-level slide. This is effectively the same slide on the AMD Secure Processor that we saw with the AMD EPYC 7001 series launch, but this is from the EPYC 7002 series. AMD EPYC CPUs may be x86, but they have an embedded Arm Cortex-A5 microcontroller that runs its own OS that is independent of the main system. This AMD Secure Processor is the backbone of AMD’s security push as it provides features such as key management and hardware root of trust for the platform.</p>
<figure id="attachment_36705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36705"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7002-series-rome-delivers-a-knockout/amd-epyc-7002-platform-secure-processor/" rel="attachment wp-att-36705"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg" alt="AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor" width="1792" height="918" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg 1792w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-400x205.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-800x410.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-696x357.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-1068x547.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-820x420.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-36705">AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor</figcaption></figure>
<p>AMD spends time <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-confirms-cts-labs-exploits-requiring-admin-access/">patching this solution</a>&nbsp;to make it more secure, but it is generally fairly hard to reach without some extremely low-level access in a system. We are going to come back to the “Enables hardware validated boot” line shortly, but it is important to understand that this secure processor underpins many of AMD’s best security features.</p>
<p>For example, at STH we use EPYC’s Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization heavily. With AMD EPYC, we do not have to manually manage keys. Instead, the ephemeral keys are managed for us by the AMD Secure Processor. This is the basis for what is really the building wave of confidential computing offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-cloud-confidential-computing-enabled-by-amd-epyc-sev/">Google Cloud Confidential Computing Enabled by AMD EPYC SEV</a>. Intel has its secure boot features and SGX that will be enhanced greatly with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake Xeons</a>, but for now, AMD has this capability while Intel does not. When big vendors say AMD is more secure, the AMD Secure Processor is a cornerstone of those offerings.</p>

<p>Let us discuss that “Enables hardware validated boot” line. While traditionally CPUs just fire up in whatever platform they are in, AMD has intelligence in their CPU due to the Arm-based AMD Secure Processor. EPYC CPUs are designed to be a bit more intelligent about the platforms they are in, and interact with server platform security to act as this root of trust that would not be possible if they effectively just booted up in any system.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from AMD describing the AMD Platform Secure Boot.</p>
<p><em>The AMD Platform Secure Boot Feature (PSB) is a mitigation for firmware Advanced Persistent Threats. It is a defense-in-depth feature. PSB extends AMD’s silicon root of trust to protect the OEM’s BIOS.&nbsp; This allows the OEM to establish an unbroken chain of trust from AMD’s silicon root of trust to the OEM’s BIOS using PSB, and then from the OEM’s BIOS to the OS Bootloader using UEFI secure boot. This provides a very powerful defense against remote attackers seeking to embed malware into a platform’s firmware.</em></p>
<p><em>An OEM who trusts only their own cryptographically signed BIOS code to run on their platforms will use a PSB enabled motherboard and set one-time-programmable fuses in the processor to bind the processor to the OEM’s firmware code signing key. AMD processors are shipped unlocked from the factory, and can initially be used with any OEM’s motherboard. But once they are used with a motherboard with PSB enabled, the security fuses will be set, and from that point on, that processor can only be used with motherboards that use the same code signing key. (<strong>Source</strong>: AMD statement to STH)</em></p>
<p>That is a lot to take in. We asked HPE about this. Their response mirrored what the above was describing. HPE firmware, when a system is first turned on, performs this binding process where the AMD EPYC CPU expects to see HPE signed firmware. If you alter the HPE firmware on the system, the check fails and the system will not work. That means if your HPE motherboard fails, you can replace it and put your CPU in another HPE motherboard with signed HPE firmware. It also means if the server platform’s firmware is not signed by HPE, the processor will see it as evidence of tampering and not work.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: 2020-09-09</strong> – HPE clarified that they are doing this in a different manner than Dell after initially confirming that they were using the AMD PSB feature. After this went live, HPE sent us the following:</p>
<p><em>HPE does not use the same security technique that Dell is using for a BIOS hardware root of trust. HPE does not burn, fuse, or permanently store our public key into AMD processors which ship with our products. HPE uses a unique approach to authenticate our BIOS and BMC firmware: HPE fuses our hardware – or silicon – root of trust into our own BMC silicon to ensure only authenticated firmware is executed.&nbsp; Thus, while we implement a hardware root of trust for our BIOS and BMC firmware, the processors that ship with our servers are not locked to our platforms. (<strong>Source</strong>: HPE)</em></p>
<p>What is at least interesting there is that HPE was initially claiming feature parity with Dell to us, and from the comments on this article were saying they used this feature in sales pitches, but now are saying they are not blowing the eFuses.</p>

<p>Here is where the concern develops, and not necessarily for AMD, the OEM, or most of the initial customer base. Customers want more security. The OEMs want to create a secure hardware environment because that is what their customers want. AMD is implementing an advanced security solution beyond what Intel Xeons have giving the OEMs and end-customers what they want. Effectively, when these are sold as new systems, this is exactly what everyone involved wants.</p>
<p>If everyone is getting what they want, then where is the concern, that is what we are going to cover next.</p>

<p>Open letter to DY Logunov et al., authors of:</p>



<p><strong>“Safety and immunogenicity of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine in two formulations: two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies from Russia.” Lancet. 2020;0(0). doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31866-3</strong></p>



<p>Available at:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31866-3/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31866-3/fulltext</a></p>



<p>and to Richard Horton (editor of The Lancet).</p>



<p>OBJECT.</p>



<p>The study reports the results of a phase 1/2 study on an adenovirus-based vaccine, using Ad5 and Ad26 vectors for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen, and two different formulations (liquid and lyophilized).</p>



<p>During the current pandemic, the extreme public interest and expectations for an effective vaccine are understandable. However, the very same reasons should motivate the scientific community to pay even more attention to the scientific evidence and the underlying data, and it is thus of utmost importance that they are fully available for close scrutiny. Numerical data for all the experiments and original FACS files in fcs format, for example, would be of great help in evaluating the present study, enabling direct reproduction of &nbsp;all analyses and findings, rather than trying to do so from data abstracted or inferred from the figures.<br>While the research described in this study is potentially significant, the presentation of the data raises several concerns which require access to the original data to fully investigate. These are detailed below.</p>



<p>POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCIES IN FIGURES 2, 3 AND 4.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<strong>figure 2</strong>, the authors report the reciprocal titre of RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies at different time points, for all the patient groups (challenged with different formulations).<br>As evident by the following reproduction, there are several data patterns which appear repeatedly for the reported experiments. To this end, connecting measurements for each individual across time points would be highly beneficial in reporting (and hence) interpreting the results. This suggestion also applies to similar measurements in the other manuscript figures.</p>

<p><br>In the red boxes, 9 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd26-S appear to have identical antibody titres at 21 and 28 days; this is also true for 7 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd5-S (yellow boxes). Furthermore, in the cyan boxes we can see all the experimental points differing for a constant value in two completely unrelated experiments; and 8 out of 9 experimental points are completely preserved among other two completely unrelated volunteer groups (green boxes).</p>



<p>While we understand that in this case the variable under study is discrete (representing the reciprocal of a dilution), still it seems to us that on the ground of simple probabilistic evaluations the fact of observing so many data points preserved among different experiments is highly unlikely.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;<strong>figure 3</strong>, intended to present the results of the cellular response to the different formulations used for challenging the volunteers, in the following reproduction repeated experimental point patterns are boxed with the same colours as in the previous case, with an important difference: in this case, the variable under study (cell proliferation %) is continuous in nature, rendering the coincidence of data points among different experiments even less likely.</p>

<p>For&nbsp;<strong>figure 4</strong>, which is intended to show the neutralizing antibody formation against the adenovirus vectors used for the vaccine, problems like those observed for figure 2 are again apparent.

<p>Please note that, in lack of the original numerical data, no conclusions can be definitively drawn on the reliability of the data presented, especially regarding the apparent duplications detected.</p>



<p>FURTHER CONCERNS.</p>



<p>The authors did not specify enough characteristics of the convalescent patients used as a control for the evaluation of the humoral response in figure 2. How were they matched to the different groups of enrolled volunteers? Since there are several convalescent control patients which apparently are seronegative and are also negative for neutralizing antibodies, it is also crucial to know when their plasma was collected – for each patient, how many days passed since symptoms and seronegativization occurred? How many convalescent controls were used for the graphs in figure 2?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
	Disney has publicly thanked a Chinese government agency accused of human rights abuses in Xinjiang for its help in making "Mulan" — a revelation that has provoked a storm of criticism online.</p>
<p>
	Disney acknowledges several Chinese government bodies in the credits for the live-action remake of the 1998 animated picture of the same name, but a few in particular have raised red flags: The Xinjiang government's publicity department and the Public Security and Tourism bureaus for Turpan, a city of about <a href="http://www.tlf.gov.cn/zjtluf/rkyy/rkgk.htm" target="_blank">633,400 people</a> just outside Xinjiang's capital Urumqi.</p>
<p>
	Disney did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business to its media inquiry line, and to U.S. press officers about the film and the credits. It's not clear how much of "Mulan" may have been shot in Xinjiang, though people who worked on the movie have said on social media and in interviews that they scouted and filmed locations there.</p>
<p>
	The U.S. State Department estimates that since 2015 as many as <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/120418_Busby_Testimony.pdf" target="_blank">two million of the Muslim-majority Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities</a> have been imprisoned in enormous re-education camps in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>
	The Turpan Public Security Bureau has been listed by the U.S. government as an organization involved in <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-22210/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list" target="_blank">"human rights violations and abuses"</a> in the region.</p>
<p>
	Beijing has long defended the crackdown in Xinjiang as necessary to tackle extremism and terrorism, and said it is in line with Chinese law and international practice, calling accusations of mass detentions a "groundless lie" and "sensational rumor." A spokesperson for the country's foreign ministry on Tuesday reiterated its defense of what it calls its Xinjiang "vocational skills education and training centers." CNN Business has reached out to the Xinjiang government and Turpan's tourism bureau, but Turpan's Public Security bureau could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>
	"There are no so-called concentration camps in Xinjiang," said China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. "The establishment of vocational skills education and training centers in Xinjiang in accordance with the law is a useful attempt and active exploration for preventive counter-terrorism and de-radicalization."</p>
<p>
	But the connections between Xinjiang and "Mulan" have ignited widespread criticism on social media since its release Friday on Disney+, the company's streaming service. Human rights advocates are now calling on Disney to make public any agreements with the Chinese government over filming in the region.</p>
<p>
	"[It's] deeply disturbing that Disney thought it was okay to partner with, and also thank, government departments, specifically propaganda departments, and a public security bureau from a region in China that is<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/asia/xinjiang-sterilization-women-human-rights-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank"> complicit with genocide," </a>said Isaac Stone Fish, senior fellow at the Asia Society, a New York based non-profit organization focused on raising awareness of Asia.</p>
<h3>
	A FILM PLAGUED BY SETBACKS</h3>
<p>
	Disney hoped that "Mulan" would be a major success at the lucrative Chinese box office, now the second-largest in the world. The company spoke last year about its dedication to making the film culturally accurate — remarks that were reported in Chinese state media.</p>
<p>
	"We spent a lot of time in the beginning with scholars, experts and people from the region. And we spent a great deal of time in China," said Sean Bailey, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, at a Disney expo event last year, reported the state-run news agency Xinhua. Bailey added that the studio "not only has a Chinese cast but also brought in a Chinese producer to make the movie with them," the outlet noted.</p>
<p>
	Eschewing the musicality of Disney's earlier animated feature of the same name, one box office analyst told CNN Business earlier this year that the live-action epic was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/media/disney-mulan-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">"tailor-made for success."</a></p>
<p>
	But the film — which is based on a traditional Chinese legend about <a href="http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/history/1706/4656-1.htm" target="_blank">a female warrior</a> who disguised herself as a man and took her father's place in the army — has already faced controversy and setbacks.</p>
<p>
	In August 2019, pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong called for a boycott of "Mulan" after the lead actor expressed support for Hong Kong police on her social media account.</p>
<p>
	"I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong," Liu Yifei, a Chinese-born U.S. citizen who plays the titular Hua Mulan, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/asia/china-mulan-actor-protests-intl-hnk-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">posted to her official Weibo account.</a> At the time, Hong Kong police faced allegations of excessive violence against protesters. (Hong Kong police <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/asia/hong-kong-protests-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">defended their actions</a> in September 2019, saying they had been "so restrained.")</p>
<p>
	Then in March, Disney was forced to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/media/mulan-delay-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">delay the film's release</a> as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered movie theaters.</p>
<p>
	Even now, its rollout has been stilted. The film was released as a US$30 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/media/mulan-disney-china-international-release/index.html" target="_blank">video-on-demand </a>last Friday on Disney+, which is only available in certain markets, including the United States. It makes its debut in Chinese theaters this weekend. (Disney+ is not available in China.)</p>
<p>
	The release of the film has renewed the controversy surrounding it, however. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/entertainment/mulan-boycott-hong-kong-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Thailand and Taiwan</a> have once again called on people to boycott the film because of Yifei's remarks last year.</p>
<p>
	And it's not even clear that the film will win over Chinese audiences, who were already chilly toward the original animated version because of its westernized flair and unfaithful retelling of the original legend.</p>
<p>
	After the release of the trailer in 2019, Chinese state-run media Global Times criticized the film for using<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1157286.shtml" target="_blank"> Japanese "ninja gestures"</a> and Chinese stereotypes.</p>
<h3>
	CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY</h3>
<p>
	Allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang stretch back years.</p>
<p>
	In recent years, the Xinjiang government has allegedly undertaken a large campaign to imprison and re-educate Muslim minorities in the region, especially the large Uyghur population.</p>
<p>
	Evidence of widespread human rights abuse has trickled out from inside the region, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">lengthy detentions,</a> abuse, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/26/asia/china-xinjiang-leaks-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">indoctrination</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/asia/xinjiang-sterilization-women-human-rights-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">mass birth control</a> — which experts have described as evidence of "genocide."</p>
<p>
	In 2017, Mulan director Niki Caro posted a photo from Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang<strong> </strong>and said she was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZle-neFOc-/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank">scouting out locations</a> for the film. And in an interview in September<strong> </strong>with Conde Nast traveler, Mulan production designer Grant Major discussed filming in Xinjiang's <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/on-location-mulan" target="_blank">Taklamakan Desert</a>, in the region's far southwest.</p>
<p>
	Adrian Zenz, a leading academic<strong> </strong>at the Victims of Communism Foundation who has helped break major stories from Xinjiang, said that the earliest documented case of a re-education center in the region was in Turpan in 2013.</p>
<p>
	Zenz said that while it was possible Disney didn't know about the growing number of detention centers set up across Xinjiang, the widespread oppression in the region was impossible to miss.</p>
<p>
	"There were police stations and checkpoints all over Xinjiang by late 2016, not to be missed," he said.</p>
<p>
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao dismissed Zenz's claims and accused him of making a living "through making Xinjiang-related rumors and slandering China." He also claimed there had been no cases of violence or terrorism in Xinjiang for "more than three consecutive years."</p>
<p>
	Turpan was also the setting for one of the worst outbreaks of ethnic violence in Xinjiang in recent years, when 35 people died during an attack on a police station in Lukqun township, in 2013, <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/kindle/2013-07/05/content_16731473.htm" target="_blank">according to state media.</a></p>
<p>
	Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, called for Disney to <a href="https://twitter.com/Yaqiu/status/1303002585155149825" target="_blank">disclose what assistance</a> it had received from Xinjiang authorities and what agreements it had made with the regional government.</p>
<p>
	And<strong> </strong>Asia Society fellow Stone Fish said that many companies were accustomed to making small concessions to the ruling Communist Party to access the Chinese market.</p>
<p>
	"Studios feel like they need to make these compromises to be in Beijing, but you can slightly censor your movies to get into the Chinese market, you can bring Chinese movies that shouldn't be in the States because of poor quality or because of propaganda elements into the States. And you can do that and maintain your integrity, mostly intact," he said.</p>
<p>
	"You don't need to take these extra steps that Disney is taking, and they're rightly getting excoriated for it."</p>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.

<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

        <p>A story on Hacker News recently argued that webpage speeds haven't improved, even as internet speeds have gone up.</p>
<p>This article explains why that conclusion can't be drawn from the original data.</p>
<p>We'll also look at how devices and the web have changed over the past 10 years, and what those changes have meant for web performance.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="interpreting-the-http-archive-data">Interpreting the HTTP Archive data</h2>
<p>This chart from the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/">Nielsen Norman Group article</a> suggested that increasing mobile network bandwidth hasn't resulted in faster page load times.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart.png" alt="Chart showing increasing bandwidth along increasing page load times"></p>
<p>However, <strong>the connection speed used by HTTP Archive has not actually increased over time.</strong></p>
<p>Instead it went down in 2013, <a href="https://httparchive.org/faq#what-changes-have-been-made-to-the-test-environment-that-might-affect-the-data">switching from wifi to an emulated 3G connection</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart-annotated.png" alt="Annotation for page loads time showing when methodology changed"></p>
<p>The onLoad metric has increased 55% since 2013, from 12.7s to 19.7s. If you bought a phone in 2013 and have been on a 3G connection ever since, then the web has become slower for you.</p>
<p>Before looking at how devices and the web have changed over the last 10 years, here are a few notes on how to think about this data.</p>
<h3 id="why-look-at-on-load">Why look at onLoad?</h3>
<p>The <code>load</code> event is emitted by the page when all page resources like scripts or images have been downloaded.</p>
<p>If the top of a page renders quickly, but the page also loads 20 images further down, then the onLoad metric will suggest that the page is slow.</p>
<p>A different page might not initially render anything useful at all, and only start loading additional resources and rendering content long after the onLoad event. Yet this page will appear fast.</p>
<p>As a result, onLoad doesn't do a good job measuring whether a user experiences the page as fast.</p>
<p>So why do we even look at this metric? <strong>Because it's been around for a long time</strong>, and HTTP Archive has been tracking it since 2010. Newer metrics like <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> or Time to Interactive were only added to HTTP Archive in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="should-we-expect-increasing-bandwidth-to-result-in-faster-page-load-times">Should we expect increasing bandwidth to result in faster page load times?</h3>
<p>Increasing bandwidth will only make a page load faster if bandwidth is the bottleneck at some point. It won't help if you're on a Gigabit connection with a 1s network roundtrip time.</p>
<p>However, the 1.6Mbps 3G connection emulated by HTTP Archive is very slow, so we should expect significant performance improvements as bandwidth improves. The average website downloads 1.7MB of data in 2020, which will take at least 9s to download on the HTTP Archive connection.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-http-archive-caveats">Some more HTTP Archive caveats</h3>
<p>I'll talk a lot about "the average website" in this article. It's worth noting that HTTP Archive only collects data on homepages, not pages deeper down in the site. The corpus of tested domains has also grown over time.</p>
<p>The tests weren't always run on the same device. Initially a physical iPhone 4 was used, today the tests are run on an emulated Android device.</p>
<p>We'll look at median metric values in this article. If most websites are fast but one in five websites freeze your phone for 20s we won't be able to pick this up.</p>
<h3 id="performance-on-desktop">Performance on desktop</h3>
<p>This article will focus on mobile performance in the US. However, if you're looking at the desktop data from the original article, it's worth noting that the test bandwidth was increased and latency was reduced in 2013.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/desktop-performance.png" alt="Chart showing desktop connection speeds and when emulated connection speed changed"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-mobile-networks-and-devices-changed-over-the-last-10-years">How have mobile networks and devices changed over the last 10 years?</h2>
<p>Let's look at 4 factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>network bandwidth</li>
<li>network latency</li>
<li>processor speeds</li>
<li>browser performance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobile-network-bandwidth-in-the-us">Mobile network bandwidth in the US</h3>
<p>This chart shows average mobile bandwidth in the US by year, according to different sources. It increased from 1 Mbps to around 30 Mbps.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-bandwidth.png" alt="Mobile bandwidth in the US by year"></p>
<p>(I've not been very careful when collecting this data. For example, I didn't consistently distinguish when data was collected from when it was published. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifZ_ngADpT3YzezNQLpXKCsr74-BvaBJUkYm6PGpv1g/edit?usp=sharing">You can find my sources here</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="mobile-network-latency-in-the-us">Mobile network latency in the US</h3>
<p>This was harder to find data on, but the results indicate that latency dropped from around 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-latency.png" alt="Mobile latency in the US by year, going down from 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020"></p>
<h3 id="mobile-device-cpu-speeds">Mobile device CPU speeds</h3>
<p>I've not been able to find data on average mobile device speeds in the US. But <a href="https://infrequently.org/">Alex Russel</a> and <a href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> have published a <a href="https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1233275220275818498">chart showing GeekBench 4 scores alongside the release years of different phones</a>.</p>
<p>Even budget phones have become 4x faster, with iPhones now being up to 20x more powerful.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/mobile-cpu-benchmark.jpeg" alt="Mobile CPU performance over time"></p>
<h3 id="how-have-browsers-changed">How have browsers changed?</h3>
<p>A lot of work has been done on browsers over the last 10 years. JavaScript has become a larger part of the web, so many improvements have focussed here.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/10-years">this chart from the V8 blog</a>, page CPU usage for gone down by a factor of 4.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/v8-performance.png" alt="V8 Speedometer 1 benchmark results 2013 to 2018"></p>
<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<p>Browser networking has also improved, for example with the introduction of HTTP/2 in 2015. 64% of requests are now served over HTTP/2.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/http2.png" alt="HTTP/2 adoption over time"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-websites-changed">How have websites changed?</h2>
<p>Let's look at some data from HTTP Archive to see how websites have changed.</p>
<h3 id="page-weight">Page weight</h3>
<p><a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight">Mobile page weight</a> increased by 337% between 2013 and 2020. This is primarily driven by an increase in images and JavaScript code.</p>
<p>Other resources also increased a lot –&nbsp;I suspect these are mostly videos.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/page-weight.png" alt="Page weight by resource type over time"></p>
<p>The chart starts in 2013 as HTTP Archive changed its methodology in October 2012. Before page weight was undercounted, as the test stopped when the page load event was triggered, even if more data was still being loaded.</p>
<h3 id="java-script-execution-time">JavaScript execution time</h3>
<p>JavaScript would be the most likely culprit if pages are getting slower despite faster mobile networks. Unfortunately, HTTP Archive only started collecting this data in late 2017, and it seems to have been mostly stable since then.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/javascript-execution-time.png" alt="HTTP Archive JavaScript execution time chart"></p>
<p>The drop in mid-2018 can probably be attributed to a URL corpus change.</p>
<p>Note that the absolute run duration (0.5s) is less than what you'd normally see in a tool like Lighthouse. These tools normally slow down JavaScript execution to emulate a mobile device, but <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/methodology#lighthouse">this was broken for the HTTP Archive tests</a>. So while this number might be realistic for mid-range phones, a common assumption is that budget phones are around 4x slower.</p>
<h2 id="answering-whether-the-web-has-become-slower">Answering whether the web has become slower</h2>
<p>Has the web become slower? Well, it depends on what your device, network connection, and most-used websites are.</p>
<p>We'd need to weigh real-world performance data to get a distribution that shows how different users experienced the web over time. And should the experience of someone opening thousands of pages a day count as much as someone who only visits Facebook once a week?</p>
<p>I don't have detailed per-user data, but we can take a look at the question in a few different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real-user data from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome UX Report (CrUX)</a></li>
<li>Naive modelling based on how websites and devices have changed</li>
</ol>
<p>I also tried downloading old page versions from archive.org and testing them with Lighthouse, but wasn't able to get meaningful results in the time I had available. For example, often some images are missing from the page archive.</p>
<h2 id="data-from-the-chrome-user-experience-report">Data from the Chrome User Experience Report</h2>
<p>The big limitation of CrUX data is that it's only been collected since late 2017. But we can still use it to see if the web has become slower in the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike HTTP Archive, CrUX looks at the whole domain instead of just homepages.</p>
<p>The data we'll look at is the 75th percentile, meaning pages load at least this fast for 75% of users.</p>
<p>(I'm taking the average across websites rather than the median, which is not great.)</p>
<h3 id="us-page-load-times">US page load times</h3>
<p>CrUX data for the US does not show page performance getting worse.</p>
<p>The onLoad metric shows a slight improvement, maybe due to an increase in bandwidth. Or maybe more activity is now happening after the initial page load.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-us.png" alt="Page load speeds in the US"></p>
<p>The paint metrics seem fairly stable. Largest Contentful Paint is a new metric that has only been collected since mid-2019.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-of-the-world">The rest of the world</h3>
<p>The downward trend in the US onLoad metric is matched by the global data. There are however signifianct differences in page load times across countries, with onLoad timings in India being almost twice those in South Korea.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-global.png" alt="Page load speeds globally, in the US, UK, Korea, and India"></p>
<p>We can use CrUX data to put HTTP Archive data into perspective. In January 2020 HTTP Archive reported a median (50% percentile) load time of 18.7s, based on its synthetic data.</p>
<p>In contrast, CrUX suggests a load time of just 5.8s –&nbsp;and this is the 75th percentile.</p>
<p>(Note that the Global values here just take an average and are not weighed by population.)</p>
<h2 id="modelling-page-load-times">Modelling page load times</h2>
<p>We can create a theoretical model of how changes in devices, networks, and websites might affect overall performance.</p>
<p>This won't be a great model, but hopefully it will still provide some insight.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-page-download-time">Theoretical page download time</h3>
<p>Page weight has increased over time, but so has bandwidth. Round-trip latency has also gone down.</p>
<p>Downloading a file the size of the median mobile website would have taken 1.7s in 2013. If your connection hasn't improved since then downloading this much data would now take 4.4s. But with an average connection today it would only take 0.9s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/minimum-page-download-time.png" alt="TCP download time"></p>
<p>In practice, a website wouldn't consist of just a single request, and other factors like CPU processing or server latency would also affect how quickly the page loads. The onLoad times reported by HTTP Archive are 2-3 times this lower bound.</p>
<p>But we can still use this as an indicator that reduced latency and increased bandwidth have helped make websites load faster overall.</p>
<p>(I'm starting in 2013 rather than 2011, as the HTTP Archive page weight metric has only been measured consistently since then.)</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>I'm not quite sure how to think about this, but I'll make some guesses anyway.</p>
<p>Someone who used a Galaxy S4 in 2013 and now uses a Galaxy S10 will have seen their CPU processing power go up by a factor of 5. Let's assume that browsers have become 4x more efficient since then. If we naively multiply these numbers we get an overall 20x improvement.</p>
<p>Since 2013, JavaScript page weight has increased 3.7x from 107KB to 392KB. Maybe minification and compression have improved a bit …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

                In 100 years, passport discrimination will be seen as wrong as skin-colour discrimination
              </h2>

              <p>September 2020</p>

              <p>
                It's 2020, and you're browsing the web when you see a job ad with something very unusual:
              </p>

              <p>
                <i>"We're looking for experienced marketers to help us launch a new product line. White candidates only, please".</i>
              </p>

              <p>
                Infuriating and depressing! How long do you think it would take for every news agency in the world to be talking about this? And for this company to go out of business? And how about for the authors to be facing criminal charges?
              </p>

              <p>
                This entire situation sounds very unlikely to happen today. But isn't it disturbing to think that less than a century ago this would be just another ordinary day?
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, replace the <i>"White candidates only"</i> with <i>"Australian residents only"</i>, and you have a real example of thousands of modern job ads shared around the web every day.
              </p>

              <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c08abdd264a662ef6b35ae6807f17f4322cbdb90/424f0/assets/img/blog/open-borders-book.jpg" alt="Open Borders Book"></p><p>
                <i>(Illustration from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960/">Open Borders</a> by Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith)</i>
              </p>

              <p>
                I was born in Brazil, and as I grew up, I became each year more distant and frustrated with the country's (and my) future. Living in one of the poorest states in the country, I was one of the very few who was lucky and privileged to have parents who could afford to send me for a year abroad during high-school.
              </p>

              <p>
                I spent my last year of high school in the U.S., a life-changing and mind-expanding event. With one caveat, though. I wasn't allowed to work and get paid anywhere while I was in the country. I still remember my American friends giving me a ride on their way to work after school and perplexed that I depended on my parents sending me money from overseas.
              </p>

              <p>
                Back in Brazil, as I entered university and started working as a software developer, I found myself dreaming about working and living in Australia. But once again, I wasn't allowed, I was born in Brazil.
              </p>

              <p>
                As an 18-year old, my obsession with moving to Australia wasn't just rational. It was also an emotional one. I knew I wanted to scape the fear of daily violence in Brazil. I dreamed about a society with less economic inequality. But I also pictured myself surfing in Australian waves.
              </p>

              <p>
                And to be fair, I didn't understand what was wrong with that. I wanted a better life right away. A better life obviously means different things for different people. For me, I knew it would be a move to Australia. But I couldn't just save some money, buy a ticket and fly to Oceania. No, I would be committing a crime if I did that, I was born in the wrong place to do that.
              </p>

              <p>
                By then, I spoke English and was getting more experienced in my field each year. After years contacting hundreds of companies in Australia and doing remote test projects, I was offered a job with visa sponsorship, meaning I would get a temporary work visa to live in the "lucky country".
              </p>

              <p>
                Everything worked out for me, and I've relocated permanently to Australia. But that was never the case for thousands of people who have contacted me in the last ten years asking for help to do the same. In fact, that's not the case for approximately one billion people in the world today.
              </p>

              <p>
                Accordingly to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/124028/700-million-worldwide-desire-migrate-permanently.aspx">Gallup World Poll</a>, 16% of the world's adults would like to move to another country permanently if they had the chance.
              </p>

              <p>
                The point is: That same feeling I had about moving to Australia is not uncommon. Millions of people daydream about a similar move to a better country their entire lives. The sad part is that my migration story is an outlier. The vast majority of people are not able to legally enter the more developed nations due to current immigration law.
              </p>

              <p>
                Removing (or at least reducing) immigration restrictions would not just be the right and moral thing to do. It would be one of the smartest and most impactful economic moves we could make.
              </p>

              <p>
                It's practically unanimous between economists that reducing immigration restrictions would make the world more productive. To be more specific, estimates are we would instantly get close to <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/economics-and-emigration-trillion-dollar-bills-sidewalk-working-paper-264">doubling global GDP</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                But if economic gains are so clear, why do countries decide to close their borders to foreigners?
              </p>

              <p>
                I prefer not to enter the immigration debate directly linked to political elections around the world in the last couple of decades. People are too zoomed-in to see the big picture and think un-emotionally about at least small reductions in immigration restrictions that would create a net gain for most people.
              </p>

              <p>
                The most frequent counter-arguments I hear are:
              </p>

              <p>
                1) Mass migration would create mass poverty. A popular one is that everyone from South America and Africa would move to the U.S., which would, in turn, become a poor country.
              </p>

              <p>
                2) No developed nation would be able to afford the new demand for their welfare programs. How would they keep a quality health system or unemployment protection program in place?
              </p>

              <p>
                3) Terrorism.
              </p>

              <p>
                4) The receiving countries would risk losing their national culture.
              </p>

              <p>
                I can understand people raising these questions. It's just not productive that this is where they stop when they think about freer immigration. They are moved by fear and passion, and no healthy debate can come from that.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you're interested in learning more about such questions, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960/">Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Whatever your view and belief are about this topic, the truth is that at least small improvements can be made. The default logic for immigration law in 2020 is simply cruel.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the things that seem almost always to surprise people is knowing that having a passport and not being able to go to a country because of visa restrictions is a very recent phenomenon.
              </p>

              <p>
                Until 1914, there were no travel restrictions based on where you were born. Anyone could go anywhere. Every individual could make their own decisions about where in the world they would be able to live a better life, as long as they had a way to make it to their desired destination.
              </p>

              <p>
                And then came World War I, security concerns and the introduction of the modern passport as we know it. Germany, France and Italy were the first ones to officialise its use. By the end of the war, the system had global mass adoption.
              </p>

              <p>
                The passport with visa restrictions was supposed to be a temporary "hack". For the next several decades, governments held international conferences to discuss getting rid of passports and restoring the freedom of movement for everyone.
              </p>

              <p>
                But the temporary hack became a complex system with no easy way back. Less than a hundred years later, and we had all got used to it and could not imagine life without it anymore. No matter what, you have to agree we got used to critical loss of freedom.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm optimistic, and the good news is that if you zoom out, you can see the world is moving in the right direction on several fronts. There are still errors and injustices, of course, and the passport in its current form is an example. A mistake, I believe, that will be corrected slowly in the next few decades. I expect we will be talking about passport discrimination, the same way the world is currently talking about discrimination based on gender, skin colour or age, for example. No discrimination can be accepted, and as humans, I expect us to continue learning and evolving.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the meantime, there's a lot more that could be done. A few examples: We could easily have at least ten times more free movement agreements between neighbour countries. The developed countries should be creating more flexible work-holiday programs, open to a much higher number of people than current volumes. And points-based immigration systems could be used as a way to start opening up the most strict and closed countries.
              </p>

              <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/083968dbd06130c23d37ba83019c012ae3a29162/896b4/assets/img/blog/vanuatu-australia-pilot-program.jpg" alt="Vanuatu and Australia Pilot Program"></p><p>
                <i>(Small agreement between Australia and Vanuatu in September 2020)</i>
              </p>

              <p>
                On a final note, our complex immigration programs, which change from country to country, create another substantial barrier: Access to information. I'm building <a href="https://www.duoflag.com/">Duoflag</a> as a side project in a small attempt to have a centralised resource for people to discover and understand their options to migrate to another country. I wish this existed twenty years ago when I was researching my options. If this is something you're also interested in, I would love to hear from you and join forces.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Let's face it, It is not easy to choose a freaking PC these days with the deluge of specifications that come with it let alone FPGAs. The question of using FPGAs to solve any computing problem only arises when an extraordinary performance is required. Owing to this fact, FPGAs in their feature specification and build can be extremely specific to the application at hand. This results in an insane number of varieties in terms of the logic structures within the FPGA as well as the interfaces that are provided with the external world. However, this guide aims to guide you in the right direction (which does not mean dumping a list of the hundreds of different options out there) based on your level of experience and requirement.</p>
<p>There are other posts out there that provide large tables with exhaustive lists of FPGA development boards out there and let you (after a year or two of research) make a choice. If that's your thing, I'll attach some links to help you get started.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>If you're already familiar with the various bells and whistles of  FPGAs and are only looking for some good suggestions, you might prefer to <a href="https://thedatabus.io/fpga-buying-guide#the-top-contenders"><strong>JUMP TO THE LIST OF SUGGESTIONS</strong></a>.  If not, read on to learn some very important stuff about the FPGA world and how to choose better!</em></p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-be-looking-for"><a href="#what-you-should-be-looking-for" aria-label="what you should be looking for permalink"></a>What you should be looking for</h2>
<p>There are already a lot of aspects to an FPGA in general that determine its fit to a particular problem and the ease with which it can be programmed, now add to this the complexity of a feature-rich development board with all sorts of peripherals, interfaces, connectors and memory options you have at hand a humongous task of deciding between hundreds of varieties out there.</p>
<h3 id="soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga"><a href="#soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga" aria-label="soc based board or just an fpga permalink"></a>SOC based board or just an FPGA?</h3>
<p>SOC stands for <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/integrated-circuit/ic-types/system-on-chip/" target="_blank">System-on-Chip</a> which simply means that various interacting technologies are built onto the same die (/chip). You see SOCs everywhere, on your phones, TVs, and computers. In the context of an FPGA development board, a SOC based system means that the hardware has two components, a sea of programmable logic (the FPGA) and a hard processor core implemented in silicon independent of the programmable FPGA logic. Interfaces are created between the programmable logic and the processing system (in Xilinx lingo) that enable communication between the two regions.</p>
<p><img src="https://thedatabus.io/static/zynq7000-ae213195db5b530cc3f5d60785b3b0b1.png" alt="Zynq7000"></p>
<p>If you are an absolute beginner looking for direction, you should definitely choose a SOC based system because of the immense additional learning potential it adds. Having said that, your first few digital design projects should never involve the processor cores or any kind of software programming. For that, you can just ignore the processor logic and dump your design into the programmable region to use it as a normal FPGA. As you progress, you can add much higher levels of complexity to your design by bringing in the processor core to directly read and write data in your configurable hardware. You can also experiment with writing firmware, drivers, the Linux OS, and the higher levels of abstraction thus getting a truly holistic experience of embedded system design. Even the simplest SOC based board will keep you busy for a long time. </p>
<p>These boards can also be of great interest for Software engineers looking to explore into the digital design world since processor + FPGA structures lend themselves very well to paradigms like HLS, Heterogenous computing and partial acceleration of algorithms. Viewing the FPGA logic as an extension of the SOC is something that is going to be very important in the future and is a good investment of your time.</p>
<p>Alternatively, If you are a beginner but are looking only to learn digital design or you wish to buy a board to complement your studies at college where you get to use a particular board in your lab, you can get a lot more basic FPGA resources (LUTs, BRAMs, DSPs) on a Non-SOC based board that has only the FPGA. This way you save money and have a much less complex system at hand that you can comprehend better. The same is true If you plan to implement something specific that takes up an enormous number of resources, you might be better off going for a dev board that has only the FPGA and the required peripherals.</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/9yutk8/best_100300_fpga_development_board_in_2018/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">this post</a> on the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/" target="_blank">r/FPGA</a> user <strong>u/ndbroadbent</strong> has shown the resource usages of several open source projects, this can give you a good idea of how big projects usually are.</p>
<p><strong>An important note for beginners</strong> : <em>Having an SOC board, with all the processor logic around the FPGA can really deviate you from the basic idea of programmable logic and how you're supposed to learn it. I strongly suggest completely disregarding anything to do with the processor for your first few projects and use only the FPGA part of the device. Also note that as of today, any good FPGA engineer will tell you that any form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_synthesis#:~:text=High%2Dlevel%20synthesis%20(HLS),hardware%20that%20implements%20that%20behavior."><strong>HLS</strong></a> is not good enough to be used in real world projects. This is doubly true for the beginners. <strong>DO NOT</strong> fall into the 'Write code in C++/Python and run it on FPGA' trap. A lot of youtubers seem to be promoting stuff like that for beginners these days which is just sad. If you have the money to spend, the ideal (and more enjoyable) learning strategy would be to use a standalone FPGA board first and upgrade to an SOC later.</em></p>

<h3 id="interfaces-and-ios"><a href="#interfaces-and-ios" aria-label="interfaces and ios permalink"></a>Interfaces and IOs:</h3>
<p>FPGAs are excellent tools for working on high-speed interfaces. So you might want to look at the interfaces and IO options a particular development board is providing. This is important because if the board has a particular interface out of the box, the vendor will probably provide the necessary documentation and sample designs for those interfaces. This can save you tons of head-scratching and hair-pulling (trust me that is common in the FPGA world) as a beginner. That's not to say that newer interfaces cannot be added to the board manually but when it comes to High-speed interfaces like Ethernet, HDMI, PCIe, it can be very difficult to add them yourself and expect reliable performance. Low-speed ones like SPI, UART, etc can always be manually added using the GPIOs, so let them not be the dealbreaker for any board.</p>
<p>Some common networking interfaces that you should look for are high-speed interfaces like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" target="_blank"><strong>HDMI</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array" target="_blank"><strong>VGA</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet" target="_blank"><strong>ETHERNET</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express" target="_blank"><strong>PCIe</strong></a>  etc. and low-speed peripherals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface" target="_blank"><strong>SP</strong>I</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" target="_blank"><strong>CAN</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank"><strong>I2C</strong></a>  etc.</p>
<p>Although not as important for a beginner, another set of interfaces that can be useful are the analog and sensor interfaces like ADCs, DACs, Camera Interface, Audio CODECs, etc. These are very niche features that can make or break a particular project if it depends on data acquisition from the external world.</p>
<p>If you choose to go for a board with not too many peripherals for whatever reason, you might be better off choosing one that has the industry-standard <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/" target="_blank"><strong>PMOD</strong></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA_Mezzanine_Card" target="_blank"><strong>FMC</strong></a> connectors installed so that when you do need additional interfaces in the future, they can be added very easily. These standard connectors essentially decouple FPGA carrier boards from the IO engines (which plug-in as daughter cards), enabling you to use the same FPGA boards with a large variety of IO designs without ever having to re-design the board.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="buttons-leds-and-displays"><a href="#buttons-leds-and-displays" aria-label="buttons leds and displays permalink"></a>Buttons, LEDs, and Displays:</h3>
<p>Debugging FPGA designs can be a hard thing. Unlike MCUs where you can place print statements and breakpoints anywhere you want in the code, there is no such equivalent in the FPGA world and that can often lead to great frustration. One workaround is possible, if there are switches and LEDs on your board. They provide an easy way to pull out signals to the real world and give you an indication of the status of some status registers that can help you visualize and debug (like the current state of a state machine or a particular flag in a CPU design). However, this should not be the deciding factor between two boards since it is very easy to add LEDs, buttons, switches, and LCDs using the GPIO connectors without much effort.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="memory-and-resource-count"><a href="#memory-and-resource-count" aria-label="memory and resource count permalink"></a>Memory and Resource Count:</h3>
<p>The Resource Count is another important metric that goes into deciding on an FPGA device. By resource, we mean the number of programmable logic elements available on the board. These can be LUTs (ALMs for Altera), Block Rams, DSPs, and IO blocks. Much more complex and fancier devices like the  <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/acap/versal.html" target="_blank"> Versal family</a> from Xilinx can have lots of other stuff like AI, video, and audio cores, etc. It is important to take note of these resource numbers because they determine the biggest project that you can successfully fit onto the FPGA. It is hard to come up with a fixed count for a particular project owing to differences in the underlying CLB architecture from vendor to vendor and family to family.</p>
<p>FPGAs store the configuration(bitstream) data on the SRAM (usually) cells within the FPGA. Since SRAM is a volatile kindof memory, the program is lost each time the board is power-cycled. A PC support is needed to reprogram it again after the power cycle, to prevent this, FLASH (or EEPROM in older boards) based storage is provided onboard by the vendors. Flash is a non-volatile form of storage that holds the bitstream data even without a power supply. Each time the board comes up after a power cycle, the FPGA checks the flash memory for a bitstream and programs itself with it. This is usually given by default in most boards but can be something important to look out for. </p>
<p>The other important form of memory is the external onboard volatile storage which is most commonly provided in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM" target="_blank">DDR SDRAM</a>  This is extremely useful if you are building an application that needs to store data locally for whatever reason. Since the block ram storage within the FPGA fabric is very little and is very precious, having a DDR that can be written to and read from in a reasonable amount of time is very much essential. The more the better!

        <article>
          <section><p>Operating systems and file systems have traditionally been developed
hand in hand. They impose mutual constraints on each other. Today we
have two major leaders in file system semantics: Windows and <span>POSIX</span>.
They are very close to each other when compared to the full set of
possibilities. Interesting things happened before POSIX monopolized
file system&nbsp;semantics.</p>

<p>When you use a file system through a library instead of going through
the operating system there are some extra possibilities. You are no
longer required to obey the host operating system’s semantics for
filenames. You get to decide if you use <code>/</code> or <code>\</code> to separate
directory components (or something else altogether). Maybe you don’t
even use strings for filenames. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/weinholt/fs-fatfs">fs-fatfs</a> library uses
a list of strings, so it’s up to the caller to define a directory
separator for themselves. While working on that library, I was driven
to write down some ideas that I’ve previously run across and found&nbsp;inspirational.</p>

<p>The very first hierarchical file system was developed for Multics. It
is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.multicians.org/fjcc4.html">A General-Purpose File System For Secondary Storage</a> (1965)
by Robert C. Daley and Peter G. Neumann. There are several things that I find
astounding about this&nbsp;paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were apparently no hierarchical file systems before Multics.
The references do no cite any previous work on this and I haven’t
found&nbsp;any.</li>
<li>Privacy in computing was a big consideration even back&nbsp;then.</li>
<li>Modern hierarchical file system are essentially unchanged from 1965,
but some features disappeared along the&nbsp;way.</li>
<li>There’s a <em>very</em> interesting backup system described in this&nbsp;paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper describes these concepts that we still use&nbsp;today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files.</li>
<li>Directories.</li>
<li>Root&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Working&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Tree name, i.e. the name of a file or directory in the tree
structure. Akin to&nbsp;realpath(3).</li>
<li>Path name, which is like a tree name, but it is conceptually
different because components can be links. The paper used <code>":"</code>
instead of <code>"/"</code> to separate&nbsp;directories.</li>
<li>Relative paths. They used an initial <code>":"</code> in place of <code>"./"</code> (or
empty) and <code>"*"</code> in place of <code>".."</code>. Instead of <code>"cd .."</code> you used
<code>"CHANGEDIRECTORY :*"</code>.</li>
<li>Symbolic&nbsp;links.</li>
<li>Access control using access control lists (showed up relatively
recently in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>).</li>
<li>Read, execute and write modes on files and directories. Execute
on a directory means permission to search it, just as in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>.</li>
<li>Segments and segment numbers (file descriptions and file
descriptors, respectively, if I’m not&nbsp;mistaken).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is said that Unix took inspiration from Multics and simplified
things. What was lost? Whoever implemented the file system for Unix
stopped reading the paper somewhere around subsection 2.3. There are
at least these features we’re&nbsp;missing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Access control lists can define a <span>TRAP</span> for a user. Users can refuse
to use TRAPs and instead get an error. Otherwise TRAPs call a named
function at the time of the access. They can be used to implement
smart files that can e.g. monitor file usage or apply password-based
file&nbsp;locks.</p>
<p>(Someone will undoubtedly insert eBPF into the Linux <span>VFS</span> soon and we
will have invented TRAPs&nbsp;again).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multics fully separated the append mode and the write mode and made
it available to users. You could actually have files and
<em>directories</em> that were writable but not appendable, or appendable
but not writable (or&nbsp;both).</p>
<p>(Append-only <em>files</em> exist on Linux through file attributes settable
by the super user or processes with <code>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</code>. This is
very weak sauce. Immutable directories exist, but not append-only
directories. And of course there is no way to have a writable file
or directory that can’t&nbsp;grow).</p>
</li>
<li>Directory entries that point to secondary storage. <em>This is a game
changer for file system management.</em> More on this&nbsp;below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiple-level-storage-and-backups">Multiple-level storage and&nbsp;backups</h2>
<p>Files in the Multics file system could have directory entries that
point to a secondary storage medium. At the time the secondary media
were tapes, but today they could be mechanical hard drives, <span>USB</span> drives
or network servers. But what is the point of having a file that isn’t
there? It’s really quite clever and it only gets more clever the more
you look at&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>When a Multics system was running out of disk space it could remove
unused files from the primary medium, but keep the directory entries.</strong>
If you then tried to open such a file it would ask you to wait while
the file is being made available. It would issue instructions to the
operator (perhaps later a tape robot) to have them retrieve the
required tapes for restoring the file. Very useful when disks were
small and tapes were&nbsp;plentiful.</p>
<p>But it gets even better when you consider backups. Today if you need
to restore a Linux system from backups you do it this way: find the
oldest full backup and restore it, then restore each incremental
backup, going from oldest to newest. This means that the system can’t
be used until you’ve completely restored it from the backups. With
today’s disk sizes that could take a very, very long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Multics backups are done differently. To restore a completely hosed
system you first restore the system files, which will allow you to
boot. Then you restore the <em>latest</em> incremental backup. After this the
file system will contain the most current directory entries. <strong>Just
restore one incremental backup tape and all the files are already in
their right places. This is <em>much</em> faster than waiting for everything
to be&nbsp;restored!</strong></p>
<p>Why is only the latest incremental backup required to get everything
back in its place and working? The clever part is that the files might
not yet be on the disk. In fact, most files will probably be on
another backup medium. But the most recently used files have been
restored, so you can most likely do useful work already, and all other
files have their directory entries. If you try to open a file that
hasn’t been restored then you’re asked to wait and the operator is
told which tape to put in to get the file&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>Is something like this offered on <em>any</em> <span>POSIX</span>-compatible file&nbsp;system?</p>

<p>The Xerox Alto was also a system of many firsts. It is most famous for
having the first windowing <span>GUI</span>, which inspired Apple’s design, which
then inspired Microsoft’s design. Of course it had a hierarchical file
system with version numbers, and even a network file&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>I would like to highlight the interesting disk structure of the Alto
file system, which is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/an-open-operating-system-for-a-single-user-machine/">An Open Operating System for a Single-User Machine</a> (1979)
by Butler Lampson and Robert F.&nbsp;Sproull.</p>
<p>The designers of the system were concerned about data loss caused by
hardware issues and buggy software. They came up with a feature to
protect the user’s data against loss of any block on the disk. (Unless
the user data was in that lost block, of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>All blocks on the disk have a label that contains these&nbsp;fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>A file&nbsp;identifier</li>
<li>A version&nbsp;number</li>
<li>A page number (block&nbsp;index)</li>
<li>A&nbsp;length</li>
<li>A next link (pointer to the next block in the&nbsp;file)</li>
<li>A previous&nbsp;link</li>
</ul>
<p>The label means that each block is self-identifying. By my count this
type of disk had an additional 14 bytes of label per each 512 byte&nbsp;block.</p>
<p><strong>If the disk structure is damaged then a special program called the
<em>scavenger</em> will iterate over all blocks and recover the structure.</strong>
Contrast this to a file system like ext4 where a damaged structure can
mean that huge swathes of data are rendered&nbsp;inaccessible.</p>
<p><strong>The scavenger was also used to upgrade the disk structure.</strong> Imagine
converting in-place between ext4, btrfs or <span>ZFS</span> by just running a
scavenger for the new disk structure. It would e.g. regard the
existing ext4 metadata as nonsense and build a new disk structure
based on btrfs by using the labels. (It will not work with these
specific file systems, but it demonstrates the&nbsp;principle).</p>
<p>Why don’t we have this today? Nobody wants to build a <span>POSIX</span> file
system that uses labels because the disks we’re using have 512-byte or
4096-byte blocks and no room for a label. A label would have a very
small overhead for each block, but even a very small overhead like
this is not acceptable to file system designers. More seriously, it
would mess up mmap(2). There are disks with slightly larger blocks
meant to store a label, but they are more expensive and not very
common. So we’re left with fragile file system structures and the sage
advice that you’re supposed to have backups anyway (for which, see
previous&nbsp;section).</p>
<p>The best modern alternative is something like Btrfs or <span>ZFS</span>. Blocks are
checksummed and those checksums are stored next to the pointers in the
disk structure. A modern version of the Alto file system should
certainly have checksums, but not using labels gives weaker
protections than what the Alto file system provided. If you want to
see how relevant the Alto file system design is today, just read what
using ZFS protects against, but then remember that it doesn’t use&nbsp;labels.</p>

<p>Hydra is another historical operating system with innovations in the
file system. It is described in the
paper
<a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/os/Qual/papers/hydra.pdf"><span>HYDRA</span>: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System</a> (1974)
by W. Wulf, E. Cohen, W. Corwin, A. Jones, R. Levin, C. Pierson, and
F. Pollack at Carnegie-Mellon&nbsp;University.</p>
<p>Hydra does away with the idea of ownership and a hierarchy of ever
more privileged components. It uses a fundamentally different concept
of protection and security than what <span>POSIX</span> is based&nbsp;on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Technologists like hierarchical structures – they are elegant; but
experience from the real world shows they are not viable security
structures. The problem, then, which <span>HYDRA</span> attempts to face
squarely, is to maintain order in a nonhierarchical&nbsp;environment.”</p>
<p>– <span>HYDRA</span>: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System&nbsp;(1974)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Resources that need protection, such as files, are called <em>objects</em>.
You can apply an <em>operation</em> to an object, such as reading or writing.
But to do so you need a reference to that object, which is called a
<em>capability</em>. You can even know a file’s identity, but without the
reference you can’t do&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>This is similar, but not identical, to a safe programming …</p></section></article></div></div></div>

Fleek's mission is to speed adoption of the DWeb by making it easier for everyone from dedicated developers to everyday internet users to create apps and store files in a decentralized paradigm, positioning them on the vanguard of a "low-code/no-code" movement of platforms, services, and development tools for users at all levels of coding experience.</p> <p>Fleek's product and service portfolio is built on the Fleek Stack of IPFS, <a href="https://textile.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Textile</a>, and <a href="https://filecoin.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filecoin</a>, and deployed via Fleek Edge — infrastructure that combines the distributed peer-to-peer data sharing protocol of IPFS with edge computing to create an exceptionally fast and reliable distributed network. On Fleek Edge, data and information are processed and stored at edge locations geographically close to users' requests, reducing latency for real-time data applications and improving the performance and speed of peer-to-peer interactions.</p> <p>Fleek's service offerings — hosting, storage, and their new Space Daemon suite of developer tools — all utilize Fleek Edge, and can be used on their own or together as needed to put the power of IPFS's decentralized storage architecture into the hands of everyone from everyday internet users looking for file storage to more experienced developers who need low-friction tools for building on IPFS. With Fleek, anyone and everyone can use IPFS to join the decentralized web. For the Fleek team, it's IPFS that makes the DWeb possible, and Fleek wants to make IPFS easier, faster, and more streamlined for everyone.</p> <h3 id="fleek-by-the-numbers"><a href="#fleek-by-the-numbers">#</a> Fleek by the numbers</h3> <div><div><p>&gt;8K</p> <p>IPFS site deployments</p></div><div><p>&gt;8K</p> <p>Fleek URLs and DNSLink records</p></div><div><p>99.99%</p> <p>guaranteed uptime on Fleek Edge</p></div><div><p>150+</p> <p>global Fleek Edge locations</p></div></div> <h2 id="the-story"><a href="#the-story">#</a> The story</h2> <p>Fleek started life as Terminal.co with a simple mission: Build tools that make using the Dweb easier for everyone in order to fuel a faster, more seamless transition from the centralized web of today to the decentralized web of the future. To that end, the team originally launched with a focus on user-friendly tools for building decentralized apps (dapps) interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.</p> <p>But Fleek soon realized that starting with dapps was putting the cart before the horse. Not only is building for dapps and smart contracts a specialized market, but these products themselves are only ever as decentralized as the storage architecture upon which they rely. To truly guide the web's transition to a decentralized future, the team needed a broader approach. That's when Fleek turned to IPFS as the technology that would help them make their vision a reality.</p> <div><p><strong>"We saw that the fastest, simplest, and most direct way to advance the decentralized web is to equip ordinary web users with the tools they need to access and build on IPFS. IPFS offers the data integrity, privacy, and security that we think matter most for the future of the DWeb. And with the right tools, we knew we could give a full hosting experience and seamless workflow — making IPFS as easy to use as a standard website today."</strong></p> <p><em>— Brett Shear, COO, Fleek</em></p></div> <p>The Fleek team decided to pursue a new company direction, with a product roadmap geared toward boosting the accessibility of IPFS-based hosting, storage, and database management. That decision spurred development of an entirely new platform — the Fleek Stack of IPFS, Textile, and (after mainnet launch) Filecoin — with a debut in early 2020.</p> <p>Fleek currently offers three products built on the Fleek Stack, each intended to enhance and streamline the workflow around common DWeb use cases:</p> <ul><li><strong>Fleek Hosting:</strong> Tools for hosting sites and apps on IPFS, including industry-familiar continuous integration and deployment tooling via GitHub.</li> <li><strong>Fleek Storage:</strong> A service for importing, storing, pinning, and fetching files via IPFS that includes a friendly UI in addition to API and CLI interfaces.</li> <li><strong>Space Daemon:</strong> A developer toolset for building peer-to-peer encrypted apps that packages IPFS, Textile Threads and Buckets, and Filecoin into a single JavaScript interface.</li></ul> <p>Each of these products is designed to facilitate IPFS use and integration in as streamlined a manner as possible. Space Daemon, for example, makes it simple for users to leverage IPFS for encrypted database storage and serverless app development. Fleek's hosting and storage offerings automatically handle the IPFS-specific details by auto-updating references to content identifiers (CIDs), TXT values in DNS records, and more.</p> <p>In creating this streamlined workflow for using, building upon, and deploying to IPFS, Fleek empowers developers to integrate the protocol's key benefits — such as peer-to-peer functionality, serverless interactions, and autonomy from centralized hosting — into their sites, products, and apps. What's more, the Fleek Edge network provides significant performance and efficiency boosts that anyone from DWeb newcomers to IPFS veterans can benefit from.</p> <p>In short, Fleek's portfolio offers wide-ranging functionality and a bridge between the legacy web and the DWeb, facilitating many valuable use cases across the end-user and developer space. "One of the biggest barriers to adoption of IPFS by the broader web community is unfamiliarity with the manual work involved in hosting or building on IPFS," says Shear. "Fleek takes care of that work on its own, which ensures that anyone who wants the benefits of hosting their website on IPFS can get them easily and quickly. But even experienced devs can benefit from the ease of use and faster speeds they get with Fleek products deployed on Fleek Edge."</p> <h2 id="ipfs-benefits"><a href="#ipfs-benefits">#</a> IPFS benefits</h2> <p>Fleek chose IPFS because it decentralizes two of the core aspects of the internet: file storage and data transfer. Combined with the inherent advantages of IPFS content addressing and IPFS's position as a fundamental technology in Filecoin, this opens up a host of benefits not available elsewhere:</p> <ul><li><strong>Data integrity in a peer-to-peer world:</strong> Fleek uses IPFS in combination with encryption tools like Textile's, enabling them to offer a best-of-both-worlds paradigm where users get the benefits of client-side encryption (through user-owned keys) as well as the ability to share data directly without touching any third-party servers. Because the transport is encrypted by default, external watchers can't view it in transit, and IPFS's <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">content addressing</a> also ensures that the data a user receives when they make a request is cryptographically verified as the data they asked for.</li> <li><strong>Censorship and disaster reslilience:</strong> IPFS content addressing allows for multiple copies of the same content-addressed resource to exist as equivalent items in multiple locations worldwide. This can offer the potential for a degree of resilience against physical disaster or censorship unavailable on the legacy web.</li> <li><strong>Integrated access to future storage and retrieval markets:</strong> Because IPFS and Filecoin are so tightly integrated, building on IPFS will facilitate the ability to offer Fleek users a seamless way to access the Filecoin marketplace for their storage needs.</li></ul> <p>Additionally, IPFS's vibrant and active community of developers means that the protocol is constantly evolving to better meet the needs of its users and builders.</p> <h2 id="how-fleek-uses-ipfs"><a href="#how-fleek-uses-ipfs">#</a> How Fleek uses IPFS</h2> <p>Fleek creates a simple, streamlined workflow for anyone looking to host, share, or build content on the decentralized web. Fleek provides its own public IPFS gateway, which means that developers don't need to build their own in order to serve their users. The gateway allows even IPFS-ignorant legacy web browsers and apps to access content provided via IPFS.</p> <p>Fleek also automates the process of building and deploying on IPFS. Developers who use Fleek for site and app deployments don't need to do anything except link Fleek with a GitHub repo, and Fleek will automatically build and deploy their code via IPFS.</p> <p>So, what does that look like in action? Since IPFS uses content addressing, every piece of content on IPFS needs its own unique content identifier (CID). This CID is updated with every change to the content with which it is associated. For developers, keeping up with these updates can be a hassle, since it would normally involve manually updating CID pointers or implementing other downstream changes to match a new CID.</p> <p>Fleek handles all that manual work on its own. In the case of a website, Fleek automatically takes the CID generated by IPFS for the site content and points it to a Fleek subdomain URL, using a TXT record added to the DNS settings Fleek creates for the site. Whenever anyone visits that Fleek URL, the most recently associated CIDs are delivered to the user via Fleek's HTTP IPFS gateway — meaning that a request that starts with an HTTP request (such as a legacy web browser) remains HTTP throughout. And any time site content changes, Fleek automatically detects the new hash and re-associates the TXT record accordingly.</p> <p>In short, a developer on Fleek can use familiar tools and workflows without worrying about the manual work that might normally go into using IPFS — while still taking advantage of the benefits provided by the decentralized web.</p> <h3 id="the-tooling"><a href="#the-tooling">#</a> The tooling</h3> <p>At the core of all of Fleek's offerings are <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>go-ipfs</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>ipfs-http-client</code></a>, used out of the box. Nodes on <code>go-ipfs</code> appear throughout the Fleek ecosystem, including:</p> <ul><li>Pinning nodes used by Fleek Hosting and Fleek Storage</li> <li>Nodes for encrypted backups</li> <li>Space Daemon-specific nodes (behind Textile Hub)</li></ul> <p>Platform-wide,…</p></div></div>

        <blockquote><p>Perhaps you are a skilled technologist. But beware: If your personality is as scintillating as a dish rag, you could jeopardize your open source projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8935389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent study</a>, a developer’s personality could significantly impact their contributions to open source projects. The researchers at the University of Waterloo found that social factors, including experience, remain the most influential factors in whether a contributor’s work is accepted or rejected. But the study also found that personality traits play a key role in how their work is perceived.</p>
<p>“People who voluntarily work on open source projects need to be aware of how open they are to change and how conscientious they are, as these two personality traits will impact how willing people are to work with them,” says Meiyappan Nagappan, a professor in Waterloo’s David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science and a co-author of the study, <a href="https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=256663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in&nbsp; a statement.</a></p>
<p>Nobody works in a vacuum. A person’s behavior comes out <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-good-qa-director-and-a-great-one/">when they interact with other people</a>, whether it’s in person, in a Slack channel, or in code comments. Software development often involves <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/4-lessons-software-teams-can-learn-from-rock-bands/">creating a team where it’s comfortable and safe to share ideas</a>. As the researchers note, it’s not enough to complete a task; developers also need to listen and consider other people’s opinions with an open mind. In fact, some developers say, the more diverse personalities on a team, the better the end product.</p>
<p>The researchers collected their data from GitHub. They analyzed the personality traits of 16,935 active developers from 1,860 projects. Each developer had at least 250 pull requests, the process by which GitHub developers notify other open source contributors working on the same project that they completed a task.</p>
<p>The researchers then used the IBM Watson Personality Insights to retrieve the big five personalities of the software developers in GitHub: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.</p>
<p>“We found that social factors are still more important than technical factors in getting your open source work accepted,” says Alex Yun, a master’s student in Waterloo’s faculty of mathematics and another study co-author, in a statement.</p>
<p>The researchers also examined the importance of personality factors. They found that biases may be involved in the acceptance or rejection of open source work. That’s true despite the apparent advantage of open source whereby you can contribute with a level of anonymity; your persona shows in your code and comments. Someone reviews and comments on your work based on what they see in front of them, and not how they know you as a person.</p>
<p>“Managers are more likely to accept a contribution from someone they know, or someone more agreeable than others – even though the technical contribution might be similar,” Yun says.</p>
<h3>Developers are not surprised</h3>
<p>People who work in the open source community agree with the research findings.</p>
<p>“If your work is being reviewed and you immediately shoot down any suggestions made by others, I could then foresee this negatively impacting the views of the decision makers who merge your work,” observes Matthew Arnold, a senior software engineer at global call intelligence provider <a href="https://www.infinity.co/us/">Infinity</a>.</p>
<p>“What’s the adjective for the furthest thing from ‘surprised’? Because whatever that word is describes my reaction to this research finding,’’ says VM (Vicky) Brasseur, an open source leader, speaker, and author of the book, <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/vbopens/forge-your-future-with-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forge Your Future With Open Source.</a> “While the research phrases it academically as ‘personality,’ what they mean is someone’s ability to interact with others: <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">the application of social interaction skills</a> as well as technical skills.”</p>
<p>Those with an extroverted personality likely find it easier to hit “submit” when sending pull requests to open source repositories, Arnold adds. “By submitting this pull request, you’re agreeing to let the internet community review and judge your work. That can be quite daunting, especially when open source projects often attract some of the finest minds in the industry.’’</p>
<p>To some degree, each of us can assess our own capabilities – for good or ill. Arnold’s personality falls into the introverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging (INTJ) personality type within the Myers-Briggs personality assessment. He considers himself to be open and conscientious. But we may see ourselves with a different perspective than do outsiders.</p>
<p>Personality traits have <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">some impact on software development</a>, but social factors are more influential, says Dawn Foster, director of <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource">Open Source Community Strategy</a> &nbsp;at VMware. “In my experience, the social factors have had a bigger impact on my ability to successfully contribute to open source projects.”</p>
<p>Foster describes herself as “primarily conscientious with a bit of agreeableness,” which she says has served her well because &nbsp;she is usually prepared and detail oriented. This “allows people to feel more comfortable relying on me to perform my duties.” Being agreeable helps her empathize with others and make them feel welcome, she says.</p>
<h3>Social factors carry more weight</h3>
<p>Both Foster and Brasseur agree with the Waterloo study finding that social factors are more influential on the likelihood of pull request acceptance of contributions into open source projects.</p>
<p>“Open source communities often feel like very small worlds where I keep running into the same people over and over again,’’ Foster explains. “My past social interactions in previous communities have helped smooth the way for my participation in new ones.”</p>
<p>For example, when Foster started contributing to Kubernetes, she wanted to help out with the Contributor Summit. Because she had worked with several of the organizers on other projects who could vouch for her work, it was relatively easy for her to get involved as an organizer despite being relatively new to the project.</p>
<p>Another example the <a href="https://chaoss.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHAOSS Project</a> where Foster eventually joined its governing board. “Because many of the existing board members and maintainers knew of my past work on open source project health metrics, it allowed me to participate in meaningful ways much more quickly than I might have if I didn’t have those previous social interactions,” Foster says.</p>
<p>Brasseur points out that social interaction is critical not just to a successful open source contribution – but to any endeavor that involves more than one person.</p>
<p>“Collaboration is difficult if not impossible when people aren’t able to interact well, whether due to personal skills, language differences, or some other obstruction,’’ Brasseur says. “We in open source have abundant documentation about the technical aspects of contributing, such as <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/16-things-that-testers-wished-theyd-learned-earlier/">writing tests</a> or the mechanics of sending your contribution for review, but relatively little about the social expectations for that contribution.”</p>
<p>Projects don’t necessarily ignore the social expectations, Brasseur adds. “It’s simply that they rarely document them.”</p>
<p>Like Foster, Arnold says that being open, conscientious, and agreeable has benefited him professionally. These traits have helped him to “gel well with teammates, which to me is a massive benefit.” But, he adds, “I have to be careful, however, that I don’t let this cloud my judgement when receiving feedback around changing how I have done something. I need to make sure I’m not too quick to go with what makes the other person happy.”</p>
<p>The result is a willingness to accept suggestions that go against his initial view. “My impediments tend to come from a lack of extroversion along with levels of neuroticism,” Arnold says, “making experiences such as presenting and training a lot more stressful and anxiety inducing than they necessarily need be.”</p>
<p>Don’t expect arguments. Most developers are agreeable! “The times that I see a pull request being hindered most by personality are when you have a small pool of developers reviewing the work,” Arnold says. In those cases, “The author is implementing review comments without really critiquing the suggestions, which can sometimes cause a reduced level of quality.”</p>
<h3>Being a good communicator speaks volumes</h3>
<p>Someone who is a good communicator always is in demand. <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/so-you-want-to-become-a-software-qa-professional/">Employers are always looking for that soft skill</a> in candidates across industries, says Lusen Mendel, director of developer relations at <a href="https://karat.com/">Karat</a>, which conducts technical interviews for organizations hiring developers.</p>
<p>“Just as <a href="https://www.functionize.com/acceptance-testing-a-step-by-step-guide/">we validate software correctness with tests</a>, it often takes bouncing ideas off a peer to validate the degree of our own understanding and the effectiveness of our insights,’’ Mendel says. “Being a good, concise communicator lets developers quickly identify what information is salient to specific brainstorms, decisions, and open source projects.”</p>
<p>In virtually every interview Karat conducts,&nbsp;regardless of what they were&nbsp;supposed to be evaluating, “Interviewers inevitably tell the hiring manager how the candidate communicated,’’ he notes.</p>
<h3>More change is needed</h3>
<p>While he is not a developer, Jack Wallen, who has covered open source for decades as a journalist, finds that “Developers are very much like artists, in that they can be very sensitive to criticism and place a very high value not only on their work, but on the acceptance of both their work and who they are.”</p>
<p>Many developers pride themselves on their individuality and tend to hold that trait very dear, Wallen says. “That can translate to either being very satisfied with a project, when they and their work are accepted – or walking away when they are not.”</p>
<p>For Wallen, there is another longstanding issue in the development community that needs to be addressed. “It’s become clear that there needs to be significant improvement in the way the development community treats people of color, women, and members of the LGBTQ community,” he says. “At this point, there must be a zero tolerance for unwanted or unequal treatment.”</p>
<p>Wallen says he knows very talented developers who have been affected by this. “And …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>Nobody wakes up in the morning excited to deal with a SOC 2 audit, but completing one will help your company grow and close larger deals faster. SOC 2 covers <em>a lot</em>, and it’s not just an engineering checkmark - but if you’re a developer at a not-huge company going through SOC 2 compliance, chances are you’ll need to get involved. This guide will cover everything you need to know from a technical perspective, from basic access controls to encrypting data at rest. <em>‍</em></p><p><em>(Note: this guide is NOT a comprehensive assessment of what you’ll need to pass SOC 2 compliance, nor is it legal advice. The goal here is just to help developers understand what they’ll need to do to make sure that tech and infrastructure aren’t holding things up.)</em></p><h2>What SOC 2 is and why it's important</h2><p><em>SOC 2</em> is a certification – an objective third party checking your company out – developed by the AICPA, one of the big “governing bodies” of accountants in the U.S (riveting, I know). The way it works is that you hire an auditor to investigate how secure and trustworthy your company is, fill in any holes they identify, and then they certify you as SOC 2 compliant. Once you’ve passed an audit, you can display the SOC 2 logo on your site, tell your customers and leads that you’re compliant, and close those bigger deals. </p><p>The important thing about SOC 2 is that it’s not just a stamp for giant enterprises - like <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">SSO</a> and <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-directory-sync-scim">Directory Sync</a>, even fast growing startups are starting to require more advanced security measures before engaging with vendors. And as we’ll see in a bit, most of what you’ll need to work on to be SOC 2 compliant overlaps a lot with engineering best practices anyway. So if you’re considering whether SOC 2 compliance is worth it for your company, it might be a realistic fit earlier than you think - and help you stand out to potential customers.</p><p>Now if you’re thinking that SOC 2 implies the existence of a SOC 1, you’d be right, but SOC 1 is a lot less popular among SaaS startups. It’s generally a lower lift certification and doesn’t meet the security requirements that those larger deals are looking for. There’s also a SOC 3, but same story here - generally not the focus for the customers you’re trying to woo. SOC 2 is the big one.</p><p>So what exactly are these auditors looking for? What makes your company SOC 2 compliant? The answer, weirdly enough, is that criteria are subjective and company-specific - the auditor you work with will put together a plan. Generally, they’re looking for a few things:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>There’s quality <strong>oversight of the company</strong> as a whole (performance reviews, independent voices, background checks, etc.)</li><li>The <strong>SDLC</strong> (software development lifecycle) is transparent, trackable, and controlled (issue tracking, unit testing, version control, etc.)</li><li>Your <strong>application and underlying infrastructure</strong> are secure and monitored (encryption, logging, APM, vulnerability scans, etc.)</li><li>You’ve implemented <strong>access controls</strong> for internal services and SaaS (de-provisioning accounts, 2FA, malware detection, etc.)</li></ul><p>If a lot of these examples look familiar to you, it’s because you’ve probably already implemented them. The good news about SOC 2 is that as it relates to engineering, the requirements are generally pretty agreeable and a lot of modern SWE orgs already have issue tracking, review pipelines, vulnerability checks, and a good amount of the remaining checks auditors will be looking for. </p><p>We’ll dive into the SDLC, app and infrastructure, access controls, and then take a look at how you can save time with pre-built software like <a href="https://www.vanta.com/">Vanta</a> that takes care of a lot of the annoying work you need to do for SOC 2, like policy generation.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>The SDLC</strong>‍</h2><p>Your auditor will put together a list of concrete checks that you’ll need to either (a) provide evidence that you’ve already done, or (b) get started on doing. Again - this is not a comprehensive list, but it should help you get started and think about what auditors will be looking for.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Issue Tracking</strong>‍</p><p>Any “issues” that relate to the core business - new features, products, bugs, vulnerabilities, etc. - should be tracked. There are a hundred ways to do this - if you’re at a bigger company you’re probably using <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a>, the cool kids are using <a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a>, and there’s also <a href="https://clubhouse.io/">Clubhouse</a>, <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub Issues</a>, and many many more. The auditors are just looking to make sure known problems don’t slip through the cracks, and when a problem arises it’s dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.<br></p><figure id="w-node-361755762ee0-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f4fb0d32ee58930e6b6eb82_image%20(6).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>They might ask for a sample of your tracked issues over a given time period. You’ll save yourself a bunch of time down the road by finding a way to link commits and PRs to specific tickets, e.g. via a naming convention (BUG-453-fix-broken-dropdown).<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Change Testing and Review Cycles</strong>‍</p><p>Auditors will be looking for documented policies that govern how you track, test, approve, and validate changes to your core application. Now ideally if you’re reading this, you’re not pushing directly to master - you’ve got a staging environment set up and a pull request process with required reviewers. Internal documentation might suffice here, but you’ll probably need to generate a policy (something Vanta can help with - more on that later).</p><p>If you’re working via a monorepo, building foolproof review cycles is pretty easy (it’s just a setting in GitHub). But if you’ve got a bunch of repositories all constantly changing, they should all ideally require reviews before merging in changes. Even if there’s only one engineer pushing code, laptops can get lost or stolen, and auditors will want to see that extra security to bestow the SOC 2 stamp.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Application and infrastructure</strong></h2><p>Here, auditors are trying to verify that your app is generally reliable, trackable, and that you fix things quickly when they come up. Again - all things that you probably already care about.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Encryption</strong>‍</p><p>You’ll generally want to encrypt customer data at rest, and make sure that sensitive requests (especially if they’re auth or customer data related) are encrypted in transit/motion (e.g. HTTPS). Ideally your site and app have SSL enforced, your certificate isn’t expired (duh), and there aren’t any known issues. Some auditors will also require an encryption policy that describes your company’s approach to encryption.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ APM / Monitoring</strong>‍</p><p>To be SOC 2 compliant, you’ll need to set up a basic application monitoring system, either in house or via a vendor like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>. Auditors will also be interested in <em>what you do with this information</em> - how often is there downtime? How quickly does it get resolved? You might need to provide screenshots of outage statistics via your APM tool, and evidence that you resolved the issue via your issue tracking software. These usually come in the form of a post mortem / analysis and remedy of the root cause.</p><p>It’s not a given, but some auditors will specifically require that you set up a Load Balancer to handle traffic, and monitor that Load Balancer as well as your core app.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Logging and Backups</strong>‍</p><p>Auditors will be looking for centralized logging from your app into a secure spot, via something custom like flat files, Elasticsearch, or an out of the box setup like Heroku (if you’re running on PaaS). You might be asked for daily backups - auditors are generally more concerned with your app’s data than your app itself, so if you’re using something like RDS, you can rely on their backup to S3 feature.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Vulnerabilities</strong>‍</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this is a major focus of the audit process, even if it’s not a common day-to-day occurrence. Auditors are basically looking for 3 major things here:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>There’s a safe way for anyone (literally, anyone) to notify your company of vulnerabilities</li><li>Your team is proactively checking for vulnerabilities via review meetings and software</li><li>When a vulnerability gets uncovered, your team fixes it </li></ol><p>You’ll want to set up an email inbox for disclosing vulnerabilities (e.g. <a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a2d1c7c1d7d0cbd6dbe2d5cdd0c9cdd18cc1cdcf"><span data-cfemail="41322422343328353801362e332a2e326f222e2c">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>), put together a policy for how you handle incident response, and (if relevant) provide evidence that you’ve resolved any major vulnerabilities (i.e. a post-mortem). Auditors will also look for proactive vulnerability scanning. If you’re running on managed infrastructure like Heroku, they do a lot of that for you. GitHub will also <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies">notify you of any dependencies with known vulnerabilities</a>.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Access controls / SaaS</strong></h2><p>This is where things get a bit tedious. In addition to your core infra (AWS or whatever cloud you’re using), chances are you’re using a bunch of SaaS like PagerDuty, Segment, GitHub, and the like, some cloud based and some (potentially) on prem. Auditors are looking for rigid access controls: only relevant team members should have access to customer data and applications, and access needs to be revoked when employees leave the company.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Core Infrastructure Access</strong>‍</p><p>Auditors will be looking for even stricter controls when it comes to managing core infra. In practice, this means a robust IAM setup in AWS (or your cloud provider of choice) with clear lines between admins and non-admins, and a review process for adding new folks to the organization. You might need to prove that review via a screenshot of someone asking permission, or something along those lines.</p><p>As part of this review, you’ll probably end up needing to remove users from accounts that they previously had access to. Early on in the company lifecycle things are pretty free rein, but auditors will want to make sure that if you have no business querying the warehouse, you’re not on BigQuery.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ De-provisioning Users</strong>‍</p><p>If an employee leaves the company or gets terminated, their access to all company accounts - infrastructure, SaaS, any anything else - needs to be revoked, and auditors will often look for this to happen within one business day of the employee’s last day with the company. You’ll probably need to do this manually for the first couple of years in the company lifecycle, but eventually you’ll want to <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-directory-sync-scim">set up Directory Sync so computers can do it for you</a>.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ MFA</strong>‍</p><p>Any method for accessing customer data needs to be protected by (at least) …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/how-metrics-lead-to-effective-sprint-retrospectives" data-title="How Metrics Lead to Effective Sprint Retrospectives">
<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective">Atlassian’s playbook</a>, it states that Sprint Retrospective’s goal is to&nbsp;<em>identify how to improve teamwork by reflecting on what worked, what didn’t, and why.</em>&nbsp;Usually, the meeting consists of brainstorming what the team did well and what the team needs to do better.</p>



<p>During my journey, I’ve been in many of these meetings, sometimes participating, sometimes facilitating. I’ve noticed that writing down post-its is painful for some people. When everybody is speaking, engineers get stuck and can’t think of anything else during the meeting.</p>



<p>Then, right after the meeting is over, many situations and problems emerge. They would like to discuss those topics. However, they wait a couple of weeks for the next meeting. Rarely they remember the issue. I don’t think the meeting gets as effective as it could.</p>



<p>To increase effectiveness, I think managers should promote a culture in which people raise their hands when the problems occur. They should discuss as soon and fresh in their mind as possible.</p>



<p>If the issue needs a more extended discussion, the team can add it to Evernote, Notion, GitHub Gist, or any other shareable document. A couple of sentences telling the problem with a little context would do the job.</p>



<p>The team can do the same as what did well. More post-its may pop up during the meeting. Then, the Scrum Master or facilitator can read the document.</p>



<p>When the meeting starts, the team already has a list of essential items to discuss. It saves time and makes it more productive.</p>



<p>So, how can teams make Sprint Retrospective meetings even more effective?</p>

<h2>Using Pull Request Lead Time &amp; Throughput in Sprint Retrospectives</h2>



<p>I’ve been talking about <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/software-engineering-kpis-how-to-choose-the-best-fitting-metrics">Pull Request Lead Time and Throughput</a> for a while. If you’re familiar with the term Cycle Time, I recommend reading my article on why&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/why-you-should-use-lead-time-instead-of-cycle-time">I rather use Lead Time instead of Cycle Time</a>.</p>



<p>To be explicit, in this article, Pull Request Lead Time measures how many days a Pull Request takes to be merged, and Throughput is the number of merged Pull Requests.</p>



<p>These two metrics can truly help teams to understand how they are performing. Besides, teams benefit from them when they look for the variability along the weeks. The data bring valuable insights and allow teams to question their decisions.</p>



<p>Let me explain through an example.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="654" height="295" src="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24.png" alt="" srcset="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24.png 654w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24-300x135.png 300w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24-300x135@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px"><figcaption>Lead Time and Throughput – Chart provided by SourceLevel</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I took this chart as an example. Let’s say we’re back in January 2020. We’ve started the Sprint Retrospective creating post-its for the team’s issues and appraisals during the last weeks of December 2019.</p>



<p>We’ve discussed a bit, and now someone shares the chart above to analyze the Pull Request Lead Time and Throughput.</p>



<p>If the sprint is two-weeks long, we could use the metrics to ask ourselves questions like this:</p>



<ul><li>Why did we merge less Pull Requests in the week of Dec 2nd compared to Nov 25th?</li><li>What did we do in the week of Nov 25th that allowed us to merge more Pull Requests than the last few Sprints?</li><li>Why did the Lead Time increase in the week of Dec 2nd?</li></ul>



<p>Asking this kind of question is fundamental. However, nobody should point fingers or blame other people. That’s not healthy nor effective.</p>



<p>I would expect answers like this:</p>



<ul><li>We merged less Pull Requests in the last week because we had a massive refactoring going on.</li><li>In the Week of Nov 25th, we fixed several small bug fixes that popped up after deploying a problematic feature in the week before.</li><li>The Lead Time increased because everyone held their reviews, and we made a task force to merge the refactoring.</li></ul>



<p>The numbers themselves don’t matter as much as the story behind them. Now it’s time to ask what are learnings from the last iteration. Here are some alternatives to address those issues:</p>



<ul><li>Should we avoid massive refactorings because they slow down everyone? Should we make it part of the team’s guidelines?</li><li>Deploying complex features may lead to a higher escaped bugs rate. How to minimize the impact? Should we invest more effort into testing? Should we deliver smaller changes? Should we adopt a more incremental approach? Should we consider a gradual rollout?</li><li>Was the task force an effective strategy? Maybe fewer people working on the refactoring at the same time ships it faster.</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, the data allow teams to derive relevant aspects for the Retrospective. The discussion is a tremendous source of knowledge and should generate insights for improving the development flow.</p>



<h2>In short</h2>



<p>Sprint Retrospectives can be more effective using metrics. The team can extract valuable knowledge by questioning the Pull Request Lead Time and Throughput. Indeed, other metrics are useful, as well.</p>



<p>The crucial point is to use the metrics to distill tacit knowledge and formalize it. What went well and what went wrong should promote changes in the process, feed guidelines, and motivate new practices.</p>



<p>That’s what an effective Sprint Retrospective is about, in my opinion.</p>

Like letters in the alphabet, they can be used to form words, phrases and sentences that would constitute a larger part of the mathematical lexicon. \[ \begin{gather*}x  \longrightarrow x+1 \longrightarrow (x+1)^2 \longrightarrow (x+1)^2 \ge 0 \\ \longrightarrow \forall x \in \mathbb{R} [ (x+1)^2 \ge 0 ] \end{gather*} \]  A math symbol can be used for different <strong>purposes</strong> from one mathematical subfield to another (e.g., $\sim$ as logical negation and similarity of triangle), just as multiple symbols can be used to delineate the same concept or relation (e.g., $\times$ and $\cdot$ in multiplication).</p><p>A basic understanding about mathematical terminology is essential to a solid foundation in higher mathematics. To that end, the following is a compilation of some of the most well-adapted, <strong>commonly-used symbols</strong> in mathematics.</p><p>Moreover, these symbols are further categorized by their <strong>function</strong>&nbsp;into tables.

In some occasions, a constant might be regarded as a variable in the larger context.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.empirical.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the_losers_game.pdf">this essay</a> which discusses changes in investment strategy in the 1970’s. In it, Charles Ellis talks about the difference between a <strong>winner’s game</strong> and a <strong>loser’s game</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Expert tennis is what I call a Winner’s Game because the ultimate outcome is determined by the actions of the winner. Victory is due to winning more points than the opponent wins – not, as we shall see in a moment, simply to getting a higher score than the opponent, but getting that higher score by winning points.</p><p>Amateur tennis, Ramo found, is almost entirely different. Brilliant shots, long and exciting rallies and seemingly miraculous recoveries are few and far between. On the other hand, the ball is fairly often hit into the net or out of bounds, and double faults at service are not uncommon. The amateur duffer seldom beats his opponent, but he beats himself all the time. The victor in this game of tennis gets a higher score than the opponent, but he gets that higher score because his opponent is losing even more points.</p><p>…</p><p>In other words, professional tennis is a <strong>Winner’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the winner – and amateur tennis is a <strong>Loser’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser.</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to talk about winning or losing in programming? What does success look like? I think that is a hard question, which could probably fill several blog posts, but I think a good working definition for us is “producing high quality code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, either by oneself or as part of a team, that helps to solve some problem for an end user”. Based on this definition, it seems to me that professional programming is somewhat of a losers game, at least for most of us.</p><p>I will concede that perhaps in fast moving startups, or for those involved in bleeding-edge research, there is an element of succeeding by “winning points”. Developing a faster algorithm, or determining some incredibly innovative way to implement a feature may help you succeed. However, I believe for a lot of professional programmers, succeeding comes from focusing on not “losing points” - causing bugs or producing unfathomable code, for example<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>When we consider programming with this in mind, it highlights the importance of some of the less glamorous elements of our field as a viable strategy for success. As you approach your next project, ask yourself, how can you avoid losing?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Which itself was taken from the work of Simon Ramo in his book <em>Extraordinary Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>By “high quality code” I mean code that is clean, understandable and that produces few bugs in normal operation. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote"><p>There has been some discussion on this piece on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iqctuy/programming_is_losers_game">lobste.rs</a> and it has highlighted a point that I need to clarify. I am not trying to claim that programming <em>is</em> a game, but rather it represents a scenario where we are working towards a goal, and perhaps one of the best strategies for achieving that goal is to avoid actions that frustrate your attempts to reach it. In tennis, that goal would be to win the match and a strategy you can pursue is to avoid hitting the net, rather than focussing on trying to outsmart your opponent with a clever backhand. For programmers, that goal may be to produce high quality software, and a strategy to pursue is to be extra careful to avoid bugs, rather than implement some very complex algorithm. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></section></div>]]>

<p>EC2 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html">instance profiles</a> allow you to attach an IAM role to an EC2 instance. This allows any application running on the instance to access certain resources defined in the role policies. Instance profiles are usually recommended over configuring a static access key as they are considered more secure and easier to maintain.</p>



<ol><li>Instance profiles do not require users to deal with access keys. There is one less secret to securely store and one less secret that can leak. </li><li>Instance profiles can be replaced or removed using EC2 API or in EC2 Console. There is no need to make your application configuration dynamic to change or revoke permissions.</li><li>Instance profiles, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html">roles in general</a>, provide temporary credentials per-use. If those credentials leak, the damage is contained to their lifespan.</li></ol>

<p>But how does an application running on EC2 use this instance profile? Where do the credentials come from? How does this work without any application configuration change?</p>



<p>EC2 shares the credentials with the application through the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">metadata service</a>. Each instance can access this service through <code><a href="http://169.254.169.254/" rel="nofollow">http://169.254.169.254</a></code> (unless disabled) and EC2 will expose instance-specific information there. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html">exposed information</a> includes AMI id, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-add-user-data.html">user-data</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-identity-documents.html">instance id and IPs</a>, and more.</p>



<p>The instance profile credentials are exposed on <code><a href="http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/" rel="nofollow">http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/</a></code>. When you <code>curl</code> this URL on an EC2 instance, you will get the name of the instance profile attached to the instance. When you <code>curl</code> the same URL with the instance profile name at the end, you get the temporary credentials as JSON. The metadata service will return access key id, secret access key, a token, and the expiration date of the temporary credentials. Behind the scenes it is using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html">STS AssumeRole</a>.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="878" data-permalink="https://kichik.com/image-7/" data-orig-file="https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png" data-orig-size="1986,874" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-7" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=809" src="https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=1024 1024w, https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=150 150w, https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=300 300w, https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png?w=768 768w, https://kichik.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/image-7.png 1986w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>All this data can be used to configure any application to use the role attached to the instance profile. You just have to be careful not to use it past the expiration date. You must also remember to check for new temporary credentials once the expiration date passes. If you are going to use these credentials manually, remember that the token is required. Normal user access keys don’t have a token, but temporary credentials require it.</p>



<p>To save you on <code>curl</code> calls and to automate this process further, all AWS SDKs check the instance profile for credentials first. As you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/e70cc1d46d9301cc12266c4666759de4afec9dbb/botocore/utils.py#L393-L446">source code</a>, this is exactly what the Python SDK, <a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore">botocore</a>, does to get credentials from the instance profile. In the end, everything just works as expected, and no application configuration is required.</p>

                                interested in learning about Zoom's growth strategies.

  <div>
    <p>For the past few months, I’ve been running a handful of SSH Honeypots on some
cloud providers, including <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a>,
<a href="https://m.do.co/c/b2cffefc9c81">DigitalOcean</a>, and
<a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1380239&amp;u=2497236&amp;m=46483&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">NameCheap</a>.
As opposed to more complicated honeypots looking at attacker behavior, I decided
to do something simple and was only interested in where they were coming from,
what tools might be in use, and what credentials they are attempting to use to
authenticate.  My dataset includes 929,554 attempted logins over a period of a
little more than 3 months.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a big surprise, I’ll go ahead and let you down easy: my
analysis hasn’t located any new botnets or clusters of attackers.  But it’s been
a fascinating project nonetheless.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="honeypot-design">Honeypot Design</h2>

<p>With a mere 200ish lines of Go, I implemented a honeypot server using the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh?tab=doc"><code>golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</code></a>
library as the underlying implementation.  I advertised a portable OpenSSH
version as the server version string (sent to clients on connection).  I then
logged each connection to a SQLite database, including the timestamp, IP
address, client version, and credentials used to (attempt to) authenticate.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-credentials">Analysis of Credentials</h2>

<p>In a surprise to absolutely nobody, <code>root</code> is by far the most commonly tried
username for login sessions.  I suspect there must be many attackers trying
lists of passwords with just <code>root</code> as the username, as 78% of attempted logins
were with username <code>root</code>.  None of the remainder of the top 10 are particularly
surprising, although <code>usuario</code> was not one I expected to see.  (It is Spanish
for <code>user</code>.)</p>

<p>Blank passwords are the most common attempted passwords, followed by other
obvious choices, like <code>123456</code> and <code>password</code>.  Just off the top 10 list was a
surprising choice of password: <code>J5cmmu=Kyf0-br8CsW</code>.  Interestingly, a Google
search for this password only finds other people with experience running
credential honeypots.  It doesn’t appear in any of the password wordlists I
have, including <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists</a> and
others.  If anyone knows what this is a password for, I’d love to know.</p>

<p>There were a number of other interesting passwords such as <code>7ujMko0admin</code>, used
for a bunch of networked DVRs, and also known to be used by malware attacking
IoT devices.  There are other passwords that don’t look obvious to a US-centric
view of the world, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>baikal</code> – a lake in Siberia</li>
  <li><code>prueba</code> – Spanish for test</li>
  <li><code>caonima</code> – a Mandarin profanity written in Pinyin</li>
  <li><code>meiyoumima</code> – Mandarin for “no password”</li>
  <li><code>woaini</code> – Mandarin for “I love you”</li>
  <li><code>poiuyt</code> – <strike>The name for an optical illusion also known as the "devil's tuning
fork"</strike> <strong>Edit:</strong> multiple redditors pointed out this is the begginning
of the top row of the keyboard from right to left.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also dozens and dozens of keyboard walks, like <code>1q2w3e</code>, <code>1qaz@WSX</code>,
and <code>!QAZ2wsx</code>.  There are many more that took me much longer to realize they
were keyboard walks, such as <code>4rfv$RFV</code> and <code>qpwoei</code>.</p>

<p>It has actually fascinated me to look at some of the less obvious passwords and
discern their background.  Many are inexplicable, but I assume they are from
hardcoded passwords in devices or something along those lines.  Or perhaps
someone let their cat walk across the keyboard to generate it.  I’ve certainly
had that experience.</p>

<p>Overall, the top 10 usernames and top 10 passwords (not necessarily together)
are:</p>

<p>Again, no real surprises here.  <code>ubnt</code> is a little bit higher than I would have
thought (for Ubiquiti networking gear) but I suppose there’s a fair bit of their
gear on the internet.  It’s interesting to see the mix of “lazy admin” and
“default credentials” here.  It’s <em>mildly</em> interesting to me that all substrings
of the first 10 digits (3 or longer) are included, <em>except</em> for 7 digits.  I
guess 7 digit passwords are less common?</p>

<h2 id="timing-information">Timing Information</h2>

<p>Though I imagine these kind of untargeted scans are long-term processes
continually running, I decided to check and see what the timing looked like
anyway.  Neither the day of week analysis nor the hour of day analysis look
like there’s any significant variance.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/days_of_week.png" alt="Day of Week">
<img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/hours.png" alt="Hour of Day"></p>

<p>Looking at the number of login requests over the time period where I’ve been
running the honeypots shows the traffic to be intermittent.  While I didn’t
expect the number to be constant, the variance is much higher than I expected.
I imagine a larger sample size and more nodes would probably make the results
more even.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/dates.png" alt="Day of Study"></p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-sources">Analysis of Sources</h2>

<p>So where are all of these requests coming from?  I want to start by noting that
<em>none</em> of my analysis is an attempt to attribute the actors making the requests
– that’s just not possible with this kind of data.  There’s two ways to look at
the source of requests – in terms of the network, and in terms of the (assumed)
geography.  My analysis relied on the IP to ASN and IP to Country data provided
by <a href="https://iptoasn.com/">iptoasn.com</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the country-level data, networks from China lead the pack by a long
shot (62% of all login attempts), followed by the US.</p>

<p>Again, I’m not claiming that these countries mean anything other than location
of the autonomous system (AS) that originates the requests.  I also did not do
individual IP geolocation, so the results should be taken with a small grain of
salt.</p>

<p>So what networks are sourcing this traffic?  I have the <a href="https://systemoverlord.com/static/attachments/gopot/asns.csv">full AS counts and

<p>Chinanet is no surprise given the high ratio of China in general.  OVH is a
low-cost host known to have liberal AUP, so is popular for both malicious and
research purposes.  DigitalOcean and Microsoft, of course, are popular cloud
providers.  Surprisingly, AWS only sourced about 600 connections, unless they
have a large number of IPs on a non-Amazon ASN.</p>

<p>Overall, traffic came from 27,448 unique IPv4 addresses.  Of those, more than 11
thousand sent only a single request.  At the other end of the spectrum, the top
IP source sent 64,969 login requests.</p>

<p>Most hosts sent relatively few requests, the large numbers are outliers:</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/ipcnts.png" alt="IP Count Graph"></p>

<p>Surely, by now a thought has crossed your mind: how many of these requests are
coming from Tor?  Surely the Tor network is a wretched hive of scum and villany,
and the source of much malicious traffic, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/tor.png" alt="Tor Graph"></p>

<p>Not at all.  Only 219 of the unique source IPs were identified as Tor exit
nodes, representing only 0.8% of the sources.  On a per-request basis, even a
smaller percentage of requests is seen from Tor exit nodes.</p>

<h2 id="client-software">Client Software</h2>

<p>Remember – this is self-reported by the client application, and just like I can
spoof the server version string, so can clients.  But I still thought it would
be interesting to take a brief look at those.</p>

<p>You know, I didn’t expect that.  <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> as the top
client strings.  (Also not sure what to make of the case difference.)  I wonder
if people are building the PuTTY SSH library into a tool for scanning or
wrapping the binary in some kind of script.</p>

<p>Go, paramiko, and libssh are less surprising, as they’re libraries designed for
integration.  It’s hard to know if the OpenSSH requests are linked into a
scanning tool or just wrapped versions of the SSH client.  At some point in the
future, I might dive more into this and trying to figure out which software uses
which libraries (at least for the publicly-known tools).</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I was hoping to find something earth-shattering in this research.  Instead, I
found things that were much as expected – common usernames and passwords,
widespread scanning, large numbers of requests.  One thing’s for sure though:
connect it to the internet and someone’s going to pwn it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As a startup founder, I frequently receive questions from friends, family, acquaintances, about how this mysterious fundraising process works. In short, <a href="https://www.startups.com/library/playbooks/funding/structure-your-fundraise"><u>raising venture capital</u></a> funds is a business deal in which you exchange equity, or a percentage of company ownership, for the capital your business needs to grow, in the form of investment funds.</p><p>Rapidly just raised our Seed round in February and now I am currently in the process of raising our Series A in the midst of COVID-19 and a faltering economy. From the early days of Rapidly, I knew the importance of enlisting help from a trusted accountant and I am now able to utilize our organized financial recordkeeping in my venture capital fundraising process.</p><h2>The Importance of Financial Planning Before Raising Capital</h2><p>As part of the venture capital process, it is mandatory that you understand your numbers, your growth rate, your burn rate. You should have a sense of what type of historical growth you need to be able to show in order to get a VC who is going to be interested in funding your company.</p><p>Founders want to quickly establish your cadence and relationship with your accountant or bookkeeper. Every company has to have this: either a third party person handling this, or you have a CFO function. You want to have a pulse on managing these things, with tracking revenues, costs, cash flow. Record keeping and paying your taxes are of utmost importance, for example with payroll, for both for due diligence by investors and general compliance purposes. Not getting your ducks in a row can have longer-lasting effects. Just this year with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), many businesses were ineligible due to having their employees classified as contractors rather than W-2 employees.</p><p>You want to have an accountant on your roster as early as you can, whether that’s when you incorporate your company, get your first paying customer, or hire your first employee. From Day 1, you should think about your financial recordkeeping and prepare for the future of your business by staying up-to-date with your books.</p><p>An added benefit of having a tax and accounting professional on your side is that they can bring their expertise of which bookkeeping and payroll software are going to be best for your business, rather than you trying to compare 10 different options.</p><h2>Your Due Diligence Essentials</h2><p>You want to have your base level due diligence items all together and ready before reaching out to investors. Even though you’ve prepared all documents before reaching out to investors, provide only what is asked for, when it is requested.&nbsp;</p><p>You will want to wait until after you receive a term sheet from investors to provide company financial information and documentation. You only want to show your company’s proprietary information to those who are serious about investing, not just someone who is considering investing in a competitor and wants your competitive intel. Prior to a term sheet, you would want to answer base level questions that they request, but not necessarily share your documents. I use Carta’s Deal Rooms feature just for transferring documents to potential investors.</p><h2>Required Due Diligence Items</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization-table.asp"><u>Capitalization Table</u></a> with a summary of all shareholder equity</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plstatement.asp#:~:text=The%20profit%20and%20loss%20(P%26L,synonymous%20with%20the%20income%20statement."><u>Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L)</u></a> statements with records of revenues, costs, expenses, in a given time period</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp"><u>Cash Flow</u></a> statements with a summary of all incoming transaction through operations, investments, and financing</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp"><u>Balance Sheet</u></a> with the company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity</p></li><li><p><a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/modeling/types-of-financial-models/"><u>Financial Models</u></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><ul><li><p>One model if the business continues to grow month over month for 12 and 24 months</p></li><li><p>A second model if the business does not make any further month for the next 12 months, illustrating how long the business can run if things go south for our business during this time (very essential during a post-COVID world)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Cohort analysis from your customer data</p><ul><li><p>Paid customers/users month over month</p></li><li><p>New users acquired month over month</p></li><li><p>Month over month churn</p></li><li><p>Month over month retention</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>How to Choose Your Accountant</h2><p>Timeliness and a good relationship with your accountant as additional questions or last-minute requests from investors come up during the fundraising process. This is why it’s best to have everything prepared before you begin your fundraising round. Shameless plug here Rapidly is a great starting point to start a long term relationship with a vetted accountant.</p><p>If you’re new to working with an accountant, you will want someone who has experience with startups, understands your revenue model, and your specific vertical. If you’re early stage and raising venture capital, you’re most likely not yet profitable, and your accountant should understand that in the short term your expenses are going to be more than your revenue.</p><p>Your accountant should be able to include stories from your user data (revenue, acquisition costs, churn rate, customer lifetime value, burn rate, revenue pipelines) in their financial modeling numbers of historical and projected KPI’s. Timeliness and a good relationship with your accountant as additional questions or last-minute requests from investors come up during the fundraising process. This is why it’s best to have everything prepared.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<h2>A potential solution</h2>
<p>Use your slow days to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proactively plan your creativity time and to;</li>
<li>Align your energy level with tasks for the rest of the week.</li>
</ol>
<p>I find this approach super helpful.</p>
<p>It is an idea adapted from <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremiahdillon">Jeremiah Dillon</a>, previously Head of Product Marketing at Google for 9 years. </p>
<p>At Google, Dillon <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3054571/the-better-time-management-strategy-this-googler-taught-his-coworkers">sent an email</a> that encouraged employees to set aside more time for <em>Maker Time — our creativity and thinking time —</em> instead of having endless busy times, back to back.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noc-DKZoNGU">2-minute video</a> on this concept.

<p><strong>In summary: first set aside more time for creativity by reducing the amount of busy times you have. Then align your days throughout the week with your energy level.</strong></p>
<p>Make sense? </p>
<p>Let’s go a little bit deeper into each of these.</p>
<h2>Set aside more time for creativity</h2>
<p>You want your plan to drive down busy time while also increasing maker time. </p>
<p>

  </a>
    
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>The higher your busy time, the lower your maker time; but you can plan ahead more maker time by reducing your busy time.</em></p>
<p>The chart moves from 100% busy time to 100% maker time.</p>
<p>But 100% maker time is an idealistic state. We most likely will never get there. And that’s fine. Think of it as a form of stretch goal.</p>
<p>If you picture the top left corner of the graph, most busy people reside there: <em>busy, exhausting, working on back-to-back tasks</em>. So when a day starts out slow, guilt immediately follows because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>I should be doing a ton of work right now but I’m not! I really don’t feel like doing anything.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more realistic place to shoot for is somewhere, a little past the center where you’re still busy but you’ve set aside even more maker time. </p>
<p>Then on the far right is where you keep pushing yourself to — as you go more towards the right, it becomes much tougher to achieve 100%.</p>
<h2>Align tasks with your energy level</h2>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of an example week by Dillon:</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<p>Energy ramps out of the weekend — schedule low-demand tasks like setting goals, organizing, and planning.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>Peak of energy — tackle the most difficult problems, write, brainstorm, schedule your Make Time.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<p>Energy begins to ebb — schedule meetings, especially when consensus is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<p>Lowest energy level — do open-ended work, long-term planning, and relationship building.”</p>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that you set yourself ahead of time and this is particularly powerful if you manage others. </p>
<p>Less guilt;
More work;
Even more creativity.</p>
<h2>But I don’t manage anyone</h2>
<p>That’s ok. </p>
<p>You actually don’t have to be a manager to follow the high level principle. You don’t even have to work for a company.</p>
<p>You can adapt it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Workouts</strong>: Days where you want to do a full work out. Plan ahead something simple for days when you notice your energy is typically low</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Writing</strong>: You have a book to write but feel lazy in the evenings. You can use that period to plan titles for the book, outline for chapters, etc. But then dedicate your high energy in the mornings to writing at least one pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meditation/House Chores/Job application/etc</strong>: Plan ahead for low-energy moments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your next action</h2>
<p>Maybe for you, Mondays are not slow.</p>
<p>It could be Tuesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>The most important takeaway is that you should chunk your activities by different days of the week or different hours of the day and align them with your energy level. You can use your slow days to boost your creativity.</p>
<p>That way, you’ll feel more balance and control in how your week goes.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, simple little tweaks like this can add up to the big transformation you desire.</strong></p>
<p>Slow days are inevitable. Don’t just slog through.</p>
<p>Instead use them to get strategy and creative work done. If you’re like most busy people, you’re not doing a lot of thinking work anyways.</p>
<p>Change that – with this tiny shift in your approach.</p>

September 8, 2020 | https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A long time ago, I gave a talk in front of a full audience talking about BigchainDB, a company I worked for to create a (scalable) decentralized database. As we just had released our browser-compatible JavaScript driver, enthusiastically, I told the audience: "... and so by using our driver from within the browser, your app won't need a backend anymore"!</p>
<p>That must have been around 2017 when I first discovered Metamask, and started drinking Ethereum's web3 cool-aid. Arguably, web3 quickly became something extraordinary. All of a sudden, users could download a browser extension and directly interact with a public network. In a sense, it still is extraordinary.</p>
<p>If you have an extension like Metamask installed in your browser today, you can visit sites on the web that allow you to do the craziest things with your digital money. An excellent recent example of this are DeFi (short for "Decentralized Finance") websites. They allow a user to engage in trading cryptocurrencies, providing liquidity, and peer to peer lending. With the click of a button and no mandatory signups, you're able to pool thousands of dollars. That is super cool and confirms the viability of the web3 vision.</p>
<p>But actually, what is the web3 vision? It may be that there never was such a thing in the first place. All I know is that someone named a library "web3.js". Developers use it to talk to remote or local Ethereum nodes when working in a browser environment (JavaScript).</p>
<p>On a web3-enabled website, when a user now clicks a button to, e.g., pool ether in a smart contract, most calculations are supported by the web3.js library that periodically talks to an Ethereum node. Ultimately web3.js allows the user to send the transaction to the node to transfer the user's money.</p>
<p>Often, a key-management program, like Metamask, is running on the user's browser. It allows the user to sign transactions with the same key on different websites.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that's web3. It's supposed to be a play on words regarding "web 2.0". Web 2.0 is the upgrade of web standards that gave us modern single-page applications and dynamic AJAX loading. And Web3? An advancement towards what exactly? Money websites?</p>
<p>Indeed, if you were capable of cleaning your mind of specific memories, specifically, let's say you could do <code>grep -l web3 brain | xargs rm</code>. And then someone asked you how you'd envision a blockchain-based and smart-contract-enabled web3; you'd likely describe an ecosystem vastly different to what it is today. You'd think about peer-2-peer networks, light clients, and renewed web standards. That's precisely not web3.</p>
<p>In today's experience it will instead be mostly shitty react websites that crash or stop working when you've neglected to install Metamask (or other key-management plugins). Opening a web3 website's network console, you'll see that it's making an excessive amount of RPC request to an Ethereum full node. Sorry, I meant to say Infura node, a hugely-popular cloud provider hosting Ethereum full nodes. That's kinda stupid.</p>
<p>And since Metamask allows developers to prompt the user for specific contract calls, what's even more stupid, is that all your money may be at the risk of continually getting stolen with the accidential click of a button. Either by someone hacking the website's server. Or by the website provider becoming corrupt themselves. Or simply because a website pretends to do X when it does Y (stealing all your money).</p>
<p>But instead of continuing to rant, I'd now like to now point out what I think should change about web3:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should stop building key-management plugins and start thinking about a standardizable web API. We must stop training our users to install shitty browser plugins!</li>
<li>We need to make light clients work as soon as possible and become independent from third-party services like thegraph and Infura.</li>
<li>We need to improve our client libraries (ethers.js and web3.js) by dramatically simplifying them and making them bug-free (god damn it!)!</li>
<li>We need to take advantage of some of the blockchain's fundamental properties. Most data is immutable so let's start caching things.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, I think we should stop focusing all of our attention on bumping the web's version number. Maybe we should reconsider writing more backends. We should promote more work on permissionless networks like Open Gas Station Network that allow developers to upgrade a user's experience. And, we should start thinking of a machine network of blockchains more often. In many ways, web3 was just a cool demo. But let's come up with something better. Just imagine what happens once there's a deeper integration of money into computer systems!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p><span>I recently came across a question on Quora:</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“How do you know if you’re going to be successful?”&nbsp;</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>Scrolling through the replies, one story caught my eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It was from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hectorquintanilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hector Quintanilla</a>, a brilliant startup expert and successful entrepreneur with nearly three decades of experience helping entrepreneurs build their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span>It went something like this:</span></p>
<p><i><span>“You can predict with outstanding accuracy how successful you will be.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>It’s a very easy formula to understand — yet difficult to execute.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>What’s the secret?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>We become like the people we hang out with.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Analyze your environment. Write down all the characteristics that you like and dislike. Well, that’s exactly where you’re heading.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>We’re social creatures and incredibly influenced by our cultures. This culture gets immersed in our behaviours, which are mostly unconscious.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Do you want to become a successful entrepreneur? Surround yourself with successful people.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Do you want to be happy? Surround yourself with happy people.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Do you want to be healthy? Surround yourself with healthy people.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Do you want to become more confident? Surround yourself with confident people.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Do you want to fly with eagles? Surround yourself with eagles! Eagles don’t fly with pigeons.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>It sounds like very simple advice. And it is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s also </span><b>incredibly powerful</b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We often talk about the importance of surrounding yourself with the right people – whether it’s co-founders, advisors, mentors, or investors.</span></p>
<p><span>Take Hector, he was surrounded by the right people from a young age. A third-generation entrepreneur, he grew up with the entrepreneurial mindset. Which is why I invited him to share his story in this expert interview.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And I have to say, I ended up with a bit more than I bargained for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As well as sharing his insights surrounding the entrepreneurial mindset; he shared the exact framework he uses when coaching and mentoring entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span>But first, let’s get to know Hector a little better.</span></p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1440/0*4rPvZX9l6HVFd_bB" alt="Successful Entrepreneur Hector Quintanilla" width="1174" height="1027" data-image-id="0*4rPvZX9l6HVFd_bB" data-width="1174" data-height="1027"></figure>
<h4><span>Q: Did you always want to become an entrepreneur?&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><b>A: </b><span>Yes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I was lucky, I was born into an entrepreneurial family. My grandfather was a successful entrepreneur, my father was a successful entrepreneur; so I was born into this entrepreneurial mindset. It wasn’t that my father was teaching me </span><b>how </b><span>to become a successful entrepreneur, but in many ways, it was our family mindset.</span></p>
<p><span>It also helped that I was a misfit to the educational system.</span></p>
<p><span>So, throughout my school years, my focus was never in academics. I was always searching for different types of businesses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, back when I was in college, it was popular to share notes with colleagues. So you would go to the Xerox copy-center. There was a significant need that I thought I could solve. I tried to open a shop doing that outside my college, but it never really launched.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My next idea actually launched but I learned a bitter-sweet lesson from it.</span></p>
<p><span>My college had a&nbsp; considerable problem when it came to parking. But I kept seeing these vacant lots nearby. So I contacted one of the lot owners and said: “I want to rent this space from you to launch a business providing parking spaces.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My father co-signed the lease with the owner and we had a great start. But after the first year, the lot owner didn’t renew my lease; he decided to keep the business for himself. Big lesson there!</span></p>
<p><span>Finding opportunities to launch a business – it was, and still is, my true passion.</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“I was a misfit to the educational system. My focus was never in academics but searching for different types of businesses”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>My cousin had a similar mindset as me, and we were quite close – So we undertook a program at college called </span><i><span>The Entrepreneurs’ Program</span></i><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>It was good fun. The teacher would guide us on how to do market research, among other things. It was very practical, we would go out, talk to people, analyse businesses, create projections for a business’s potential, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>Off the back of that, my cousin and I reached out to a franchise that did shoe repairs. We travelled to the south of Mexico to see if we could make a deal to open one in our city.</span></p>
<p><span>That didn’t work, so we found one of their competitors and made an arrangement with them and set up shop. It was going well, but we noticed our customers needed other services. So we added clothing alteration and dry cleaning. We put a concentrated focus on those services, especially with female clients – as they made up 80% of our client base at the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>That business worked so well that it’s still running today, 26 years later</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This startup was going on while I was still at college, so it’s safe to say my focus wasn’t in school.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Related: </b><a href="https://altar.io/from-being-fired-to-building-a-multi-million-dollar-fintech-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>From Being Fired to Building a Multi-Million Dollar Fintech Startup</span></a></p>
<p><span>I was studying civil engineering because my father was a passionate architect. He had his own construction business and I always thought maybe I need to continue the family business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a big lesson there. </span><b>I was trying to meet my dad’s expectations, not mine</b><span>. We will talk more about that later when we talk about what I call </span><i><span>The Three Pillars of Success.</span></i></p>
<h4><span>Q: What, in your opinion, is the essence of entrepreneurship?&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><b>A:</b><span> There’s this common idea that entrepreneurs are born from their DNA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve thought about it and I’ve come to realise that</span><b> there is a successful entrepreneur inside of every single one of us</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, the big key here is finding the freedom to pursue your desire.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We all have dreams, but most people don’t take the leap because they have a complete lack of self-belief. Or because of cultural restrictions in our home, family, social surroundings, schools etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, it’s logical that if my father goes down a path that has been good for him, he wants me to take the same path.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are coming from the industrial age, where the value of labour was very high, due to the scarcity of qualified workers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the last generation that meant: a safe secure job with benefits guaranteed a good life. A car, a house, put your kids through college, etc. Climbing the corporate ladder was enough.</span></p>
<p><span>This presents a lack of freedom, however. I was blessed to be born into a home where it was ok to try new things and I was supported by my family.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“I’ve come to realise that there is a successful entrepreneur inside of every single one of us. However, the big key is finding the freedom to pursue your desire.”&nbsp;</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>We all have different chains stopping us from gaining that freedom:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Our culture</span></li>
<li><span>Families&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Environment&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>But more importantly, are the chains inside of us. Ultimately they’re the most significant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our beliefs control our actions. </span><b>If you don’t believe you can accomplish something you won’t even try it</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There’s no magic thing about this idea of the entrepreneurial mindset. It’s a lot of common sense. But you need to dive into the water and start swimming – or you’ll never become a successful entrepreneur.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Now’s not the right time.” “I have too much responsibility, I can’t do it now.” “If I do this now I will lose money, I can’t afford to do it.”</span></p>
<p><b>These are all things that will limit your actions.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Whether the restriction is internal or external, you need to get free of it.</span></p>

<h4><span>Q: You have a framework “The Three Pillars of Success.” What is it and how did it come about?&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><b>A: </b><span>It’s been maybe 10/12 years that I’ve been playing with the idea of helping other people start the entrepreneurial journey. It’s something I’m very passionate about.</span></p>
<p><span>In sharing my experiences with my </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Hector-Quintanilla" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Quora community</span></a><span> I started learning more about the people I was reaching. Through their comments and reactions, I started to get a sense of what people needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I sensed a lack of understanding of entrepreneurship and all the misconceptions that come with it, like “how risky entrepreneurship is”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Entrepreneurship comes with its risks, but what’s risky is bad decisions – not the entrepreneurial journey itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s like investment, many misunderstand that </span><b>real investing is not gambling</b><span>. I’m not guessing if my investment will make money or not. I </span><i><span>know</span></i><span> my investment will make money because I did all the research and due diligence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Don’t get me wrong, things can change; none of us expected COVID-19 for instance. But I’m still in control of where my money is going. I can control my assets in many ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>That’s not gambling; neither is entrepreneurship</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“Entrepreneurship is about making logical, wise decisions.”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>The Three Pillars of success is a process which allows you to check things off a list and reduce the risk dramatically. </span></p>
<h4><span>Q: Let’s talk about the first Pillar: Alignment. This is about the avoidance of working against yourself. Can you expand on this a bit?&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><b>A:</b><span> If you go back in history, every single company on earth started with the vision of one person. There are partnerships, Steve Jobs &amp; Steve Wozniak for example. However, the vision came from one person, Jobs; he saw the opportunity, Wozniak had the technical ability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is very important for us to understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A lot of people come to me with this idea of starting a business by inventing something new. And that’s great, but the ability to</span><b> see a need</b><span> in the market and </span><b>turn that solution into a business</b><span> are two very different things. That’s what a successful entrepreneur does. They build business models around innovation:</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“Pillar #1 is you. Taking the passion, purpose and belief you have and knowing you picked the right battle. It’s critical you play to </span></i><b><i>your </i></b><i><span>strengths.”</span></i></span></h3>

				<p>Axial operates a confidential online marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of privately held small and medium sized businesses. The platform is 100% software enabled and includes tools and recommendation engines to empower both buyers and sellers to discover, connect and transact with one another. By expanding the reach of both buyers and sellers and eliminating hundreds of hours of manual time spent pursuing an offline transaction process allows deals with the most merit to rise to the top. The platform goes beyond matching the correct individuals and focuses on facilitating success at many levels. A key example of this is the platform's ability to facilitate real human to human interactions with communication on the platform itself.</p><blockquote><em>“Axial at its core is a specialized matching engine and communication platform.”</em></blockquote><p>The ability for the platform to connect people on a deeper level is what has made it a successful medium for completed deals and a major contributor to democratizing capital markets. As Zach Werheim, Director of Engineering at Axial, puts it, “one big goal is to be able to help people where they need it — for those who, otherwise, would never be able to get it."</p><p>Zach is a prominent software engineer and tech leader who has led a number of engineering teams. He, along with the rest of the Axial team, were quick to recognize the rapidly evolving market conditions in the way people communicate. The mindset of their users was changing quickly, and it was critical to provide them with industry best practices and features.</p><p>The Axial platform has served their customers for over 10 years. In that time they’ve endeavored to maintain best practices while evolving with emerging technologies. Their philosophy of pushing innovation results in a couple of issues arising that the team must address.</p><p><em><strong>1. Ensuring institutional knowledge isn’t lost over time.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>2. Making it easy to adopt the newest best technologies.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>3. Making their tooling accessible to their developers.</strong></em></p><p>Applications being built and improved over the course of a decade are always at risk of institutional knowledge being lost. It is paramount that developer and operations workflows and processes are common knowledge and not siloed. Additionally, over the course of the last decade, there are a new set of tools and processes which represent best practices. A core facet of engineering at Axial is to adopt the latest best practices to empower their development team to perform at their highest.</p><blockquote><br><em>Zach was on a mission to make it easier for their development team to adopt optimal tooling without silos and individual points of failure. This would empower their dev team to make the best technology choices while ensuring that the tool knowledge was collaborative and distributed. The solution was creating their own workflows meshed with the optimal tools for their day-to-day operations.</em><br></blockquote><p>After evaluating multiple tools with limited success, the team came across <a href="https://cto.ai/platform">The Ops Platform by CTO.ai</a>. The Ops Platform allowed them to start building solutions immediately by creating and automating developer workflows. These workflows were sharable with the entire team and could plug into any specific developer tooling that was necessary. They did this via Slack workflows and the CTO.ai SlackOps capability. Axial built 3 initial Ops to empower their engineering teams right away: The Dev Op, The Vault Op, and The Cluster Op.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="1-the-dev-op">1. The Dev Op</h3><p>The engineering team leverages VMs which run in AWS, which also run most of their services for development. Their Dev Command controls the state of their DevBox for AWS cost savings. When the development team isn’t active, it can easily be turned off or turn on, on demand. The team also implemented an automatic shut off. Because it’s built as an Op, the team can run these suites of commands directly from Slack and avoid having to interface with the AWS Console or other specific services.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WJ21lVtgdBCuga-WYA2xJc8h3LQUojaozdTE7cuiVgfVYtDC80LbgJRN0D1_gMul3ekbXDjS3zMwLXszGVPEGzwMOWVcRYSO6nXbTRbYIfw90_7zeRCAnBtiEZhIjThFDvNPGC3A"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br>

The <em>Dev </em>Op specifically helped save on their AWS bill by making it easy for the team to activate development services only when necessary. Across the 5 DevBoxes, Zach is able to save over 12 hours of uptime per day, which equates to a savings of over $5,900 annually. The Ops Platform made it simple to build—not only to save money, but also to streamline development for the rest of the engineering team and save developer hours.</p><blockquote><em>“Without CTO.ai, we would have to adopt the bare minimum tooling. Anything new would have to be written in a language our team was familiar with and we’d be running scripts manually. Having this technology available is going to make it easier to develop dev operations around new systems. It’s definitely going to be a big advantage for us going forward”</em></blockquote><div><p>Zach plans to continue to build key Ops to empower the rest of his team. Specifically, a production release pipeline. In addition, there are a lot of fragmented utility scripts their team uses to run various operations. These scripts currently sit in a folder and eventually become outdated as infrastructure changes. “Opifying” these would allow them to be version controlled and give the entire team more visibility. Zach has also thought about ways to empower other departments of the organization with Ops. One of their next plans for Ops is to build an “extremely simple and impossible to screw up” SlackOp to empower their marketing department to perform an operation they would usually need the assistance of engineering for. This Op would be trackable, so the engineering team would have visibility into what is being run, but the marketing team would be unblocked to continue their tasks. </p><p>Adopting Ops has allowed Axial to immediately reduce their cloud spend, enable easier adoption of new technologies, and even open the door to empowering non-engineers to run operations. Ultimately, this allows the engineering team to focus on their core competency in the pursuit of their own market innovation instead of spending time and resources on infrastructure and tooling.</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p><em>Contact us to understand how much time and money workflows can save your team:</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--[if lte IE 8]>

				<div>
				
				
				<div><p><span>In the winter of 1938, deep into the Depression,&nbsp;eight-year-old Verne was put on a train and sent 2,000 miles east, to the Ontario School for the Blind. It was when Verne was in the school’s hospital for six weeks with scarlet fever that he first heard the sound of a piano being tuned – the intervals being stretched and shortened. It was a pinging sound, not quite musical, and hardly melodic.</span></p>
<p><span>Once he had recovered,Verne sought out the school’s tuning shop. As it happened, he had a near perfect ear, and he studied the craft of piano tuning with rigor and determination.</span></p>
<p><span>Years later, Verne often took to quoting his tuning teacher, J. D. Ansell, whose favorite aphorism was “The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.” To give Verne experience, Ansell started taking his young protégé into town to tune pianos in private homes. Verne was allowed to keep the money – $2.50 per piano, and sometimes, when he got lucky, $3.00 – which he put toward some basic tools: a tuning wrench, a tuning fork, needle-nose pliers, gauges for measuring the diameter of piano wire, and rubber wedges for muting strings.</span></p>
<p><span>After graduating from high school at age 19, Verne knew his best chance at a job was to find work as a chipper in one of the many piano factories in Toronto (in the early 20th century the city directory listed no fewer than sixteen piano manufacturers). The chippers were the first tuners to work on a newly strung piano, so incomplete in construction that it still had no keys. Those initial tunings are done, first with a pitch fork, then by ear, by plucking the strings with a small chip of wood.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne started out as an apprentice chipper in the factory of the Winter Company, one of piano manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span>He had a fishing tackle box that he had converted to a tuner’s toolbox. Over the years Verne collected dozens of tools. Some he bought from old-timers, and others he adapted from other trades. He had surgical forceps and dental explorers, which made dandy hooks, opticians’ screwdrivers for adjusting harpsichords, barber scissors for trimming felt, and shoemaker pegs for plugging holes. From the welding trade he took soapstone, a dry lubricant for the buckskin that can squeak in the action of older pianos.</span></p>
<p><span>After being laid off, Verne decided to go door-to-door, tuning pianos. He was systematic, choosing a sequence of different neighborhoods around Toronto that he could reach by street car. Verne soon grew bolder and began cold-calling at sergeants’ messes,&nbsp;asylums, and prisons. He would walk a mile and a half in a snowstorm to tune a piano, and charge $3 for a tuning. He was lucky to get one tuning a day. “That’s how things were,” he recalled years later. “I was glad to get the work. During that time you did what you could.”</span></p>
<p><span>In 1952, at the age of 21, Verne was hired as a fine-tuner in the Heintzman factory, then the largest piano manufacturer in Canada.&nbsp;Verne’s tuning always stood out, even when he was tuning pianos for the first time. To trained ears, the quality of Verne’s tuning was always superior.</span></p>
<p><span>In 1961, he moved to the T. Eaton Co., to take over as the concert tuner. Verne liked to think he could take a piano beyond mere sound, into realms of color. And he liked to think he was giving people a glimpse of that color every time he tuned a piano. Muriel Mussen, who ran the concert department, sat in a small office off the showroom floor,&nbsp;and&nbsp;came to recognize Verne’s spare style of tuning whenever she heard it. Unlike many tuners, who banged a key as hard as they could, he kept it gentle, careful not to hit the key any harder than he had to. Halfway into a piano, Verne would often hear Miss Mussen call out, “I know it’s you tuning out there, Verne.”</span></p>
<p><span>One afternoon about a year after Verne started at Eaton’s,&nbsp;Miss Mussen sent him across town to Glenn Gould’s apartment to tune Gould’s old Chickering. All Gould wanted, he told Verne, was for the tuner to do what had been done hundreds of times before: get the piano into playable condition, if only for the time being. But Verne refused, telling Gould that the tuning pins were so loose they needed to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne’s stubborn insistence on doing things his way had endeared him to Gould, and the encounter galvanized what was to become a decades-long association between a pianist and his technician.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne tuned for many famous musicians over the years, including Duke Ellington, Arthur Rubinstein, Rudolf Serkin, Victor Borge, and Liberace. But it was the business he got from Gould that eventually enabled him to quit Eaton’s employ and sustain his family for two decades.</span></p>
<p><span>Each tolerated the other’s idiosyncracies, which were in ample evidence in both men. Gould’s quirks, of course, were legion and legendary. One of their earliest conversations was about Verne’s physical limitations. “I can’t see very well, but I get the job done,” Verne told Gould. And Gould replied that of this he had no doubt. Nothing further on the topic was ever said.</span></p>

Occasionally, he'll pop under the shower-head to tame his bed-head or rinse away some actual dirt from his skin. But he doesn't shampoo his hair&nbsp;or lather his body.</p>  <p>"You don't look and smell the same as after you go through an elaborate skin-care regimen or, you know, have lathered yourself in&nbsp;fine-smelling soaps.

His new book, <em>Clean: The New Science of Skin</em>,&nbsp;asks readers to question the multitude&nbsp;of products they're being sold in the name of hygiene and personal care, and whether some of them may, in fact, be doing more harm than good.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He says&nbsp;a global pandemic could be&nbsp;a better time than ever to experiment with cutting back on those products — and on showering overall.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>The rapid expansion of personal hygiene products&nbsp;</h2>  <p>A hundred years ago, having running water and a bar of soap in the home was a new phenomenon, Hamblin said.</p>  <p>Nowadays, a single family's bathroom may be&nbsp;home to an&nbsp;incredible array of products — scented soaps, body washes, shampoos, conditioners, cream rinses, facial cleansers, and an assortment of creams, ointments and serums all meant for specific&nbsp;body parts.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It is a brilliant story of marketing," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It's basically a process of segmenting and growth by the big corporations that have sold us these things and found ways to make these&nbsp;products slightly differentiated so that they are maybe a little different colour, a little different scent, a little different concentration, and making whole new products out of them."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-walmart.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-walmart.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-walmart.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-walmart.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-walmart.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-walmart.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Shampoos, soaps and other hygiene products on display in a Walmart aisle. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>That original shift toward personal&nbsp;hygiene was based in science, Hamblin&nbsp;said, and helped&nbsp;curb the spread of disease and infections.</p>  <p>"But it really quickly devolved away from from actual disease prevention practices and toward wealth and class signifiers."</p>  <p>That linking of cleanliness to class, Hamblin&nbsp;says, has had devastating consequences for society at large.</p>  <p>"Throughout the history of the idea of cleanliness, it has been used maliciously as being used to justify racism and xenophobia, and we've we've called other groups unclean since before we had germ theory as a way of just differentiating ourselves and justifying plunder," he said.</p>  <p>Asked what he think of&nbsp;comments by U.S. President Donald Trump about&nbsp;<a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7271702/donald-trump-shower-hair/">increasing&nbsp;water pressure from showerheads</a> to have a more intense shower experience and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52407177">injecting disinfectant to combat COVID-19</a>, he said that "goes hand-in-hand with a lot of germaphobia."</p>  <p>"There are clear tropes with purity and cleanliness that become very easily tied up in toxic ways, toward thinking you just want to eradicate all foreign entities," he said.</p>  <p>"That is where you start to see very clearly a propensity to just think of all germs are bad and purity as good as this hyper-simplified version of the actual way that we should be thinking about our skin and our microbial worlds."</p>  <h2>Balancing your bacteria&nbsp;</h2>  <p>Human skin is covered in bacteria.

<p>Columnar storage is a proven way to speed up database query performance by greatly reducing I/O during query execution. It’s been a fundamental feature in analytic relational databases such as Vertica, Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, and many others for more than a decade. It’s also a fundamental feature of the PostgreSQL query-acceleration extensions of <a href="https://swarm64.com/swarm64-da/">Swarm64 DA</a>.</p>



<p>In Swarm64 DA 5.0 (<a href="https://swarm64.com/early-access-request/">now in beta</a>), compressed columnar storage is implemented as a columnstore index, which can easily be applied to any standard PostgreSQL table to speed up queries. </p>



<p><a href="https://swarm64.com/early-access-request/">Try the Swarm64 DA 5.0 beta for free</a></p><p>The columnstore index caches the data of the related table in a compressed column-oriented format, thus providing data locality for similar values. A query that uses the columnstore index benefits from more efficient I/O and improved CPU utilization. Both these properties lead to faster query execution.</p>



<h3>Why columnstore indexing is important for PostgreSQL</h3>



<p>The columnstore index provides a more performant way for PostgreSQL to retrieve data from large tables in queries that use a subset of all the columns in the table.</p>



<p>Columnstore indexing can be very useful if you are doing any of these things with PostgreSQL:</p>



<ul><li>Migrating applications from Microsoft SQL Server, which also implements columnstore indexes</li><li>Supporting mixed workloads, for example user reporting on an OLTP database or accelerating the occasional table scan</li><li>Improving query and reporting performance, especially at scale, for concurrent users</li><li>Implementing data warehouses and analytical databases on free, open source PostgreSQL</li></ul>



<h3>What is columnar storage, and how does it accelerate queries?</h3>



<p>Columnar storage is an established DBMS concept, but let’s start with a high-level primer on how columnar storage accelerates querying. Consider the following table containing data about pets:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-1024x455.png" alt="How columnar storage for PostgreSQL works" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-1024x455.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-300x133.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-768x341.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table.png 1143w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In row-oriented databases such as PostgreSQL, data pages (or blocks) store the values of an entire row together, sequentially for each column in the row. The rows-to-data pages ratio might be more or less than one, depending on the number and type of columns per row and the data page size setting. For illustration purposes, let’s assume that each data page in our Pets database contains one row in our table:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-1024x92.png" alt="" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-1024x92.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-300x27.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-768x69.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-1536x137.png 1536w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Row-oriented storage is optimal for OLTP performance, where transactions frequently read and write entire records. However, if you query one column of the row-store table, for example PetType, you see that all columns are read, which means the query wastes a lot of time scanning and filtering irrelevant data.</p>



<p>Column-oriented storage solves this problem by grouping values of the same column (PetType) together on disk:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-1024x90.png" alt="Columnar storage in PostgreSQL example" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-1024x90.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-300x26.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-768x68.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-1536x135.png 1536w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols.png 1602w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>For that same query on the PetType column, only the values of the relevant column are scanned, which results in fewer reads from storage and faster query results. In this simple case, each page read from storage contains PetType values for five rows instead of one, so I/O would be reduced by 5x.</p>



<h3>But wait, there’s less! (compressed columns)</h3>



<p>Since columns contain data of the same type, and especially when they contain relatively few unique values, they lend themselves well to compression. This further decreases I/O (and query time) by squeezing even more column values into each data page. In fact, compressed columns are often small enough to remain cached entirely in memory for very fast query performance.</p>



<h3>Accelerating TPC-H with PostgreSQL columnstore indexing</h3>



<p>When we run a 1-terabyte (SF1000) TPC-H benchmark on PostgreSQL with the Swarm64 DA extensions installed, you can see the effects of the columnstore indexing (along with other PostgreSQL acceleration features in Swarm64 DA, such as increased parallelism). The time required to run the whole benchmark is reduced by 19x with Swarm64 DA, with some queries executing as much as 60x faster:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-1024x722.png" alt="PostgreSQL columnstore indexes accelerate TPC-H benchmark by 19x" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-1024x722.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-300x212.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-768x542.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H.png 1175w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Swarm64 DA 5.0, with Columnstore indexing helps PostgreSQL 12 run TPC-H 19x faster </figcaption></figure>



<p>The following chart shows how much columnstore indexing reduces I/O. As the I/O bars show in the chart below, with columnstore indexes applied, 17x less data is read by PostgreSQL during the benchmark. This reduces scan time by up to 20x in some TPC-H queries.</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-1024x618.png" alt="Columnstore indexes in PostgreSQL reduce query I/O" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-1024x618.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-300x181.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-768x464.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1.png 1287w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Columnstore indexing reduces I/O by 17x in a 1TB TPC-H benchmark</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Creating a columnstore index in PostgreSQL with Swarm64 DA</h3>



<p>As mentioned, columnstore indexes can be defined for any PostgreSQL table. Let’s suppose we have the following table definition:</p>



<pre><code>CREATE TABLE orders (
o_orderkey bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
o_custkey int NOT NULL,
o_orderstatus "char" NOT NULL,
o_totalprice double precision NOT NULL,
o_orderdate date NOT NULL,
o_orderpriority character varying(15) NOT NULL,
o_clerk character varying(15) NOT NULL,
o_shippriority int NOT NULL,
o_comment character varying(79)
);</code></pre>



<p>A columnstore index should cover your most commonly accessed columns. Let’s suppose we want a columnstore index that covers all columns in the orders table except for an infrequently referenced o_comment column. In this case, we use the following create index statement:</p>



<pre><code>CREATE INDEX orders_columnstore_idx ON orders USING columnstore(
o_orderkey
, o_custkey
, o_orderstatus
, o_totalprice
, o_orderdate
, o_orderpriority
, o_clerk
, o_shippriority
);</code></pre>



<p>The specific order of the columns in the CREATE INDEX statement does not matter. The new columnstore index will initialize as soon as you execute a VACUUM statement or whenever autovacuum next kicks in.</p>



<h3>Columnstore indexes work like most any other PostgreSQL index</h3>



<p>After the columnstore index is created, the PostgreSQL planner uses it automatically in your queries. Like other PostgreSQL indexes, the columnstore index has full transaction safety, crash-safety, replication support, and it benefits from an often-vacuumed database for optimal performance.</p>



<h3>Try it out, and let us know what you think</h3>



<p>That’s a high-level overview of columnstore indexing and columnar data storage for PostgreSQL. </p>



<p>For more detail, check out this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Intro-Columnstore-Indexing-Postgres.pdf" target="_blank">slide deck on PostgreSQL columnstore indexing</a> from a <a href="https://swarm64.com/columnstore-index-webcast/">recent webcast</a> we ran.</p>



<p>In upcoming blog posts we will detail other aspects of columnstore indexing like compression and additional columnstore indexing best practices.</p>



<p>Columnstore indexing is available now in the preview release of Swarm64 DA 5.0. We’d love to hear your feedback. If you’d like to try it out for free, you can request a copy here:</p>

          <p>It’s often forgotten that graphic design revolves around communication. A visual way of communication, but communication nonetheless. There’s 4 things needed for successful communication: </p><ul><li>The Sender</li><li>The Message</li><li>The Medium </li><li>The Receiver</li></ul><p>This applies to all types of communication, verbal and non-verbal alike.</p><p>For a message to be successful (i.e. the sender is able to send out the message and have the receiver on the other end get it and decipher it), some criteria must be met:</p><ul><li><strong>A common language must be spoken.</strong> "Language” can be verbal or nonverbal. Following this logic, English is a language of course, but so are images, maths, and music! For any of these languages to be shared and understood by two or more people, organization is required. This organization ensures that the communication can be deciphered by the receiver in the way that the sender intended.</li><li><strong>The medium mustn’t have noise or noise must at least be minimal.</strong> By “noise” I mean interference - something that could alter the message or in some way prevent the message from being deciphered. An example of this is the game telephone we used to play as kids. In this game a message is whispered from one kid to another and, without a doubt, by the time it gets to the last person it will have been changed from the original message. Another more straightforward example is trying to talk to someone across a noisy and crowded room: the message will most likely arrive deformed (or not at all).</li></ul><p>It’s interesting to think about the different ways in which communication can be established. Imagine none of us spoke the same spoken language: we would need another type of language in order to establish communication. This is one of the areas where graphic design is applied. The study really should be called “graphic <em>communication</em>”, but it’s shinier to say “design” so that stuck. </p><p>As I mentioned earlier, images are a form of communication in themselves. There’s certain conventions that need to be established for them to be used as a language. For example, if I drew a stick figure, then there is a great chance that everyone will know that it’s a loose interpretation of a person. How do we know this? By convention.</p><p>We unconsciously learn a lot of things by convention just by being immersed in the society that we live in. Graphic design exploits those conventions in order to create communication. It’s why it’s so important to never re-invent the wheel. Not only is it a waste of time, but it would also go against convention, creating interference in the medium, and prohibiting the receiver from deciphering the message.</p><p>On the other hand though, imagery can be a tricky way of communicating. Images are associated to symbols and concepts rather than a concrete “thing”. For example the stick figure I drew means “person” to me, but, to someone who doesn’t share any of the same social and cultural conventions as me, it might not. Sometimes even images literally don’t translate.</p><p>Today I wanted to talk about a piece of graphic design which to me is the epitome of AWESOME in both communication and aesthetics. It’s a piece that was created to send a message to beings with whom we don’t know anything about. Scratch that, we don’t even know if they’re there. To me, this piece fully encompasses what graphic design is. Not only that but it accomplishes this in the sphere of one of my other passions, space!</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qCUtBHhJCNJc3PslYbqkQ1Z4SZNkoomxSEYAV534bgQhNNCWrnPFrOKptsiO21TxsVq5kh_t5oW7KPUJrd_cdXjwYV4p7PkmBEOQwMLihziGYa1nD3HBnDcU8etp49rBGQU2YD0b" alt="Aliens"></figure><p>In 1972 and 1973 NASA sent off the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecrafts to explore Jupiter and Saturn. After their core objectives were completed, they continued their route and flew out of the Solar System. Attached to the spacecrafts they added a golden plaque with a message. There’s over 7000 spoken languages on Earth (and a few more of unspoken nature), so how on earth (ha!) would we be able to send out a message that could be deciphered by beings that we can only assume do not share any of our Earthly conventions?</p><p>The answer is <em>science.</em></p><p>Science uses the language of mathematics to express itself. One can only assume that any civilization advanced enough to explore the universe and bump into the spacecrafts that NASA launched in the 70’s will know a thing or two about science and maths.</p><p>The Pioneer plaque was a last minute addition by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake. It’s also an important piece to me because the person who actually drew it was a woman: Linda Salzman Sagan, Dr Sagan’s wife.</p><p>The plaque is broken down into 4 sections and can be “read” using maths.</p><h3 id="section-1-the-key">Section 1: The Key</h3><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JT_zuZTxrPj7sCsaTEUSZ--bdeGrTnJcBOWtQIz1pB0rMOm9BdXMaBLnCDAuNQDagi3lZNXhUAdJ7fMj54WWTcYYRG95-DR48SJIml2uNvXuhpZPNiLedPENnJ3JUd-Q954ff1qC"></figure><p>The first section shows two hydrogen atoms and represents the key to deciphering the whole plaque. The design team and the scientists postulated that hydrogen, being the most abundant element in the cosmos, would be one of the first elements to be discovered and studied by a civilization. The hydrogen atoms are shown changing from one energy state to another, a process called hyperfine transition where electromagnetic radiation is released. That wavelength can be traced (it’s approximately 21cm), serving as the first clue by giving a spatial measurement. The period of the transition can also be calculated to approximately .7 nanoseconds, serving as the second unit given, a unit of time. The next clue is the small tick between the atoms, that assigns the values of space and time to the binary number 1.</p><h3 id="section-2-the-address">Section 2: The Address</h3><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cbTM1HQp21jmqc6fJYW2NCzn9yVxzv4ik7yboPq58gEBtnSxQUv2ZGeiDwvQdPrVkpriMQo-L3SrNR_rKriBv45kBNuef_gS_MNfXdwQUMHpvKCn_Ev6Kas69-orNVNBhSkC6j2I"></figure><p>The second part of the plaque is a bundle of lines extending radially from a common centre: our star, the Sun. This is our interstellar address. The lines indicate the direction of the 14 most significant pulsars (a type of rotating star) near our Solar System. The little dashes and lines represent the period of the respective pulsar, in binary. Not only is this a map communicating the position from which the message originated, but time as well. With this information, a civilization advanced enough to decipher this part of the message could triangulate our position in time and space.</p><h3 id="section-3-the-origin">Section 3: The Origin</h3><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5IZgnT-GDfSgI4-BkSrHM-ay1SK8E1sCr6SYftns-hd9k-YtCZZvJHT4LL-6rh9bY_B6om85iB0g2aZbg8iafNtUsyiqmb_jhqiNUk6W_491zSOFn_a0B-lf9rdlpzMW84Q3yDK0"></figure><p>The next section of the message is a zoomed out view of our Solar System, with the Sun at the far left, followed by the 9 planets (Pluto was still considered a planet when the spacecrafts were launched) orbiting the star. Their respective distances to the Sun are written in binary above or below each planet. The third planet, the Earth, shows the path the spacecraft took when launched, which gives evidence of the origin of the Pioneer spacecrafts.</p><h3 id="section-4-the-sender">Section 4: The Sender</h3><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/c9RbDfaTK-tI1dcKMorsan91YbVYFuKNd3kbuRPodlJYZkm8SYwVjZAOI966mmGEKf1paQQGWZ-tEckwmCO-mo7xrZ-57v-CJM5zYZAxsTLD_BMFi5ajwlCJqtAnfkiTBloS0Yt_"></figure><p>The final section shows what’s found in that planet. The image of a man and a woman, the man bends his arm and extends his open palm as a sign of 'hello', which admittedly could be meaningless to another civilization. No detail in this plaque has been by chance, as seen in the woman’s stance, her arms are down and her weight is shifted to one side to show we are mobile and flexible. They stand by a diagram of the probe for scale, but if that wasn’t enough, on the far right of the image there is a binary number 8, meaning the woman is 8 units tall (or, 8 x 21cm = 5.5 feet tall).</p><p>The last signal from Pioneer 10 was received in 2003, when it was 12 billion kilometers from Earth.</p><p>I love this piece not only because it combines two of my greatest passions, but also because it’s one of the most ambitious pieces of communication ever created. The receiver is unknown, the common language is a big assumption, and we’ll probably never know for certain whether the message was deciphered like the sender intended. </p><p>Having said that, it may sound like this was a fruitless exercise by the very smart folks at NASA. From a graphic design point of view however, it’s incredibly poignant how communication can be established (or, at the very least, initiated) by learning as much possible about those who will be deciphering the message. In this case, the assumption that a learned civilization would know of the hydrogen atom allowed experts to work backwards from that point and attempt to establish a common language (science) so that whoever might be out there could understand our message: "We're here!"</p><hr><p>If you liked this article by our Chief Design Officer, Vicky, <a href="https://blog.codelitt.com/cdo-victoria-jaime/">check out this interview with her!</a></p>

September 8, 2020 | https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/09/06/work.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/09/06/work.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>In 2002, my mom started a new job in finance. One day, I visited her office. As part of the grand tour, she showed me her Lotus Notes setup on her PC, and explained that she received around 400 emails a day. This <em>baffled</em> my eleven year old mind: “why don’t you guys just use MSN?” My friends at school used Microsoft’s Messenger for everything. Some of my friends in the US had me hopping on AOL, but either one seemed obviously better than my mom and her highly-paid colleagues shooting one-line emails through their bulky setups. Nearly twenty years later, Slack and Microsoft Teams are finally making real-time chat commonplace even among the most traditional enterprises.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, I was deep in MMO gaming (specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape">RuneScape</a>). I joined and led clans of hundreds of other players, sometimes in PVP, but most often just to make money. For us kids, these were remarkably successful group efforts: large groups of teenage strangers around the world organized themselves, mostly over text chat, to work together for hours every day. I still know my major timezone overlaps off by heart from back then. We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB">phpBB forums</a> for longer-form discussion and official matters, and set up internal Wikis for knowledge management. We used IRC to chat in real-time, and set up dozens of custom scripts to integrate with external services. If we needed audio to chat in real-time, we’d use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventrilo">Ventrilo</a>, which would support up to 400 people simultaneously. For sharing short screen recordings, we used <a href="https://gyazo.com/">Gyazo</a> and <a href="https://puush.me/">Puush</a>, a decade before <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a> was founded.</p> <p>As such, the past few months of COVID quarantine have been a real throwback for me. As a teen, I sat at my desk for fourteen hours a day, coordinating buyouts of ingame items, playing on one screen, watching IRC and forums on the other, while chatting over Ventrilo.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">1</a></sup> Now, as an adult, I am doing the same, just with real work, Slack, and Zoom instead.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p> <p>The rest of the world has been adjusting to this new normal, and venture/tech Twitter (mostly people who were <em>not</em> obsessive online-gaming teens in the early 2000s) has been abuzz with theories about what collaboration in this new world looks like. To me, it looks a great deal like the toolset I used to very competitively<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup> play online games. Some tools, like Notion, GitHub, and Roam Research are genuinely unprecedented in that they have no prior product analogies, but for the most part, you can predict the 2020 remote work toolkit by looking at the 2010 gaming toolkit.</p> <p>It’s unsurprising that there would be a strong correspondence between online gaming and work tools. Both are collaborative team efforts, and require low-latency communication over text, audio, and video. Both make use of complex external services to manage recruiting, onboarding, collective knowledge, and to solve complicated coordination problems over multiple timezones for dozens, if not hundreds of teammates.</p> <p>Let’s look ahead. What does gaming in 2020 tell us about collaborative work in the future?</p> <h3 id="twitch">Twitch</h3> <p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> is a livestreaming/social platform, most popular for video games. Streamers on Twitch have slowly expanded to now include real-life vlogging, teaching, live coding, painting, writing, and other non-gaming genres. What’s most interesting is that streamers are starting to use Twitch to share their <em>creative efforts</em> as they build: some people are now even <a href="https://24hrstartup.com/">building businesses</a>, all in public, on Twitch.</p> <p>I believe this style of content production and engagement is going to shift <em>how work is done</em> in a few years. Most employees will be streaming as they work, and their colleagues may drop in on their streams with ideas and suggestions. It’ll feel weirdly invasive at first. There’s certainly a hump to get over when live-streaming your thoughts and showing your intimate, unfinished work-product drafts. However, once people get used to it, it’s collaboration supercharged. You’ll work, take a break, peruse your coworkers’ streams, find something interesting, drop in, chat for five minutes, share context, and get back to your own stuff. The feedback loop of creation becomes much tighter.</p> <h3 id="video-as-institutional-knowledge">Video as Institutional Knowledge</h3> <p>Closely related to Twitch is YouTube – after you’ve done a stream, you’ll upload a copy for posterity. This solves a problem in how companies deal with the loss of institutional knowledge – namely, <em>how to do stuff</em> – as they grow. As people leave, so do all the little procedures and processes that glue together a large operational organization. All companies try to remedy this through written knowledge bases, and the vast majority fail. Screen recordings of <em>how employees work</em> can be powerful stores of institutional knowledge.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">4</a></sup></p> <h3 id="audio-preferred">Audio Preferred</h3> <p>Face-to-face communications for routine meetings are going away. I’m in a lot of Zoom meetings these days, and I don’t want to stare at another person’s face, and try to read their expressions. It wears me out. I don’t want to carefully adjust my background to look presentable. Most people I know who are on 3+ calls a day will subtly push toward audio-only. New users may start off excited about video meetings and seeing other people’s faces, but as they become power users, video becomes too taxing and they move toward audio only. Outside of important/first-time external meetings, power users and well-acquainted teammates don’t want all the baggage of video calls, they want <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeamSpeak">TeamSpeak</a>.</p> <h3 id="splinter-groups">Splinter Groups</h3> <p>As far as meetings go, the current big open problem is that it is extremely difficult to replicate the experience of meeting as a group, splintering into smaller conversations, and hopping from conversation to conversation, the way you might at a professional event (or a party in Silicon Valley; the two are identical). Ventrilo solved this problem over a decade ago:<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">5</a></sup> create ephemeral channels/groups within your VoIP server that people can join, and that close when they have no members. Supporting this is the next big step for Zoom. If they fall short, they very seriously open up the market for any other entrant that can facilitate this.</p> <h3 id="arvr">AR/VR</h3> <p>For all the talk about shifting paradigms under remote work, there’s been little talk of AR/VR collaborative solutions. There are tons of vendors! But they’re all uncanny-valley experiences that very imperfectly try to replicate the experience of face-to-face meetings, or (even worse) conferences. All of these collaborate-in-VR solutions feel awkwardly skeuomorphic, and I expect that nothing will come of them.</p> <p>Why? Because, just like in the above point, face-to-face comms are an <em>artifact</em>, not a <em>goal</em>. The goals are always to exchange information, build trust, and to make decisions. Strapping into an Oculus Rift to sit in a virtual meeting room with a bunch of Lara Croft lookalikes doesn’t advance the goal, it only distracts. Even a perfect VR experience would only distract.</p> <p>Going out on a limb, I expect that if users do end up going for 3D interaction, it’s going to look a lot more like a blend of traditional MMORPGs and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/get-started-hubs-mozilla">Mozilla Hubs</a> than anything requiring an AR or VR device.</p> <h3 id="discord">Discord</h3> <p>If Discord starts marketing itself for a more professional crowd, it will destroy Slack. It’s a far superior software product – lighter-weight, faster, and it natively supports audio and video chat inside the platform. Discord is a $10B+ company in the making. Perhaps controversially, I think if users adapt to audio being more important than video, Discord is a serious competitor to Zoom.</p> <h3 id="lighter-weight-applications">Lighter-Weight Applications</h3> <p>All good gaming-adjacent software is light and fast. Bulky software would slow down your computer and you’d lose in games! Similarly, we’re enduring an epidemic of slow enterprise software. Asana, JIRA, Confluence, Slack, Google Drive, and so forth: using any of these tools is like wading through molasses. There’s lag when you enter keystrokes, interfaces load slowly due to hundreds of API calls under the hood, and so on.</p> <p>I desperately hope that as SaaS providers try harder to provide mind-melding interfaces between man and machine, they’ll eventually realize that a lack of speed is the biggest barrier between the two; that the speed of response and navigation is the single most important feature to a serious user.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>Right now, we are in a strange period of adjustment as people learn to work remotely. Users cling to representations of real life, meetings, and face-to-face Zooms. But this is an inconvenience, and it’ll become more rare for routine work. Audio is king in the remote world work; video – of actual humans – is less relevant, simulacrum of a past paradigm. On the other hand, video of <em>work</em> is of paramount importance, and the combination of live streaming and video storage will reshape how employees work, collaborate, and share institutional knowledge.</p> <p>In this world, AR and VR are somewhat counter-intuitive losers, only useful in very niche applications. If people collaborate in some kinds of 3D spaces, it’ll be mostly for rapid prototyping, sketching, etc. It is clear that collaborative, multi-user, version-controlled/historied software will succeed in this paradigm; I expect more products like Figma and Google Docs to arrive, and single-user software like PhotoShop to quietly leave the scene. And I pray that this new, glorious software will be fast.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we are going to discuss a change to server security that is going to make waves in the home lab and secondary markets for servers and components in the future. During our recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 review</a> we briefly mentioned that AMD EPYC CPUs in the system are vendor locked to Dell EMC systems. This is not a Dell-specific concern. We have confirmed that other vendors are supporting the feature behind this. For the large vendors, their platform security teams are pushing to build more secure platforms for their customers, and that is going to have future impacts on the secondary server market and home labs.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to cover the basics of what is happening. We are going to discuss the motivations, and why this is going to be more common in the future. Finally, we are going to discuss what those in the industry can do to keep the secondary server market operating well. If you work with partners or resellers who dip into used parts bins or even have the potential to purchase grey market CPUs, send them this article or accompanying video. The current market has a large disconnect between what some large customers are asking for, and large vendors are delivering on and what others in the market know is happening.<span id="more-46716"></span></p>
<h2>Accompanying Video</h2>
<p>This is an important topic. To ensure that we can cover those who like to read/ skim and those who like to get information via audio, we have an accompanying video:</p>
<p><iframe title="Vendor Locking AMD EPYC CPUs Great for Security at a Cost" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNVuTAVYxpM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Feel free to pop open that video on YouTube and check it out or to send to those who prefer not to read.</p>
<h2>Background: How we learned this was a “thing”</h2>
<p>In 2018 we did a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-r7415-review/">Dell EMC PowerEdge R7415 review</a> and as part of that review, we started our normal process of trying different CPUs in the system. Early in that process, we used an AMD EPYC 7251 CPU, the low-end 8-core model, and noticed something curious. It would not work in our other test systems after.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, we found it was because Dell EMC was vendor locking the chips to Dell systems. We did not know exactly why, but we were told was a security feature. At this point, and even to this day two years later, not every vendor takes advantage of all of the AMD EPYC security features. What that practically means is that what we saw with the Dell EMC system is not what we saw with other systems. For example, we were able to interchangeably use CPUs in Supermicro and Tyan systems, but we could not use those systems once they went into a Dell EMC server.</p>

<p>We found we were not alone. Laboratories, VARs, and other organizations were finding that transferring AMD EPYC CPUs from one vendor’s system to another, was not the simple process it was on the Intel Xeon side. It did not always work.</p>
<p>We knew it was a security feature and thought that most who are buying servers would be informed of this by their sales reps or channel partners. After I personally got a lot of texts, e-mails, instant messaging, and comments on our C6525 video and article, I realized that this actually may be a situation where many people do not know what is going on.</p>

<p>This experience that we had, apparently is one that is not overly common yet. That makes sense because the systems that utilize the enhanced security levels are still largely new, and being used by their first buyers. Also, AMD still has a smaller market share than Intel. A big reason, by the way, that Intel Xeon does not have this issue is that they do not have the security feature that AMD has. Vendors have come out and stated that their AMD EPYC systems are more secure than their Intel Xeon systems, and this behavior is a byproduct of that enhanced security.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to dive into the feature of AMD processors (and what will be more common in future CPUs from other vendors.)</p>
<h2>AMD EPYC Secure Processor Platform Secure Boot (PSB)</h2>
<p>Let us start with the high-level slide. This is effectively the same slide on the AMD Secure Processor that we saw with the AMD EPYC 7001 series launch, but this is from the EPYC 7002 series. AMD EPYC CPUs may be x86, but they have an embedded Arm Cortex-A5 microcontroller that runs its own OS that is independent of the main system. This AMD Secure Processor is the backbone of AMD’s security push as it provides features such as key management and hardware root of trust for the platform.</p>

<p>AMD spends time <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-confirms-cts-labs-exploits-requiring-admin-access/">patching this solution</a>&nbsp;to make it more secure, but it is generally fairly hard to reach without some extremely low-level access in a system. We are going to come back to the “Enables hardware validated boot” line shortly, but it is important to understand that this secure processor underpins many of AMD’s best security features.</p>
<p>For example, at STH we use EPYC’s Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization heavily. With AMD EPYC, we do not have to manually manage keys. Instead, the ephemeral keys are managed for us by the AMD Secure Processor. This is the basis for what is really the building wave of confidential computing offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-cloud-confidential-computing-enabled-by-amd-epyc-sev/">Google Cloud Confidential Computing Enabled by AMD EPYC SEV</a>. Intel has its secure boot features and SGX that will be enhanced greatly with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake Xeons</a>, but for now, AMD has this capability while Intel does not. When big vendors say AMD is more secure, the AMD Secure Processor is a cornerstone of those offerings.</p>

<p>Let us discuss that “Enables hardware validated boot” line. While traditionally CPUs just fire up in whatever platform they are in, AMD has intelligence in their CPU due to the Arm-based AMD Secure Processor. EPYC CPUs are designed to be a bit more intelligent about the platforms they are in, and interact with server platform security to act as this root of trust that would not be possible if they effectively just booted up in any system.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from AMD describing the AMD Platform Secure Boot.</p>
<p><em>The AMD Platform Secure Boot Feature (PSB) is a mitigation for firmware Advanced Persistent Threats. It is a defense-in-depth feature. PSB extends AMD’s silicon root of trust to protect the OEM’s BIOS.&nbsp; This allows the OEM to establish an unbroken chain of trust from AMD’s silicon root of trust to the OEM’s BIOS using PSB, and then from the OEM’s BIOS to the OS Bootloader using UEFI secure boot. This provides a very powerful defense against remote attackers seeking to embed malware into a platform’s firmware.</em></p>
<p><em>An OEM who trusts only their own cryptographically signed BIOS code to run on their platforms will use a PSB enabled motherboard and set one-time-programmable fuses in the processor to bind the processor to the OEM’s firmware code signing key. AMD processors are shipped unlocked from the factory, and can initially be used with any OEM’s motherboard. But once they are used with a motherboard with PSB enabled, the security fuses will be set, and from that point on, that processor can only be used with motherboards that use the same code signing key. (<strong>Source</strong>: AMD statement to STH)</em></p>
<p>That is a lot to take in. We asked HPE about this. Their response mirrored what the above was describing. HPE firmware, when a system is first turned on, performs this binding process where the AMD EPYC CPU expects to see HPE signed firmware. If you alter the HPE firmware on the system, the check fails and the system will not work. That means if your HPE motherboard fails, you can replace it and put your CPU in another HPE motherboard with signed HPE firmware. It also means if the server platform’s firmware is not signed by HPE, the processor will see it as evidence of tampering and not work.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: 2020-09-09</strong> – HPE clarified that they are doing this in a different manner than Dell after initially confirming that they were using the AMD PSB feature. After this went live, HPE sent us the following:</p>
<p><em>HPE does not use the same security technique that Dell is using for a BIOS hardware root of trust. HPE does not burn, fuse, or permanently store our public key into AMD processors which ship with our products. HPE uses a unique approach to authenticate our BIOS and BMC firmware: HPE fuses our hardware – or silicon – root of trust into our own BMC silicon to ensure only authenticated firmware is executed.&nbsp; Thus, while we implement a hardware root of trust for our BIOS and BMC firmware, the processors that ship with our servers are not locked to our platforms. (<strong>Source</strong>: HPE)</em></p>
<p>What is at least interesting there is that HPE was initially claiming feature parity with Dell to us, and from the comments on this article were saying they used this feature in sales pitches, but now are saying they are not blowing the eFuses.</p>

<p>Here is where the concern develops, and not necessarily for AMD, the OEM, or most of the initial customer base. Customers want more security. The OEMs want to create a secure hardware environment because that is what their customers want. AMD is implementing an advanced security solution beyond what Intel Xeons have giving the OEMs and end-customers what they want. Effectively, when these are sold as new systems, this is exactly what everyone involved wants.</p>
<p>If everyone is getting what they want, then where is the concern, that is what we are going to cover next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Half-way through 2012, you’d have been forgiven for thinking that Facebook was doing a MySpace. In other words, Facebook was on a fast path to slow, painful decline.</p>
<p>Yahoo had just sued Facebook <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-facebook-lawsuit/yahoo-sues-facebook-for-infringing-10-patents-idUSBRE82B18M20120312">for patent infringement</a>. Zuck - like Steve Jobs before him - had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">bet too early</a> on the mobile web, and Facebook’s HTML5-powered apps were slow and buggy. Some argued that Zuck had overpaid for Instagram - $1billion for a 12 person company with no revenue, valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/right-before-acquisition-instagram-closed-50m-at-a-500m-valuation-from-sequoia-thrive-greylock-and-benchmark/">half that amount</a> a week before Facebook bought it.</p>
<p>The share price was tanking, having lost more than half its value just 3 months after going public. In Q3 2012 the company posted a net loss - it’s second quarter as a public company. And, though more than 50% of monthly active users visited Facebook on mobile, those users generated almost no advertising revenue.</p>
<p>If that wasn’t enough to finish Facebook off, advertisers weren’t exactly flocking to it, either.</p>
<p>Google’s search ads had earned a reputation as “the new standard” in the world of direct response advertising. They were easy to buy, easy to optimise, and it was easy enough to measure the impact of them. Google had tapped directly into a “standards-based” form of brand advertising, too. Adsense enabled advertisers to buy - through auction, at scale - display ads in standard IAB formats across hundreds of thousands of websites. Plug in your existing messages and creative, pick your audience, and go. SMBs loved it.</p>

<em>Exactly how many questions could be a in a Question ad?</em></p>

<p>In stark contrast, Facebook ads were almost impossible to buy. There were 27 different ad units to choose from. Facebook’s “Ads and Sponsored Stories Guide” was <a href="https://allfacebook.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Facebook-Ads-and-Sponsored-Stories-Guide-Januar-2013.pdf">45 pages long</a>. To ensure maximum reach to Facebook’s audience on desktop and mobile, advertisers were required to create a gazillion images of various different dimensions and ratios. An infestation of bugs paused ad campaigns for no discernable reason (usually on Fridays, for entire weekends). Even worse, GM - one of the biggest brand advertisers on Facebook - publicly said <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304192704577406394017764460">Facebook ads didn’t work</a>.</p>
<p>For a newly-listed company, with an advertising-based business model, the situation looked pretty bleak. Facebook was surely destined to join MySpace and Friendster in the dot-com deadpool.</p>
<p>Of course, as we now know, that never actually happened. Less than a year later, when Facebook announced Q2 2013 earnings, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/24/4553942/facebooks-q2-2013-earnings-beat-expectations-on-revenue-and-profit">stock shot up 21% in after hours trading</a> after an earnings beat. Mobile accounted for 41% of revenue, up from 30% the quarter before. Facebook reported its first quarter with over 1 million active advertisers. Advertising revenue in “International” markets (EMEA, APAC, and LATAM) was doubling year-over-year. ARPU - a helpful metric to understand advertising auction demand - was growing faster than ever ($1.60 in Q2 2013, it’s $7.26 today).</p>
<p>How the heck did that happen? Simple answer: some good old <a href="https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/wtf-is-a--platform/" title="What is a Platform?">platform thinking</a>. And rationalizing.</p>
<p>When Facebook’s Ads Product team solicited feedback from marketers, it came thick and fast. It wasn’t great. Creating campaigns was equally intimidating, confusing and time consuming. Marketers were already investing time and money to create “organic” content on Facebook, like Page Posts. Adding 27 ad formats to the mix would create additional “work-work” for them.</p>
<p>To build empathy with the people they were serving, Ads PMs started adding the likes of David Ogilvy and Marshall McLuhan to their “must read” lists. And they started talking to the Ads API ecosystem more. Turns out the “work-work” problem was affecting developers, too. There were multiple ways to do similar things - or the same thing - through Facebook’s Marketing APIs. Internal confusion had been externalised to them. Wasting time re-inventing the wheel and implementing a constant barrage of new, different ad formats ate up their innovation budget.</p>
<p>A simpler approach was required. Marketers, developers, and Facebook were counting on it.</p>

<em>Paul Adams (now SVP Product at Intercom) was a Facebook Ads PM around then, and used simple diagrams like this to explain the “messages, containers, channels” idea.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook’s Ads team quickly realised advertising on Facebook shouldn’t be all that different from advertising through any medium, old or new. It didn’t matter if was billboards, newspapers, magazines, leaflets, display ads, search ads, social ads, or emails, the basics were the same - marketers wanted to get messages in front of people, to drive a response.</p>
<p>The channels may vary, and containers within those channels may vary, but the messages and objectives were the same. And, of course, the best messages were those that started new relationships between businesses and customers.</p>
<p>This simple insight brought clarity to the conversation, and to the roadmap. Marketers were already creating “messages” on Facebook, after all - Page Posts. Instead of creating “ads” why not make it so that marketers could simply pay to get their existing messages in front of more people?</p>
<p>And, if these messages contained images - wasn’t that just the same thing as “ad creative?”</p>
<p>And, if these messages already appeared in users’ feeds, didn’t “feed” also mean “mobile feed”?</p>
<p>And, if marketers paid to promote these messages in “mobile feed,” aren’t they “mobile ads?”</p>
<p>The penny dropped.</p>
<p>For a self-proclaimed “platform company,” the approach to serving marketers and developers hadn’t been “platform-ey” at all. Lots of complexity, no consistency. Lots of distinct features were built, not rationalized capabilities. The feedback shared by marketers and developers was spot on - there <em>were</em> so many ways to do similar things - or the same thing - through every ads interface, not just Facebook’s APIs. An embarrassing oversight, but fixable with the right framework.</p>
<p>Changes came thick and fast. In June 2013, Fidji Simo penned - on behalf of the Ads Product team - “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2013/06/an-update-on-facebook-ads/">an update on Facebook Ads</a>.” She used words like <em>simplify</em>, <em>consistent</em>, <em>redundancies</em>, <em>streamline</em>, and <em>objectives</em> to describe what was changing. Messages and images would gracefully degrade, depending on where they were delivered to people. The number of ad units would be reduced from 27 to fewer than half of that. Her final sentence summarised the changes well:</p>
<p>“We think these updates will make it easier for them (marketers) to do what they do best: reach the right groups of people with the right message and drive the results they care most about.”</p>

<p><em>Different containers, different channels, same message.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To say that Fidji was right is a mild understatement. Since 2012, marketers have <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/2496/facebook-revenue-by-segment/">invested over $167billion in mobile advertising through Facebook</a>. In the 3rd quarter of 2019, mobile advertising represented 94% of Facebook’s overall advertising revenue. And, not all of that revenue came from the “big blue” Facebook app.</p>
<p>By simplifying the concept of a “message” reaching the “right groups of people” to “drive results,” advertisers could extend their advertising campaigns to Instagram and Facebook Audience Network with no additional effort. The messages they created would simply be presented in different types of containers, on different channels. When ads on Facebook Messenger appeared, the same messages created for Facebook and Instagram “gracefully degraded” to fit the containers on that new channel.</p>
<p>Even better, ads could quite literally be a new way to start a conversation with customers - through Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. It was easy. SMBs loved it.</p>
<p>It didn’t stop there - life for developers improved, too. The process of integrating with Facebook’s Ads APIs became easier, and - by rationalizing across interfaces, including APIs - developers had more headspace and capacity to innovate. New Facebook Marketing Partners emerged with innovative solutions. Some, like Wix, created solutions to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/07/14/wixs-integration-with-facebook-lets-you-create-page-post-ad-campaigns-via-wix-shoutout-newsletters/">extend the reach of email marketing campaigns to Facebook</a>. Others, like StitcherAds and Smartly.io enabled marketers to create <a href="https://stitcherads.com/digital-circulars/">digital circulars</a> and <a href="https://www.smartly.io/">data-fuelled ad creative</a>. As of March 2019, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2019/05/17/helsinki-born-kristo-ovaska-built-smartly-io-for-a-facebook-driven-ad-world/#799bce6d23df">almost $2 billion of Facebook’s annual revenue</a> flows through Smartly.io - just one partner, based in Finland. There are more like them.</p>
<p>Facebook may have solved the “reach the right groups of people with the right message” problem well for advertisers within their own walled garden, but that doesn’t mean they’ve solved it for every business in the world. These days, the volume of inbound and outbound messages - emails, SMS, WhatsApp, and the rest - is ever increasing. A challenge for everyone, not just marketers.</p>
<p>Every team, in every business, wrestles with an infinite stream of inbound messages, and outbound messages that need to land in various apps and inboxes, on a myriad of devices, formatted in different ways. The number of “channels” is exploding, not consolidating. These days, TikTok is the new Tencent, Twilio is the new Telephone. <a href="https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/browsers--not-apps--are-still-the-future-of-mobile/" title="Browsers, not apps, are still the future of mobile">WhatsApp and WeChat are the new browsers</a>. Email and SMS are alive and well. But, just like Facebook advertising back in the day, managing all of this can be equally intimidating, confusing and time consuming.</p>
<p>The likes of Twilio - now a $40billion market cap company - are using terms like <em>omni-channel</em>, <em>programmable conversations</em> and <em>conversational messaging</em> to describe their capability to process and route inbound messages to the right teams, and route outbound messages to recipients on the channels they are most engaged with. Channels they ingest from and output to include email, SMS, voice, WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, Telegram, and many, many more.</p>
<p>If this all sounds familiar, it’s because it should be. “Graceful degradation” and orchestration of inbound and outbound messages across channels is uncannily similar to the “platform thinking” Facebook applied to create an entirely new multi-billion dollar mobile ads business.</p>
<p>This challenge, by itself, creates a market opportunity far greater than Facebook or Google's market cap. These days, the opportunity can be sized in terms of $trillions, …</p></div></div></div></div>

                        <div><p>
                            There are a few reasons you may need to be able to prove who you are without revealing who you are.</p><p>
                            
                            Suppose you desire to share many different pieces of information online but must remain anonymous for security reasons. Since you are anonymous, you have no reputation online and therefore no trust or credibility.<br>
                            You can release one piece of information that will later prove to be true, thus gaining credibility for yourself. People will now take your information seriously, except you were fully anonymous, so that credibility is useless to you as you can't claim it in the future when sharing future information.<br>
                            What's worse, others may impersonate you, claiming to be the original author of the first piece of information, and then share bad information thus soiling all of the credibility you built up.</p><p>
                            
                            With AnoProof you can sign your first piece of information with an AnoProof signature using your AnoProof secret key.<br>
                            Now, once it gains credibility, you can sign your future informations with your same secret key.<br>
                            Using AnoProof, anyone can verify that the future information (signed) was authored by the same anonymous author as the original credible information.
                            </p></div><hr>
                            <p>
                            AnoProof doesn't always have to be used anonymously, another great use-case for AnoProof is in proving your known identity, online, in an ever increasing world of spoofing, deep-fakes, and general impersonation.</p><p>
                            
                            Consider the <a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/leoni-ag-email-scam-40-million-ceo-hack-september-2016/">case of Leoni AG</a>, in which the CEO instructed the CFO to wire transfer $40m to an offshore account, the only problem for the CFO, it wasn't a true eMail from the CEO, it was a hacker pretending to be the CEO.<br>
                            Had the company policy been that all instructions of such nature must be signed with an AnoProof signature, the CFO could have easily proven that the hackers weren't the CEO.</p><p>
                            
                            This example was just a simple eMail spoofing, but imagine a few years from now when DeepFakes, SIM spoofing, and a combination of other tools will allow a hacker to video call one of your employees, and pretend to be you not only with caller ID but visibly and audibly as well.<br>
                            Signing protocols like AnoProof will become more and more necessary in the identity verification crisis realm AI will bring us towards.</p><hr>
                            <p>
                            To use AnoProof, simply paste, verbatim, two messages that have AnoProof signatures, in the text boxes at the bottom of this page, then tap the 'Verify' button.</p><p>

<p><em>Written by Cody Burkard, Senior Security Consultant, mnemonic</em></p>

<h2>Tl;dr</h2>
<p>mnemonic researchers have discovered a new technique for escalating privileges within Azure environments through the abuse of dynamic groups in Azure Active Directory. Organizations that employ dynamic groups for assigning user roles and rights should review their Azure Active Directory configuration to ensure they are not susceptible to this attack.</p>

<h2>Cloud security != On-prem security</h2>
<p>As organizations continue to migrate parts or all of their infrastructure to the cloud, security personnel need to adapt and understand the threats related to this cloud transition. At first glance, this doesn’t appear all too complicated, and security teams can take similar approaches to networking security as they have in traditional on-premise networks: VPNs for connectivity, network segmentation, network security appliances, agents, hardened virtual machines, etc. While these are all valid security measures for cloud infrastructure, they don’t address security concerns related to the management of infrastructure and users in the cloud.</p>
<p>For example, consider an adversary that is targeting a VM on an internal Azure network. The adversary cannot gain network access to the private Azure VNet that the VM resides on, but finds the password to an account in Azure AD. If the compromised user account has access to modify the infrastructure within Azure, they can bypass network and host-level security controls. The adversary could simply update the VM so that they may access it, or directly execute code on it. This scenario is shown below:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/contentassets/1e70019b2fd44c0eaba8f5e8a3a88fff/managementplaneattack-1.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/contentassets/1e70019b2fd44c0eaba8f5e8a3a88fff/managementplaneattack-1.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>This is a very simple example of pivoting into infrastructure through Azure’s “management plane”, which is used by legitimate users to manage infrastructure. This scenario is dependent on an adversary compromising an account in AAD that has privileges to run commands on VMs within the Azure infrastructure.</p>
<p>This may seem like a somewhat naïve and simple example given the requirement for a pre-compromised AAD account with special permissions in Azure. However, commonly successful techniques such as phishing, password cracking or identification of leaked secrets can lead to the compromise of an AAD account. If an account compromised using one of those techniques does not have administrative permissions, then the goal of the adversary is to identify some privileged escalation that helps them gain higher permissions.</p>
<p>The remainder of this blog post focuses on the topic of elevating privileges in Azure infrastructure with a previously compromised Azure AD account. A full summary of previous work on this topic will be contained in a future post, whereas this post will focus on a new technique targeting AAD dynamic groups.</p>

<h2>Some background on Azure Active Directory</h2>
<p>Let’s start by clearing the air about Azure vs Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD).</p>
<p>When we talk about Azure, many folks jump straight to thinking about Azure Active Directory, or even Office 365. This is a common point of confusion. Microsoft has a large cloud ecosystem that is tied together with identity management and authentication through Azure Active Directory.</p>
<p>Azure Active Directory uses “tenants” to represent different organizations and environments within a company’s Microsoft cloud ecosystem, and includes a collection of users, groups and rights.&nbsp; Any one tenant may be connected to a single Office365 account, any number of Azure subscriptions, Dynamics365, Outlook, and other Microsoft cloud services.</p>
<p>So while the same Azure AD users may be used for all of these services, Azure AD is <em>not</em> a part of Azure nor a part of Office 365. Azure AD is a separate entity that handles user management and authentication, and has tight integrations with other Microsoft services.</p>
<p>With this straight, let’s briefly cover a few other basic topics that are relevant for the privilege escalation technique.</p>
<h3><strong>Azure AD Roles</strong></h3>
<p>Roles in Azure AD are top-level roles in the Microsoft Azure AD tenant for Azure AD users. At the time of writing this article, the assignment of some admin roles to Service Principal objects is also in preview. Azure AD roles allow users or service principals to perform actions including, but not limited, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing security groups</li>
<li>Managing users</li>
<li>Accessing Azure infrastructure</li>
<li>Creating and managing Azure AD applications (Service Principals)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot illustrates some of these Azure AD Roles in Azure Portal:&nbsp;</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/azure-2.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/azure-2.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<h3><strong>Azure RBAC Roles</strong></h3>
<p>Azure RBAC (role-based access control) roles govern access to the infrastructure deployed within Azure. This is a large and complicated topic, but the important thing to understand here is that RBAC roles determine what actions an Azure AD principal can take on specific resources deployed in Azure. For example, to deploy a VM, a user must be assigned an RBAC role that includes that action, such as owner or contributor.</p>
<h3><strong>Azure AD Security Groups</strong></h3>
<p>In Azure AD, users can be added into logical groups to help with user and access management. Azure RBAC roles and Azure AD roles can then be assigned to these groups (Azure AD role assignments to groups is in preview at the time of writing). This means that any user that is added to a group will then inherit the roles assigned to that group.</p>

<h2>The technique – abusing dynamic groups</h2>
<p>While researching and testing Azure deployments, I stumbled upon an interesting privilege escalation vector: the abuse of dynamic groups in Azure AD.</p>
<h3><strong>What are dynamic groups?</strong></h3>
<p>Dynamic groups in Azure AD allow administrators to automatically assign group memberships to users based on attributes of that user. For example, if a company has two offices in Oslo and London, they may create security groups for each of their offices. They can use dynamic groups based on the user’s “city” attribute for this purpose, so that whenever a new user is added to Azure AD, they will automatically be added to one of these two groups.</p>
<p>The following picture shows how you would do this with a dynamic group rule:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-3.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-3.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>This use case is fairly innocent. But let’s think of a more security sensitive case.</p>
<h3><strong>A real-world scenario for the attack</strong></h3>
<p>An organization creates a dynamic group called VM Contributors, which has VM Contributor Access scoped to the subscription:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-4.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-4.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now, this organization outsources all VM management to a company called “Bluefish”, and Bluefish uses the following naming convention:</p>

<p>To automate the process of Bluefish users being assigned VM Contributor, a rule is added to dynamically add any user with “bluefish” in the userPrincipalName (UPN) to the VM Contributor group. Seems reasonable and innocuous, since users cannot modify their UPN without appropriate access rights, and the organization has locked these down.</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-5.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-5.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<h3><strong>Time to escalate some privileges</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s assume for our scenario that an adversary gains access to a low-privileged user in Azure AD, which resides in no groups or Azure RBAC roles. The compromised user has the “Global Reader” role, so the attacker can read configurations in the directory, but cannot change settings, and therefore cannot use traditional methods to change access rights to their own user, or to other users.</p>
<p>The attacker finds the dynamic membership rule, and wants to find a way to trigger the dynamic rule for an account they control. In short, the attacker needs to get the name “bluefish” in the UPN attribute of their user:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/userprofile-6.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/userprofile-6.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Since users with the Global Reader role cannot edit any configurations, the attacker cannot edit their own UPN and is stuck.</p>
<h3><strong>UPN</strong></h3>
<p>User Principal Names are based on user email addresses. I have identified dynamic groups based on this attribute in the past, and on the surface seems to be okay because users generally cannot change their own email addresses. This requires administrative privileges within Azure AD and a role such as “User Administrator”. However, there is a way around this…</p>
<h3><strong>Abusing Guest Accounts</strong></h3>
<p>By default, users in Azure AD can invite guest users to the directory. Since the UPN of a guest user is still based on email addresses, an adversary can simply create a new email address from any email provider, such as Gmail, that contains “bluefish” in the address. For example:</p>

<p>If the attacker invites this email to the azure tenant:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/inviteguestuser-7.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/inviteguestuser-7.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>And then accepts the invite, the user will become a user in the local directory with an interesting UPN:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/newuser-8.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/newuser-8.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now we can go into the portal and check our group assignments:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/groupmembership-9.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/groupmembership-9.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now the attacker has access to the testDynamicGroup, which assigns the VM contributor role through a dynamic group membership.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>The attacker starts with a Global Reader in Azure AD</li>
<li>The attacker finds a dynamic group with the VM Contributor role assigned
<ol>
<li>Membership is dynamic based on the string “bluefish” existing in the UPN</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The attacker can invite guests, as per the default setting</li>
<li>The attacker invites a guest Gmail account with bluefish in the address - <span data-e="D4B9BBB7FAB8BDB5B9B394BCA7BDB2B1A1B8B6B0A6B5BFA6A1B6B0B7"></span></li>
<li>The guest account triggers the dynamic group after accepting, and inherits the VM Contributor role in Azure RBAC</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Notes on dynamic group abuse</strong></h3>
<p>In this example, we show how dynamic groups based on a UPN can be abused using a guest account. However, there are many other attributes for determining dynamic group membership, and different types of attackers could abuse each. <strong>When setting up dynamic groups, consider whether lower privileged users or external attackers could modify the attributes that define that group.</strong></p>
<p>The following are other potential attack paths to modify user attributes on dynamic groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>AD Connect Sync – An attacker may modify user attributes in an on-premise system, and Azure AD Connect …</li></ul></div></div>

<a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a>. We won't go into detail about the design or
architecture of NestJS applications specifically, so if you're unfamiliar with
the framework I'd recommend you check out its docs first, or simply skip to
another one of our
<a href="https://github.com/architect-team/architect-cli/tree/master/examples/react-app">Node.js samples</a>
that uses <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> directly.</p>

<p>NestJS is an opinionated framework for developing server-side Node.js
applications, including, but not limited to, microservices. Their default walk
throughs and tutorials all show how to create and operate a REST API using
NestJS, but in this tutorial we'll show how to use some of their other helpful
microservice libraries to create and operate a TCP-based microservice.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.architect.io/images/blog/nestjs-microservices-simple/tcp-services.png" alt="TCP services"></p>
<p>To start, let's download NestJS's CLI to help us bootstrap our new microservice
project. The CLI will do all the work to build the project skeleton making it a
lot easier for us to make the changes we need:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new nestjs-microservice</code></pre></div>
<p>Once the application has been fully initialized, we're going to install the
NestJS microservices library to help us modify the boilerplate application from
an http-based REST API to a TCP-based microservice:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> i --save @nestjs/microservices</code></pre></div>
<p>Once installed, go ahead and replace the contents of your <code>src/main.ts</code> file
with the following:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> NestFactory <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/core'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> Transport <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> AppModule <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'src/app.module'</span><span>;</span>

<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>bootstrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      host<span>:</span> <span>'0.0.0.0'</span><span>,</span>
      port<span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>await</span> app<span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'Microservice listening on port:'</span><span>,</span> port<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>bootstrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you're already familiar with NestJS, this file should be easy to read
through. The only unique part is how we're initializing the application –
instead of using the default <code>NestFactory.create()</code> method, we're using
<code>NestFactory.createMicroservice()</code> which provides us additional controls over
the protocols and contracts our application responds to:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>const</span> app <span>=</span> <span>await</span> NestFactory<span>.</span><span>createMicroservice</span><span>(</span>AppModule<span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  transport<span>:</span> Transport<span>.</span><span>TCP</span><span>,</span>
  options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    host<span>:</span> <span>'0.0.0.0'</span><span>,</span>
    port<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above snippet, we're declaring that our microservice responds to <code>TCP</code>
requests and listens on our configurable port (defaults to <code>8080</code>). This means
our service won't be a REST API, but will respond to a more raw request format.</p>
<p>Next, let's take a look at the generated controller which defines the routes and
methods our API responds to, <code>src/app.controller.ts</code>. Since our microservices
responds to TCP requests instead of HTTP, we'll need to change the annotations
on our controller methods to respond to more relevant request structures. Go
ahead and paste the contents below into the file:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Controller <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/common'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> MessagePattern <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>

@<span>Controller</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppController</span> <span>{</span>
  @<span>MessagePattern</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> cmd<span>:</span> <span>'hello'</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>hello</span><span>(</span>input<span>?</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Hello, </span><span><span>${</span>input <span>||</span> <span>'there'</span><span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the way we define and annotate NestJS controllers remains the
same as the generated project code, but the way we annotate methods within our
controllers is different. Instead of using <code>@Get()</code>, <code>@Post()</code>, and other
http-specific annotations, we define our TCP interfaces using
<code>@MessagePattern()</code> – an annotation that maps controller methods to incoming
requests so long as they match the provided pattern. In our case, we've defined
the pattern to be any request that contains <code>{ cmd: 'hello' }</code>. We also expect
the request payload to be an optional string that will be used to enrich our
response:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>hello</span><span>(</span>input<span>?</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Hello, </span><span><span>${</span>input <span>||</span> <span>'there'</span><span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Great! Now let's make sure our microservice will start up. Our NestJS project
came pre-baked with a <code>package.json</code> file that includes all the appropriate
start commands, so let's use the one designed for local development:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> run start:dev
<span>[</span><span>5</span>:41:22 PM<span>]</span> Starting compilation <span>in</span> <span>watch</span> mode<span>..</span>.
<span>[</span><span>5</span>:41:27 PM<span>]</span> Found <span>0</span> errors. Watching <span>for</span> <span>file</span> changes.

<span>[</span>Nest<span>]</span> <span>6361</span>   - 08/31/2020, <span>5</span>:41:28 PM   <span>[</span>InstanceLoader<span>]</span> AppModule dependencies initialized +20ms

Microservice listening on port: <span>8080</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we know the application boots correctly, let's build a <code>Dockerfile</code> for
the service. Creating a <code>Dockerfile</code> will allow our service to be built into a
portable, scalable image that anyone (or any machine) can run consistently
without issues. This means we'll be able to run it ourselves in a stable virtual
environment, we'll be able to hand it off to team members to test more easily,
and we'll be able to deploy it to production-grade environments with ease.</p>
<p>Our <code>Dockerfile</code> will inherit from an open-source node image, install npm
modules, and will run our <code>npm run build</code> command to transpile our typescript
and minimize the code footprint. Simple copy the file contents</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code>
<span>FROM</span> node<span>:</span>13
<span>WORKDIR</span> /usr/src/app


<span>COPY</span> package*.json tsconfig*.json ./
<span>RUN</span> npm install


<span>COPY</span> src/ src/


<span>RUN</span> npm run build


<span>RUN</span> rm <span>-</span>r src


<span>CMD</span> <span>[</span><span>"npm"</span><span>,</span> <span>"run"</span><span>,</span> <span>"start:prod"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="creating-a-client-service"><a href="#creating-a-client-service" aria-label="creating a client service permalink"></a>Creating a client service</h2>
<p>Knowing that our microservice is booting up properly is great, but the best way
to test it in a practical setting is to see if we can extend it from another
microservice. So let's go ahead and create one!</p>
<p>Just like with the previous service, let's start by creating a new NestJS
project:</p>

<p>Let's also install two additional NestJS libraries. The first is the config
library to make it easier to parse and manage application variables, and the
second is the microservices library which contains several helper methods that
can be used to more easily access other NestJS microservices:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> i --save @nestjs/config @nestjs/microservices</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have our required libraries installed, let's use them both together
to create a client service for accessing the microservice we created in the
previous step. Open up <code>src/app.module.ts</code> and paste in the following contents:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Module <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/common'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> ConfigModule<span>,</span> ConfigService <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/config'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> ClientProxyFactory<span>,</span> Transport <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> AppController <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./app.controller'</span><span>;</span>

@<span>Module</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  imports<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigModule<span>.</span><span>forRoot</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  controllers<span>:</span> <span>[</span>AppController<span>]</span><span>,</span>
  providers<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      provide<span>:</span> <span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>,</span>
      inject<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigService<span>]</span><span>,</span>
      <span>useFactory</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>configService<span>:</span> ConfigService</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        ClientProxyFactory<span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
          transport<span>:</span> Transport<span>.</span><span>TCP</span><span>,</span>
          options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            host<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_HOST'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
            port<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_PORT'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
          <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppModule</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first thing to note from the file contents above is the import of the config
module. This import allows the <code>ConfigService</code> to be utilized throughout our
application module:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code>imports<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigModule<span>.</span><span>forRoot</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The next addition to the file is the <code>HELLO_SERVICE</code> provider. This is where we
use <code>ClientProxyFactory</code> from the nest microservices library to create a service
that allows us to make calls to our other microservice:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  provide<span>:</span> <span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>,</span>
  inject<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigService<span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>useFactory</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>configService<span>:</span> ConfigService</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> ClientProxyFactory<span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    transport<span>:</span> Transport<span>.</span><span>TCP</span><span>,</span>
    options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      host<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_HOST'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
      port<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_PORT'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above snippet, we're registering a <code>ClientProxy</code> instance to the provider
key <code>HELLO_SERVICE</code> that points to <code>HELLO_SERVICE_HOST</code> listening on
<code>HELLO_SERVICE_PORT</code>. These two values come from the ConfigService we imported
earlier, and the values are loaded up from environment parameters. This kind pf
parameterization is crucial to enable us to run the service in multiple
environments (like dev, staging, and production) without code changes.</p>
<p>Now that we've successfully created our proxy instance, let's open up
<code>src/app.controller.ts</code> and set it up with our proxy methods. Paste the
following content into the file:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Controller<span>,</span> Get<span>,</span> Inject<span>,</span> Param <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/common'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> ClientProxy <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>

@<span>Controller</span><span>(</span><span>'hello'</span><span>)</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppController</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>@<span>Inject</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>)</span> <span>private</span> client<span>:</span> ClientProxy<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

  @<span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>':name'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>getHelloByName</span><span>(</span>@<span>Param</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>)</span> name <span>=</span> <span>'there'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>client<span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> cmd<span>:</span> <span>'hello'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first thing you'll see is that we've injected an instance of our client
proxy into the controller. We registered with client under the key
<code>HELLO_SERVICE</code>, so this is the key we use to indicate which client instance we
want injected:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>constructor</span><span>(</span>
  @<span>Inject</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>)</span> <span>private</span> client<span>:</span> ClientProxy
<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Armed with a client that points to our TCP microservice, we can start sending
requests that match the <code>@MessagePattern</code> we defined in the service:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code>@<span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>':name'</span><span>)</span>
<span>getHelloByName</span><span>(</span>@<span>Para…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

But hold on. The argument for taking Vitamin D assumes a few things. First, that low Vitamin D actually causes all of the conditions it is associated with. This is not necessarily true. Low Vitamin D could cause (or contribute to) heart disease, but it could also be that heart disease causes low Vitamin D. Another possibility is that some third factor causes both low Vitamin D and heart disease. </p><p id="viewer-9g65f">Even if we can prove some causation, we then need to assume that correcting the Vitamin D deficiency will prevent the disease. This may not be true either. Low Vitamin D may be an indicator of overall poor health, which increases the risk for cardiac disease. It could appear that low Vitamin D contributes to the condition. But raising the Vitamin D will not help because it will just fix the symptom, not the underlying problem. </p><h3 id="viewer-399rj"><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-4p68a">Fortunately we have studies that can help figure this out. Currently the best way to answer a question of clinical relevance is with a large, well-executed <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT).</strong> An RCT works like this: enroll the participants you want to study and randomly assign half of them to receive a treatment and the other half to receive a placebo. Those receiving the treatment are called the intervention group. The other group is the control group. Ideally, the two groups will be similar in every way except the treatment – they will have the same distribution in age, income, race, gender, and health status. They will even receive pills that look identical, though half will be placebos. If, at the end of the study, there are differences between the two groups, we can attribute those differences to the treatment. </p><div id="viewer-3aoj5"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Simple randomized controlled trial "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1674,h_920,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Simple randomized controlled trial "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">Simple randomized controlled trial</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-fvrr">RCTs are costly and time intensive, so generally we will only be able to study the interventions and outcomes that have the highest chance of showing a benefit. We base this on prior studies; if several large observational studies show a correlation between Vitamin D and heart disease, then this is something we should study with an RCT. </p><p id="viewer-1ofc5">
We now have results for over 1500 RCTs on Vitamin D supplementation. Some of the largest and most significant trials are listed and summarized at the end of this article. When tested on its ability to prevent disease, <strong>Vitamin D has failed to live up to expectations</strong>. </p><div id="viewer-b7fav"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Results of Vitamin D Trials "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1206,h_878,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Results of Vitamin D Trials "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">For more details, see the list of high-quality RCTs at the bottom of this page</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-en75e">One of the largest and best studies we have is called <a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VITAL</u></a>, led by Dr. JoAnn Manson at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Over 25,000 adults (men age 50 and older, women age 55 and older) with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer participated in the study. They received either 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 or placebo daily for five years. Researchers evaluated the rates of cancer and major cardiovascular events including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. </p><p id="viewer-f6k24"><strong>The result: Vitamin D failed to prevent cancer, stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death. </strong>These conditions occurred at the same rate in those receiving Vitamin D and those receiving placebo. There was one positive finding, though: in a post hoc analysis, it seemed that Vitamin D decreased the mortality from cancer when the initial two years were excluded. Post hoc (“after the event”) analyses can be quite useful, but need to be viewed with some skepticism. In high-quality RCTs (like VITAL), the outcome measures and statistical analyses are specified prior to data collection. Sometimes, as in VITAL’s case, an unexpected outcome may appear at the time the data are evaluated, prompting a post hoc analysis. In this case, when results from the first two years were excluded, the rate of cancer death was 1.2% in the placebo group, and 0.9% in the Vitamin D group - 25% reduction in cancer mortality, though the absolute numbers were low. It is not possible to draw too many conclusions from this, but it is something to note for future studies. </p><p id="viewer-3cooc"><strong>Even in studies of bone health, Vitamin D has been disappointing.</strong> We already know that Vitamin D is essential in calcium metabolism, and Vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets and osteomalacia. Taking Vitamin D to treat severe Vitamin D deficiency is necessary for the treatment of these conditions. But in the large trials looking at Vitamin D's ability to prevent bone loss, the participants were taken from the general population, many of whom had normal Vitamin D levels. For severely deficient individuals (only a small percentage of the population), there are clear benefits to supplementation. These benefits do not appear to extend to those with normal levels or mild deficiencies.</p><h3 id="viewer-ct6r5"><strong>Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ek5t0">Large randomized controlled trials are currently the best way to evaluate a treatment, but they are difficult to do. If done well, an RCT is expensive, time intensive, and challenging to coordinate. It is worth it if we can answer our question adequately, but sometimes we realize after the trial that we needed to account for something else, or that we need more people in the study before we can really answer our question. In addition, RCTs will not always give definitive answers. Sometimes two or more small trials of the same treatment will show opposite results, and we need to reconcile those. Simply redoing an RCT is usually not an option. Instead, scientists have developed a method of combining similar RCTs and analyzing them together, in what is called a meta-analysis. </p><p id="viewer-ab05u">Meta-analyses have exploded in popularity over the last few decades.<span> If done well, a meta-analysis of a group of trials can reveal insights that cannot be seen in the individual trials. Unfortunately there are potential problems. The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality of the studies it includes, which can lead to erroneous results when poor quality studies are present (garbage in, garbage out).</span></p><p id="viewer-9nlvf"><span>In addition, <strong>publication bias</strong> may incorrectly amplify a treatment effect. Publication bias occurs when researchers decide to publish only “positive” findings – studies that show a treatment effect. Suppose ten small trials of Vitamin D are performed. Five show a benefit to Vitamin D and five do not. Researchers and journals are much more inclined to publish positive results than negative, so it is possible that only the five positive studies will make it into the medical literature. A meta-analysis on the five published positive studies will show a much stronger effect of Vitamin D than a meta-analysis that included all ten studies. </span></p><div id="viewer-9ul9t"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_373,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a6n1n"> <em>Where negative studies go to die. </em></p><p id="viewer-a6bj6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosenthal_(psychologist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Robert Rosenthal </u></em></a><em>called publication bias "the file drawer problem" because important negative studies often end up here.

One of the major challenges in performing these analyses is deciding which studies to include or exclude. Ideally only high-quality, well-designed, well-executed studies will be included.

<p>I have recently come into possession of a series of exquisite miniatures which I pray are worthy of your esteemed attention. While my employers are familiar with your <em>unusual tastes</em>, they also appreciate your desire for privacy- this showing was arranged with the utmost discretion, I assure you.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, the pieces might <em>appear</em> remarkably similar. Each canvas is a digitally-reproduced composition measuring ten pixels in height and ten pixels in width, illuminated in a strikingly intense blue.</p>

<p>To an, ahem, <em>avid collector</em> such as yourself, it is no doubt obvious that each print possesses unique <em>qualia</em>, as expounded upon by the artist’s extensive footnotes. Please, take as long as you need…</p>

<figcaption>Becoming and Unbecoming. Macintosh Operating System 10.14.6, Preview.App 10.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist used a carefully selected vintage of the <em>Macintosh</em> operating system. The desktop wallpaper color was customized to consist entirely of the desired blue, and then the <em>Preview</em> application was employed to take a screenshot and perform the necessary trimming. Tragically, <em>Preview</em> cannot save files in the <em>Graphics Interchange Format</em> (GIF).</p>

<figcaption>Pointillism I. Sublime Text 3.2.2, ImageMagick 7.0.8–59</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist manually constructed the image in the <em>Portable PixMap</em> (PPM) format using the <em>Sublime</em> text editor, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>P3

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>ImageMagick</em> application was then used to convert it into a GIF file:</p>

<pre><code>$ convert ii.ppm ii.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Pointillism II. Vim 8.0.1365, FFmpeg 4.1.4</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For this piece, the artist once again created a PPM image, this time using the <em>Vi, Improved</em> text editor, giving the source code a subtly crisper affect:</p>

<pre><code>P3

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group</em> application was then used to generate a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i iii.ppm iii.gif
</code></pre>

<figure>

<figcaption>Searing Light. Nano 2.0.6, POV-Ray 3.7.0</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist composed this piece using the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> language, composing the following script in the <em>Nano’s Another</em> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>background { rgb &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>The scene was then raytraced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ povray +Iiv.pov +W10 +H10 +Oiv
</code></pre>

<p>As with <em>Preview</em> above, the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> is intentionally designed not to support the creation of GIF files; output is a <em>Portable Network Graphics</em> file instead.</p>

<figcaption>The Cobbler. Sublime Text 3.2.2, as 10.0.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This image was composed by the <em>Macintosh Operating System X Mach-O Gnu’s Not Unix-based assembler</em>, a utility for the creation of binary files. The <em>Sublime</em> text editor was once again employed for its neutral tone:</p>

<pre><code>.ascii "GIF89a" # magic number
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0xF0     # 2-entry global color table
.byte  0        # background color index
.byte  0        # 1:1 pixel aspect ratio

.byte  0x00     # color 0: blue
.byte  0x00
.byte  0xFF
.byte  0x00     # color 1: black
.byte  0x00
.byte  0x00

.ascii ","      # image descriptor
.long  0        # x/y offsets
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0        # no local colortable
.byte  0        # minimum LZW code size
.byte  0        # end of frame

.ascii ";"      # finish
</code></pre>

<p>Curiously, the output of this assembler is prefaced with an entirely useless header, which must then be trimmed. (Hopefully future revisions of the tool will correct this obvious usability gaffe!) The composition was thus carried out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ as v.s -o assembled.o
$ dd bs=1 skip=208 if=assembled.o of=v.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Camera Obscura. oK, iKe, Safari 12.1.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, the artist employed the <em>Interactive K Environment</em> (iKe), a tool based around the unfathomably esoteric programming language <em>K</em>. The tool can be used to save animated GIF images of program output; in this case, a single frame as indicated by <code>fc:1</code>. Note that <em>iKe</em> automatically doubles the size of pixels within images when rendering.</p>

<pre><code>w:h:5
fc:1
draw:{,(;,"blue";5 5#0)}
</code></pre>

<p>For this work, the artist composed an electronic mail message to a colleague as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Dear [REDACTED],
I pray this letter finds you well.

I am in grave need of your assistance. I require an opaque image file in the .GIF format,
measuring precisely 10 pixels square, consisting entirely of the hexadecimal RGB color #0000FF.
If you could provide me with such a file as an attachment, I would be immensely grateful.

Warmest Regards,
[REDACTED]

(P.S. This will make more sense later.)
</code></pre>

<p>Some time later, the artist used their electronic mail client to save the final print.</p>

<!-- For the record, this GIF was created in the Windows version of Krita 4.30. Thanks, Michal! -->

</figure>

<p>Here, the artist constructed a virtual machine- a sort of computing matryoshka, if you will- running the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution of the <em>Linux</em> operating system. They then proceeded to install the <em>GIMP</em> application. Despite frequent threats by the developers to remove them, the <em>GIMP</em> application had (at time of composition) some obscure and infrequently-used features permitting the creation and manipulation of image files. After its painstaking creation, the file was then transferred between the virtual machine and its host by way of a physical Universal Serial Bus mass-storage device. The mass-storage device was prepared in advance by formatting it with the 32-bit <em>File Allocation Table</em> filesystem and labeling it <em>Charon</em>, in recognition of its role in transporting the soul of the artwork between worlds.</p>

<figcaption>Composition in Blue and Blue. Gnuplot 5.2, Sublime Text 3.2.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist generated this work using the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em>, based on the following description:</p>

<pre><code>set terminal gif size 10,10
set output 'ix.gif'
set margins 0,0,0,0
unset key
unset tics
unset border
unset label
set style rectangle fs border lc rgb 'blue'
set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb 'blue' behind
plot 1 lt rgb 'blue'
</code></pre>

<p>Note in particular how easily a user of the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em> may customize the background color of a plot. The plot description may then be rendered as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ gnuplot ix.gp 
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-382" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Lots of applications require a Postgres database. Before you can install them, you will need a Postgres database. How do you pick the right Postgres for your application? There are a bewildering variety of possible ways to acquire a database running on a Postgres instance, but the biggest choice is “build or buy”: whether to install a Postgres version on your own or to purchase it as a service.</p><p>lakeFS is yet another Postgres application, so it requires a Postgres database. At Treeverse we decided for now to buy Postgres as a service. I’ll explain the factors why we decided, and how you might decide to whether or not to follow us.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#got-a-postgres"></a>Got a Postgres?</h2><p>If your organization already runs Postgres instances, they may well be the best choice: there can be extensive in-house experience and expertise already present. And you probably don’t need this guide.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#expensive-as-a-service"></a>Expensive as a Service?</h2><p>The most common objection to buying a database as a service is sheer price: a DB instance from your cloud provider can cost more than&nbsp;<em>twice</em>&nbsp;the cost of the virtual machine instance that it runs on. Obviously you pay extra to get much more than just the virtualized resources: you get expertise, much of the ops, easier backup and clustering, sometimes even some features.</p><p>For pricing I believe we should prefer to&nbsp;<em>buy</em>&nbsp;what is not a core part of our business. Pricing can actually make this decision easy. If the cost of buying Postgres as a service is a significant expenditure, then necessarily it is a core part of business — and clearly we need to develop the requisite in-house capability to support it. Otherwise cost is not a driving factor in the decision.</p><p>Even if you decide Postgres is a core capability for your organization, you may wish buy Postgres as a service for an initial ramp-up period, planning to move away later. While migrating database installations generally requires some downtime, this too is often a good choice.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#choices"></a>Choices</h2><p>Every cloud provider provides managed Postgres as a service:</p><ul><li>AWS provide RDS as well as clustered Postgres-compatible Aurora;</li><li>Azure provide Azure Database for PostgreSQL;</li><li>GCP provide Postgres on Cloud SQL</li></ul><p>Similarly, some hosting providers also have a Postgres as a service offering. If you are already using a hosting provider that offers Postgres — Heroku is one example — this can be a convenient choice.</p><p>Postgres maintain a page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/professional_hosting/">PostgreSQL: Hosting Providers</a>&nbsp;that list a wide range of options for purchasing hosted solutions along with support. Additionally, many hosted application platforms offer Postgres.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#expertise-and-ops"></a>Expertise and Ops</h2><p>Developing in-house expertise is often desirable, and not only as a means to save costs. For instance, by allowing rapid resolution of issues without having to go outside the organization, expertise reduces risk.</p><p>On the flip side, managing your in-house database carries an ops burden, which will include monitoring, backup, clustering, and versioning. The last can be particularly troubling: occasionally you&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;need to upgrade Postgres on a running system.</p><p>A middle ground between buying a service and building it yourself is to contract the setup but manage ops in-house. I believe that unless you do database-related development, databases are generally a poor fit for this middle ground alternative. Contracting only the setup means you will take longer to build expertise in the database. Meanwhile you already start carrying the ops burden of the database.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#versions-and-extensions"></a>Versions and Extensions</h2><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#versions"></a>Versions</h3><p>Buying from a large service provider appears to limit available versions. Currently, for example, the latest supported Postgres version is 12.4; the major release Postgres 12 was on 2019-10-03. Service providers have been slow to provide version 12:</p><ul><li>AWS RDS started supporting Postgres version 12 on 2020-03-31, and supports Postgres versions 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10, and 11; however Aurora clusters do not support version 12 yet;</li><li>Azure still supports only versions 9.5, 9.6, 10.11, and 11.6;</li><li>GCP started providing Postgres version 12 on 2020-05-21;</li><li>ElephantSQL supports Postgres version 12, but the free tier provides version 11.9.</li></ul><p>At the same time service providers can upgrade Postgres (and underlying OS) versions more transparently. This can be particularly useful for receiving patch releases. So low availability of newer Postgres versions is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a significant detriment. Of course, certain applications may require an absolutely latest version of Postgres, which may make it impossible to buy Postgres service.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#extensions"></a>Extensions</h3><p>Numerous extensions are available for Postgres. Service providers provide the most popular of these. But they cannot provide all of them, and typically it is not possible to install new extensions that require compilation.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#applicability-to-lakefs"></a>Applicability to lakeFS</h3><p>To allow users flexibility, lakeFS requires only Postgres 11. So availability of versions and extensions does not influence choice of provider for a database intended to run only lakeFS.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#provisioning"></a>Provisioning</h2><p>Creating a new database instance with a service provider requires plenty of time. For example, on AWS RDS creating a small empty database instance can take 10 minutes. This is very reasonable for one-time setup of long-lived production and even staging environments.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#fast-setup-of-small-databases"></a>Fast setup of small databases</h3><p>For short-lived environments or for testing, it can take too long to set up a hosted database. Luckily Postgres is an isolated component and one installation may easily be replaced with another installation. If the database is small and the generated data is not particularly valuable then there are good alternatives with quick setup times. These include creating a new database on an existing Postgres database instance or even — when database instance performance is not critical — running a database instance inside a container. If you have permission to create a new database, both of these alternatives have equivalent setup times that are typically less than a second.</p><p>Using an existing database instance allows you to take advantage of existing setup and ops on that database instance. For example, it will be easy to backup your new database if the database already has backups, and clustering exists at the instance level. By the same token, an existing database instance will offer significantly lower isolation than a container.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>An example of creating new databases inside an existing database instance is the ElephantSQL free tier: you are allocated a database inside an existing instance and can see that other databases exist inside that instance. It uses Postgres roles to prevent data leakage (a side effect is that some operations are impossible, for instance any application that requires multiple roles).</p><p>An example of running a database instance inside a container is when running tests. Every test can create its own blank container running Postgres. This is probably the best solution for component testing: it offers complete isolation between tests, the database container is small, and it scales directly with the number of running tests.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#what-did-we-pick"></a>What did we pick?</h2><p>All our lakeFS instances currently use plain or Aurora Postgres on RDS:</p><ul><li>Our database usage is currently not high enough to justify the cost savings of running our own instances..</li><li>We build lakeFS, and supporting Postgres as a service is important to the product. So by design, lakeFS does not require latest-version features or esoteric extensions.</li><li>Our core business is currently to develop rather than to operate lakeFS; this is essentially the “ramp-up” time above.</li></ul><p>For isolation and speed of setup, our unit and component testing use a containerized Postgres instance.</p><figure><img src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="407" srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-24x18.jpg 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-36x27.jpg 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-48x36.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg" data-srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-24x18.jpg 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-36x27.jpg 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-48x36.jpg 48w"><figcaption>Picking a database, like picking an elephant, can be hard but need not be intimidating</figcaption></figure></div><!-- .entry-content .clear --></div></article></div>]]>

<section id="mc_embed_signup">

</section>
<p>I read a post online recently about how some software engineer was asked to complete a technically complex, jargon-filled coding challenge over the phone in order to get a job. He did well enough on the call to get an offer, but after he started the new job, he realized it wasn’t going to be the academically challenging role he was hoping for. No, he’d just be building basic CRUD applications for the web with a legacy system haphazardly running on whatever virtual machine could be found.</p>
<p>This happens all the time during job-screening. We put engineers through rigorous screening processes and ask them intellectually stimulating questions, only to hire them and put them into the admittedly dull task of wiring up 5 or 6 services and making the screen look pretty. I’m not saying there aren’t skills involved in those tasks - I’m simply saying that those aren’t the same skills being tested for in most whiteboarding-style challenges.</p>
<p><em>PS: <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/rethinking-hiring">Here’s how I revamped my hiring process with this trend in mind</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="lets-stop-sugar-coating-it">Let’s stop sugar-coating it</h2>
<p><strong>Software is created when its presence provides more business value than its absence.</strong></p>
<p>While it’s appealing to read about software craftsmanship and strive for excellence in everything we do, when it really comes down to it, our job wouldn’t exist if we didn’t make money (or save money) for some business somewhere.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the industry’s state makes sense. Just like plumbers, <strong>we are paid to know our tools and understand how they work together to make a usable piece of equipment</strong>, not to reinvent working technology or spend 80 hours optimizing something that 5% of our users will use.</p>
<h2 id="put-it-in-perspective">Put it in perspective</h2>
<p>Small to medium sized businesses rarely deal with scaling or optimization problems anymore - partly because hardware has gotten so cheap, and partly because foundational open source software has gotten so good. This is a great thing, and we as software developers should embrace it.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the plumbing example. Imagine you owned a small restaurant with one bathroom and 10 employees. You get a few hundred customers per week and maybe 10% of them use your bathroom. Obviously, you’ve got to have a working bathroom, but does it need to be anything fancier or more advanced than your home toilet? <strong>Do you need 10 stalls, motion-activated faucets, Dyson hand dryers, and marble counters?</strong> Probably not, unless you’re just trying to project some facade of success.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9bS3JGQ.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>We do this all the time in the world of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto">startup software engineering</a> though.</strong></p>
<p>A small business with 5-10 employees building a software-as-a-service web app needs to have a reliable, secure system, but does it need to be that much more robust than an off-the-shelf service provides? <strong>Do you really need AI-powered search, real-time dashboards for every internal team member, microsecond optimizations on your home page, and split testing for every feature you release?</strong> Probably not unless you’re just trying to project a facade of success…</p>
<p>Just as a good small business owner should hire a humble plumber who knows the standard tools required for small bathrooms, and will pay him market rate, <strong>a good engineering manager should hire <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hero-myth">humble team players</a> who use industry-standard tools to build reliable software, and pay them market rate.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, what I’m seeing is a lot of false projections from engineering managers. They give the impression during the interview that every person they hire must be a senior engineer, has to have “big data” experience, or has to know every sorting algorithm by heart.</p>
<h2 id="we-engineers-are-guilty-of-over-engineering">We (engineers) are guilty of over-engineering</h2>
<p>Part of the problem is that we over-engineer the software we work on. I am guilty of this as well.</p>
<p>I came to the Graide Network and immediately started breaking our legacy app into microservices. Now I’ve had to build custom tooling just to help new developers get things running on their local machines - not something that is truly worth my time this early on in our business’ lifecycle.</p>
<p>I’ve also made it harder on myself to hire people. I don’t want to limit my hiring pool to engineers who know multiple specific web frameworks, Docker containers, microservices, Redis, and MySQL, but I’ve built myself into a corner with all these choices. Lately I’ve realized this, and been starting to think of ways to simplify our stack, but that will have to come in a future blog post.</p>
<h2 id="investors-are-guilty-of-pushing-it-on-us">Investors are guilty of pushing it on us</h2>
<p>The other side is investor and media pressure. In the startup world this is especially pronounced as I’ve found investors as likely to latch onto buzzwords as reporters are.</p>
<p>“Oh, so you’re building an app? Does it use AI? Blockchain? <insert hot="" buzzy="" tech="" here="">? Take my money and do it!"</insert></p>
<p>Now you’ve sold yourself to an investor as an AI/Blockchain/etc. company, so you’ve got to hire engineers who do that thing, even if you’re not sure it’s actually going to help you build a better business or not. This means you’re going to shun candidates with 10+ years of experience in existing tech to hire slick kids who jump from buzz-word to buzz-word chasing trends. <strong>It’s like hiring a plumber with 3 years of experience who invented his own tools: high risk, very low reward.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-do-about-it">What do we do about it?</h2>
<p>So we’re here, living in a world where most “software engineering” is essentially plumbing. What should we do about it? What does it mean for our careers? Will the money keep flowing forever?</p>
<p><strong>First, we should recognize and embrace the fact that we can build more with less.</strong> What it will mean is that the crummy parts of our job will probably get automated or tools will be built that will make it possible for business people to do them for us. For example, I used to have to make code changes every time someone on our team wanted to change an automated email’s copy. Now, they just have to edit a template in Sendgrid’s nice visual editor, and I never even know that a change has been made.</p>
<p><strong>Second, we should consider the complexity required when designing systems.</strong> If an off-the-shelf solution exists, grab it, don’t build it from scratch. Get good at soldering pieces together so that you seem more productive, faster, and better at your job than the software artisans out there who have to custom-build their own framework every time they start a project.</p>
<p><strong>Third, we should set realistic expectations in our job listings.</strong> No more coding exercises that require a CS degree for jobs that require little more than importing libraries and understanding HTTP requests. Yes, some jobs will require micro-optimizations, and that’s fine, but recognize that those are few and far between. Your software is likely not as special as you think it is.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-notenough-karl-l-hughes/">don’t get comfortable</a>.</strong> This isn’t a popular opinion among software engineers, but I believe that many in the field are overpaid relative to the difficulty of the work they do. Sometimes it’s because they are the only people who know some obscure corner of their field, sometimes it’s because their company’s gatekeepers are preventing full access to the talent market, and sometimes it’s because other engineers insisted they overbuild things such that junior devs will take a long time to understand it. In any case, <strong>we can’t stop learning if we want to remain relevant and well-paid.</strong> Keep going deep and wide in your knowledge, and learn how to filter out the hype from the truly ground-breaking technology.</p>
<p>What do you think? I imagine many of you in the field will have a different opinion, so let me hear it on <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

But hold on. The argument for taking Vitamin D assumes a few things. First, that low Vitamin D actually causes all of the conditions it is associated with. This is not necessarily true. Low Vitamin D could cause (or contribute to) heart disease, but it could also be that heart disease causes low Vitamin D. Another possibility is that some third factor causes both low Vitamin D and heart disease. </p><p id="viewer-9g65f">Even if we can prove some causation, we then need to assume that correcting the Vitamin D deficiency will prevent the disease. This may not be true either. Low Vitamin D may be an indicator of overall poor health, which increases the risk for cardiac disease. It could appear that low Vitamin D contributes to the condition. But raising the Vitamin D will not help because it will just fix the symptom, not the underlying problem. </p><h3 id="viewer-399rj"><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-4p68a">Fortunately we have studies that can help figure this out. Currently the best way to answer a question of clinical relevance is with a large, well-executed <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT).</strong> An RCT works like this: enroll the participants you want to study and randomly assign half of them to receive a treatment and the other half to receive a placebo. Those receiving the treatment are called the intervention group. The other group is the control group. Ideally, the two groups will be similar in every way except the treatment – they will have the same distribution in age, income, race, gender, and health status. They will even receive pills that look identical, though half will be placebos. If, at the end of the study, there are differences between the two groups, we can attribute those differences to the treatment. </p><div id="viewer-3aoj5"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Simple randomized controlled trial "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1674,h_920,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Simple randomized controlled trial "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">Simple randomized controlled trial</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-fvrr">RCTs are costly and time intensive, so generally we will only be able to study the interventions and outcomes that have the highest chance of showing a benefit. We base this on prior studies; if several large observational studies show a correlation between Vitamin D and heart disease, then this is something we should study with an RCT. </p><p id="viewer-1ofc5">
We now have results for over 1500 RCTs on Vitamin D supplementation. Some of the largest and most significant trials are listed and summarized at the end of this article. When tested on its ability to prevent disease, <strong>Vitamin D has failed to live up to expectations</strong>. </p><div id="viewer-b7fav"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Results of Vitamin D Trials "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1206,h_878,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Results of Vitamin D Trials "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">For more details, see the list of high-quality RCTs at the bottom of this page</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-en75e">One of the largest and best studies we have is called <a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VITAL</u></a>, led by Dr. JoAnn Manson at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Over 25,000 adults (men age 50 and older, women age 55 and older) with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer participated in the study. They received either 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 or placebo daily for five years. Researchers evaluated the rates of cancer and major cardiovascular events including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. </p><p id="viewer-f6k24"><strong>The result: Vitamin D failed to prevent cancer, stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death. </strong>These conditions occurred at the same rate in those receiving Vitamin D and those receiving placebo. There was one positive finding, though: in a post hoc analysis, it seemed that Vitamin D decreased the mortality from cancer when the initial two years were excluded. Post hoc (“after the event”) analyses can be quite useful, but need to be viewed with some skepticism. In high-quality RCTs (like VITAL), the outcome measures and statistical analyses are specified prior to data collection. Sometimes, as in VITAL’s case, an unexpected outcome may appear at the time the data are evaluated, prompting a post hoc analysis. In this case, when results from the first two years were excluded, the rate of cancer death was 1.2% in the placebo group, and 0.9% in the Vitamin D group - 25% reduction in cancer mortality, though the absolute numbers were low. It is not possible to draw too many conclusions from this, but it is something to note for future studies. </p><p id="viewer-3cooc"><strong>Even in studies of bone health, Vitamin D has been disappointing.</strong> We already know that Vitamin D is essential in calcium metabolism, and Vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets and osteomalacia. Taking Vitamin D to treat severe Vitamin D deficiency is necessary for the treatment of these conditions. But in the large trials looking at Vitamin D's ability to prevent bone loss, the participants were taken from the general population, many of whom had normal Vitamin D levels. For severely deficient individuals (only a small percentage of the population), there are clear benefits to supplementation. These benefits do not appear to extend to those with normal levels or mild deficiencies.</p><h3 id="viewer-ct6r5"><strong>Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ek5t0">Large randomized controlled trials are currently the best way to evaluate a treatment, but they are difficult to do. If done well, an RCT is expensive, time intensive, and challenging to coordinate. It is worth it if we can answer our question adequately, but sometimes we realize after the trial that we needed to account for something else, or that we need more people in the study before we can really answer our question. In addition, RCTs will not always give definitive answers. Sometimes two or more small trials of the same treatment will show opposite results, and we need to reconcile those. Simply redoing an RCT is usually not an option. Instead, scientists have developed a method of combining similar RCTs and analyzing them together, in what is called a meta-analysis. </p><p id="viewer-ab05u">Meta-analyses have exploded in popularity over the last few decades.<span> If done well, a meta-analysis of a group of trials can reveal insights that cannot be seen in the individual trials. Unfortunately there are potential problems. The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality of the studies it includes, which can lead to erroneous results when poor quality studies are present (garbage in, garbage out).</span></p><p id="viewer-9nlvf"><span>In addition, <strong>publication bias</strong> may incorrectly amplify a treatment effect. Publication bias occurs when researchers decide to publish only “positive” findings – studies that show a treatment effect. Suppose ten small trials of Vitamin D are performed. Five show a benefit to Vitamin D and five do not. Researchers and journals are much more inclined to publish positive results than negative, so it is possible that only the five positive studies will make it into the medical literature. A meta-analysis on the five published positive studies will show a much stronger effect of Vitamin D than a meta-analysis that included all ten studies. </span></p><div id="viewer-9ul9t"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_373,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a6n1n"> <em>Where negative studies go to die. </em></p><p id="viewer-a6bj6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosenthal_(psychologist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Robert Rosenthal </u></em></a><em>called publication bias "the file drawer problem" because important negative studies often end up here.

One of the major challenges in performing these analyses is deciding which studies to include or exclude. Ideally only high-quality, well-designed, well-executed studies will be included.

<p>I’ve been reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44719608-refactoring"><em>Refactoring</em></a> and two things have gotten my gears turning.</p>



<p><strong>Thing one: refactoring moves understanding from your head back into your code.</strong> When you finally grok how something is working, refactor the code to make that understanding obvious.</p>



<blockquote><p>Read the code, gain some insight, and use refactoring to move that insight from your head back into the code. The clearer code then makes it easier to understand it, leading to deeper insights and a beneficial positive feedback loop.</p><cite>Martin Fowler</cite></blockquote>



<p>For example, if you realize that a chunk of code is determining the pricing for a soccer match, extract that into a <code>determinePrice()</code> function so that next time it’ll be obvious. </p>



<p>Or if discover two different types of Articles (Text and Video), make <code>TextArticle</code> and <code>VideoArticle</code> classes that extend the <code>Article</code> class. That way, no one will ever need to learn that lesson the hard way again.</p>



<p>Whenever you think “ah, so <em>that’s</em> what this is doing” use that as a mental trigger that you should refactor to make it self evident.</p>



<p>It’s embarrassing how obvious this seems in retrospect. I’ve used that as a trigger to write documentation or do some knowledge sharing, rather than improve the code.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Thing two: refactoring should be done in tiny steps, and the code should never be in a broken state.</strong> You make a little change, compile-test-commit, and repeat. The changes will be small, but they add up.</p>



<blockquote><p>Whenever I’ve shown people how I refactor, they are surprised by how small my steps are, each step leaving the code in a working state that compiles and passes its tests. The key to effective refactoring is recognizing that you go faster when you take tiny steps, the code is never broken, and you can compose those small steps into substantial changes.</p><cite>Martin Fowler</cite></blockquote>



<p>I never realized that I could change so much without breaking stuff in the process. I always assumed refactoring was the code equivalent of cracking eggs to make an omelette. </p>



<p>Last week, I spent a couple hours moving code around and creating classes and changing method definitions. Then I spent the next 4 hours trying to make it all work again. Oh how I wish I had read this book before that.</p>



<p>Important note: this depends on having solid and fast automated tests. <em>Writing tests is often the first step of refactoring.</em> Remember, you should compile-test-commit after each change. That’s going to be brutal if you can’t make robots do your testing for you. </p>



<p>I’m not even halfway through <em>Refactoring</em> but so far it’s fantastic. Have you read it? What did you think? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet me</a> and let me know. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599532527250/Gm0E0xbTo.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>The most successful companies are built upon great working cultures that are thoughtful about the <a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-new-analytics-of-culture">cultural contribution</a> each hire will make to their company. If you're a candidate looking to land your dream job, you'll need to be well prepared for these cultural or behavioral interviews. </p>
<p>As a hiring manager, I've interviewed over 200 engineering candidates and a significant portion of that  has been evaluating the soft skills each candidate embodies. I've rejected extremely strong technical performers and and fought to hire some more junior candidates based on the signal I've identified from the culture interview. Because every company has their own culture, their own values, and their own questions, the culture interview can be extremely hard to prepare for. However, there's still plenty you can do to set yourself up for success instead of jumping in blind.</p>
<p>While my interviewing experience as both a hiring manager and a candidate have been primarily within engineering, I believe the tools in this kit will be mostly applicable across product, design, and other disciplines within product development organizations. </p>
<h2 id="stories-to-prepare">Stories to Prepare</h2>
<p>Why should you prepare stories instead of answers to specific questions? The simple reason is that you can't prepare and memorize an answer to every question an interviewer might ask. Often times these conversations are organic and the real signal comes from how you respond to follow-up questions. The best answers are rooted in real examples from your personal experience and by "loading" these stories into your brain ahead of time, you'll be better equipped to handle questions on the spot.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599089431543/WeopvfKLq.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599089431543/WeopvfKLq.png"></p>
<h3 id="story-1-your-career-narrative">Story #1: Your career narrative</h3>
<p>Almost everyone you talk to will give an intro of themselves and then ask you to share a brief intro as well. Depending on who you're talking to, that intro can be anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes. In some cases, a hiring manager or recruiter might ask you to go deeper into your background and spend up to 30 minutes digging into your experiences.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ol>
<li>A narrative that connects your career together. While many careers are not linear, it can help to show that you were deliberate about the jobs you took and what you wanted to learn at each one. You may find that as you look back on your career, there's a story you can weave together that ties together where you started, where you're at now, and the trajectory you're on. A story that shows strong growth, surmounting challenges, and a high forward trajectory can help get companies excited about you. Finish your story such that the company you're talking to easily makes sense as the next step on your career journey.<ul>
<li>A weak narrative merely lists what's on your resume, e.g., "in 2013 I joined X and did these projects, in 2014 I joined Y and did these projects, and recently I've done Z and B. I want to join this company because it's doing really well."</li>
<li>A stronger narrative gives context on your decisions and motivations, e.g., "In college, I was excited about electronics and human-computer interfaces, so I looked for companies that specialized in consumer hardware. X company was one of the companies that stood out, and when I joined I got to work on the interface for Product P. This taught me [so and so] but after 2 years there, I really wanted to get better at [this other thing], so I reached out to Company Y. From there, I grew into [some role], helped the company do [these things], and now I'm [doing something impressive]. Going forward, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can put my front end architecture skills to good use while learning how to build complex systems at scale. I admire [company name] for being able to build high quality user interfaces while being super fast and reliable. I think this might be a great fit for my expertise and give me opportunities to grow my backend skills."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What specific things you're looking for in your next role. These should apply to more than one company to show that you're not just pandering to the company, but try to be opinionated at the same time.<ul>
<li>A weak answer is too vague, uncertain, or demonstrates that you haven't put much thought to it.<ul>
<li>e.g., "I'm looking for a place where I can advance my career." or "I wanted to get into AI and Machine Learning because it's a really hot industry right now."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A stronger answer shows that you've clearly thought about what you want, have had enough experience to know what you don't want, and implicitly show why the company you're talking to is a good fit.<ul>
<li>e.g., "Over my career, I've found that it's really important for me to have a strong sense of ownership over my work. I enjoy taking an ambiguous customer problem, breaking it down with a PM or designer, and then being able to see the whole project through from start to finish. I like to solve problems and not just execute on tasks, even if that means working through some dealing with a lot of uncertainty at times and wearing many hats."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="what-the-interviewer-is-looking-for">What the interviewer is looking for</h4>
<ul>
<li>For quick intros, interviewers are generally not evaluating your storytelling ability. Instead, they want to know why you might be a good fit for the role and what your motivations are.</li>
<li>For hiring managers and recruiters, your career narrative can be a useful lens to interpret the interview feedback and make a decision on whether or not to move forward.<ul>
<li>For example, if your background is primarily backend engineering and the interviews demonstrate weakness in UI implementation, then your narrative can help interviewers focus more on your strengths over your weaker areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you under-represent yourself at this stage, you may miss an opportunity to move forward in the interview process or get an offer.<ul>
<li>On the flip side, you should avoid changing your narrative too much simply to suit the role or company you're talking to. It's often better to be rejected for a role that really doesn't fit you than to get a role doing something that doesn't actually align with what you want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-that-interviewers-may-ask">Questions that interviewers may ask</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
<li>What are you looking for in your next role?</li>
<li>Why are you interested in [company]?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png"></p>
<h3 id="story-2-two-impressive-projects">Story #2: Two Impressive Projects</h3>
<p>You should be prepared to talk in depth about at least two meaningful projects you've worked on where you played a significant role. Why two? If you use the same example for every question, the interviewer may think you're lacking experience or have a weak track record. Having at least two substantial projects in your pocket will help you balance breadth and depth to respond to a variety of questions.</p>
<p>Keep your initial explanation short (between 3-5 minutes) and offer to go deeper afterwards. This will help keep the conversation focused and avoid wasting time on unimportant details.</p>
<p>A good format to use whenever you're giving an example of something that happened is to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm">SBI framework</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf">STAR framework</a>. For these examples I'll use the SBI model. </p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Situation</strong>: Share context on the project before jumping into what you did.<ul>
<li>Where did the project come from?</li>
<li>Why was it important? How did you or your team prioritize it?</li>
<li>What were the goals of the project?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Behavior</strong>: Describe your specific role on that project. If you played a technical role, describe how the system was designed.<ul>
<li>Project management<ul>
<li>What was your role in defining the scope or solution?</li>
<li>How did you ensure the project was on track?</li>
<li>What obstacles came up during the project? How did you overcome them?</li>

</li>
<li>System design of the project<ul>
<li>How was the system architected?</li>
<li>What were the biggest points of failure?</li>
<li>How did you approach this design?</li>
<li>Who else was involved in the design?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: What was the result of this project?<ul>
<li>What went well on that project?<ul>
<li>Did the project succeed?</li>
<li>How did you measure success?</li>
<li>Can you share some of your success metrics and how they performed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What did you learn on that project?<ul>
<li>What skills did you build?</li>
<li>What didn't go well on that project?</li>
<li>If you were to do the project again, what might you do differently? Try to come up with at least one or two examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the project didn't succeed, why not?<ul>
<li>Demonstrate that you can take ownership of your mistakes and avoid blaming others. Most interviewers are looking for a growth mindset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-interviewers-are-looking-for">What interviewers are looking for</h4>
<ul>
<li>Does the work align with the level and scope of the role?<ul>
<li>Are they applying for a role that's realistic with what they've done historically?</li>
<li>What kind of domain expertise do they have?</li>
<li>Have they had enough technical leadership experience for the role? (More relevant for senior/tech lead roles and above.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can the candidate clearly articulate the benefit and impact of their work?<ul>
<li>It's surprising how often some people don't know or think about the result of their work beyond completing the tasks that were assigned to them. Strong candidates think about the entire workflow, from idea conception to evaluating success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do they have a growth mindset?<ul>
<li>Are they able to reflect on both the successes and misses of that project?</li>
<li>Do they take credit for all the things that went well and blame others for all the things that didn't go well? (This would be a red flag.)</li>
<li>Can they clearly explain both the technical and non-technical portions of their work?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-that-interviewers-may-ask">Questions that interviewers may ask</h4>
<ul>
<li>What's the most significant project you worked on in the last year?</li>
<li>Tell me about a project that didn't go as well as you had hoped. What happened?</li>
<li>Give me an example of how you learned an area/product that you knew nothing about. What was the outcome?</li>

<h3 id="story-3-resolving-a-conflict">Story #3: Resolving a conflict</h3>
<p>Delivering successful projects often require working with a lot of stakeholders and collaborators. Demonstrate that you can work well with others, share critical feedback, and resolve situations on your own.</p>
<p>I've been surprised at how often candidates talk about a situation where they ultimately failed to resolve a conflict. It can be hard to think of a good example on the spot, so definitely prepare this ahead of time and consider what you want the interviewer to take away.</p>

  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to
describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.</p>

<p><span>T</span>he average fintech startup founder faces a taxing to-do list: raise seed funding, scope out a user base, recruit talent, build something people will actually use. For the Indonesian entrepreneur, the Muslim-majority market presents an additional hurdle: build an app that is compliant with Islamic religious law, or Sharia.</p>



<p>New fintech startups must present themselves before the Indonesian Ulema Council (Majelis Ulama Indonesia, or MUI, in Bahasa Indonesian), composed of religious clerics from across the archipelago, for Sharia certification, in order to reach Indonesia’s 220 million Muslim users, who generally seek out products that fit their faith.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MUI shapes much of Indonesian life. The body has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/bjpwwm/indonesia-just-got-its-first-halal-fridge-heres-a-list-of-everything-else-that-needs-a-stamp">conducted halal audits on household products</a>, verifying that milk, moisturizer, and instant ramen meet strict religious criteria. Its <em>fatwa</em> commission also regularly intervenes in the moral life of Indonesians, promulgating headline-making rulings on <a href="https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/87440-bhimanto-suwastoyo-fatwa-homosexuality-indonesia-death-penalty">homosexuality</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jis/article-abstract/18/2/202/726927">secularism</a>. Since the late 1990s, when Indonesian politics began a turn toward Islamic conservatism, the council’s influence has grown, according to Syafiq Hasyim, a Jakarta-based scholar of MUI and the political economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now MUI is using its policing power to shape a new sector of Indonesian society: consumer technology. In November 2019, Vice President Ma’ruf Amin declared the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3044601/how-sharia-economy-shapes-democracy-indonesia">“Shariatization” of the economy</a> — i.e., the growth of digital financial services catering to Muslim users — a priority for the country’s development. Indonesian Muslim consumers currently spend $224 billion annually. When fintech companies build platforms for these users — whether peer-to-peer lending apps, mobile money services, or online stock-trading portals — MUI acts as the arbiter of their religious legitimacy. MUI’s National Sharia Council (Dewan Syariah Nasional, or DSN) issues certificates that verify platforms are compliant with Sharia. The chairman of DSN just happens to be the vice president himself.</p>



<p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech. New fatwas are added every year on digital finance topics that now include commodities trading online and cryptocurrencies. In the certification process, MUI’s religious scholars become embedded in the early evolution of a company’s digital products, their background not in software engineering or UX design but the traditions and teachings of Islam.</p>

<p>In Sharia, for example, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riba.asp#:~:text=Riba%20is%20prohibited%20under%20Shari,and%20helping%20others%20through%20kindness.">charging interest, or <em>riba</em></a><em>,</em> is strictly prohibited. Sharia promotes charitable financial dealings and labels interest and guaranteed profits inherently unjust. Instead of a conventional credit model, Sharia lending platforms operate according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091931230X"><em>mudarabah</em></a>. Under this model, rather than a lender extracting a profit from a borrower, the borrower and lender enter a more equitable contract. For a small-business loan, for example, the lender receives a predetermined share of profits but must also share in the losses, since the borrower has invested labor and knowledge in the business. This model underpins a host of peer-to-peer lending apps targeting Muslim users in Indonesia.</p>



<p>For Sharia stock trading, MUI mandates, under <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxTl-lNihFyzZUxIbkR3RXV4TWc/view">Fatwa No. 80</a>, that traders invest only in halal companies. Online stock trading platforms like MNC Trade Syariah vet all potential listings accordingly, removing any that deal in gambling, alcohol, or pork products.</p>



<p>For some companies, compliance is more of a challenge. Take LinkAja. <a href="https://kr-asia.com/linkaja-ceo-danu-wicaksana-ready-to-be-the-biggest-mobile-payment-platform-in-indonesia">Launched in June 2019</a> and currently serving 45 million registered users, it’s one of the country’s largest mobile money services <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/adv-longform/2019/12/27/why-gojek-users-leave-their-cash-behind-and-turn-to-gopay.html">behind leaders like GoJek’s digital wallet</a> GoPay and OVO. Customers can send, store, or receive electronic money on the LinkAja app. </p>



<p>Late last year, the company announced it was building the first Sharia mobile money product in Indonesia, a digital wallet for Muslim consumers to be called LinkAja Sharia Services. Standard LinkAja app users would be able to go into their settings and switch to a parallel platform built for Sharia compliance. But before they even created a prototype, LinkAja’s team knew they needed to consult MUI.</p>



<p>Most Islamic fintech companies have an appointed head of Sharia, a taskmaster who manages the compliance process. At LinkAja, that person is Widjayanto Djaenudin. While he had no experience in Sharia technology per se, he spent more than a decade at Telkomsel, Indonesia’s largest telecoms operator, developing mobile products for the unbanked. His task at LinkAja was to liaise with MUI and guide the company through its certification process, a challenge, considering the tenuous status of Sharia scholarship on mobile money apps. </p>



<p>Some clerics have argued that <a href="http://www.ikim.gov.my/new-wp/index.php/2019/08/22/some-sharia-considerations-concerning-e-wallet/">digital wallets are a form of <em>haram</em></a>, a term for practices forbidden by Islamic law<em>. </em>The<em> </em>digital-only cash-back rebates and other discounts with partner retailers commonly found on these apps are considered, by some clerics, a form of interest payment between businesses — riba in disguise. MUI has ruled sending and storing money in digital wallets acceptable, but only under strict terms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>After conducting a rigorous product-proposal review, MUI appointed a three-member supervisory board to Djaenudin’s team well-versed in the nuances of its rulings. The board included Anwar Abbas, chairman of an Islamic reformist organization in Southern Java’s Yogyakarta and author of a national bestseller promoting the vice president’s “Shariatization” worldview, <a href="https://www.tokopedia.com/dojobuku/ma-ruf-amin-way-sahala-panggabean-by-anwar-abbas"><em>The Ma’ruf Amin Way</em></a><em>. </em>“They are all Sharia experts,” said Djaenudin. “They gave us guidance and consultations about the product.” </p>



<p>Starting in November 2019, shortly after the vice president’s Shariatization initiative, Djaenudin was required to brief these scholars on market research, product testing, and the ins and outs of engineering every month. MUI’s supervisory board would share their insights and ensure the technological infrastructure of the app followed MUI’s rulings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An MUI fatwa issued in 2017 was of particular concern to Djaenudin. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KPAvhhziJ61Pt8EFxxTFfDPNmRHJoQDG/view">Fatwa No. 116</a> begins with verses from the Quran published in both classical Arabic script and Bahasa Indonesian. “O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write it between you in justice,” reads one verse. They are followed closely by <a href="https://yaqeeninstitute.org/emadhamdeh/are-hadith-necessary/">quotations from books of <em>hadith</em></a>, records of the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad: “Do not sell gold for gold, and do not sell silver for silver, except in case of like for like.”</p>



<p>These threads of theological precedent are woven together to create a set of rulings reinterpreting classical verse for the new digital economy. According to the fatwa, these Quranic lines have a specific implication for fintech: floating funds must be housed in certified Islamic banks. Contracts between all parties — users, banking institutions, or the app itself — must be grounded in Sharia contract law. Any promotional campaign cannot include riba.</p>

<p>The supervisory board had other suggestions for LinkAja’s parallel Sharia platform, Djaenudin told <em>Rest of World</em>. The new version of the app embedded a <em>zakat </em>payment feature, <a href="https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/zakat/">a form of religious tithing and worship</a> performed through charitable donations, customarily amounting to 2.5% of one’s total savings. After the board signed off on the feature, LinkAja partnered with 240 MUI-approved charitable institutions and 1,000 mosques nationwide <a href="https://news.detik.com/adv-nhl-detikcom/d-5019749/wahai-umat-muslim-ini-cara-mudah-berzakat-lewat-layanan-syariah-linkaja">to launch the zakat feature</a>. Months of vetting culminated in a full audit of LinkAja’s operations at its Jakarta headquarters by MUI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Widjayanto, LinkAja paid a $300 (4 million rupiah) charge to MUI for its Sharia certificate, which lasts three years, including a $20 transportation fee for the auditor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LinkAja Sharia Services <a href="https://www.idnfinancials.com/news/33503/link-aja-launches-linkaja-sharia-services">launched on April 14</a>, just one week before the start of Ramadan. In its first month, it saw 100,000 user registrations. Djaenudin credits the MUI Sharia certificate for this first wave of customers. Most Indonesians prefer to use a Sharia-branded service, even if few understand the particulars of riba or mudarabah, according to LinkAja market research. “From the customer’s perspective, as long as they see the halal logo or Sharia certificate from a trusted body, which is MUI, it gives them clearance and trust,” said Djaenudin.</p>



<p>For Indonesian fintech entrepreneurs hoping to establish their Sharia credentials, the MUI certificate has become the gold standard. Ronald Yusuf Wijaya, the founder of two Sharia-compliant crowdfunding startups, converted to Islam while building his business. “It’s been almost nine years, and I’m learning all of this from the day I started my business,” he said. Wijaya is chairman of the <a href="https://fintechsyariah.id/en">Indonesian Sharia Fintech Association (AFSI)</a>, a trade association that lobbies on behalf of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-digitalpayments-islam/sharia-fintech-startups-race-to-tap-indonesia-growth-by-aligning-with-islam-idUSKBN20Q0IA">this burgeoning pocket of the Indonesian economy</a>. Since converting, Wijaya has successfully navigated MUI Sharia certification with both his companies. “Some customers, they ask, ‘Are you certified, or are you just Sharia?’”&nbsp;</p>

<p>For most Sharia fintech startups, MUI certificates are not only commercially advantageous but legally required by the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK), the state financial regulator. Other areas of the Sharia digital economy, like <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesian-e-commerce-giant-tokopedia-aiming-for-10-of-total-transactions-to-come-from-new-islamic-m">halal e-commerce</a> and <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesia-gets-first-diy-umrah-platform-e-commerce-giant-starts-selling-pilgrimage-packages"><em>umrah </em>sites</a>, travel-booking platforms for Islamic pilgrimages, do not require this certificate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ir. H. Nadratuzzaman Hosen, vice chair of DSN MUI, told <em>Rest of World</em> that MUI is a passive actor in the development of new apps — waiting idly for companies to seek its approval rather than imposing fatwas on companies as a theocratic …</p></div></div>

        <p>Navigation menus are one of the most-viewed and most-clicked-on pieces of interface. Let’s look at some principles of nav design that will help our users have a better experience.</p>

<h2 id="1-placement-matters">1) Placement matters</h2>

<p>The web has developed a clear pattern for where navigation goes (very top, left side, or in the footer). When menus are placed outside of these areas, it feels awkward, confusing, and hard to find.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-1.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="2-show-them-where-they-are">2) Show them where they are</h2>

<p>Clearly communicate the user’s current location. Use multiple clues, like the ones below, to help them orient themselves. Our users should never have to wonder where they are.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-2.png">
</figure>



<p>Research shows that mega menus provide a better experience than list dropdowns because they show everything at a glance, are able to utilize imagery, allow for better grouping, and feel more engaging.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-3.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="4-effective-link-titles">4) Effective link titles</h2>

<p>A user should be able to easily predict where a link will take them before they click it (this is called information scent). The single biggest factor in this is how good of a job we do at link labeling.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-4.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="5-how-many-items">5) How many items?</h2>

<p>The right number of items in your menu depends on a few things, like how complicated your product is or how savvy your users are. But try to get to fewer than 6 or 7 items. The order also matters.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-5.png">
</figure>

<p>Navigation menus are one of the most-clicked-on pieces of interface, and they provide major contextual information to the user, so it should always be visible.</p>

<p>The default on mobile these days seems to be the hamburger menu, but there are alternatives that don’t hide the nav completely: tabs, progressive collapsing, scrollable lists, and so on.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started being developed internally at Facebook back in 2012, before being publicly released as open-source in 2015. <strong>GraphQL is a query language for APIs</strong>, its main advantage is allowing clients to query exactly for the type of data that is required. The definitions of all the data clients can query through the service are stored in GraphQL schema. Each field in the schema is attached to a function, called a resolver, which gets called to produce the values when a query is executed.</p>
<p>GraphQL is language-agnostic which makes it fairly easy to be adopted across different technologies, one of its successful implementations is done in Rust, by a library called Juniper.</p>
<h2>Code- first, fast &amp; type-safe GraphQL Servers in Rust</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper">Juniper</a></strong> is a code-first approach that allows you to write <strong>type-safe and super fast GraphQL servers in Rust</strong>, keeping declaring and resolving GraphQL schemas as easy as possible.</p>
<p>GraphQL query language is fully supported, including interfaces, unions, schema introspection, validations, as well as some basic Rust crates integrations allowing you to use popular Rust types as <code>uuid</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>chrono</code>, or <code>bson</code> out of the box. </p>
<p>As previously mentioned <strong>Juniper is a code-first library</strong>, if you prefer the schema-first approach you can use <a href="https://github.com/davidpdrsn/juniper-from-schema">juniper-from-schema</a> to <strong>auto-generate resolvers</strong> for your GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>Although Juniper does not provide a built-in web server functionality it comes with building blocks to make integration with your servers as seamless as possible, as well as optionally providing pre-built integration for popular Rust web frameworks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actix,</li>
<li>Hyper,</li>
<li>Iron,</li>
<li>Rocket, </li>
<li>Warp.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example of Juniper integration for Actix</h2>
<p>Below you can find a sample Juniper integration with the <strong>Actix web framework</strong>. The servers run on <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> and has built-in GraphiQL for easier testing. Star it with:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>The LinkedIn Ads network is likely awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic that make the platform’s value extremely dubious, according to a new study from global digital agency RMG that the company shared exclusively with me.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, RMG founding partner Ryan Gellis <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryan-gellis_theory-the-linkedin-ad-network-is-full-of-activity-6700077824360910848-LysO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a thread</a> wondering if LinkedIn “is full of fraudulent accounts and unchecked misclicks that artificially inflate the cost of advertising and result in poor performance compared to other ad networks.” The ensuing discussion inspired him to look into the issue further.</p>
<center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKuyxgWuiRM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><p>Gellis goes through his findings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKuyxgWuiRM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this YouTube video</a>. For the test, RMG promoted a webinar by targeting c-certain c-suite executives at large companies in the United States based on their job titles. The ad encouraged them to click to sign up for for event for free.</p>
<p>The first issue the agency found was the projected versus actual cost per click. LinkedIn estimated a $25 average CPC. The actual campaign CPC was nearly $45.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of forecasting if you project one cost and then the actual cost ends up being 200% the projection?” Gellis asks in the video.</p>
<p>But the real issue was the source of the clicks themselves. LinkedIn’s ad platform reported 11 clicks. RMG’s logs showed ten clicks. <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStory</a>, the digital experience analytics platform that RMG uses, stated that eight people registered for the webinar. However, the true number of registrations was zero.</p>
<p>“Zero people signed up for the webinar from that specific campaign,” Gellis told me in an interview. “That’s kind of the punch line and why I believe this is newsworthy. Nobody signed up. In fact, nobody even exhibited what I believe is real user behavior on the site after clicking the ad. That is also true of all the other ads we ran on LinkedIn. We had a total of 0 people ever “sign up” on any ad we ran during our testing on LinkedIn — regardless of the ad format or messaging.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rmgmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RMG</a> suspects bot activity or misattributed misclicks had been the cause because visitors would bounce away from the webinar’s landing page before it even had a chance to render — in other words, they would click the LinkedIn advertisement and then leave the website in less than 1.3 seconds. In addition, FullStory reported mouse movements that were nothing like what an actual human would do.</p>
<p>“As far as we’re concerned, the LinkedIn ad network basically has fraudulent clicks and/or misclicks that don’t get attributed to the users that are being passed through as leads in campaigns,” Gellis says in the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the simple size in RMG’s one-day test was extremely small. The target audience size was 16,000. The number of impressions would be between 680 and 2,000. The cost was $250. But Gellis told me that the results match a prior, larger test.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png" alt="linkedin ads" width="660" height="197" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 660 197'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png"></p>
<p>During a $3,000 campaign in March, LinkedIn reported 256 clicks with an average CPC of $11. The company received zero leads from all of the clicks.</p>
<p>“You’ll see the call to action is ‘Request Demo,'” Gellis said. “So, arguably, a user who sees this ad and clicks legitimately on it will be looking to get a demo of the analytics tool we were marketing. If the ads were giving us behavior like this on a $3,000-per-month budget, it’s unlikely they would have performed any better with additional budget.”</p>
<p>RMG charges that LinkedIn’s advertising is on a closed network and does not follow the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-measurement-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards for digital advertising</a>. (The IAB did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>
<p>After reviewing RMG’s findings, a LinkedIn spokesperson sent me the following company statement.</p>
<p>“LinkedIn is a members-first organization and our&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFsmfrYAHwHhV6tM-nG54kogFWEw">Ads program</a></u>&nbsp;is designed to ensure that only high-quality, relevant ads are served to our members. We prohibit the use of bots or other automated fraudulent methods to access our services, as they are in violation of the&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNErEgCF6J2mC2B2u6Rnd32Ialafiw">User Agreement.</a></u>&nbsp;Additionally, LinkedIn is a&nbsp;member of the IAB&nbsp;and works closely with the organization and its members to help develop standards for the digital advertising industry.”</p>
<p>But when summarizing his findings in the video, Gellis is skeptical of LinkedIn.</p>
<p>“As far as we can tell, LinkedIn is basically a money pit,” he says. “You’re not going to get the performance that you would expect out of the network.”</p>
<p><strong>(Note: For more, <a href="https://www.samueljscott.com/2019/02/26/fake-online-fake-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see my recent talk on how much of the Internet is fake</a>.)</strong></p>

In this post we’ll show you how to set up a practical computer vision analytic system using the $99 Nvidia Jetson Nano Developers Kit, running OpenDataCam. With OpenDataCam we can recognise, track and count people and a variety of vehicles from a USB webcam feed. We will send the collected data to InfluxDB for visualization and analysis, and set up the Jetson Nano for remote operation and management using a cellular modem and a Hologram SIM.<br></p><p>The video below shows a recording of a live field test I did outside a filling station, counting vehicles and pedestrians travelling in different directions.<br></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/bjrMs8JFYdo">https://youtu.be/bjrMs8</a><br></p><p>To get started, you will need the following hardware:</p><ul role="list"><li>Jetson Nano Developers kit</li><li>5V 4A Power Supply with barrel connector</li><li>Micro SD Card, class 10 or better, 64 GB recommended</li><li>Wi-Fi adaptor (<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15449">Edimax N150</a> or <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15841">Intel 8265.NGWMG M.2 card</a> recommended) or Ethernet cable</li><li>USB Webcam</li><li>4G Modem - USB or Raspberry Pi Hat (Tested with D-Link DWM-222)</li><li>Hologram SIM Card</li><li>HDMI monitor</li><li>USB Mouse and Keyboard</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f2c5dacd16d7c48f0c455f9_20200724_143026.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><h2>How to set up the Nvidia Jetson Nano<br></h2><p>The Nvidia Jetson Nano is a powerful little single board computer with a GPU for running neural networks to do things like image classification, object detection or speech processing. It’s size and low cost means that it’s perfect for edge computing applications like retail analytics or various industrial uses. Combined with a cellular modem and USB webcam, it allows for quick and easy remote deployments, with the only field requirement being a power supply.<br></p><p>The Jetson Nano has no shortage of documentation and online resources, with Nvidia really having put effort into making machine learning approachable for almost anyone.

On the user setup page select the “Log in automatically” to allow all services to start without user intervention.<br></p><p>Once done, you should see the desktop. Open a terminal window and do the following:</p><p>Check for updates, and update all packages. This might take a while.</p><p><code>
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>Install the Nano text editor and curl</p><p><code>
sudo apt install nano curl
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>For deployment a cellular connection is really convenient, but for testing and initial setup and ethernet or WiFi connection is quicker to set up. If you are using a Wi-Fi adaptor for testing, disable Wi-Fi power management to improve connection stability.</p><p><code>
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>It will open a file with the following file</p><p><code>
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 3
</code></p><p>Disable Wi-Fi power saving by changing <strong>3</strong> to <strong>2</strong>.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>Get the IP address of your Jetson Nano by running</p><p><code>
ifconfig
</code></p><p>Restart the Jetson before continuing. Any command line operation from this point forward can be done either directly on the Nano with the keyboard, mouse and monitor, or you can use SSH from any computer on the same network.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that you have a running Nano, it’s time to jump into the computer vision software.<br></p><h2>How to Install OpenDataCam</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam">OpenDataCam</a> is an open source tool for computer vision analytics, that can track and count objects in almost any video feed. It is probably the easiest to use and setup tool that I have seen for this purpose. It is licensed under the permissive MIT license, which allows for use in commercial products.</p><p>‍<br>OpenDataCam runs on the Docker platform, and requires access to CUDA, Nvidia’s tool for running parallel processing tasks on GPUs. First we need to make sure CUDA is defined in the PATH on the Nano, by editing the <em>.bashrc</em> file</p><p><code>
sudo nano .bashrc
</code></p><p>‍<br></p><p>Add the following two lines to the end of the file, then save and close it.</p><p><code>
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
</code></p><p>Increase swap partition size of the Jetson to 6 GB to improve performance and reliability</p><p><code>
git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installSwapfile
cd installSwapfile
chmod 777 installSwapfile.sh
./installSwapfile.sh
</code></p><p>‍<br></p><p>Install Docker-compose and dependencies</p><p><code>
sudo apt install -y python3-pip libssl-dev libffi-dev python-openssl
sudo pip3 install docker-compose
</code></p><p>Allow docker to run on startup</p><p><code>
sudo systemctl enable docker
</code></p><p>Install OpenDataCam. You will be asked for your sudo password during this process, and it may take a while.</p><p><code>
mkdir ~/opendatacam
cd ~/opendatacam
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/v3.0.1/docker/install-opendatacam.sh
chmod 777 install-opendatacam.sh
./install-opendatacam.sh --platform nano
</code></p><h2>How to configure OpenDataCam</h2><p>Once the installation is complete, open Chromium and go to <em>localhost:1880</em> from the Jetson, or <em>*JetsonIP*:1880</em> from any computer on the same network. Once OpenDataCam has started, you will see the following video feed. It is a demo file included in OpenDataCam and demonstrates its object detection capabilities. We’ll use this as an example to get familiar with the interface before changing the video feed for our specific use case.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889973b49b0b09f6e922_UFzR3FTem-uv1i--ef_6ImhdEpBDpt2KfhSRH-nKZV0pb-fzcXfRg8O0PQY3TbOj2PztqHk-4w3Vd2TxSfclRoaW-4s2Y4LzfuUgjATLtWqQF4bczSNDX8J6xo4QGwdqlm1tRpqq.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Click on the “Pathfinder” button in the upper left corner, and you will see the “tracks” generated by each car as it’s identified and tracked.<br></p><p>To count the vehicles, click the “Counter” button to add counting lines as shown below. These lines act as checkpoints, counting objects that pass over them. In the example below, I’ve added lines for oncoming, leaving, and crossing traffic. You can also toggle the direction of travel for objects to be counted, by clicking on the arrow in the centre of the line. To start counting, click the “Start recording” button.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f298899354fcf9d9df68f0d_GLWKyNi1Xs8Jq7lWGDHkCKCNnvh9syNBk2Lk-1gC1OEQEvHgJEs21VJ8oPYtk1Wc-nbns8Kj_GdcqaA25lKE2UaPU82ZRAQzUcFRCuBuUh23XW0RZsZaK3c3CIqIKH6-UhMRzuhd.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>To increase the reliability of the counters, it is important to place them in areas with high detection confidence. By clicking the hamburger menu in the upper right-hand corner, you can activate the tracker accuracy heatmap, which will highlight the areas with the <strong>lowest</strong> detection confidence levels.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f2988983b96a20a4ae37c21_D6BXJhyf_Dj-V7Ee6Xfa5q2Np7CTB_E5WITOkrOwuLSi73JBZjK2gWLf5Iz36E1Bn71D6-om6ao_-lE2HugxczT_NT_y0ojc_2DHNJGRQnvQ3adJOsHddTUM8LhB3z7tXt8GVYzL.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889972d197251894544b_BuLB_wQ_upuv3Vg3rZMNuyXJmQ0GNx0UyaJB5cmIJ-uJbQEcKPVdKE56PmnNvJBW_ft_Dl2oio5QcaScWLRZoK506Yx-L4BfFnNc8uAo4cmMGXlW1jBLDMBAA_D5DD02V-ZifngK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This means that you should avoid these areas when placing counting lines. It might also be a good idea to move the camera to a different perspective, or even improve the detection model using <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/training-yolo-for-object-detection-in-pytorch-with-your-custom-dataset-the-simple-way-1aa6f56cf7d9">transfer learning</a>.<br></p><p>If you have a sample video file that you want to test, you can simply drag and drop it into the OpenDataCam window and it will start playing the new file.<br></p><p>To use a webcam or IP camera stream, you need to <a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/CONFIG.md#video-input">edit the config.json</a> file in ~/opendatacam/ to specify the desired video source. Complete details are available on the <a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/CONFIG.md#video-input">OpenDataCam Github page</a>, including all the other settings you can change. For now will stick to the demo file while we link all the different parts of the project together, and I will describe the final setup I did for deployment at the end of the post.</p><p>To load and updated config file, restart the Docker container</p><p><code>
sudo docker-compose restart
</code></p><h2>How to Install Node-RED for Cloud Data Collection and Analysis</h2><p>I want to collect traffic data in set intervals and store it for analysis. InfluxDB is a database solution built specifically for time series data, which is exactly what we get from OpenDataCam. It also has some built-in visualisation tools. You can install and run InfluxDB locally on the Jetson, but in a production environment we will likely have multiple sources of data, so sending it to the cloud for analysis makes more sense.<br></p><p>OpenDataCam provides a simple but effective <a href="https://opendatacam.github.io/opendatacam/apidoc/">API </a>for interacting with it and extracting data, but we need to create a simple app to do this. I’ll be using Node-RED, flow-based GUI wrapper for Node.js, which also allows us to see at a glance how data flows through the app, and quickly make changes</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f298898cf4cb2839161f831_wUmPP-WAF2sNZpv2qt-pTAv6j4twJzsVmUR3MPQSDpX9roRV8JLq8PxcGqSejBnJc7z-RTxFWb7XIFEDAJNGIBgcPjBmHh4DDmMNuapQ3jL2agcDopb5UghwI4yRnsSB_TFLrEIp.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The above screenshot gives you a good idea of how the flow works. First it checks the status of OpenDataCam (ODC), and starts it if it is not running yet, and if no recording is active, it starts one. If a recording is running, it retrieves the recording and then stop it, and immediately starts a new recording. The data from the completed recording is retrieved, and sent to InfluxDB.<br></p><p>This process is repeated at intervals set in the blue <em>timestamp</em> inject node. The dark green nodes provide output for debugging purposes.<br></p><p>To install Node-RED, open a terminal on your Jetson, and run:</p><p><code>
bash (curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
</code></p><p>Install additional nodes for easy interaction with InfluxDB</p><p><code>
cd ~/.node-red &amp;&amp; npm install node-red-contrib-stackhero-influxdb-v2
</code></p><p>We want to let Node-RED start automatically when the Jetson starts</p><p><code>
sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
</code></p><p>Start Node-RED as a background service</p><p><code>
node-red-start
</code></p><p>Open the Node-RED UI by going to <em>localhost:1880</em> from the Jetson, or <em>*JetsonIP*:1880</em> from any computer on the same network.</p><p>To import the flow, click the menu icon in the upper right corner, and select <em>Import</em>.</p><p>Copy the flow code from this <a href="https://github.com/CuriousMongoose/opendatacam-nodered-influxdb/blob/master/nodered-flow.json">GitHub repo</a>, paste it into the import window, and click <em>Import</em>. The flow will now show in your Node-RED editor. Before we can deploy it, we need to set up InfluxDB to receive data, and get its authentication details.</p><h2>How to configure InfluxDB Cloud</h2><p>Now we need to set up a InfluxDB instance to receive the data. First go to the <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/">InfluxDB Cloud page</a>, register for a free account, and create an instance on the cloud platform of your choice. I used AWS.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889817f6f13ef9861283_iy66hKVJonggHuEE97zGCmEVwrBnvAR0HzJKug2-sTenFZKkAqmzCzpErKJZ_FLEBe6JGaS8v3kr9Kg05pUCwDJKJtK-cwoFw27Jr4ULD90M90_tiYSn5X5kffZhbMXp1udSCsFR.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Once the instance is created and you are logged in, go to the <em>Buckets</em> tab on the <em>Dat…</em></p></div></div></div>

                    <p>Secrets in version control systems (VCS) like git is the current state of the world <strong>despite widely being recognized as a bad practice</strong>. Once source code enters a git repository, it can organically spread into multiple locations. This includes any secrets that may be included within. But why then are secrets in git repositories so common? </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><em>This is the second in a series of articles about secrets within source code and will look specifically at why secrets within git repositories is such a plague, why it is so dangerous and how to prevent it. </em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="1"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="why-secrets-end-up-in-git">Why secrets end up in git</h2><p>A seasoned developer may be scratching their heads wondering why anyone may put secrets inside a git repository. <strong>But the fact is, secrets inside git repositories is the current state of the world. </strong></p><p><a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secret-sprawl/">Last article</a> we talked about how it is common to choose the path of least resistance when it comes to accessing and distributing secrets. <strong>Git acts as the central point of truth for a project</strong>, so it makes sense, at least from a convenience point of view, that secrets are stored inside a private git repository to make distribution and access easy. </p><blockquote>But storing secrets like this is playing with fire, it only takes a very small incident to get burnt. </blockquote><p>In addition to intentionally storing secrets in git, <strong>when secrets are not managed properly, it is very easy to lose track of them</strong>. Secrets may be hardcoded into source code, stored as text file, shared over Slack or buried inside a debug application log. In addition, developers can be in large distributed teams with access to a plethora of secrets while being faced with reduced release cycles and an ever growing number of technologies to master. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="2"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="why-secrets-in-git-is-dangerous">Why secrets in git is dangerous</h2><p>Source code, we have to remember, is very leaky. Code is copied and transferred everywhere. Git is designed in a way that allows, even promotes, code to be freely distributed. </p><p>Projects can be cloned onto multiple machines, forked into new projects, &nbsp;distributed to customers, made public so on and so forth. <strong>Each time it’s duplicated on git, the entire history of that project is also duplicated.</strong></p><p>Why storing secrets in public repositories is bad will be obvious. They are freely available to everyone on the internet and it is very easy to monitor public repositories, GitHub has a public API to fetch all public commits for example. <br></p><p><strong>But what about private git repositories?</strong><br></p><p>Private repositories don’t publish your source code to the internet openly, but it doesn’t have adequate protection to store such sensitive information either. <strong>Imagine if there was a plain text file with all your credit card numbers within it, you hopefully wouldn’t put this into the companies git repository, secrets are just as sensitive. </strong></p><p><strong>A few things to consider when storing secrets in private repositories:</strong></p><ul><li>Everyone in the organization with access to the repo has access to the secrets within (one compromised account can provide an attacker access to a trove of secrets).</li><li>Repositories can be cloned onto multiple machines or forked into new projects.</li><li>Private repositories can be made public which can have secrets buried in the git history.</li></ul><p>Another important consideration is that <em><strong>code removed from a git repository is never actually gone.</strong></em></p><p>Git keeps track of all changes that are made. Code that is removed - or more technically correct: code that is committed over - still exists within the git history.</p><p>Interestingly enough, code is removed from a project at near equal volume that is added. This means that the code within repositories are much deeper than the first layer and secrets could be buried deep within the git history under a mass of commits that have been long forgotten. </p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iPPNU4jrj_CRg3G1zdZ8dFranXUHL7uDUvUk3c3IoLgp-Ub4iNPrpxe8JGjXBl1ntarRIy1Izu5FByy8OFzOOQr8gQA5OCnnvaG_p20IOPQQmaDpHX2LyLJ6IRI0laPFlIs-Ez0O" alt="git history added files and deleted files"><figcaption>git contributions graph</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/graphs/code-frequency"><em>https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/graphs/code-frequency</em></a><em> </em><br></p><blockquote>Comment: The contributions graph that you see above from HashiCorp Vault repository is a typical view of a project's history.

In one example, <strong>bad actors scanned GitHub for AWS keys and used them to mine cryptocurrency, leaving <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots/">developers with thousands of dollars in debt</a></strong>.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[RESEARCH IN PROGRESS] We "forgot" to hide AWS keys in the code of a public repo on <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a> .

It’s therefore common to believe that if secrets are leaked in source code, they of course will be detected within a code review or in a pull request.</p><blockquote>Code reviews are great for detecting logic flaws, maintaining good coding practices and keeping code quality high. But they are not adequate protection for detecting secrets. </blockquote><p>This is because reviews generally only consider the net difference between the current and proposed state. Not the entire history of a branch. Branches are commonly cleaned before being merged into the master branch, temporary code is added then deleted, unnecessary files added then removed.. But now these files, which are high risk candidates for containing secrets, are not visible to the reviewer (unless they want to go through the entire history of a branch). <br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XZOq-SU3EwpmQM6YEo52h7jk1vUM99PL-IJSs5wbRfioPpiAqIl8Ss2zm6MhZPWGLQ8bv_52YMcMB-qPGhb98e0b52cYMNJQYJB8-FXTE1URxxa9g5_2gpwmqT2iqySjDYXhrfCe" alt="Looking for secrets in git history"><figcaption>Git code review diagram</figcaption></figure><p>Let's walk through the example above. While this is over simplified it tells a familiar story. </p><p><br>Commit B a file named main.py is added. A new branch is created to add a new function to main.py in commit C, this feature uses an API key so to save time for testing this is hardcoded. Once the feature is working the hardcoded API key is replaced with an env variable and the file is cleaned. Finally a pull request is made and accepted because the reviewer looks at the net difference between commit B and D, ignoring commit C. Now undetected secrets are buried in the git history of the project.</p><p>While this scenario is very basic, add in hundreds of commits and files between master and a development branch and you can see how easy it is to miss secrets in code reviews. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow.

While automation is not always the answer, detecting secrets, in particular secrets inside git, automated secrets detection is a clear solution to this widespread problem. </p><p>Unfortunately detecting secrets in git is not quite as easy as it first seems because of the probabilistic nature of secrets.

A great dashboard with native GitHub and GitLab integrations, a CLI tool called <a href="https://github.com/GitGuardian/gg-shield">GG-Shield</a> or you can even build custom your own git secrets scanner using the <a href="https://api.gitguardian.com/">GitGuardian API</a>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2><p>Let’s have a quick review of what we have gone through. Git repositories are very common places to find secrets and they remain the perfect incubator for secrets to sprawl into multiple locations. Git keeps a track of a project's history which can be deep making finding secrets difficult. Because of the workflow git creates, it is common for any secrets to be missed during manual checking procedures and automated secrets detection should be introduced into the SDLC.</p><p>Curious of how secrets detection works? Next episode in the secrets in source code series we are going to dive into the mechanics of secrets detection including why probabilistic algorithms are so tricky and the secret sauce behind making them work.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->

        <p><span>E</span>ven though mathematicians have spent over 2,000 years dissecting the structure of the five Platonic solids—the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron and dodecahedron—thereâ€™s still a lot we donâ€™t know about them.<br></p>

<p>Now, a trio of mathematicians has resolved one of the most basic questions about the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Suppose you stand at one of the corners of a Platonic solid. Is there some straight path you could take that would eventually return you to your starting point without passing through any of the other corners? For the four Platonic solids built out of squares or equilateral triangles—the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron—mathematicians&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012365X16302254?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">figured out</a>&nbsp;that the answer is no. Any straight path starting from a corner will either hit another corner or wind around forever without returning home. But with the dodecahedron, which is formed from 12 pentagons, mathematicians didnâ€™t know what to expect.</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jathreya/" target="_blank">Jayadev Athreya</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://userhome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/aulicino/" target="_blank">David Aulicino</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/people?name=Pat_Hooper" target="_blank">Patrick Hooper</a>&nbsp;have shown that an infinite number of such paths do in fact exist on the dodecahedron. Their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10586458.2020.1712564" target="_blank">paper</a>, published in May 2020&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Experimental Mathematics,</em>&nbsp;shows that these paths can be divided into 31 natural families.</p>
<p>The solution required modern techniques and computer algorithms. â€œTwenty years ago, [this question] was absolutely out of reach; 10 years ago it would require an enormous effort of writing all necessary software, so only now all the factors came together,â€� wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~anton.zorich/" target="_blank">Anton Zorich</a>, of the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris, in an email.</p>
<p>The project began in 2016 when Athreya, of the University of Washington, and Aulicino, of Brooklyn College, started playing with a collection of card stock cutouts that fold up into the Platonic solids. As they built the different solids, it occurred to Aulicino that a body of recent research on flat geometry might be just what theyâ€™d need to understand straight paths on the dodecahedron. â€œWe were literally putting these things together,â€� Athreya said. â€œSo it was kind of idle exploration meets an opportunity.â€�<br></p>
<p>Together with Hooper, of the City College of New York, the researchers figured out how to classify all the straight paths from one corner back to itself that avoid other corners.</p>
<p>Their analysis is â€œan elegant solution,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~masur/" target="_blank">Howard Masur</a>&nbsp;of the University of Chicago. â€œItâ€™s one of these things where I can say, without any hesitation, â€˜Goodness, oh, I wish I had done that!â€™â€�</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Symmetries</strong></p>
<p>Although mathematicians have speculated about straight paths on the dodecahedron for more than a century, thereâ€™s been a resurgence of interest in the subject in recent years following gains in understanding â€œtranslation surfaces.â€� These are surfaces formed by gluing together parallel sides of a polygon, and theyâ€™ve proved useful for studying a wide range of topics involving straight paths on shapes with corners, from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-shapes-solve-infinite-pool-table-problem-20170808/" target="_blank">billiard table trajectories</a>&nbsp;to the question of&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2975" target="_blank">when a single light</a>&nbsp;can illuminate an entire mirrored room.</p>
<p>In all these problems, the basic idea is to unroll your shape in a way that makes the paths you are studying simpler. So to understand straight paths on a Platonic solid, you could start by cutting open enough edges to make the solid lie flat, forming what mathematicians call a net. One net for the cube, for example, is a T shape made of six squares.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_b5cfddf2f49d5db00b5bd785f76c12dc.jpg" alt="nautilus paper dodecahed"><figcaption><span>A paper dodecahedron constructed in 2018 by David Aulicino and Jayadev Athreya to show that straight paths from a vertex back to itself while avoiding other vertices are in fact possible. </span><br><span>Patrick Hooper</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine that weâ€™ve flattened out the dodecahedron, and now weâ€™re walking along this flat shape in some chosen direction. Eventually weâ€™ll hit the edge of the net, at which point our path will hop to a different pentagon (whichever one was glued to our current pentagon before we cut open the dodecahedron). Whenever the path hops, it also rotates by some multiple of 36 degrees.<br></p>
<p>To avoid all this hopping and rotating, when we hit an edge of the net we could instead glue on a new, rotated copy of the net and continue straight into it. Weâ€™ve added some redundancy: Now we have two different pentagons representing each pentagon on the original dodecahedron. So weâ€™ve made our world more complicated—but our path has gotten simpler. We can keep adding a new net each time we need to expand beyond the edge of our world.</p>
<p>By the time our path has traveled through 10 nets, weâ€™ve rotated our original net through every possible multiple of 36 degrees, and the next net we add will have the same orientation as the one we started with. That means this 11th net is related to the original one by a simple shift—what mathematicians call a translation. Instead of gluing on an 11th net, we could simply glue the edge of the 10th net to the corresponding parallel edge in the original net. Our shape will no longer lie flat on the table, but mathematicians think of it as still â€œrememberingâ€� the flat geometry from its previous incarnation—so, for instance, paths are considered straight if they were straight in the unglued shape. After we do all such possible gluings of corresponding parallel edges, we end up with what is called a translation surface.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_14ff01eeeec2fbef4da8d0a223f2a3e2.jpg" alt="nautilus arthreya"><figcaption><span>Athreyaâ€™s right arm bears a tattoo of his favorite translation surface — a double pentagon. </span><br><span>Radhika Govindrajan</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The resulting surface is a highly redundant representation of the dodecahedron, with 10 copies of each pentagon. And itâ€™s massively more complicated: It glues up into a shape like a doughnut with 81 holes. Nevertheless, this complicated shape allowed the three researchers to access the rich theory of translation surfaces.<br></p>
<p>To tackle this giant surface, the mathematicians rolled up their sleeves—figuratively and literally. After working on the problem for a few months, they realized that the 81-holed doughnut surface forms a redundant representation not just of the dodecahedron but also of one of the most studied translation surfaces. Called the double pentagon, it is made by attaching two pentagons along a single edge and then gluing together parallel sides to create a two-holed doughnut with a rich collection of symmetries.</p>
<p>This shape also happened to be tattooed on Athreyaâ€™s arm. â€œThe double pentagon was something that I already knew and loved,â€� said Athreya, who got the tattoo a year before he and Aulicino started thinking about the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Because the double pentagon and the dodecahedron are geometric cousins, the formerâ€™s high degree of symmetry can elucidate the structure of the latter. Itâ€™s an â€œamazing hidden symmetry,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/" target="_blank">Alex Eskin</a>&nbsp;of the University of Chicago (who was Athreyaâ€™s doctoral adviser about 15 years ago). â€œThe fact that the dodecahedron has this hidden symmetry group is, I think, quite remarkable.â€�</p>

</center>
<p>The relationship between these surfaces meant that the researchers could tap into an algorithm for analyzing highly symmetric translation surfaces developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/iag3/~finster/en" target="_blank">Myriam Finster</a>&nbsp;of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. By adapting Finsterâ€™s algorithm, the researchers were able to identify all the straight paths on the dodecahedron from a corner to itself, and to classify these paths via the dodecahedronâ€™s hidden symmetries.<br></p>
<p>The analysis was â€œone of the most fun projects Iâ€™ve gotten to work on in my whole career,â€� Athreya said. â€œItâ€™s important to keep playing with things.â€�</p>
<p>The new result shows that even objects that have been studied for thousands of years can still hold secrets, Eskin said. â€œI think even for [the three mathematicians], it was very, very surprising to say something new about the dodecahedron.â€�</p>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond

We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

<p>The algorithms you'll use to create models use the error metric to perform optimizations. Your choice of error metric will affect the final model and the way you evaluate its performance, so it's important to understand the difference between error metrics.</p>
<p>MAE and RMSE are both extremely common in practice, that's why we will talk about them in this article. Before starting, let's have a quick recap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A regression model is a model that predicts a continuous value. The most common way of training a regression model is using supervised learning: you have a set of examples with the 'right answers'. You use this training set to teach the model how to produce those answers with a set of inputs in the hopes of finding general rules you can apply outside of the training set.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="meanabsoluteerrormae">Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</h2>
<p>The mean absolute error (MAE) is defined as the sum of the absolute value of the differences between all the expected values and predicted values, divided by the total number of predictions. In equation form, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/12/MAE.png" alt="MAE"></p>
<p>The expected values are the answers you already know that are part of the training, validation or test sets, and the predicted values are the results predicted by the model for such inputs.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you run your model on a validation set and get the following result:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Expected value</th>
<th>Predicted Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td>19</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>37</td>
<td>32</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>21</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>48</td>
<td>43</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>33</td>
<td>21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>25</td>
<td>22</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each row in the table represents a prediction and its associated expected value.</p>
<p>For example, in the first prediction, the right answer is 5, but our model predicted a 10, the prediction is off by 5. In the third prediction, our model predicted a 32, where the right answer is 37, the prediction is off by -5.</p>
<p>You can summarize this in another table with the results of the error for each prediction.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Expected value</th>
<th>Predicted Value</th>
<th>Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td>19</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>37</td>
<td>32</td>
<td>-5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>21</td>
<td>30</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>48</td>
<td>43</td>
<td>-5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>33</td>
<td>21</td>
<td>-12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>25</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>-3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>How do we calculate the mean absolute error?</p>
<p>Easy, just average the absolute value of the errors. With the data of our table, it would be like this:</p>
<p>MAE = (|5|+|8|+|-5|+|0|+|9|+|-5|+|-12|+|-3|+|3|)/9 = (5+8+5+0+9+5+12+3+3)/9 = 50/9 =~ 5.55</p>
<p>You might be wondering why we use absolute values. This is important to take into consideration the fact that we have two types of errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The predicted value is lower than the expected value.</li>
<li>The predicted value is higher than the expected value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The absolute value ensures that both types contribute to the overall error. Without it, the positive and negative errors would cancel each other. This is bad: your regression model might perform terribly and still return a very low overall error.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, repeat the calculation for total error using the data in the table, but this time don't use the absolute values:</p>
<p>Total Error = (5 + 8+ -5 + 0 + 9 + -5 + -12 + -3 + 3)/9 = 0</p>
<p>Yes, a total value of 0 despite making several mistakes.</p>
<p>MAE is a very simple and useful metric for error, and now you know almost everything there is to know about it.</p>
<p>Let's talk about RMSE.</p>
<h2 id="rootmeansquareerrorrmse">Root-Mean Square Error (RMSE)</h2>
<p>RMSE is defined as the square root of the average of the squared errors. In equation form, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/12/RMSE.png" alt="RMSE"></p>
<p>Don't worry if that sounds a bit confusing, it's much easier to understand with an example. Let's calculate it, step by step, using the same error table from before.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Square the error values</strong></li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Error</th>
<th>Squared Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>64</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-5</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>81</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-5</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-12</td>
<td>144</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-3</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2: Sum the squared errors and divide the result by the number of examples (calculate the average)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>MSE = (25 + 64 + 25 + 0 + 81 + 25 + 144 + 9 + 9)/9 =~ 42.44</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3: Calculate the square root of the average</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>RMSE = square_root(42.44) =~ 6.51</p>
<p>Calculating both the MAE and RMSE is quite simple, and both summarize the total error as a single number. Now that we know how to calculate both, let's discuss their main differences and when to use each one.</p>
<h2 id="maeorrmse">MAE or RMSE?</h2>
<p>First, let's list the things they both have in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both are used to measure the error produced by a predictive model.</li>
<li>Both are quick and easy to calculate.</li>
<li>Both summarize the error as a single numeric value that is easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference between the two metrics is the <strong>contribution of individual error values to the final result</strong>.</p>
<p>In the case of MAE, the contribution follows a linear behavior. This means that an error of 10 contributes twice as much as an error of 5. An error of 1000 contributes 10 times as much as an error of 100.</p>
<p>RMSE has a different behavior: due to the squaring operation, very small values ( between 0 and 1) become even smaller, and larger values become even larger. This means that big error values are magnified, whereas small ones are ignored.</p>
<p>If you were to plot the contribution of single values to the error in our example, MAE and RMSE would follow a behavior like the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/12/MAE_RMSE.png" alt="MAE_RMSE"></p>
<p>In brief, you want to use MAE for problems where the error gets worse linearly, like a model that predicts monetary loss. An error of $100 is twice as bad as an error of $50. MAE doesn't have a <em>predilection</em> for small errors or big errors.</p>
<p>RMSE is used when small errors can be safely ignored and big errors must be penalized and reduced as much as possible. RMSE gives much more importance to large errors, so models will try to minimize these as much as possible.</p>
<p>MAE and RMSE are both very simple and important concepts, and now you are another step ahead in your data science literacy.</p>
<p>I hope this information will be useful in your professional life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.empirical.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the_losers_game.pdf">this essay</a> which discusses changes in investment strategy in the 1970’s. In it, Charles Ellis talks about the difference between a <strong>winner’s game</strong> and a <strong>loser’s game</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Expert tennis is what I call a Winner’s Game because the ultimate outcome is determined by the actions of the winner. Victory is due to winning more points than the opponent wins – not, as we shall see in a moment, simply to getting a higher score than the opponent, but getting that higher score by winning points.</p><p>Amateur tennis, Ramo found, is almost entirely different. Brilliant shots, long and exciting rallies and seemingly miraculous recoveries are few and far between. On the other hand, the ball is fairly often hit into the net or out of bounds, and double faults at service are not uncommon. The amateur duffer seldom beats his opponent, but he beats himself all the time. The victor in this game of tennis gets a higher score than the opponent, but he gets that higher score because his opponent is losing even more points.</p><p>…</p><p>In other words, professional tennis is a <strong>Winner’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the winner – and amateur tennis is a <strong>Loser’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser.</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to talk about winning or losing in programming? What does success look like? I think that is a hard question, which could probably fill several blog posts, but I think a good working definition for us is “producing high quality code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, either by oneself or as part of a team, that helps to solve some problem for an end user”. Based on this definition, it seems to me that professional programming is somewhat of a losers game, at least for most of us.</p><p>I will concede that perhaps in fast moving startups, or for those involved in bleeding-edge research, there is an element of succeeding by “winning points”. Developing a faster algorithm, or determining some incredibly innovative way to implement a feature may help you succeed. However, I believe for a lot of professional programmers, succeeding comes from focusing on not “losing points” - causing bugs or producing unfathomable code, for example<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>When we consider programming with this in mind, it highlights the importance of some of the less glamorous elements of our field as a viable strategy for success. As you approach your next project, ask yourself, how can you avoid losing?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Which itself was taken from the work of Simon Ramo in his book <em>Extraordinary Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>By “high quality code” I mean code that is clean, understandable and that produces few bugs in normal operation. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote"><p>There has been some discussion on this piece on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iqctuy/programming_is_losers_game">lobste.rs</a> and it has highlighted a point that I need to clarify. I am not trying to claim that programming <em>is</em> a game, but rather it represents a scenario where we are working towards a goal, and perhaps one of the best strategies for achieving that goal is to avoid actions that frustrate your attempts to reach it. In tennis, that goal would be to win the match and a strategy you can pursue is to avoid hitting the net, rather than focussing on trying to outsmart your opponent with a clever backhand. For programmers, that goal may be to produce high quality software, and a strategy to pursue is to be extra careful to avoid bugs, rather than implement some very complex algorithm. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></section></div>]]>

<p><a href="https://veloren.net/">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In August, Veloren 0.7 was released! Airshipper, Veloren's launcher, also got
updated to 0.4.0. Veloren was featured in the inaugural episode of the <a href="https://rustgamedev.com/episodes/interview-with-team-veloren">Rust
Game Dev Podcast</a>. Although the 0.7 release party saw the
largest number of concurrent players at 57, it ran into some significant issues
which you can read about below.</p>
<p>The largest merge in Veloren so far also happened in August. It included
monumental changes to lighting and added level of detail functionality to see
far-off mountains. Lots of work has been done on the animation, combat, SFX, and
UX front. Animations for movement and combat were added and improved. Work
continued on particle systems, which have been added to Veloren in places like
campfires, fireworks, and weapons.</p>

<p>In September, work on 0.8 will continue. Some large systems being worked on
include networking, improved persistence stability, and player experience. Game
design is working on improving the connection between the experience a new
player has, and the current game design. The in-progress 0.8 version will likely
be completed more quickly than 0.7, as to not include too many changes.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://douady.paris/blog/egregoria_5.html">5th devlog</a> was published, talking about
the renaming, project management, buildings and scripting.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://discord.gg/CAaZhUJ">Discord</a> server was launched to discuss the project.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://specificprotagonist.itch.io/cary">Cary</a> the player has to bring the titular character to the exit by carrying
them or otherwise making sure they don't – nor the player themselves –
touch any of the traps.
Easier said than done when you have limited stamina and Cary keeps running
into spikes.</p>
<p>Made with hecs and wgpu (no framework), but uses WebGL on the web
because of the current implementation status of WebGPU.</p>
<p>Made during the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/extra-credits-game-jam-6">Extra Credits game jam</a>,
it's a rather small game.
It can be played in the browser or downloaded at <a href="https://specificprotagonist.itch.io/cary">itch.io</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1110620/Way_of_Rhea/">Way of Rhea</a> is a puzzle platformer that takes place in a world where you can
only interact with items that match your current color.</p>
<p>Way of Rhea has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1110620/Way_of_Rhea/">free Steam demo</a> temporarily available as part of
<a href="https://www.play-nyc.com/">Play NYC</a>!
The new demo includes a level that wasn't part of the Steam Game Festival,
showing off how circuit puzzles will work in the game. Since Play NYC
couldn't be in person this year, the devs temporarily themed this level to look
like last year's Play NYC venue, included placing virtual booths for other games
throughout the level.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kvark/vange-rs">vange-rs</a> is the project of re-implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vangers">Vangers</a> game (from 1998)
in Rust using modern development practices, parallel computations, and GPU.</p>
<p>This month vange-rs got real-time shadows!
See <a href="https://reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/i32p6r/realtime_hybrid_shadows_in_vangers">video on /r/rust_gamedev</a> and technical description
on the <a href="https://kvark.github.io/vange-rs/2020/08/04/shadows.html">Hybrid Shadows</a> post of the blog.</p>
<p>Another exciting development - the new bruteforce rendering technique allowing
to shift the camera behind the mechos as in 3rd person view.

<p><a href="https://epcc.itch.io/garden">Garden</a> is an upcoming game centered around growing realistic plants.
Some of the updates from <a href="https://cyberplant.xyz/posts/july-august/">the July &amp; August devlog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new player inventory system;</li>
<li>Better collision detection and camera movement;</li>
<li>Minimalist, scrollable text-based GUI for choosing which species to plant
or the type of material to build with (or destroy) something;</li>
<li>Plant growth now depends directly on the amount of light
every individual leaf receives, calculated on the GPU;</li>
<li>Variable leaf alignment and ease of creating variety;</li>
<li>Better bark, detailed trunks, and new species;</li>
<li>Completely new lighting using GI.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/khonsulabs/chillscapes">Chillscapes</a> is a lo-fi
rhythm experience created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/neoc03-rhythm-jam">NEOC#03 Rhythm Game Jam</a>. Using
layerable lo-fi music tracks, the game has you tap with the rhythm of the loops
being added, before changing the music up by adding another loop into the mix.
Last week, <a href="https://community.khonsulabs.com/t/chillscapes-retrospective-and-kludgine-update/28">a retrospective update was published</a>
reflecting on what the developer's takeaways were from the experience.</p>
<p>Chillscapes is written using an early-in-development 2d engine,
<a href="https://github.com/khonsulabs/kludgine">Kludgine</a>. For audio playback, rodio was utilized. The source code is
<a href="https://github.com/khonsulabs/chillscapes">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>When linking to a page for the <strong>purpose of reference</strong>, it seems better to me to <em><strong>link to the <a href="https://archive.org/">archive</a> of a given page</strong></em>, rather than to the original site itself.</p>
<p>This ensures that after some years have gone by, <strong>my article is guaranteed to be consistent</strong>. Due the  changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link could lead to a:</p>
<ul>
<li>404 /  Not Found (most common)</li>
<li>Changed or edited content, or entirely replaced content</li>
<li>Content that, due to a rise in popularity, is now shielded, demanding the user to make an account to read the entire article.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>Take defensive measures. To future-proof your content, rather than reference the general web, its far more reliable to link to an archive.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example:</h2>
<p>The Epoch Times wrote an article on Smartphones data-mining their users. This is the archived article here:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190214015500/https://www.theepochtimes.com/smartphone-app-users-are-data-mined-even-when-not-using-the-apps_2787202.html">The Archive Version (fully readable)</a></p>
<h3 id="article-content-before">Article Content Before</h3>
<p>You can see its perfectly “normal” readable useful  content.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-before.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<h3 id="article-content-after">Article Content After</h3>
<p>Now it’s spam from a site suffering financial need.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-after.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<p>So in Feb 14 2019 your users would have seen the content you intended. However in Sep 07 2020, your users are being asked to support independent Journalism instead.</p>
<h2 id="if-an-archive-record-doesnt-exist-make-one">If an Archive Record Doesn't Exist, Make One</h2>
<p>Its worth the extra moment, in referencing a site, to make an archive of the page you wish to reference, if one does not exist. After that, immediately use the link from the archive.org entry, rather than the blog, news, info, or forum site you wish to refer to.</p>
<h2 id="in-unstable-times-take-measures-for-stability">In Unstable Times, Take Measures for Stability</h2>
<p>The web is a fast changing place. Even more during the Covid pandemic and suffering financial markets. Since times are financially harder, websites are disappearing, heaping up advertising, demanding user response, and things like this.</p>
<p>To avoid your content losing quality due to these things, linking to a solid, unchanging static copy of the page is far more reliable.</p>

Making attempts to measure each engineer and team against the same yard stick not only hurts culture, but gives no true indication of productivity to begin with.</p><p>‍</p><p>To date, the industry has been attempting this 'holy grail' of software development metrics from the wrong perspective. By focusing on drivers and blockers of productivity rather than KPIs and stack ranking; we can start to measure engineers and teams in a healthy way. More importantly, this new perspective enables engineering leaders to introduce a software development metrics to help improve while maintaining the highest impact driver of productivity (culture).</p><p>‍</p><p>Check out Haystack's approach <a href="https://usehaystack.io/">here</a>!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5ef130052901e5cad8432b81_Haystack_Designed_Presentation.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><a href="https://usehaystack.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=3%20git%20signals%20to%20identify%20blockers&amp;utm_campaign=inside%20blog">Haystack</a> helps engineering leaders identify blockers and trends.

<p>In this post, we're going to take a look at some cool stuff that can be done using HTML. Let's look at some of the html tags, you might not be knowing even existed.
ould be making use of today.</p>
<p>Let's get started 💪</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-the-lessfiguregreater-tag">1. The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>This can be used to mark up a photo. The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element can also contain a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593642634315-48f5414c3ad9"</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"Person using lack laptop computer on brown wooden table"</span> <span>style</span>=<span>"width:100%"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figcaption</span>&gt;</span>Person using lack laptop computer on brown wooden table<span>&lt;/<span>figcaption</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="2-the-lessaudiogreater-tag">2. The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>⁣<code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element provides a way to add audio resources to a web page without the need to use any other plugin.⁣ It's used to play a sound much as music or an audio stream. It supports mp3, wav and ogg.
⁣
A fallback text is enclosed within the tag to be shown to browsers that don't support the element.⁣
⁣
By default, the browser does not show any controls. ⁣
To add the ability for users to play, pause, adjust volume, etc. the 'controls' attribute can be used.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>audio</span> <span>controls</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"music.mp4"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"audio/mp4"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"mucis.ogg"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"audio/ogg"</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>audio</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="3-the-lessvideogreater-tag">3. The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>This allows you to embed a media player for video playback. 
It's used to play a video clop or a video stream without embedding youtube or vimeo videos. It supports mp4, webm and ogg.</p>
<p>For example, you can upload your video on AWS S3 and use the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag to embed it on your website.</p>
<p>You can also specify certain attributes, such as width, height, autoplay, loop, controls, etc.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>video</span> <span>width</span>=<span>"960"</span> <span>height</span>=<span>"540"</span> <span>controls</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"video.mp4"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"video/mp4"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"video.ogg"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"video/ogg"</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>video</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-the-lessprogressgreater-tag">4. The <code>&lt;progress&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;progress&gt;</code> tag represents the progress of a task.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;progress&gt;</code> tag should not be confused with the <code>&lt;meter&gt;</code> tag (which represents a gauge). It has two attributes value and max.⁣⁣</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>progress</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"57"</span> <span>max</span>=<span>"100"</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>progress</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="5-the-lessmetergreater-tag">5. The <code>&lt;meter&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>You can use the meter element to measure data within a given range (a gauge).</p>
<p>This can be achieved with min and max values or with a percentage.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>meter</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"7"</span> <span>min</span>=<span>"0"</span> <span>max</span>=<span>"10"</span>&gt;</span>7 out of 10<span>&lt;/<span>meter</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>meter</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"0.4"</span>&gt;</span>40%<span>&lt;/<span>meter</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="6-the-lessdatagreater-tag">6. The <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>It specifies the machine-readable translation of the content of the element. It also provides a human-readable text.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>li</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>data</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"010"</span>&gt;</span>Dogs<span>&lt;/<span>data</span>&gt;</span>

</code></pre>
<h2 id="9-the-lessdetailgreater-tag">9. The <code>&lt;detail&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;⁣detail&gt;</code> tag is used to make collapsible sections when it is required to provide extra information about a subject that users can hide or view by their choice.
⁣
It uses the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag which specifies the title that can be clicked to expand or collapse the details.⁣</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>details</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>summary</span>&gt;</span>Click To Open<span>&lt;/<span>summary</span>&gt;</span>
  Hey, I am natively collapsable section. My content remains hidden till you click on summary.

<p>By now, many people have run across the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016.pdf">Invisible Salamander</a> paper about the interesting property of AES-GCM, that allows an attacker to construct a ciphertext that will decrypt with a valid tag under two different keys, provided both keys are known to the attacker. On some level, finding properties like this isn’t too surprising: AES-GCM was designed to be an AEAD, and nowhere in the AEAD definition does it state anything about what attackers with access to the keys can do, since the usual assumption is that attackers don’t have that access, since any Alice-Bob-Message model would be meaningless in that scenario.</p>



<p>What is interesting to me is that this property comes up more often than one would think, I ran across it several times now during my work reviewing cryptographic designs, it’s far from an obscure property for real world systems. The general situation these systems have in common is that they involve three parties: Alice, Bob, and Trent. Trent is a trusted third party for Bob, who is allowed to read messages and scan them, with details like when and why depending on the crypto system in question. While Trent and Bob agree on the ciphertext<em>—</em>say because Trent hands Bob the ciphertext or because Alice presents Trent’s signature on it<em>—</em>Alice has the option of giving Trent and Bob different keys. The challenge for Alice is to come up with a ciphertext that has a valid authentication tag and still decrypts to different messages for Trent and Bob.</p>



<h4>Mitigations</h4>



<p>Before I dive deeper into how to construct invisible salamanders for AES-GCM and AES-GCM-SIV, a few words on how to defend against these problems. The easiest option here is to add a hash of the key to the ciphertext. This technically violates indistinguishability, as the identity of the key is leaked, i.e. an attacker now knows which key was used for the message. If indistinguishability is necessary, using the IV as a salt for the hash works well, constructions like <code>HMAC-SHA-2(key=IV, message=key)</code> (i.e. aka HKDF-expand) work well here, as long as attention is paid on whether or not this key hash can be used in any other context. In general, it shouldn’t because the key already should only be used for AES-GCM/AES-GCM-SIV, but real world systems sometimes have weird properties.</p>



<h4>Constructing Salamanders</h4>



<p>With the mitigation out of the way, onto the fun part: Constructing the messages. In order to understand why and how these attacks work, we first have to talk about <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{F}_{2^{128}}</span> and the way AES-GCM and AES-GCM-SIV use this field to construct their respective tags. As a finite field <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{F}_{2^{128}}</span> supports addition, multiplication, and division, following the usual field axioms. The field has characteristic 2, which means addition is just the xor operator, and subtraction is the exact same operation as addition. Multiplication and division is somewhat more complicated and not in scope for this article, it suffices to say that multiplication can be implemented with a very fast algorithm if the hardware supports certain instruction sets (carryless multiplication). The division algorithm uses the Euclidean algorithm and will at most take 256 multiplications in a naive implementation, so while slower than the other operations, it will still be extremely fast. I will use <span data-katex-display="false">+</span> for the addition operation and <span data-katex-display="false">\cdot</span> for the multiplication operation. The most important caveat is to not confuse these operations with integer arithmetic.</p>



<h5>AES-GCM</h5>



<p>Next, on to <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf">AES-GCM</a>. This AEAD is a relatively straightforward implementation of an AEAD that uses a UHF based MAC for authentication. Our IV is 12 byte long, we use a 4 byte counter and CTR mode to encrypt the message. The slightly odd feature is that we start the counter at 2, for reasons we will see later. For authentication, we first derive an authentication key <span data-katex-display="false">H</span> by encrypting the zero block (This is why we don’t start the counter at zero, otherwise the zero IV would be invalid). Now, using the ciphertext blocks, additional data blocks (both padded with zeros as needed for the last block), and adding a special length block containing the size of the additional data and the ciphertext, we get a collection of blocks, all of which I will refer to as <span data-katex-display="false">C_i</span>. To compute the tag, we now compute the polynomial</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">GHASH(H, C, T) = C_0\cdot H^{n+1} + C_1\cdot H^{n}+\dots + C_{n-1}\cdot H^2+C_n\cdot H+T</span></p><p>The constant term, <span data-katex-display="false">T</span> is the encrypted counter block associated to the counter variable of 1 (Which is why we started at 2 for the CTR mode). Remember that in characteristic 2 <span data-katex-display="false">+</span> is xor, so we could equivalently say that we compute the polynomial without the constant term and then encrypt it with CTR mode as the first block.</p>



<p>Now, how do we get two different plaintexts to agree on both ciphertext and tag, we first choose two keys and produce the corresponding keystreams, choosing the plaintexts so that the ciphertexts agree (If you want two plaintext that make sense, this part is the hardest step, you first brute force the first few bytes in order to be valid in one format and a comment opening statement in the other, so that you can switch which parts of the ciphertext will appear as valid plaintext and which parts appear as commented out). We leave one ciphertext block open for now, as a sacrificial block that we will modify in order to make the tags turn out to be the same. Next derive the corresponding authentication keys <span data-katex-display="false">H_1</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">H_2</span> and our constant terms <span data-katex-display="false">T_1, T_2</span>. This means, we have <span data-katex-display="false">C_i</span> fixed, except for a specific index, say <span data-katex-display="false">j</span>, and can now solve</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">GHASH(H_1, C, T_1) =GHASH(H_2, C, T_2)</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">\sum_{i=0}^n C_i\cdot H_1^{n+1-i}+T_1=\sum_{i=0}^n C_i\cdot H_2^{n+1-i}+T_2</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">C_j\cdot\left(H_1^{n+1-j}+H_2^{n+1-j}\right)=\sum_{\substack{i=0\\i\neq j}}^n C_i\cdot \left(H_1^{n+1-i}+H_2^{n+1-i}\right)+T_1+T_2</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">C_j=\left(H_1^{n+1-j}+H_2^{n+1-j}\right)^{-1}\cdot\left(\sum_{\substack{i=0\\i\neq j}}^n C_i\cdot \left(H_1^{n+1-i}+H_2^{n+1-i}\right)+T_1+T_2\right)</span></p><p>by solving for the sacrificial block <span data-katex-display="false">C_j</span>.</p>



<h5>AES-GCM-SIV</h5>



<p>So far so good, but, what about <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8452">AES-GCM-SIV</a>? GCM is famous for having many weird properties that make it extremely fragile, like leaking the authentication key on a single IV reuse, or allowing for insecure tags smaller than 128 bits. In many ways, AES-GCM-SIV is how AES-GCM should look like for real world applications, much more robust against IV reuse, only revealing the damaging properties of an UHF with a reused IV if both IV and tag are the same. This is accomplished through using the tag as a synthetic IV, meaning the tag is computed over the plaintext, and then used as IV for CTR mode to encrypt. Even though this kind of SIV construction uses MAC-then-Encrypt, they are secure against the usual downsides due to CTR mode always succeeding in constant time, independent of the plaintext. This means the receiver can decrypt the message and validate the tag without revealing information about the plaintext in case of an invalid tag. The library needs to take care that the plaintext is properly discarded and not exposed to the user in case the tag does not validate.</p>



<p>The actual IV for AES-GCM-SIV is used primarily derive a per message key. This means that if the IV of two messages is different, both encryption and authentication keys will be unrelated and can not be used to infer things about each other.</p>



<p>All in all AES-GCM-SIV works like this:</p>



<ul><li><span data-katex-display="false">H, K_E = \operatorname{KDF}(K, IV)</span></li><li><span data-katex-display="false">T=\operatorname{AES}(K_E, P_0\cdot H^{n+1}+\dots+P_n\cdot H)</span></li><li><span data-katex-display="false">C=\operatorname{AES-CTR}(K_E, IV=T)</span></li></ul>



<p>where the plaintext blocks <span data-katex-display="false">P_i</span> again contain additional data and length, and some extra hardening and efficiency tricks having been stripped for clarity.</p>



<p>Our previous approach of first creating the ciphertext and then balancing things out to get the tags to agree clearly cannot work here anymore. The keystream, and therefore the ciphertext, depend on the tag, so if we want to have any chance of finding a salamander, we have to fix the tag before we do any calculation at all. So after having chosen <span data-katex-display="false">T</span>, we decrypt it under each of our keys to get the result of our polynomial <span data-katex-display="false">S_i=\operatorname{AES}^{-1}(K_{E,i}, T)</span>. What we are left with is finding plaintexts <span data-katex-display="false">P_1, P_2</span> such that</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">S_i=\sum_{j=0}^n P_{j, i} H_i^{n+1-j}</span></p><p>which gives us a system of two linear equations with <span data-katex-display="false">2n</span> unknowns. But this isn’t all constraints we need to satisfy, since we still need to encrypt these plaintexts once we have the tag balanced. Here, we are lucky that everything is over characteristic 2: The CTR encryption is just an addition of the plaintext and the encrypted counter block <span data-katex-display="false">C_i=\operatorname{AES}(K_E, CB_i)+P_i</span>. To say that two plaintexts result in the same ciphertext under two different keys is just fulfilling the equation</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">\operatorname{AES}(K_{E, 1}, CB_{j, 1})+P_{j, 1}=\operatorname{AES}(K_{E, 2}, CB_{j, 2})+P_{j, 2}</span>.</p>



<p>This, like our two equations for the tag, is a linear equation. So in the end, for a plaintext that has a size of <span data-katex-display="false">n</span> blocks, we get <span data-katex-display="false">n+2</span> linear equations with <span data-katex-display="false">2n</span> variables. This means, in almost all cases, we can construct an invisible salamander with only adding two sacrificial blocks, with the same caveat that the two plaintexts need to be partially brute forced.</p>



<h4>Test Code</h4>



<p>I’ve put this to the test and have written code to produce <a href="https://github.com/sophieschmieg/fun-with-gcm/blob/master/FunWithGcm.java">AES-GCM</a> (Java) and <a href="https://github.com/sophieschmieg/fun-with-gcm/blob/master/fun_with_gcm_siv.cc">AES-GCM-SIV</a> (C++) salamanders.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Anyone with any programming experience understands that computers are deterministic machines. If you provide the same input, you’ll always get the same output. That’s why having computers generate something by chance is trickier than it may seem.</p>
<p>Computers use random numbers for everything from cryptography to gambling, generative algorithms, video games, and more. However, computers are inherently incapable of being random. Instead, programmers rely on pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). These are simply a category of algorithms that programmatically generate new random numbers from a given starting value called the seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These algorithms are not without their own limitations. Since the random numbers are programmatically generated, if someone were able to identify the seed value and the PRNG algorithm you were using, they’d be able to predict the next random number in the sequence. This would allow an attacker to break encryption, predict the next playing card in a sequence, cheat in a video game, etc. </p>
<p>Despite this concern, PRNGs are extremely useful in situations involving modeling and simulations as it allows you to “replay” a series of random events by initializing your random number generator with the same seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In situations where the randomness of the random numbers is critical, we use a “true” random number generator (TRNGs). Unlike PRNGs that have an arbitrary seed value, TRNGs pick a seed value from their environment / external data. </p>
<p>Here are a few potential options:</p>
<ul><li>Mouse movements</li><li>Fan noise</li><li>Atmospheric pressure</li><li>Number of microseconds since the last whole second</li></ul>
<p>We just need to pick a seed that an attacker wouldn’t be able to predict. This seed value will then be passed into an algorithm, similar to PRNGs, that will generate a random number to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use case will generally dictate whether a PRNG will suffice or if a “true” RNG is needed. Regardless, it’s important to understand the practical differences between both approaches. </p>
<p>PRNGs are faster than TRNGs and their determinism is extremely useful in cases where you want to replay a series of “random” events. Additionally, some PRNGs are periodic in nature, but modern PRNGs with the right initialization parameters have a period long enough that it’s not a major concern. Conversely, TRNGs are slower than PRNGs, are non-deterministic, and are not periodic.</p>
<h2>Linear Congruential Generator</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at implementing a simple PRNG. We’ll implement a variant called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> (LCG) algorithm. LCG was previously one of the most commonly used and studied PRNGs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">more info</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the recurrence relation for LCG:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iNcDHvHA6BvD1fpYntUkZ-11dzW6EYoW5dHv7mMhPZhDNo5fJaIMZXUh7SmZq0AoobvHxg7K5MMvqoWav7ee0xHase0fhAjWmNWoW7RcT5GzAao1jVwtGY11q2yL6iuvWiYFgyHS" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">Wikipedia page on LCG</a> documents a few commonly used values for modulus, multiplier, and increment. There’s no consensus on the best values to use hence the differing values across implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to be mindful of what values we use for these parameters. Choosing the wrong values can create a period that is too short which would render our random number generator useless. </p>
<p>In the image below, you can see that small changes to our parameters can greatly impact the period length.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FVum2kuYt4oMYjOdzHx2txpQH0NgheDDSUSxyQJamzGbZgPcUALt3Mmv4H-BElodwXwTzcLaqicG8IdsPFAgolV4DK8NkZXtghDQ_hX6MyMsxU_irWeOxR1ijaoYgecOU3fbuPbQ" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>For our implementation, we’ll use the values documented in previous standards of the C languages (C90/C99/ANSI C,&nbsp; and C11).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>a = 1103515245</code></p>
<p><code>m = 2³¹</code></p>
<p><code>c = 12345</code></p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever PRNG algorithm you choose should result in a uniform distribution of random numbers and a sufficiently long period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a simple implementation in Swift:</p>

<h2>Simulating Dice Rolls</h2>
<p>Let’s say you wanted to simulate a dice roll. </p>
<p>It might seem reasonable to change the modulus to 6, but this would create a period far too short to be usable. We need to stick with well-chosen and tested values for our parameters. </p>

<p>Instead, using the approach in the code above, we can simulate 10,000 dice rolls:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uVT2lMlmWHcYIio5WmgkMMXz9nkkA_P4lzIVWeyVETxasCDn5s_5qQWgBh5FAvfPDwHipyMaqHWmb_lOp_J7oOXiRdxo_3lywqvrIo4Ky40QoDUYIrJ15w5mC6B9XWVLWvyySRWr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Dice Value: 10,000 Roll Simulations</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking at the results, we can see that it is indeed a uniform distribution of values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Generating Random Numbers In A Range</h2>
<p>Next, let’s consider generating random numbers that fall in a range. Again, we shouldn’t change our parameters without fully understanding how it affects the period. </p>
<p>Instead, we should map our PRNG’s results to values in our desired range.&nbsp;</p>

<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/A2h_s4Z_eN-qGkjEZabgPwWpOjMmIDdD9fQlYcdM344voNTlxPIvammtm6RRXJ6aDgG83h67zZYf4E4olN7jz5VRiIK10D_XeRTf0whcfHLZhn8Q9142vJBZU9Ma40DIvFVw7FdU" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>After a million simulations across the specified range [30, 80)</p>
<h2>Further Reading</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators">more modern PRNGs</a>, I’d recommend exploring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne-Twister</a> approach. It’s currently the most popular PRNG algorithm and currently used in Python (numpy), Ruby, PHP, R, and C++.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Azure Bicep is an abstraction built on top of Azure ARM Templates and Azure Resource Manager that offers a cleaner code syntax with better support for modularity and code re-use. Azure Bicep moves away from the JSON syntax used by ARM Templates and is much easier to both read and write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Azure! This is the latest tool from Microsoft for deploying Azure resources in a DevOps process, and its even open source!</p>



<p>Let’s get started!</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: Before you start using Azure Bicep, know that it is in an early Alpha state and is not supported for use in production environments just yet. Also, it doesn’t support all the functionality it eventually will. However, it does support some really great features already that makes Azure<a href="https://build5nines.com/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/"> Infrastructure as Code </a>(IaC) even easier to write and read!</p></blockquote>







<br><h2><span id="what_is_azure_bicep"></span>What is Azure Bicep?<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Bicep is a new declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources. The goal of this new language is to make it easier to write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) targeting Azure Resource Manager (ARM) using a syntax that’s more friendly than the JSON syntax of Azure ARM Templates.</p>



<p>Azure Bicep works as an abstraction layer built on top of ARM Templates. Anything that can be done with Azure ARM Templates can be done with Azure Bicep as it provides a “transparent abstraction” over ARM (Azure Resource Manager). With this abstraction, all the <code>types</code>, <code>apiVersions</code>, and <code>properties</code> valid within ARM Templates are also valid with Azure Bicep.</p>

<p>Azure Bicep is a transpiled language. This means that the Azure Bicep code converted into ARM Template code. Then, the resulting ARM Template code is used to deploy the Azure resources. This transpiling enables Azure Bicep to use it’s own syntax and compiler for authoring Azure Bicep files that compile down to Azure Resource Manager (ARM) JSON as a sort of intermediate language (IL).</p>



<p>The way that Azure Bicep is transpiled into ARM JSON is similar to how there are many different languages that can be written in, then transpiled into JavaScript that can be run within the web browser. One popular example of this type of transpiled language is TypeScript. A transpiled language offers benefits of adding an abstraction layer to make it easier and / or more feature full to write code that then gets compiled down to IL code that gets executed. This is also similar to how C# and VB.NET code compile down to MSIL in .NET code.</p>



<p>In the development world, it’s common to encounter the use of transpiled languages. It’s also common in the DevOps world where YAML and JSON are converted between one or the other. Azure Bicep offers some similarity in how it’s transpiled into ARM JSON. This enables you to use an alternative syntax and feature set for writing declarative Infrastructure as Code than the often-cumbersome ARM JSON syntax.</p>



<blockquote><p>Azure Bicep offers some similarity in how it’s transpiled into ARM JSON. This enables you to use an alternative syntax and feature set for writing declarative Infrastructure as Code than the often-cumbersome ARM JSON syntax.</p></blockquote>



<p>Azure Bicep will have limits in its ability to support features that are not natively supported by ARM Templates when deploying Azure resources. However, Azure Bicep will also be able to implement additional code reuse and other features that the Azure Bicep compiler will be able to translate into valid ARM JSON features. Through all this, Azure Bicep has a goal of offering a cleaner syntax along with better support for modularity and code re-use than is offered by ARM JSON.</p>



<h2><span id="why_use_azure_bicep"></span>Why use Azure Bicep?<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Resource Manager and ARM Templates are written in a JSON syntax that can be cumbersome to work with. Azure Bicep is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that offers a transparent abstraction over Azure Resource Manager and ARM Templates that offers support for a cleaner code syntax with better support for modularity and code re-use. Azure Bicep offers a few improvements for authoring Azure IaC over the use of ARM Template JSON.</p>



<br><h3><span id="azure_bicep_benefits"></span>Azure Bicep Benefits<span></span></h3>



<p>Here are the primary benefits of using Azure Bicep that are integrated as core goals into the Azure Bicep project and are the foundations for why Microsoft is building Azure Bicep:</p>



<ol><li>Create a better language for writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for describing, validating, and deploying Azure resources.</li><li>The Azure Bicep language is a transparent abstraction that does not require any updates or onboarding to the underlying platform in order to support a new Azure resource <code>type</code> and / or <code>apiVersion</code>.</li><li>Azure Bicep code should be easily understood and straightforward to learn for those both new and experienced with other programming languages.</li><li>Code re-use should be a primary feature allowing users freedom to modularize and re-use code without ‘copy/paste’.</li><li>Azure Bicep tooling should offer a high level of discoverability and validation. The tooling should also be developed alongside the compiler; rather than added afterwards.</li><li>Azure Bicep should enable users to have high confidence that the code is ‘syntactically valid’ before it’s deployed.</li></ol>



<p>Also, Azure Bicep is being specifically designed so that it is not a general-purpose language for meeting any need. It is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) meant for writing declarative IaC. It’s also not meant to provide a model for non-Azure related tasks.</p>



<h2><span id="install_azure_bicep"></span>Install Azure Bicep<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Bicep is a DevOps tool built for authoring IaC used to deploy Azure resources from any environment. As a result, this means Azure Bicep supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>



<p>The primary component for Azure Bicep is the Bicep CLI. This is the required tool used for compiling Bicep code into ARM JSON; plus, it’s open source and cross-platform.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at installing Azure Bicep in different environments!</p>



<h3><span id="download_bicep_cli_binaries"></span>Download Bicep CLI Binaries<span></span></h3>



<p>When installing Azure Bicep, you will need to first download the Bicep CLI binary built for your operating system. All the binaries for the different supported operating systems can be downloaded from the official <a href="https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases page</a> of the Azure Bicep open source project.</p>



<p>You can either manually download the Bicep CLI binary and install it, or you can use the following helper script examples to install Azure Bicep more easily.</p>



<h3><span id="install_on_windows"></span>Install on Windows<span></span></h3>



<p>On Windows machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using PowerShell with the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Create the install folder
$installPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\.bicep"
$installDir = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $installPath -Force
$installDir.Attributes += 'Hidden'
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-win-x64.exe", "$installPath\bicep.exe")
# Add bicep to your PATH
$currentPath = (Get-Item -path "HKCU:\Environment" ).GetValue('Path', '', 'DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames')
if (-not $currentPath.Contains("%USERPROFILE%\.bicep")) { setx PATH ($currentPath + ";%USERPROFILE%\.bicep") }
if (-not $env:path.Contains($installPath)) { $env:path += ";$installPath" }
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command.
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_on_macos"></span>Install on macOS<span></span></h3>



<p>On macOS machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using the terminal with the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-osx-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep
# Add Gatekeeper exception (requires admin)
sudo spctl --add ./bicep
# Add bicep to your PATH (requires admin)
sudo mv ./bicep /usr/local/bin/bicep
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_on_linux"></span>Install on Linux<span></span></h3>



<p>On Linux machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-linux-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep
# Add bicep to your PATH (requires admin)
sudo mv ./bicep /usr/local/bin/bicep
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_in_azure_cloud_shell"></span>Install in Azure Cloud Shell<span></span></h3>



<p>The Azure Cloud Shell runs on Ubuntu server, so to install Azure Bicep, you will need to install the Linux binary for the Bicep CLI. However, you cannot simply use the above script for installing Azure Bicep on Linux due to a limitation of the Azure Cloud Shell that prevents you from modifying the PATH.</p>



<p>Here are some steps you can follow to basically “install” Azure Bicep for use in the Azure Cloud Shell environment:</p>



<ol><li>Connect to the Azure Cloud Shell; either within the Azure Portal or at <code><a href="https://shell.azure.com/" rel="nofollow">https://shell.azure.com</a></code>.</li><li>First, you likely want to create a directory within the Azure Cloud Shell environment to save the Bicep CLI to. For example, creating a <code>~/tools</code> directory:<br><code>mkdir ~/tools</code></li><li>Next, navigate to the directory created and download the Linux binary for the Bicep CLI into the Azure Cloud Shell environment into this directory:</li></ol>



<pre><code># Navigate to "tools" directory
cd ~/tools
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-linux-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep</code></pre>



<p>Using the above steps will place the Azure Bicep CLI in the location of <code>~/tools/bicep</code> within you Azure Cloud Shell environments. Once placed here, you can execute the Bicep CLI from anywhere within the Azure Cloud Shell environment by referencing it within the <code>~/tools</code> directory.</p>



<p>For example, when located within the <code>~/bicep</code> directory, you can run the following command to utilize the <code>~/tools/bicep</code> executable to build some Azure Bicep code in the <code>main.bicep</code> file:</p>



<pre><code>chris@Azure:~/bicep$ ~/tools/bicep build main.bicep</code></pre>



<p>With the Azure Bicep CLI installed into the Azure Cloud Shell environment, then you’ll be able to utilize Azure Bicep easily from anywhere without the need to install it on your local machine.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599532527250/Gm0E0xbTo.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>The most successful companies are built upon great working cultures that are thoughtful about the <a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-new-analytics-of-culture">cultural contribution</a> each hire will make to their company. If you're a candidate looking to land your dream job, you'll need to be well prepared for these cultural or behavioral interviews. </p>
<p>As a hiring manager, I've interviewed over 200 engineering candidates and a significant portion of that  has been evaluating the soft skills each candidate embodies. I've rejected extremely strong technical performers and and fought to hire some more junior candidates based on the signal I've identified from the culture interview. Because every company has their own culture, their own values, and their own questions, the culture interview can be extremely hard to prepare for. However, there's still plenty you can do to set yourself up for success instead of jumping in blind.</p>
<p>While my interviewing experience as both a hiring manager and a candidate have been primarily within engineering, I believe the tools in this kit will be mostly applicable across product, design, and other disciplines within product development organizations. </p>
<h2 id="stories-to-prepare">Stories to Prepare</h2>
<p>Why should you prepare stories instead of answers to specific questions? The simple reason is that you can't prepare and memorize an answer to every question an interviewer might ask. Often times these conversations are organic and the real signal comes from how you respond to follow-up questions. The best answers are rooted in real examples from your personal experience and by "loading" these stories into your brain ahead of time, you'll be better equipped to handle questions on the spot.</p>

<h3 id="story-1-your-career-narrative">Story #1: Your career narrative</h3>
<p>Almost everyone you talk to will give an intro of themselves and then ask you to share a brief intro as well. Depending on who you're talking to, that intro can be anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes. In some cases, a hiring manager or recruiter might ask you to go deeper into your background and spend up to 30 minutes digging into your experiences.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ol>
<li>A narrative that connects your career together. While many careers are not linear, it can help to show that you were deliberate about the jobs you took and what you wanted to learn at each one. You may find that as you look back on your career, there's a story you can weave together that ties together where you started, where you're at now, and the trajectory you're on. A story that shows strong growth, surmounting challenges, and a high forward trajectory can help get companies excited about you. Finish your story such that the company you're talking to easily makes sense as the next step on your career journey.<ul>
<li>A weak narrative merely lists what's on your resume, e.g., "in 2013 I joined X and did these projects, in 2014 I joined Y and did these projects, and recently I've done Z and B. I want to join this company because it's doing really well."</li>
<li>A stronger narrative gives context on your decisions and motivations, e.g., "In college, I was excited about electronics and human-computer interfaces, so I looked for companies that specialized in consumer hardware. X company was one of the companies that stood out, and when I joined I got to work on the interface for Product P. This taught me [so and so] but after 2 years there, I really wanted to get better at [this other thing], so I reached out to Company Y. From there, I grew into [some role], helped the company do [these things], and now I'm [doing something impressive]. Going forward, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can put my front end architecture skills to good use while learning how to build complex systems at scale. I admire [company name] for being able to build high quality user interfaces while being super fast and reliable. I think this might be a great fit for my expertise and give me opportunities to grow my backend skills."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What specific things you're looking for in your next role. These should apply to more than one company to show that you're not just pandering to the company, but try to be opinionated at the same time.<ul>
<li>A weak answer is too vague, uncertain, or demonstrates that you haven't put much thought to it.<ul>
<li>e.g., "I'm looking for a place where I can advance my career." or "I wanted to get into AI and Machine Learning because it's a really hot industry right now."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A stronger answer shows that you've clearly thought about what you want, have had enough experience to know what you don't want, and implicitly show why the company you're talking to is a good fit.<ul>
<li>e.g., "Over my career, I've found that it's really important for me to have a strong sense of ownership over my work. I enjoy taking an ambiguous customer problem, breaking it down with a PM or designer, and then being able to see the whole project through from start to finish. I like to solve problems and not just execute on tasks, even if that means working through some dealing with a lot of uncertainty at times and wearing many hats."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="what-the-interviewer-is-looking-for">What the interviewer is looking for</h4>
<ul>
<li>For quick intros, interviewers are generally not evaluating your storytelling ability. Instead, they want to know why you might be a good fit for the role and what your motivations are.</li>
<li>For hiring managers and recruiters, your career narrative can be a useful lens to interpret the interview feedback and make a decision on whether or not to move forward.<ul>
<li>For example, if your background is primarily backend engineering and the interviews demonstrate weakness in UI implementation, then your narrative can help interviewers focus more on your strengths over your weaker areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you under-represent yourself at this stage, you may miss an opportunity to move forward in the interview process or get an offer.<ul>
<li>On the flip side, you should avoid changing your narrative too much simply to suit the role or company you're talking to. It's often better to be rejected for a role that really doesn't fit you than to get a role doing something that doesn't actually align with what you want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-that-interviewers-may-ask">Questions that interviewers may ask</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
<li>What are you looking for in your next role?</li>
<li>Why are you interested in [company]?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png"></p>
<h3 id="story-2-two-impressive-projects">Story #2: Two Impressive Projects</h3>
<p>You should be prepared to talk in depth about at least two meaningful projects you've worked on where you played a significant role. Why two? If you use the same example for every question, the interviewer may think you're lacking experience or have a weak track record. Having at least two substantial projects in your pocket will help you balance breadth and depth to respond to a variety of questions.</p>
<p>Keep your initial explanation short (between 3-5 minutes) and offer to go deeper afterwards. This will help keep the conversation focused and avoid wasting time on unimportant details.</p>
<p>A good format to use whenever you're giving an example of something that happened is to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm">SBI framework</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf">STAR framework</a>. For these examples I'll use the SBI model. </p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Situation</strong>: Share context on the project before jumping into what you did.<ul>
<li>Where did the project come from?</li>
<li>Why was it important? How did you or your team prioritize it?</li>
<li>What were the goals of the project?</li>
</ul>

<li>Are they applying for a role that's realistic with what they've done historically?</li>
<li>What kind of domain expertise do they have?</li>
<li>Have they had enough technical leadership experience for the role? (More relevant for senior/tech lead roles and above.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can the candidate clearly articulate the benefit and impact of their work?<ul>
<li>It's surprising how often some people don't know or think about the result of their work beyond completing the tasks that were assigned to them. Strong candidates think about the entire workflow, from idea conception to evaluating success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do they have a growth mindset?<ul>
<li>Are they able to reflect on both the successes and misses of that project?</li>
<li>Do they take credit for all the things that went well and blame others for all the things that didn't go well? (This would be a red flag.)</li>

<h3 id="story-3-resolving-a-conflict">Story #3: Resolving a conflict</h3>
<p>Delivering successful projects often require working with a lot of stakeholders and collaborators. Demonstrate that you can work well with others, share critical feedback, and resolve situations on your own.</p>
<p>I've been surprised at how often candidates talk about a situation where they ultimately failed to resolve a conflict. It can be hard to think of a good example on the spot, so definitely prepare this ahead of time and consider what you want the interviewer to take away.</p>

<p>In this blog post we will take a look inside the Wyze Outdoor Base Station and see whats going on. Many people were very excited to hop on board the Wyze train when they announced the outdoor camera – however it has mostly been met with bad reviews and buggy, half baked features. </p>

<p>We can see that the board is labeled 9531_HL_CORE_AM7</p>

<p>Qualcomm marketing says:</p>

<p>The Specifications sheet on Qualcomms website is very light on details, but this looks like a common SoC for low end networking and cheapo wireless routers. </p>

<p>It seems like this might be a board built by Nova Electronics that Wyze is putting into a nice package. Looks Familiar right?</p>



<p>The 3 pins on the right side of the board look like they could be SPI – so we tried to solder some pins on and get a terminal open</p>



<p>I guessed the TX / RX pins, and the ground was labeled nicely on the board. For Reference: </p>



<ul><li>Ground to GND (Duh!)</li><li>TX is L1</li><li>RX is L2</li></ul>

<p>I connected with a cheapo CP2102 USB to UART adapter, set the baud rate to 115200 and was off to the races… kinda</p>

<p>Well this is interesting, this little guy is running OpenWRT.  I guessed all of the normal user / password combos I could think of and didn’t get anywhere – If anyone has any ideas on how to get into this shoot me a message / comment!</p>



<p>Lets watch it boot up and see if there is anything interesting going on here: </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Rust is increasingly used as a programming language for smart contracts.
Whereas the first generation blockchains used specialized VMs,
newer blockchains are running general purpose VMs,
especially <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a>.
And of course,
Rust is a modern language that runs just about everywhere,
and is especially good at targetting WASM.
Somewhat serendipitously,
this has made Rust one of the best candidate languages for writing
smart contracts on the new generation of blockchains.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been learning more about the smart contract programming landscape,
and this post is about my first dive into smart contract programming in
Rust on the <a href="https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore">NEAR</a> platform.</p>

<p>NEAR is a sharded, proof-of-stake blockchain that runs WASM.
It not only supports smart contracts written in Rust
(in addition to <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a>),
but is also itself written in Rust.
While one the most prominent Rust blockchain projects,
it is perhaps not yet widely known in the broader blockchain development community.</p>

<p>Based on my experiences here though,
I’m quite enthusiastic about the NEAR developer experience,
and I intend to spend more time hacking on NEAR.</p>

<p>These are my first impressions of NEAR,
as someone with moderate knowledge of blockchains,
but limited previous blockchain programing experience.
I have previously written similarly about my first experiences
with other blockchains: <a href="https://talk.nervos.org/t/experience-report-first-time-building-and-running-ckb/4518/">Nervos</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Aimeedeer/bigannouncement/blob/master/doc/hacklog.md">Ethereum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-at-the-start-of-the-docs">Starting at the start of the docs</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.near.org/">NEAR documentation</a> seems refreshingly thorough,
if a bit confusing to navigate.
There are different docs to follow depending on your role in the network,
whether a validator,
smart contract programmer,
etc.
and I find myself jumping between multiple sections,
without quite understanding how the docs are organized overall,
perhaps because there isn’t a single table of contents that covers the entire site.</p>

<p>Anyway, after browsing the docs to get a general idea of their organization,
I go back to the front page and I click “Basics”.
This seems to be leading me down the path of being a smart contract developer,
not running my own local node,
not building NEAR itself.</p>

<p>For sake of understanding,
I generally want to build the entire stack I’m working on,
but for now I’m going to follow the docs exactly and see where that gets me,
and not build NEAR on my own.</p>

<h2 id="account-creation">Account creation</h2>

<p>Setting up an account is done through a web interface at:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://wallet.testnet.near.org/">https://wallet.testnet.near.org/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I create a testnet account,
<code>floopy.testnet</code>,
and a recovery phrase.</p>

<p>The NEAR explorer page for my account is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/floopy.testnet">https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/floopy.testnet</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of a hash for an ID,
as in most blockchains,
you get an actual string name.
And the system can optionally do account recovery over email or phone.
While this is convenient, it seems suspiciously centralized for a public blockchain,
and I wonder if it is possible to create accounts without any central authority.
I imagine it is, and this website is mostly a convenience, but don’t know yet.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Following <a href="https://docs.near.org/docs/development/near-cli">the docs</a>, I install <code>near-cli</code>, a Node app.</p>

<p>Semes to work fine.</p>

<p>From previous doc reading I know that running a full node typically involves running <a href="https://github.com/near/nearup">nearup</a>.
It appears though that I don’t need that now,
so probably for the purposes of developing on near,
<code>near-cli</code> will just talk to existing public nodes.</p>

<p>At this point I seem to hit the end of the “basics” documentation flow,
without really accomplishing anything,
but I remember <a href="https://docs.near.org/docs/quick-start/new-to-near#how-do-i-get-started">from the beginning of these docs</a> that “choose a starter project”
is step 2.</p>

<p>I back up and choose the <a href="https://examples.near.org/rust-status-message"><code>rust-status-message</code></a> starter project.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-contract">Running a contract</h2>

<p>The examples say to install <code>near-shell</code>,
but that project has been renamed to <code>near-cli</code>.
I see that there are already PRs submitted to fix this,
but they are about a month old.
There are a number of relatively old PRs in NEAR repos that haven’t been reviewed.</p>

<p>I clone the example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/near-examples/rust-status-message
$ cd rust-status-message
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And build per the instructions:</p>



<p>This is an npm build that wraps a cargo build.
I’m curious if there’s any JavaScript involved,
but I suspect they are just using npm as the primary interface
for the sake of familiarity and for consistency with
the build process for AssemblyScript smart contracts.</p>

<p>Looking at <code>package.json</code> it’s true that npm isn’t doing much here,
but it <em>is</em> adding a post-build step that cargo is incapable of:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>  </span><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"build"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"postbuild"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/status_message.wasm ./res/"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is an error in the build:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target may not be installed

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an easy error to understand to somebody familiar with embedded Rust development,
but probably not to other newbies.
The toolchain just doesn’t have the <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> target installed.
I don’t know if I missed the documentation that explained this,
but the user experience here could be better.</p>

<p>I add the wasm target:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
info: downloading component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-unknown-unknown'
info: installing component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-unknown-unknown'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that the build works:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ npm run build

&gt; rust-status-message-builder@1.0.0 build /home/ubuntu/near/rust-status-message
&gt; cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

&gt; cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/status_message.wasm ./res/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I try to deploy to the testnet using a temporary developer account:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ near dev-deploy --wasmFile res/status_message.wasm --helperUrl https://near-contract-helper.onrender.com

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>NEAR wants me to opt in to telemetry.
I’m sympathetic,
but since this command presumably will have access to private keys,
I’m not confident that the developers have been suitably careful
about avoiding collection of private data.
For now I say “n”, until I can review that code.</p>

<p>The command continues:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ near dev-deploy --wasmFile res/status_message.wasm --helperUrl https://near-contract-helper.onrender.com

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>URL query parameters and how laxness creates de facto requirements on the web</h2>

	<p><small>September  7, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the ways that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a> (the code behind <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a>) is unusual is that it strictly validates the query parameters
it receives on URLs, including on HTTP <code>GET</code> requests for ordinary
pages. If a HTTP request has unexpected and unsupported query
parameters, such a <code>GET</code> request will normally fail. When I made
this decision it seemed the cautious and conservative approach, but
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CautionIsAMistakeToday">this caution has turned out to be a mistake on the modern web</a>. In practice, all sorts of sites will
generate versions of your URLs with all sorts of extra query
parameters tacked on, give them to people, and expect them to work.
If your website refuses to play along, (some) people won't get to
see your content. <strong>On today's web, you need to accept (and then
ignore) arbitrary query parameters on your URLs</strong>.</p>

<p>(Today's new query parameter is 's=NN', for various values of NN
like '04' and '09'. I'm not sure what's generating these URLs, but
it may be Slack.)</p>

<p>You might wonder how we got here, and that is a story of lax behavior
(or, if you prefer, being liberal in what you accept). In the
beginning, both Apache (for static web pages) and early web
applications often ignored extra query parameters on URLs, at least
on <code>GET</code> requests. I suspect that other early web servers also
imitated Apache here, but I have less exposure to their behavior
than Apache's. My guess is that this behavior wasn't deliberate,
it was just the simplest way to implement both Apache and early
web applications; you paid attention to what you cared about and
didn't bother to explicitly check that nothing else was supplied.</p>

<p>When people noticed that this behavior was commonplace and widespread,
they began using it. I believe that one of the early uses was for
embedding 'where this link was shared' information for your own web
analytics (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/AnalyticsVsSecurity">cf</a>), either based on your logs
or using JavaScript embedded in the page. In the way of things,
once this was common enough other people began helpfully tagging
the links that were shared through them for you, which is why I
began to see various 'utm_*' query parameters on inbound
requests to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a> even though I never
published such URLs.
Web developers don't leave attractive nuisances alone for long, so
soon enough people were sticking on extra query parameters to your
URLs that were mostly for them and not so much for you. Facebook
may have been one of the early pioneers here with their 'fbclid'
parameter, but other websites have hopped on this particular train
since then (as I saw recently with these 's=NN' parameters).</p>

<p>At this point, the practice of other websites and services adding
random query parameters to your URLs that pass through them is so
wide spread and common that accepting random query parameters is
pretty much a practical requirement for any web content serving
software that wants to see wide use and not be irritating to the
people operating it. If, like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a>, you stick to your guns and
refuse to accept some or all of them, you will drop some amount of
your incoming requests from real people, disappointing would be
readers.</p>

<p>This practical requirement for URL handling is not documented in
any specification, and it's probably not in most 'best practices'
documentation. People writing new web serving systems that are
tempted to be strict and safe and cautious get to learn about it
the hard way.</p>

<p>In general, any laxness in actual implementations of a system can
create a similar spiral of de facto requirements. Something that
is permitted and is useful to people will be used, and then supporting
that becomes a requirement. This is especially the case in a
distributed system like the web, where any attempt to tighten the
rules would only be initially supported by a minority of websites.
These websites would be 'outvoted' by the vast majority of websites
that allow the lax behavior and support it, because that's what
happens when the vast majority work and the minority don't.</p>

September 7, 2020 | https://www.dollartrak.com/negotiate-salary-to-achieve-your-financial-goals/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dollartrak.com/negotiate-salary-to-achieve-your-financial-goals/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Many people concentrate on saving and investing as a way to achieve their financial goals.  Both of these are easier to grow with a higher income.  No matter what your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a> are, negotiating a higher salary will make them easier to achieve.</p>



<p>The time you spend researching your fair market value, preparing requests for raises, and making requests for adjustments might very well be the most valuable use of your time.</p>



<p>Considering the importance of salary you would think that people would constantly be on top of their market value ensuring they are compensated fairly.  In my experience this is often not the case.</p>



<h2>Many People are Underpaid and Don’t Even Know it</h2>



<p>Like most people I knew, I never talked about my salary with my friends or co-workers.  It’s taboo for many Americans.  This lack of transparency makes it easy to be underpaid while being unaware of it.  This benefits your employer, but not you!</p>



<p>Once I took on a senior leadership position I begun to understand the severity of differences in how people are compensated for similar positions.  In some cases employees with the same job title were compensated double what others were.</p>



<p>I am sure that most people are aware these inequities exist and might blame them on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-finds-salary-history-bans-boost-pay-for-african-americans-women-11592472602?mod=e2fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discrimination</a>, differences in quality of work, education or level of education.  In my experience a lack of salary negotiation and keeping their salary up to date is the main driver. </p>



<p>Negotiating your salary can be uncomfortable, and asking for raises can be even more so.  This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it though!  Many will shy away from it and those that do not will end up making much more money over time to do the same job.</p>



<h2>Increases in Salary Compound Over Your Career</h2>



<p>As people get further along in their careers these differences can grow to nearly overwhelming numbers.  Employees can literally make over double what others make for the same job.  This is because of the compounding nature of raises on your salary over the course of your career.</p>



<p>Raises are generally given on a percentage basis of your current salary.  What this means is every single time you get a raise you are also getting a raise on all of your previous raises.  This adds up the same way compound interest adds up.  Over time the numbers can get large and with a 40 year long career for many there can be a lot of time for this to happen.</p>



<h2>Examples of Compounding Salary</h2>



<p>Lets look at a few simple scenarios over a 20 year job with a company.  The first scenario shows the affect of negotiating a higher starting salary and the second one shows the affect of negotiating occasional large raises.</p>



<h3>Affect of Negotiating a Higher Starting Salary</h3>



<p>Jack and Jill both were offered the same job, but Jill negotiated a very modest 10% higher salary than Jack.  They both did well and received 3% raises over the course of 20 years working for the company.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$57,963</td><td>$67,195</td><td>$77,898</td><td>$90,305</td><td>$1.43M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>The $5,000 starting difference turns into a little over $9,000 a year difference over 20 years.  This resulted in Jill making an extra $140,000 over the course of her job with this company.</p>



<h3>Affects of Negotiating Larger Raises</h3>



<p>Here we will modify the above table to show Jill negotiating a 10% raise for herself every 5 years while Jack happily accepts the standard 3%.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$61,903</td><td>$76,640</td><td>$94,884</td><td>$117,473</td><td>$1.63M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years, Jill get’s 10% every 5 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>After 20 years with a salary of $81,275 jack would need a whopping 45% raise just to catch up to Jill and still would be behind by $340,000 in lifetime earnings!</p>



<h2>How do I Keep My Salary Up to Date</h2>



<h3>Know Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>This always starts with knowing what your fair market value is.  There are several websites that can help here.  I like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.glassdoor.com/" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.salary.com/" target="_blank">Salary.com</a>.  Do a little research and come up with a range that you feel is reasonable.  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="548" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" alt="salary chart" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?w=731&amp;ssl=1 731w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=300%2C257&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Taken from salary.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>You should be honest with yourself about your skills and experience, but I recommend starting at the high end of the range and working down from there.  If someone else can make $100,000 a year doing your job, why not you?</p>



<h3>Getting Your Salary Right to Start</h3>



<p>In my experience the majority of people will accept the first salary offer given.  This is generally a mistake.  Why would a hiring manager make you his absolute top dollar offer to start?  He is generally wise to leave a little room for negotiation for the candidates that do counteroffer.  Some candidates will want to counteroffer no matter what you offer them first!</p>



<p>Once you accept a lower salary it is VERY difficult to get it corrected.  You may have some success here at smaller companies but with larger companies and their bureaucracy don’t get your hopes up.  In my experience the best way to fix this is to find a new job.  You can avoid it by knowing your market value and negotiating a proper base to start.</p>



<h3>Constantly Update Skills</h3>



<p>The job market is always changing.  You need to keep up with it and try to stay out in front of it to maximize your earning potential.  Whatever field you are in set annual goals to achieve certifications, complete continuing education, learn a new tool or attend a conference.  </p>



<p>While one of these things by itself may not change your career, the culmination of annual self improvement over 5 to 10 years can make a massive difference in your marketability.  Senior level employees with relevant certifications and experience can be worth many times what an entry level employee is.</p>



<h3>Take Advantage of Your Time at Work</h3>



<p>You are going to be there for 8 hours a day so you might as well make the most of it.  Always seek out new projects that allow you to learn and develop your skills.  Ask about company paid training, certification or tuition.  Look for ways to add value above and beyond normal for your task.</p>



<p>Most employers will provide you with the tools, money or time to improve your skills because it directly benefits them.  If they won’t help you out here, you may want to re-consider if working there is good for your long term success.</p>



<h3>Write Down Accomplishments as They Happen</h3>



<p>Many companies do a once per year salary adjustment.  Isn’t it basically impossible to remember what all you did when walking into this conversation?</p>

<p>The best way to remember it all is to write it down as it happens.  Keep a running log of your accomplishments. Write them all down and come into the annual review process armed with the information you need.</p>



<h3>Frequently Update Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>Your fair market value is likely always changing.  Make sure to check the websites and understand if you are compensated fairly on a regular basis.  Always do this before an annual review.  </p>



<p>If the market has shifted for your skill set, or a new skill you learned is valuable, make sure your employer knows!  This is the time to ask for a larger than standard raise.  That new certification you acquired could be a great reason to go after a 5 or 10% raise this year.</p>



<h2>Asking for an Adjustment When You are Underpaid</h2>



<p>If you want to stick it out with your company, but found that you were underpaid you will need to ask for an adjustment to market value.  I find that the request should have the following basic supporting documentation:</p>



<ol><li>Report’s on salary range for your job from multiple sources.  If you are underpaid, show them multiple sources that validate this.  The more you can find the better.</li><li>Detail any recent skills you have developed or certifications that you have obtained. </li><li>List of recent accomplishments at work that show you have gone above and beyond.  You have been keeping the list like I recommend above right?</li></ol>



<p>I have asked for larger raises(&gt;10%) multiple times in my career and always gotten what I wanted by using the above method.  I have also been asked for raises by quite a few employees over the years.  Those with accompanying documentation like above were taken much more seriously.</p>



<h2>Leave If Your Employer Doesn’t Value You Correctly</h2>



<p>Some employers will never pay you fair market value.  This could be because they don’t value you fairly or because they don’t need the skills you have.  They may also just not have the money in the budget for someone of your skill level.  </p>



<p>Don’t let their decisions hold you back.  If they won’t pay you fairly then be prepared to get up and leave.  If you have been updating your skills regularly as I mentioned above you may find that moving to a better position is surprisingly easy.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this has shed a little light onto the importance of salary negotiations when being hired and frequently during the course of your career.  If you ignore these conversations because they can be uncomfortable you will pay dearly for it over the long term.  </p>



<p>Ultimately, your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/06/09/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> can be dramatically reduced and result in you having to work for many extra years in order to meet your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a>.  You should take charge of this part of your career before you look back and wish you had.</p>

September 7, 2020 | https://orib.dev/gitserve.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://orib.dev/gitserve.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>A while ago, I released <a href="https://orib.dev/git9.html">git9</a>, a git client for
Plan 9. However, it always felt like it was missing something: A git server.
over a few weekends of work, I sat down and put one together. This Labor
Day weekend, I took the opportunity to labor on it, and got something working.</p>

<h3>usage</h3>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> is a git server designed to fit into the Plan
9 ecosystem, allowing hosting of, and interacting with, code on a Plan 9
server, while still allowing legacy clients running on Unix to get a copy
of the code.</p>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> only speaks the <code>git://</code> protocol.
But because it runs behind
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/listen">aux/listen</a>
and 
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/tlssrv"><code>tlssrv</code></a>, we
effectively get two additional protocols for free: <code>gits://</code>, or
TLS-encrypted <code>git://</code>, and <code>hjgit://</code>, which is
<code>git://</code> but with Plan 9 authentication to support user login
over TLS. Unfortunately, only the unencrypted <code>git://</code> protocol
is supported out of the box by upstream git. There may be ways to solve
this, using <a href="https://rovaughn.github.io/2015-2-9.html">custom
transports</a>, and a unix port of tlsclient</p>

<p>To start a <code>git://</code> server, just run it under aux/listen1.
To enable encryption and user authentication, run it under
<code>tlssrv -a</code>. This doesn't need a certificate, because
the Plan 9 authentication generates the secret used for TLS. And,
finally, if you just want encryption, you can use <code>tlsclient</code>
with a certificate.</p>

<pre># git:// server, serving every repository under the current directory
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' git/serve -r `{pwd}

# gits:// server, doing the same: But with encryption.
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -c /path/to/cert.pem git/serve -r `{pwd}

# hjgit:// server doing the same: Requires account on server to connect
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -a git/serve -r `{pwd}
</pre>

<p>If you want to allow people to write, you can just add the
<code>-w</code> flag to git/serve. While you can do this on
any of the protocols, keep in mind that only <code>hjgit://</code>
authenticates the users. Push to the world, but don't let the
world push to you!</p>



<p>All the protocols git uses are closely related. The <code>ssh://</code>
protocol is just the <code>git://</code> protocol, with the command selected
sightly differently. The smart <code>http://</code> protocols are the same
as the <code>git://</code> protocol, with a different handshake, and split
over multiple post requests.</p>

<p>Git9 implements the git protocol in under 500 lines of C. The
full code is available on github, in
<a href="https://github.com/oridb/git9/blob/24abe6c00b6f65e7241763399fc72c043b7d9bbf/serve.c">serve.c</a>.
</p>

<p>The protocol look something like this for pushing:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 0086:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 009d:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 refs/heads/master\n"
&lt;=w= 0076:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\0report-status\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= <pack-data>
=r=&gt; 000e:	unpack ok
=r=&gt; 0019:	ok refs/heads/master
</pack-data></pre>

<p>And this for pulling:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-upload-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
<pack-data>
</pack-data></pre>

<p>The git protocol consists of pkt-lines, which are strings with a
hex-formatted length prefix.  The length prefix includes itself.  So,
the string <code>"hi"</code> would be formatted as
<code>0006hi</code>. A zero lenth packet where the length prefix
is not included is special. This is called a 'flush packet', and
is used to terminate a phase of negotiation.</p>

<p> All negotiation is with these packet lines, at
which git flips over to pure binary mode to transfer a pack file
over.</p>

<p>In the <code>git://</code> protocol, the client always starts off
by saying which action it wants to do: Either it wants the server to
fetch a pack from the client, or it wants the server to upload a pack
to the client.  That's this line:</p><pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
</pre>

<p>The upload side of this protocol is simpler on the server side so
we'll go through it first.</p>

<h3>pushing</h3>

<p>In the upload protocol, the server begins by sending a list of
references that the client may update. In <code>git/serve</code>
we grab all the refs in the repository, and filter down to just
the ones beginning with <code>heads/</code>.</p>

<pre>	if((nrefs = listrefs(&amp;refs, &amp;names)) == -1)
		sysfatal("listrefs: %r");
	for(i = 0; i &lt; nrefs; i++){
		if(strncmp(names[i], "heads/", strlen("heads/")) != 0)
			continue;
		if(fmtpkt(c, "%H refs/%s\n", refs[i], names[i]) == -1)
			goto error;
	}
	if(flushpkt(c) == -1)
		goto error;
</pre>

<p>With the first phase of the protocol, the client then
sends the list of references it wants to update. This
takes the form of:</p>

<pre>	OLDHASH NEWHASH heads/refs/updateme\n"
</pre>

<p>Because the client knows what the reference versions are on
the server, it can compute what commits are between the version
on the server and the version that it has. If the new hash
is the zero hash, this signals to the server that the reference
should be deleted. This list of updates is terminated with a
flush packet. The code in git9 that handles this is below:

</p><pre>	while(1){
		/* Did we get a packet? */
		if((n = readpkt(c, pkt, sizeof(pkt))) == -1)
			goto error;
		/* Was it a flush packet? */
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		/* Split it up into the 3 parts: old, new, reference */
		if(getfields(pkt, sp, nelem(sp), 1, " \t\n\r") != 3){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR  protocol garble %s\n", pkt);
			goto error;
		}
		/* verify that these are valid hashes */
		if(hparse(&amp;old, sp[0]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad old hash %s\n", sp[0]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(hparse(&amp;new, sp[1]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad new hash %s\n", sp[1]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and valid refs */
		if(!validref(sp[2])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR invalid ref %s\n", sp[2]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and then remember them for when we do the update */
		*cur = erealloc(*cur, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*upd = erealloc(*upd, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*ref = erealloc(*ref, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		(*cur)[*nupd] = old;
		(*upd)[*nupd] = new;
		(*ref)[*nupd] = estrdup(sp[2]);
		*nupd += 1;
	}
</pre>

<p>Next, the client uploads the pack. This is a blob containing
the commit data. It goes into <code>.git/objects/packs/recv-$pid.pack</code>,
at least until we can index it and rename it.</p>

<pre>	while(1){
		n = read(c-&gt;rfd, buf, sizeof(buf));
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		if(n == -1 || write(pfd, buf, n) != n)
			return -1;
		packsz += n;
	}
	if(checkhash(pfd, packsz, &amp;h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "hash mismatch\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(indexpack(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "indexing failed\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(rename(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "rename failed: %r\n");
		goto error2;
	}
</pre>

<p>Finally, we update the references. Note that we haven't
locked the repository yet. This is because none of the data
we have here can conflict: All objects are addressed by hash,
so a race would simply leave us with a duplicate hash in the
packfile. Eventually, a <code>git/repack</code> will clean
that up.</p>

<p>However, updating the references can conflict. So,
for updating the references, we acquire a lock file.
We then read all the references, make sure that they
match the old reference, and then write in the new
reference.</p>

<pre>	for(i = 0; i &lt; nupd; i++){
		if(resolveref(&amp;h, ref[i]) == 0 &amp;&amp; !hasheq(&amp;h, &amp;cur[i])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR old ref changed: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((o = readobject(upd[i])) == nil){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR update to nonexistent hash %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(o-&gt;type != GCommit){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR not commit: %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		unref(o);
		if(snprint(refpath, sizeof(refpath), ".git/%s", ref[i]) == sizeof(refpath)){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR ref path too long: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((fd = create(refpath, OWRITE, 0644)) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR open ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		if(fprint(fd, "%H", upd[i]) == -1){
			close(fd);
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR upate ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		close(fd);
	}
</pre>

<p>And that's pushing.

</p><h3>pulling</h3>

<p>Pulling takes more work on the server side, because the
server needs to compute a reasonable packfile to send to
the client. The protocol itself is still fairly simple.</p>

<p>It begins the same way as pushing, by sending all the
branches that a client may want to obtain from the git
repository.</p>

<pre>=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
</pre>

<p>The client then starts telling us what commits they want,
and what commits they have. This lets us find a graph difference
between the server and client graph, and generate a pack file
that contains few, if any, extraneous commits. </p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
</pre>

<p>Computing the commits that go into a pack is not always trivial.
The comits that the client may be on may have "bubbles" in the graph,
so simply walking back from the start of the graph to the commits
that the client has may end up walking around the commit, leading
to nearly the whole history of the repository being sent, instead
of just one or two commits.</p>

<p>Consider a repo where the server is ahead of the client, and
now the client is trying to pull the changes. The client has commits
<code>c</code>, and we're trying to compute a pack with only the
commits <code>o</code>.</p>


<pre>                o---o
               /     \
    --c---c---c---c---o---o &lt;-- server
                  ^
                client
</pre>

<p>The client does a git/pull, and sends that it has the
commit marked <code>[c]</code>. Since the server has
every commit the client does, and more, it can look at
all ancestors of the client commit. If we're smart, we
would, but a naive …</p></div>

              <article>
                  

<p>Each year, I try to set a few personal goals that stretch me in some way.</p>

<p>In 2017, for example, I <a href="https://forrestbrazeal.com/2017/12/03/how-to-read-100-books-in-a-year-and-still-have-a-life/">read one hundred books</a>, which turned out to be more a test of endurance than skill.</p>

<p>This year, I decided to see if I could write a fictional short story and get it published somewhere. Though I do a fair amount of technical writing in the course of my work, I’d never seriously attempted to write and sell a short story before, or even taken a creative writing class.</p>

<p>This meant I had no knowledge of the market, no connections, and generally no idea what I was doing.</p>

<p>So, a challenge!</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>I decided to focus on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction">speculative fiction genre</a>, partly because it seemed more accessible and mostly because unlike literary journals, the best speculative fiction magazines still pay their authors.</p>

<p>My goals, in descending order of likelihood, were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get something published somewhere, even if unpaid</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published and get paid something for it, even a token amount</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published at <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#short">Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) professional rates</a> (currently 6 cents a word)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least 1000 words published at SFWA-qualifying markets (the standard for <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#associate">SFWA associate member status</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least three stories published, totaling more than 10,000 words, at SFWA-qualifying professional markets (<a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#active">SFWA Active Member status</a>, my self-imposed standard for a legit “professional” science fiction writer)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="results-through-nov-8">Results (through Nov. 8)</h2>

<p>After many form rejections on several terrible stories, I sold my <a href="https://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/biotech/forrest-brazeal/memory-foam">first story</a> on March 23rd, 2018, to Daily Science Fiction (an SWFA pro market). At 1010 words, this sale actually crossed the first four goals off my list at once.</p>

<p>However, I continued to write and improve over the spring and summer of 2018, selling several more stories along the way, eventually totaling more than 16,000 words of fiction. Some publications have long wait times, but by the time “Empathy Bee” <a href="http://www.diabolicalplots.com/the-diabolical-plots-year-five-fiction-lineup/">is published</a> in March 2019, I should have the wordcount needed for active SFWA membership status, my most insane stretch goal.</p>

<h3 id="by-the-numbers">By the numbers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Stories Written: 22</p></li>

<li><p>Total Wordcount: ~60,000, the length of a medium-sized novel</p></li>

<li><p>Total Submissions: 70</p></li>

<li><p>Stories Sold: 8</p></li>

<li><p>SFWA-qualifying professional sales: 6</p></li>

<li><p>Rejections: 50 (15 personal)</p></li>

<li><p>Withdrawals: 2</p></li>

<li><p>Still Pending: 10</p></li>

<li><p>Other Results: <a href="https://www.writersofthefuture.com/writers-of-the-future-3rd-quarter-standings-for-year-35/">Honorable Mention, Writers of the Future</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>

<h3 id="have-no-ego">Have no ego</h3>

<p>It turns out writing short stories that sell is really, really hard. It’s hard to think of good ideas, it’s hard to write them down in a form that anyone would want to read, and it’s even harder when those readers are magazine editors who get literally hundreds of unsolicited submissions every month. Don’t attempt it if you have an easily bruised sense of self-worth, or you will be depressed a lot.</p>

<p>I’m grateful to have sold some stories this year, but my identity is not tied up in “being a writer”. It can’t be, because I have to…</p>

<h3 id="embrace-failure">Embrace failure</h3>

<p>I learned to view rejections as a badge of honor, which is a helpful mental trick to keep from going insane after a few dozen forms. As I told Jason Bougger in an <a href="http://www.themeofabsence.com/2018/11/author-interview-forrest-brazeal/">author interview</a> over at Theme of Absence, rejections are like the good soreness you feel after working out – it means you’re growing.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-feedback-loop-short">Keep your feedback loop short</h3>

<p>Early on, when I was getting form rejections from big magazines with no accompanying feedback, I got really frustrated because I knew my work was obviously not up to par – I just didn’t know why. A submission to a smaller publication, Abyss and Apex (who I later ended up selling a different story to!) brought back a personalized rejection with a helpful piece of advice: try signing up for the <a href="https://sff.onlinewritingworkshop.com/">Online Writing Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>At the time I had never heard of writers’ workshops and didn’t really understand why they would be helpful. But I paid a few dollars and signed up. The other writers there provided generous feedback on how to improve my work, and I learned just as much from critiquing their pieces. The OWW membership more than paid for itself when several readers pointed out an obvious plot hole in my story “Empathy Bee”, which subsequently sold in revised form to Diabolical Plots.</p>

<p>Later, once I had professional credits, I was able to join the wonderful <a href="http://www.codexwriters.com/">Codex</a> writers’ community, which has hugely expanded my horizons and understanding of the industry. The more I write, the less I trust myself to be a good judge of my work’s quality, and the more I seek out and appreciate feedback from others.</p>

<h3 id="write-smart-not-just-hard">Write smart, not just hard</h3>

<p>Some writers recommend keeping insane writing regimens, cranking out thousands of words a day, saying it’s the only way to improve. And I wrote a fair amount this year. But stepping back and getting feedback on my work was just as important.</p>

<p>I had a music teacher who used to ask: “Did you practice ten hours, or just the same hour ten times?” When I took time to evaluate my work and deliberately build on it, I improved faster than just by vomiting words indiscriminately onto the page.</p>

<h3 id="keep-reading-good-prose">Keep reading good prose</h3>

<p>No, I didn’t read a hundred books again this year. But I did try to keep my ear filled with good prose. For example, this summer I got on a southern realist kick: Flannery O’Connor, Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers. Studying how those writers crafted characters and situations helped me nail down a couple of southern-set stories that ended up selling. My science fiction writing improved more from reading good writers, period, than from reading science fiction.</p>

<h3 id="just-because-you-wrote-something-good-enough-to-get-published-somewhere-that-doesn-t-mean-the-next-thing-you-write-won-t-be-terrible">Just because you wrote something good enough to get published somewhere, that doesn’t mean the next thing you write won’t be terrible</h3>

<p>This sounds stupid in hindsight, but for a long time I had it in my head that once I sold a story, I’d have figured out what it took to get published, and I wouldn’t have any trouble after that. Instead, I still get tons of rejections, and often my writing seems just as lifeless and terrible to me as it did before I sold my first story.</p>

<p>The good news is that with practice, the overall trend appears to be upward. At least, when I look back at my work from the beginning of the year, I can’t believe how bad it is. So I must be improving, right?</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Like many people who start out in the short fiction game, I would love to publish a novel. So I think that might be a 2019 goal. But I’m sure I’ll continue to write short stories, too. There’s real satisfaction in creating something that you can hold in your head all at once, knowing how it will turn out and why it’s effective.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In my line of work, we talk a lot about security warning design and
effectiveness. Usually, the task of a warning is to prevent a user from doing
something dangerous, such as accepting an invalid certificate or installing
malware. There’s another class of warnings which tell users that something bad
has <em>already</em> happened, with the aim of helping them recover. I’ll call this
category <strong>after-the-fact warnings</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t know much about after-the-fact warnings, such as best practices for how
to design them or how effective they can be. In fact I know so little that I had
to make up a name for this category of warnings, when there probably already
exists a fancy academic name. So I
<a href="https://twitter.com/estark37/status/1301545990848094208">asked</a> for some
research pointers on Twitter and collected an interesting reading list. I’ll
summarize some of my observations here. Note that this isn’t a comprehensive
survey – just some thoughts from the papers that caught my eye the most.</p>



<p>To set the stage, here are some real world examples of after-the-fact warnings.
Again, this isn’t comprehensive, just some examples that I can think of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Antivirus notifications telling people that they have malware on their device</li>
  <li>Password breach notifications, either from a first-party (LinkedIn notifying
users that their LinkedIn password has been leaked) or third-party service
provider (<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned</a>,
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/12/better-password-protections-in-chrome.html">a web browser</a>)</li>
  <li>Chrome has a feature
(“<a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/new-security-protections-tailored-you/">predictive phishing protection</a>”)
that notices when you type a saved password on a suspected phishing site and
warns you that you may have been phished and should change your password. This
is similar to a password breach notification, but has some different
considerations because the suspected attack is phishing rather than credential
stuffing.</li>
  <li>Other (non-password) data breach notifications, for example an email from
Equifax telling people that their personal data has been leaked</li>
  <li>Some browsers have persistent UI telling the user that they’ve bypassed a
security warning in the past. For example, after a person clicks through a
certificate, phishing, or malware warning in Chrome, the address bar shows a
red “Not Secure” chip to let them know that they’re in an unsafe state. It
might be a bit of a stretch to call this an after-the-fact warning, as it’s
not clear what action the warning is asking the user to take.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/after_cert_error.png" alt="Chrome UI after bypassing a certificate error">
  <figcaption><i>Google
Chrome UI after bypassing a certificate error. The page loads normally but the
address bar shows a red “Not Secure” chip to emphasize that the user is in an
unsafe state.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, there are some interesting hypothetical examples of after-the-fact
warnings, which is what originally got me interested in this area.
<a href="https://emilymstark.com/2020/07/20/certificate-transparency-a-birds-eye-view.html">Certificate Transparency</a>
introduces an asynchronous certificate verification step. The browser might
accept a certificate as valid, but then find out that it was actually not valid,
days or weeks later. It’s generally been considered beyond the pale for the
browser to warn the user at this point. How might the browser communicate that a
website the user visited in the past was potentially compromised? What is the
user supposed to do about it? I think the answer to these questions is probably
that the browser shouldn’t try to communicate this message, because it’s too
hard to understand and there’s nothing the user can be expected to do about it.
But I’m not totally sure that’s the right answer, and that’s what got me
interested in how successful after-the-fact warnings can be.</p>



<p>I read 5 papers on this topic:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.mobsec.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/mobsec/veroeffentlichungen/2018/09/10/ccsf266-finalv1.pdf">“What was that site doing with my Facebook password?” Designing Password-Reuse Notifications</a> <em>Golla et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper describes two surveys about notifications that companies send
when they discover a user’s password in a password dump from another
service. The first survey studies representative examples of real-world
notifications, and the second survey uses a model notification designed
using the lessons from the first survey. Comprehension was pretty poor
across the board. Most users reported that they would change their
password upon receiving the model notification, but very few said they
would change their password to something unrelated. (And of course,
surveys don’t always give us the best information about what someone would
do in real life.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2020/ConPro/papers/bhagavatula-conpro20.pdf">(How) Do People Change Their Passwords After a Breach?</a> <em>Bhagavatula et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper makes use of the Security Behavior Observatory, which is a
large group of participants who have agreed to run research software on
their machines to collect information about their security behaviors. This
allowed the researchers to observe how many users changed their password
when their accounts were actually breached in real life. The answer is
that not so many participants did change their passwords (33%), and of
those, many participants didn’t do so for quite a long time after the
breach.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8835359">“Should I Worry?” A Cross-Cultural Examination of Account Security Incident Response</a> <em>Redmiles</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper describes a set of interviews with Facebook users from 5
countries. The interviewers asked participants about how they responded to
notifications from Facebook that their account had a suspicious login.
These notifications tell the user that their account may have been
compromised and then ask them to complete a secondary authentication task,
such as identifying photos of their friends. One finding that particularly
caught my eye was that, when asked what alerted them to the suspicious
login, participants sometimes identified the secondary authentication task
rather than the initial notification. The paper hypothesizes that this may
be due to warning fatigue blinding users to the initial notification.
(Warning fatigue is when users see many warnings and get habituated to
them, ceasing to take action on them.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://lersse-dl.ece.ubc.ca/record/316/files/CHI-17_huh_paper.pdf">I’m too Busy to Reset my LinkedIn Password: On the Effectiveness of Password Reset Emails</a> <em>Huh et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper describes a Mechanical Turk survey of participants who had
received password breach notifications from LinkedIn. For a methodological
contrast, “‘What was that site doing with my Facebook password?’ Designing
Password-Reuse Notifications” asked people what they would do
hypothetically, and “(How) Do People Change Their Passwords After a
Breach?” observed what people actually did (with a slight caveat that
there were some heuristics used to figure out what people actually did
from the available data). In this Huh et al. paper, the researchers asked
people to recall what they did. Each of these methods has its pros and
cons; asking people to recall what they did can suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_bias">recall
bias</a>, though in this case the
authors took some steps to combat this bias by asking participants to
provide screenshots to verify that they had actually received the
notification and changed their password (if applicable). The results
showed a somewhat higher rate of password change (~50%) than other work,
but identified some other themes in common with other work: a substantial
delay before participants took action, and a tendency to choose weak or
related passwords when they did eventually change their password.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://yixinzou.github.io/publications/chi2019-zou.pdf">You ‘Might’ Be Affected: An Empirical Analysis of Readability and Usability Issues in Data Breach Notifications</a> <em>Zou et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper analyzes a dataset of real-world data breach notifications
downloaded from government databases. Most were mailed notifications.
Because I’m mostly interested in experimental results from electronic
notifications, I only skimmed this paper. The paper compiles a list of
best practices and recommendations for notification design (such as using
clear and concise language and highlighting key information visually) as
well as public policy (such as encouraging that notifications are
delivered across multiple channels). These recommendations seem to broadly
make sense, but I would be hesitant to apply them too dogmatically to
computer security warnings without verifying them experimentally.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, there’s a body of adjacent work about vulnerability and
misconfiguration notifications sent to server operators. For example, Durumeric
et al. conducted an experiment notifying 150,000 server operators that their
servers were vulnerable to the Heartbleed vulnerability. I’m more familiar with
this area of research because I’ve done work in it
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/06a75f932595f27a60092007965934c957b5de21.pdf">myself</a>.
My overall impression is that the effectiveness of this type of notifications
varies quite widely depending on the severity and urgency of the issue and the
effort needed to remedy it. Regardless, I view this area as mostly tangential
because I’m particularly interested in after-the-fact warnings for end users,
which is a substantially different population than server operators.</p>



<p>Here’s a collection of questions that I was hoping to find in these papers but
didn’t:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s a bit of an elephant in the room: <strong>is it possible for users to
actually recover once they’ve been compromised?</strong> Most of the work I described
above focuses on getting users to complete a particular action, such as
changing their password to a new, strong, unique password. But what if that’s
not enough? Data may have already been leaked or the account’s integrity
violated. The Redmiles paper (“‘Should I Worry?’”) touches on this issue by
describing follow-up actions that participants performed to verify their
account integrity, such as checking whether any unauthorized messages had been
sent from their account. But I think the research community hasn’t grappled
with what’s involved in truly recovering from an account compromise, and I
could spend a long time meditating on whether it makes sense to do
after-the-fact warnings at all if we don’t know what to tell users to do to
recover. (Also relevant: my colleague Chris Palmer pondering
<a href="https://noncombatant.org/2019/08/24/recoverability/">recoverability</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>How well do antivirus notifications work?</strong> When AV software pops up a
warning that the user has some malware installed, how likely are users to
comprehend the risks and respond effectively? (And, reiterating the elephant
in the room, what does “effectively” even mean in this case?) …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>When I first started programming, especially when asked for code
samples, my comments lacked purpose and would often duplicate in
English what the code clearly indicated. I knew that "commenting is
good" but as a beginner I had no further insight.</p>
<p>Over time with the help of books like Clean Code, I grew disdainful of
comments. Good code should be self-documenting. Whenever I needed to
write a comment to explain something, I'd realize I could easily
rename some key variable or function. I grew more comfortable with
variables and functions with a few words in the title. Better to spend
time on good code structure and naming.</p>
<p>
  I have always left TODOs though, since TODOs can't so easily be
  expressed in variable names. But even these TODOs concerned me
  because they existed in my issue tracker, or maybe should have.
</p><p>As I watched mature open source projects and mature engineers, I came
to value well-documented pull requests. Solid pull requests include or
link to all necessary background, opportunities failed or ignored, how
to use, links to external bugs requiring workarounds and the results
of performance evaluation.</p>
<p>Beyond pull request descriptions, when I really wanted to grease a
pull request I'd use the pull request UI to add comments calling
reviewer attention to key changes in lines of the diff.</p>
<p>Both kinds of guidance are a massive aid to reviewers, saving a lot of
time.</p>
<p>But when I'd find a bug in code -- and I knew there was good pull
request documentation, even for pull requests as recent as six months
ago -- I've been repeatedly failed by the pull request and <em>pull
request comment</em> search exposed by Github and Gitlab.</p>
<p>I <em>knew</em> there were links to documented oddities or bug reports in
pull request threads. But practically speaking, for historic pull
requests, pull request comments are useless.</p>
<p>This is the single biggest reason I've started to push for more
comments in code. More so than all other tools (issue tracker, code
management system, etc.) comments in code have the greatest chance of
still being around and <em>easily searchable</em> if they haven't been
deleted.</p>
<p>
  Don't get me started on pull request documentation in an external
  medium like Slack. It's so rewarding to get or give instant feedback
  on changes on instant messengers, but good luck finding that
  discussion 3 months later.
</p><p>Every time I have to call out a line of code in a pull request, that's
immediate cause for that code to be modified with comments.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn't do this if Github/Gitlab exposed a Google Docs-like
interface for browsing code line by line with links to all pull
request comment threads.</p>
<p>Please reply on Twitter with questions or comments.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The biggest reason to add comments in code (often linking to documented oddities or bug reports) is because it's impossible to search pull request threads historically in every source control management UI I've used.<a href="https://t.co/JlHWfbUH5z">https://t.co/JlHWfbUH5z</a></p>— Phil Eaton (@phil_eaton) <a href="https://twitter.com/phil_eaton/status/1303130504993136642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

I'm your host Lukas Biewald. Jeremy Howard created the Fast.ai course, which is maybe the most popular course to learn machine learning and there are a lot out there. He's also the author of the book Deep Learning for Coders with Fast.ai and PyTorch and in that process, he made the Fast.ai library which lots of people use independently to write deep learning. Before that, he was the CEO and co-founder of Enlitic, an exciting startup that applies deep learning to health care applications. And before that, he was the president of Kaggle, one of the most exciting earliest machine learning companies. I'm super excited to talk to him. So Jeremy, it's nice to talk to you. And in preparing the questions, I realized that every time I've talked to you there have been a few gems that I've remembered that I would never think to ask about. Like one time you told me about how you learned Chinese and another time you gave me Dad parenting advice, very specific advice and it's been actually super helpful. </p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh great. Tell me what Dad parenting advice worked out?</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Well, what you told me was when you change diapers, use a blow dryer to change a really frustrating experience to a really joyful experience and it's like such good advice. I don't know how you.. I guess I can imagine how you thought of it, but it's...</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, yeah, I know they love the whooshing sound, they love the warmth. I'm kind of obsessed about Dad things. So I'm always happy to talk about Dad things. That is this podcast.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Can we start with that? Now that my daughter is eight months old. Do you have any suggestions for her?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh my goodness! Eight months old. You know, it's like the same with any kind of learning. It's all about consistency. So I think that the main thing we did right with Claire was just, you know, this delightful child now is we were just super consistent. Like if we said you can't have X unless you do Y, we would never give her X if she didn't do Y. If you want to take your scooter down to the bottom of the road, you have to carry it back up again. We read this great book that was saying if you're not consistent, it becomes like this thing, it's like a gambler. It's like sometimes you get the thing you want, so you just have to keep trying so that's my number one piece of advice. It's the same with teaching machine learning. We always tell people that tenacity is the most important thing for students. To stick with it, do it every day.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I guess just in the spirit of questions, I'm genuinely curious about, you know, you've built this amazing framework and teaching thing that I think is maybe the most popular and most appreciated framework. I was wondering if you could start by telling me the story of what inspired you to do that and what was the journey to making Fast.ai, the curriculum and Fast.ai, the ML framework.</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>So it was something that my wife Rachel and I started together. Rachel has a math PhD, super technical background, early data scientist and engineer, Uber. I don't. I have just scraped by a philosophy undergrad and have no technical background. But from both of our different directions, we both had this frustration that neural networks in 2012 were super important, clearly going to change the world, but super inaccessible and so we would go to meetups and try to figure out like how do we... Like I knew the basic idea, I'd coded neural networks 20 years ago, but how do you make them really good? There wasn't any open source software at the time for running on GPUs. You know, Dan Seresen's thing was available, but you had to pay for it. There was no source code and we just thought, oh, we've got to change this, because the history of technology leaps has been that it generally increases inequality because the people with resources can access the new technology and then that leads to societal upheaval and a lot of unhappiness. So we thought, well, we should just do what we can. So we thought how are we going to fix this? Basically the goal was, and still is, to be able to use deep learning without requiring any code so that, you know, because the vast majority of the world can't code, we kind of thought, well, to get there, we should, first of all, see what exists right now? Learn how to use it as best as we can ourselves, teach people how to best use it as we can and then make it better, which requires doing research and then turning that into software and then changing the course to teach the hopefully slightly easier version and repeat that again and again for a few years. And so we're kind of in that process.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>That's so interesting. Do you worry that the stuff you're teaching, you're sort of trying to make it obsolete, right? Because you're trying to build higher level abstractions? Like I think one of the things that people really appreciate your course is that it's really clear, in-depth explanations of how these things work. Do you think that that's eventually going to be not necessary or how do you think about that?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, to some extent. I mean, so if you look at the new book and the new course, chapter one starts with really, really foundational stuff around what is a machine learning algorithm? What do we mean to learn an algorithm? What's the difference between traditional programming and machine learning to solve the same problem? And those kinds of basic foundations I think will always be useful, even at the point you're not using any code. I feel like even right now, if somebody is using like PlatformAI or some kind of code-free framework, you still need to understand these basics of an algorithm can only learn based on the data you provide. It's generally not going to be able to extrapolate to patterns it's not seen yet, stuff like that. Um, but yeah, I mean, we have so far released two new courses every year, you know, a part one and part two every year because every year, it's totally out of date. And we always say to our students at the start of part one, Look, you know, none of the details you're learning are going to be of any use in a year or two's time. There's a time when we're doing Piano and then TensorFlow and Keras, and then playing PyTorch. We always say, look, don't worry too much about the software we're using because none of it's still any good, you know, it's goal changing rapidly, you know, faster than JavaScript frameworks, but the concepts are important and yeah, you can pick up a new library and I don't know by weekend, I …</p></div></div>
