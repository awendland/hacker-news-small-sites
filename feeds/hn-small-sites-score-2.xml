I recommend you read it through the lens of “recommending Anki to a friend.” This article is about the problems of giving advice on how to learn.</p>
<h2>Spreading the “gospel” to the world</h2>
<p>If you deeply believe something, along the lines of “if everyone did it, the world would be much better off.” and have tried convincing other people to do that thing, then you will realize it’s almost impossible to change others’ opinions or behaviors.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re not that ambitious to convince everyone, so you start small: you share it with your friends, but then discovered nobody actually cares or realizes its significance. A mild version is like <a href="https://www.deathbulge.com/comics/206">showing your favorite TV show and they don’t care</a>:</p>

<p>My faith in evidence-based learning strategies is informed by my personal experience and <a href="https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/2020-02-25-how-to-learn-about-meta-learning-my-resource-list">my meta-learning list</a>. I wholeheartedly believe Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) like SuperMemo and Anki is the key to effective and efficient learning. If you believe education is the future, then the knowledge about evidence-based learning strategies is one big key to unlocking that future, both individually and collectively.</p>
<h2>“Doing this every day seems very tiring.”</h2>
<p>Two years ago I was doing my Anki reps. One friend glanced over and was interested in what I was doing.</p>

<p>We ate lunch together while I was giving her a little presentation. I talked <em>very enthusiastically</em> about spaced repetition, basic memory science and Anki operations. Of course I had to show her the infamous forgetting curve:</p>

<p>She sounded excited about the possibility of finally mastering a second language. But at one point she was confused:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I hadn’t learned it how could I recall it from memory?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I explained that assessment <strong><em>for</em></strong> learning (testing as a means of learning) is different from assessment <strong><em>of</em></strong> learning (finding out what you’ve learned). The act of “recalling from memory” is itself a learning process. Then I was aware that her confusion was probably due to a common misconception about memory: human memory works like computer memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The functional architecture of how humans forget, remember, and learn is <strong>unlike</strong> the corresponding processes in man-made devices […] We think of ourselves as working like computers, we become prone to assuming that exposing ourselves to information and procedures will lead to storage (i.e., recording) of such information or procedures in our memories—that the information will write itself in one’s memory.</p>
<p>If we think of human memory equals to memory in a computer, we are unlikely to appreciate that retrieving information from our memory increases the subsequent accessibility of that information, while retrieving information from computer memory leaves the status of that information unperturbed. <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780203842539/chapters/10.4324%2F9780203842539-6">On the Symbiosis of Remembering, Forgetting, and Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Side note: this story might give you the impression that I liked to show off what I know. No not really. I like to be convinced with evidence, and I thought others were the same. I was wrong. Also, I included the above quotes for the sake of convincing you, the reader. I didn’t obfuscate the subject matter with phrases like assessment <strong><em>for</em></strong> learning and assessment <strong><em>of</em></strong> learning.</p>
<p>She looked… befuddled. Sort of like this:</p>

<p>I remember I was so excited and nervous at the same time that I was fumbling for words, trying to simplify it as much as I could. In retrospect, I was making things worse.</p>
<p>She’d listen to me quite intently, signaling that she was thinking and trying to figure it out, but I could tell she was still confused. And the more I explained, the deeper the rabbit hole went (like keep clicking hyperlinks in Wikipedia), and the more confused she became, so I stopped talking to stop making the whole situation uncomfortable. The following monologue is how I imagine what she was thinking at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He’s so passionate about this stuff and was so sure of himself that I guess he’s right.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m not really sure what he means. I do want to learn Japanese but the stuff he’s talking about is so confusing…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was indeed interested in the beginning when I asked him, but I don’t really care at this point. I’m just going to pretend I understand and end this whole conversation asap.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will never forget what she said at one point,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Doing this every day seems very tiring.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was like “Yeah…” I never followed up on her progress. I figured if she was truly interested, when she bumped into problem she would ask for my help. As expected, we never talked about it and I never mentioned Anki again.</p>

<p>These has happened countless times. I usually look nonchalant on the outside but dying on the inside. People looked interested (probably due to my enthusiasm and it’s impolite to look otherwise) and then never actually bothered to use Anki. Some would actually try, make a few cards, do the reps for a few days and then say, “I tried and Anki doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>I’m probably over my head, but sometimes it feels like I’m personally attacked, that what I’m saying is not valuable. I understand it’s not true, but it took me years to study the learning science and to gain the experience with Anki/SuperMemo. The fact that they’re dismissing the software feels like they’re dismissing my knowledge and experience.</p>
<h2>The problems of giving advice on how to learn</h2>
<h3>#1. Nobody cares <em>that</em> much, alright?</h3>
<p>When I first discovered Anki I was like, “How come no one around me knows this?! I need to share this to everyone!” So I would tell my friends about Anki but nobody was interested. I’ve introduced Anki to people and every time it’s a very frustrating experience. (Surprise surprise, not SuperMemo. The learning curve of Anki is much lower. What chance do I have if I preached SuperMemo when they even think Anki is too hard to use?)</p>
<p>Update: I was never a missionary and randomly went out my way to tell people about Anki all the time like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://thejenkinscomic.wordpress.com/">Source</a></p>
<p>Very early on I did give unsolicited advice once to my best friend by intentionally bringing up Anki. Then I did bring up Anki on multiple occasions, but only when the opportunity presented itself, like the story above.</p>
<p>People may be interested in how you’ve developed a skill or become fluent in a foreign language, but just not <strong>that</strong> interested. And they certainly don’t expect to be suddenly lectured on how learning and memory work.</p>
<p>I never liked following up to people with questions like “So how’s Anki? Have you used it?” It feels like pushing an agenda to them. Also, since most would not even bother buying and downloading the app, their response is usually, “I forgot about it. I’ll do it later.” and the conversation would end in an awkward tone.</p>
<h3>#2. I’m not sure if I actually want it, alright?</h3>
<p>Sometimes people keep lamenting “I want to learn X or I want to get better grades.” How many times do you hear people say they want to learn a second language? This is like that friend who keeps saying “I want to lose weight”. Probably after all, they’re just lamenting and not yet ready to put in the effort to change.</p>
<p>Trying to convince others to use Anki/SuperMemo is like trying to convince your friends to go to the gym regularly. You can talk about the benefits of exercising/weight-lifting, how good you’ll feel afterwards, how much more productive you’ll be and so on. But nothing will work if they don’t try it in the first place, and it doesn’t help that spaced repetition doesn’t work in the short-term since using Spaced Repetition Software is a life-long pursuit (just as learning is):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This long term focus may explain why explicit spaced repetition is an uncommon studying technique: the pay-off is distant &amp; counterintuitive, the cost of self-control near &amp; vivid. <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">Gwern’s Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>#3. Why are you so hyped about it?</h3>
<p>It’s rare if people could understand and realize the significance and application of Spaced Repetition Software in a casual 10-min chat. It’s not about the complexity (it’s not rocket science after all), but rather it’s about awareness: problems with current learning approaches and how Anki/SuperMemo could solve the problems. In other words, if I don’t see the problems, why bother changing?</p>
<p>I have a friend who was learning German. She copied German vocabulary on one side and the equivalent English on the other in a notebook. I showed her my Korean Anki cards: “Take a look at these beautiful images! Gifs! Sentence cards! Audio clips! Mass Immersion Approach! (Former: All Japanese All The Time (AJATT)), Stephen Krashen’s Input Hypothesis!” Then I had another friend who was studying to become a nurse. I told him about Anki: “Image occlusion for anatomy!” It felt wrong of me to be hiding Anki (<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155">Image Occlusion</a> to be specific) from him. Deep down I want to shove their faces to this table:</p>

<p>I was exaggerating but you get the point: it’s not possible to convey the significance and application of it all in a casual 10-min chat. With the benefit of hindsight, all my attempts could’ve been a lot better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I was so convinced and have so much faith in Spaced Repetition Software that I came off as condescending, giving off the impression like “you don’t know how to study; let me teach you.”</li>
<li>Maybe it’s the bold claims: “You’ll get 2x results with half the study time.” (How many are really true whenever you hear such claim?)</li>
<li>Maybe it’s the situation: all he or she wants is someone to listen about the difficulty of studying, not some real advice or suggestions.</li>

        We are going to skip instructing you on how to add your files for commit in this explanation.
        Let's assume you already know how to do that. If you don't, go read some other tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretend that you already have your files staged for commit and enter <span>git commit</span>
        as many times as you like in the terminal box.

    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitTag-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git tag name</span> will create a new tag named "name".
        Creating tags just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags can be deleted using the command <span>git tag -d name</span> (coming soon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git tag</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.

    <div id="ExplainGitBranch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch name</span> will create a new branch named "name".
        Creating branches just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.

      <p>
        Branches can be deleted using the command <span>git branch -d name</span>.
      </p>

    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git checkout</span> has many uses,
        but the main one is to switch between branches.<br>
        For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch,
        I would type <span>git checkout dev</span>.
        After that, if I do a git commit, notice where it goes. Try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to checking out branches, you can also checkout individual commits. Try it.<br>
        Make a new commit and then type <span>git checkout bb92e0e</span>
        and see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span>, <span>git branch</span>,
        and <span>git checkout</span> commands to your hearts desire
        until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-b-Container">
      <p>
        You can combine <span>git branch</span> and <span>git checkout</span>
        into a single command by typing <span>git checkout -b branchname</span>.
        This will create the branch if it does not already exist and immediately check it out.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitReset-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git reset</span> will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever
        you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit
        that you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work
        on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ref "HEAD^" is usually used together with this command. "HEAD^" means "the commit right
        before HEAD. "HEAD^^" means "two commits before HEAD", and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you must <b>never</b> use <span>git reset</span> to abandon commits
        that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository
        to become out of sync with the origin. Don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRevert-Container">
      <p>
        To undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the
        <span>git reset</span> command. Instead, we have to use <span>git revert</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>git revert</span> will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that
        was done in the commit you want to revert.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitMerge-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git merge</span> will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting
        commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a "fast-forward" method merge.<br>
        To see this happen, checkout the 'ff' branch and then type <span>git merge dev</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRebase-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git rebase</span> will take the commits on this branch and "move" them so that their
        new "base" is at the point you specify.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should pay close attention to the commit IDs of the circles as they move when you do this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git fetch</span> will update all of the "remote tracking branches" in your local repository.
        Remote tracking branches are tagged in grey.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPull-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span>git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span>git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span>git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span>git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPush-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git push</span> will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch
        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitClean-Container">
      <p>
        One simple example of the use of <span>git reset</span> is to completely restore your local repository
        state to that of the origin.<br>
        You can do so by typing <span>git reset origin/master</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this won't delete untracked files, you will have to delete those separately with
        the command <span>git clean -df</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetchRebase-Container">
      <p>
        Below is a situation in which you are working in a local branch that is all your own. You want to receive the latest code

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TORONTO -- 
	Lisa Carr never thought her work would lead to armed threats, a firebombing, a shooting and a conspiracy to kill her.</p>
<p>
	The Carr Law office is in a nondescript strip mall in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. It’s closed now, after the litigation lawyer says police told her they could no longer protect her.</p>
<p>
	She was shuttled to another country where she spent five long months in hiding. Carr has never before told her story, but agreed to meet for an interview as part of a W5 investigation into the shady underbelly of an industry that forced her to give up her business and almost cost her, her life: The tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	Over the last number of years, criminal elements have been battling for lucrative control of the major highways around the Toronto area. It has resulted in more than 50 arsons, multiple shootings and at least four murders.</p>
<p>
	So why is there so much violence over a couple of hundred-dollar tows at the side of the road? Because that one tow can net tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>
	Here’s how it works: The tow truck driver gets a kickback from an unscrupulous auto body shop, which then submits wildly inflated repair fees to an insurance company.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="york police" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954903!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	The insurance industry estimates that fake repair bills tally up to $2 billion a year in Canada. And that’s why Carr was in the crosshairs. She was hired by an insurance company to challenge bogus claims.</p>
<p>
	Over the course of a number of months, Carr’s law firm was the target of increasingly violent attacks. First a firebombing and then her office was set on fire.</p>
<p>
	Months later, in broad daylight, a colleague leaving work had a gun put to her head and was told, “Stop suing our friends.” Shortly after that, again in broad daylight, someone opened fire through the front door of the busy office.</p>
<p>
	Carr says it is incredible no one was struck by the flurry of bullets.</p>
<p>
	“I looked down the hall and I saw my receptionist on her hands and knees surrounded by glass. And one of the other girls came running at me saying, ‘Shots fired, shots fired. Call 911.’”</p>
<p>
	While the violence surrounding the tow truck industry has made headlines in the Greater Toronto Area, the story that has never been told is that York Regional Police (YRP) uncovered a plot to kill Carr.</p>
<p>
	It was such a credible threat that they gave her an hour to pack up her belongings and leave her home. Carr and her husband were then whisked out of the country and spent five months in hiding.</p>
<p>
	Three separate police services – YRP, Toronto Police Service and Ontario Provincial Police – joined forces to launch Project Platinum to investigate the violence associated with the tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	They carried out a series of raids this past spring, which netted dozens of high-powered weapons and led to the arrests of 35 people who face almost 500 charges, including the attempted murder of Carr.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="weapon" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954983!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	Now back in Canada, Carr says police have told her she is likely no longer in danger, but with one caveat.</p>
<p>
	“The police said we believe the risk is low. As long as you don't go back to work, as long as you don't restart the firm,” she says.</p>
<p>
	“So they have effectively ended my career. We lost everything. They won.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>
Vectorization is when you take some minecraft-style raster image and make a crisp vector picture out of it.
    </p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg">
    
    <p>
It's especially useful when you want to turn a satellite photo into a map. Or if you want to scan some blueprint and turn it into a CAD model. Or if you want to reissue an old game and you don't want to redraw all the artwork from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
The algorithm I'm going to show you has nothing to do with all these things. It's a basic vectorization technique which, in its original form, has little to none applications in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
On the plus side, it illustrates the approach rather well. It shows how things like bilinear interpolation, gradient descent, and parametric splines work together to solve a real-world problem. At the very least, it makes learning about all these things a little more compelling.
    </p>

    <h2>
An input image
    </h2>
    <p>
A raster image is essentially a rectangular table of things. If it's a full-color RGB, then it's a table of color pixels. Color pixels are the triplets of 8-bit integer values where each value represents an amount of red, green, and blue color.
    </p>
    <p>
Medical images, such as obtained from computed tomography, are usually the tables of 12-bit or 16-bit integers. It's not a color really since the values come from invisible X-ray radiation, but they are called gray values nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
Satellite images may have a lot of channels. Apart from the colors of the visible specter they may contain ultra-violet and infra-red luminosity. Channels may be represented by integers or floating point values.
    </p>
    <p>
Our image will be a simple gray-scale bitmap.
    </p>
    <canvas id="greyscale_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Technically, we can already turn it into vectors rather easily. Let's just agree on some threshold, and mark the contour of all the pixels that have the values exceeding this threshold.
    </p>
    <canvas id="greyscale_canvas_contour" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Well, it's simple, but it's not what we wanted. We want curves, not corners. And for that, we have to make our image less cornery.
    </p>
    <h2>
<span id="index_image_interpolation">Image interpolation</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
Let's say our image is not a table of values. Let's say we only know the values in the centers of the pixels, and we have to guess the values between them somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
This is called interpolation. The simplest case would be the nearest neighbor interpolation, where for every point on an image, the value is the value from the nearest pixel's center. But this simply turns it back into a table.
    </p>
    <p>
A little more advanced is the <span id="index_bilinear_interpolation">bilinear interpolation</span>. The value is the linear sum of the four neighboring values. It looks like this.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_1">// pixel value with out of bounds checks
function pixel_in(pixels, i, j) {
    if(i &gt;= pixels.length)
        return pixel_in(pixels, pixels.length-1, j);
    if(i &lt; 0)
        return pixel_in(pixels, 0, j);
    if(j &gt;= pixels[0].length)
        return pixel_in(pixels, i, pixels[0].length-1);
    if(j &lt; 0)
        return pixel_in(pixels, i, 0);
    return pixels[i][j];
}

// linear interpolation
function value_in(pixels, x, y) {
    var j = Math.floor(x - 0.5);
    var tj = x - 0.5 - j;
    var i = Math.floor(y - 0.5);
    var ti = y - 0.5 - i;
    return pixel_in(pixels, i, j) * (1 - ti) * (1 - tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i, j+1) * (1 - ti) * (tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i+1, j+1) * (ti) * (tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i+1, j) * (ti) * (1 - tj);
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
If we darken the pixels where the interpolated value meets the threshold, we'll get some kind of a contour.
    </p>
    <canvas id="interpolation_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    
    <p>
There are other methods. Plenty of them. But linear interpolation solves the cornery border problem just fine. Although, the border we see is just the borderline of some threshold. It's not a vector representation yet.
    </p>

    <h2>
Turning an interpolated image into a contour
    </h2>
    <p>
We can borrow an idea from the <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/the_simplest_possible_smooth_contouring_algorithm.html">simplest possible smooth contouring</a> algorithm. We'll build an initial border from the source pixels, and then we'll use our linearly interpolated image to find the best place to put each contour point so the image value will meet the threshold value.
    </p>
    <p>
When you have a <span id="index_distance_field">distance field</span>, it's easy. A distance field is when for any point in space you can tell how far it lies from the surface you want. It's basically a function from point in space to distance.
    </p>
    <p>
You take its gradient, take the difference between the value you have and the threshold value. Since it's the distance field, the value difference is exactly the distance you should move your point for. And the gradient is the exact opposite direction. You just inverse, multiply, add — and you're there.
    </p>
    <p>
Unfortunately, we don't have a distance field. We have a continuous image which only resembles one.
    </p>
    <p>
But the principle still works. If you traverse against the gradient, you will get closer to the threshold value. And the more the difference, the further you have to go. It's just you wouldn't always get there in one try.
    </p>
    <p>
So let's try several times then. Let's make an <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/interactive_introduction_to_iterative_algorithms.html">iterative algorithm</a> out of it.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_2">// gradient
function gradient(pixels, x, y) {
    const eps = 1e-5;
    return [(value_in(pixels, x + eps, y) - value_in(pixels, x, y)) / eps,
            (value_in(pixels, x, y + eps) - value_in(pixels, x, y)) / eps];
}

// how far should you shift the point to meet the isoline
// if value_in were a distance function
function gradient_shift(pixels, threshold, x, y) {
    var g = gradient(pixels, x, y);
    var g_norm = Math.sqrt(g[0]*g[0] + g[1]*g[1]);
    var d = threshold - value_in(pixels, x, y);
    return [g[0] * d / g_norm / g_norm, g[1] * d / g_norm / g_norm];
}

// brings a point closer to the threshold isoline
function fit_point_better(pixels, threshold, point) {
    const ok_error = 1/255;
    if(Math.abs(value_in(pixels, point[0], point[1]) - threshold) &lt; ok_error)
        return point;
    gs = gradient_shift(pixels, threshold, point[0], point[1])
    var new_point = [point[0] + gs[0], point[1] + gs[1]];
    return fit_point_better(pixels, threshold, new_point);
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
We'll move our contour points against the gradient until we're close enough to the threshold
    </p>
    <canvas id="fitting_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
        
    <p>
That's good but we can do better. Let's make the contour smooth.
    </p>

    <h2>
Cubic splines
    </h2>
    <p>
All we have to do to make the contour smooth is to turn each line segment into a parametric cubic curve.
    </p>
    <p>
It's probably sounds more complicated than it is. A parametric cubic curve is just a pair of polynomials. If you have the points and partial derivatives in this points, you can get the coefficients for them from this pair of <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/programmers_introduction_to_linear_equations.html">linear systems</a>:
    </p>
    <div><p>
Px(t<sub>1</sub>)' = 3a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + c = dx<sub>1</sub>/dt
<br>
Px(t<sub>1</sub>) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + d = x<sub>1</sub>
<br>
Px(t<sub>2</sub>) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + d = x<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Px(t<sub>2</sub>)' = 3a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + c = dx<sub>2</sub>/dt
    </p><p>
    
Py(t<sub>1</sub>)' = 3a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + c = dy<sub>1</sub>/dt
<br>
Py(t<sub>1</sub>) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + d = y<sub>1</sub>
<br>
Py(t<sub>2</sub>) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + d = y<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Py(t<sub>2</sub>)' = 3a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + c = dy<sub>2</sub>/dt
    </p></div>
    <p>
The curve itself will then look like this.
    </p>
    <canvas id="cubic_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Even more, since we get to choose the parameter range, we can make it [0..1]. This greatly simplifies our system and makes it really easy to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
Here is the function that makes one array of polynomial coefficients from two pairs of point and tangent values.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_3">// solver specific to [0..1] parametrized splines
function spline_for(p1, p1d, p2, p2d) {
//     A = [
//         [1, 0, 0, 0],
//         [0, 1, 0, 0],
//         [1, 1, 1, 1],
//         [0, 1, 2, 3]];
//     B = [p1, p1d, p2, p2d]
    return [
        p1,
        p1d,
        3*p2 - p2d - 3*p1 - 2*p1d,
        p2d + p1d - 2*p2 + 2*p1
    ];
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
The polynomial is then computed in every <i>t</i> with this function.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_4">// polynomial
function polynomial_in_t(A, t){

So for every line segment with tangents, we can make a parametric polynomial. There is one problem though. We don't have tangents.
    </p>
    <p>
We have the gradient, which is orthogonal to the tangent, but there are two possible tangents in every point. The tangent can be oriented left or right from the gradient.
    </p>
    <p>
But this is solvable. Let's just pick the direction we like and keep it consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
Let the curves that originally come from horizontally oriented segments always have both tangents that way that <i>dx &gt; 0</i>. And the ones that come from vertically oriented segments, will have <i>dy &gt; 0</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
It looks like we have enough parts to assemble an algorithm.
    </p>
    <h2>
Creating splines from the pixels
    </h2>
    <p>
Let's split our vectorization into two parts. First, we'll get points and tangents for every line segment from the pixels. Then we'll turn it all into polynomial splines.
    </p>
    <p>
The function that does the first part looks like this.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_5">function turn_pixels_into_points_and_tangents(pixels, threshold) {
    var points = [];
    var tangents = [];

    // "horizontal" pieces
    for(var i = 0; i &lt;= pixels.length; i += 1) {
        var old_point = [];
        var old_tangent = [];
        for(var j = 0; j &lt;= pixels[0].length; j += 1) {
            // if right, left, top, and bottom pixels have a sign change,
            // there should be a spline there
            var sign_change_on_the_right  =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i-1, j+0) - threshold) *
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j+0) - threshold) &lt; 0;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3377">

<div>
<p>If you were born mid-90’s or earlier, you probably remember being bored. We used to talk to ourselves, play “make believe”, taking walks, listening to records, etc. We learned to entertain ourselves, imagine, and create.</p>
<p>Today, my children and children born into the age of the virtual world have not experienced boredom, at least not in the same way. In a sense, those who grew up in the 24-hour news cycle, with social media have never and will never experience being alone. They’ve rarely experience the <a href="https://austingwalters.com/the-last-free-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sense of freedom</a> that comes from thinking to oneself.</p>
<p>A personal concern, is that children’s personalities appear to develop in the absence of technology. They play with toys and make their world come to life. My two year old believes, with all his heart, that his toys are sentient. That our Roomba has feelings and needs to be “fed”. He’s learning reason, learning to manipulate the world, talking to us, and so much more.</p>
<h2>Tools of Gods</h2>
<p>Throughout all human history technology has been an extension of ourselves. Part of childhood is learning to use and create tools. However, today we don’t need to build tools. With phones, we have near infinite information, entertainment, and communication at our finger tips, we can connect to anyone or anything – instantly. Capture audio, video and picture with a tap. Search our memories with a voice command. Calculate any/all the math equations we can think of, etc. Our technology makes us ever more godlike.</p>
<p>To provide this godlike device to a child is irresponsible. Arguably, even in hands of adults, our devices do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The difference between adults and children, is that children need to <em>learn-to-learn</em>. It’s the most important thing a child can learn. How well a child <em>learns-to-learn </em>will shape their entire life, their potential is defined by how well they can learn. There are several important lessons in learning how to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to self-reflect</li>
<li>Nurturing curiosity</li>
<li>Defining ones goals</li>
<li>Indexing knowledge</li>
<li>Finding motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>There is probably more than goes into learning-to-learn, but that’s a good list for now.</p>
<p>For me, a defining moment was learning to sculpt my character in an effort to find motivation. I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to be. I defined myself and found the motivation I needed, with constant self-reflection to change. Without my time riding bikes, running, playing in the woods, soccer, walking alone, I wouldn’t be who I am today.</p>
<h2>Empathy is Derived from Self</h2>
<p>Having a godlike tool able solve most problems is a double edge sward. A phone is addictive by design. Mobile phones track us and companies learn everything about us, with that information being weaponized against us to maximize “screen time”. Is social media useful? Quite frankly, I’d argue no, social media has a net negative effect. Importantly, social media and games on your mobile device keep you constantly stimulated and often push others agenda(s)[<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>I question if most of the newer generations, born into their environment, have really learned to live in the physical world. Has the newer generation(s) learned to live with and identify themselves? Is there self-reflection and growth? Without an internal dialog, a lot of things break down: personality, autonomy, comfort with being alone, understanding alternative viewpoints… empathy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, [even more concerning] without an internal identity / dialog one doesn’t develop a “classic” ego. If a self-image is typically defined by an internal image and that internal image doesn’t develop, what guides us? Likes? Karma?</p>
<p>This would explain the rise in more extreme moral stances. Such as building a hierarchy based on gender, race, etc. Lack of empathy for others, at the same time garnering more karma, for karma is the value system people can hold themselves to. We no longer need to contemplate who we want to be, because we can receive instant feedback on our actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I suspect this optimizes for short-term gain, but long-term loss to society.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the start of the incredibly destructive cycle, where contemplating or a nuanced opinion is simply not acceptable, because others can’t relate.</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cMYfxOFBBM?start=314" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<blockquote><p>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.</p>
<p>– Robert A. Heinlein</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a firm believer that life is and should be tough. Growth comes from adaptation, confidence is derived from overcoming challenges. When life is tough, you have to create goals and blaze a trail to somewhere better. This is what it means to be “free”, free to have self-determination, which few embrace.</p>
<p>I wasn’t born to my current “class”. I would say, I was born “big-mac” rich, where you could buy a “big-mac” once a month without worrying about budget. My parents provided shelter, food and clothes, but I started mowing lawns at 12 and working a job by 14 to buy anything I needed beyond food and shelter. Yet today, (14 years &amp; a couple kids later), I’d call myself “iPhone” rich, I can buy something of equivalent cost monthly without worrying about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>My wife and I regularly create two and five year plans. These goals provide motivation. We can ask ourselves,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this activity help hit our five year objective?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is no, then it’s probably not worth doing it. We work hard, we reflect regularly and we try to improve; always iterating towards something better.</p>
<p>To have self-determination, people need to think for themselves. They need to contemplate what they want from life. They need to talk to themselves. Self-determination requires goals, it also requires grappling (or ignoring) others and importantly saying “no” and “yes” based on <em>objectives</em> not <em>desires</em>. In the end, this will make people happier.</p>
<p>It all starts with talking to ones-self, spending time alone and deciding what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<h2>A Bleak Outlook</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the god-like tools we’ve all grown accustom to (especially, when given to kids), seem to disrupt the ability to talk to one-self. In a sense, our phones, media, and general virtual world has taken all our time; this leaves us without time for self-reflection, self-thought, self-actualization. In this stunted world, the AI which manipulates our news replaces the ego we once had.</p>
<p>Complex discussions, real empathy, motivation — are going to be something most of us lose. I’m not sure if society is ready for what we created. It’s a mob of people who’ve never experienced real hardship, who’ve learned a social system designed by virtue signaling (aka trying to game the “karma” systems) and not really learning to live in the real world. Then again, these people will be shaping the real world, for better or worse.</p>

, I structured my lessons around primary sources such as the Bitcoin white paper and the Ethereum yellow paper.</p><p>This way, my students learned not only what I know, but also what’s the source of the knowledge. Now that they’re graduated, they know where to look for when they have questions.</p><p>Even though the course was four weeks long for each batch I could not answer some excellent questions in detail. Instead, I had to resort to black boxes.</p><p>How do digital signatures work? A black box.</p><p>What about ZK-STARKs? Another black box.</p><p>Black boxes help to teach a subject. Not so much for understanding in detail.</p><p>To understand Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more on a deeper level, one should know the pillars they are built on.</p><p>You understand the strength of the Bitcoin network when you know how does SHA-256 work.</p><p>You understand how your contracts run once you know the inner-working of the EVM.</p><p>You understand the security of the protocols you invest in when you, well, know a lot.</p><p>Thus, as you understand these subjects, you will realize how important blockchain really is. You will probably want to contribute to these exciting projects.</p><p>The more you will know, the more you will be able to participate in the governance of blockchains.</p><p>What should be the block size?</p><p>What’re your opinions on various layer 2 protocols?</p><p>How can you help us approaching the open questions on scalability?</p><p>All you need to do is to join the conversations, as long as you know about the subject in depth.</p><p>I recently realized that the most technical issues are getting the least participation.</p><p>Then, I decided to create this blog series with the goal of having new voices on the future of blockchain governances.</p><p>New voices that understand the contemporary issues very well.</p><p>This is one of the best things I can do for crypto.</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One bull market to learn the lesson. Second bull market to make retirement money. Third bull market to ask not what crypto can do for you but what you can do for crypto.</p>— Qiao Wang (@QwQiao) <a href="https://twitter.com/QwQiao/status/1299500501604667396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2020</a></blockquote><h2 id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h2><p>The series will demand the reader to be comfortable with computer science papers. In fact, the content will be the papers.</p><p>My job is to curate the papers, explain their contexts in the blockchain space, and clarify them with my reading notes.</p><p>Ultimately, the series will offer a fundamental understanding of blockchain technologies to eager readers, be it economics students or CS professors.</p><h2 id="the-papers">The Papers</h2><p>I’m proud to present you 67 primary sources on the science of blockchains.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="str-vOKpYe5nW" data-connect-field="content"><p>Spreadsheet services like Google Sheets or Airtable have already used by many people, teams, and companies. What makes them more interesting is, they introduce non-tech users to the no-code movement, open doors for interesting possibilities.</p><p>No-code is like Starbuck, a kind of coffee also for people who don’t drink coffee. What great about Starbuck isn’t the taste, but it allows more people to enjoy coffee. In other words, <strong>no-code is a programming language for non-programmers</strong>.</p><p>Recently, I’ve examined using Google Sheet as a database service when integrating to <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finverr.com">Inverr</a> — a no-code builder. It can possibly operate for sites or apps with less than 5M visits/month, with big enough data storage for small apps. Though, it comes with some limitations.</p><p>In this post, I’ll address a few technical issues when using Google Sheets as a database service, its effects, and how to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-search-is-inconvenient">1. Search is Inconvenient</h3><p>The main functions of the database are store, retrieve, and search for data. While Google Sheets is doing excellent at storing and retrieving data, the searching part in Google Sheets is a bit tricky.</p><p>On many apps, search provides discoverability. For example, when you’re building a movie discovery app, users search a movie by name, filter by a category, or popularity. Without search, the movie app is no different than a movie list.</p><p>To use the searching feature, Google Sheets APIs provide a property called “developerMetadata”. It’s an additional data on each cell, and invisible to Google Sheets users. When searching, it will use these additional data.</p><p>“developerMetadata” has a <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fsheets%2Fapi%2Fguides%2Fmetadata%23metadata_storage_limits">limit</a> of 30,000 characters for each spreadsheet. It’s too small to do anything great. Though, you can optimize for sentence, paragraph by only store important terms.</p><h3 id="2-quota-and-storagenbsplimits">2. Quota and Storage&nbsp;Limits</h3><p>Google Sheets has a storage limit at 5,000,000 cells (including blank ones), and up to 256 columns per sheet.</p><p>Let’s take an example as a movie discovery app, it needs at least 6 properties (id, title, description, release date, rating, category). As a rough estimation, you can only store up to 5,000,000 / 6 = <strong>~833k movies</strong>. Since there are currently <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fpressroom%2Fstats%2F">555,913 movies</a> released, in theory, it’s still acceptable.</p><p>Another limitation when using Google Sheet APIs is its request quota. Starting at 500 requests per 100 seconds (or 5 requests per second), and start charging when excessed. In many cases, using proper caching techniques will reduce the number of requests to Google Cloud APIs services.</p><h3 id="3-acceptable-performance-on-a-largenbspdataset">3.

It took around 2 seconds when getting 100k cells all at once, which 100k / 6 = ~16k movies. This is acceptable performance, and grows as the number of cells grows.</p><h3 id="4-no-schema-and-proper-restriction">4. No Schema and Proper Restriction</h3><p>Google Sheets is like a database with its own presentation. For example, you have a spreadsheet for monthly expenses. It contains a list of expenses, their category. And in the end, it can have a <strong>total expense value</strong> by the sum of all expenses in the month.</p><p>The layout freedom is convenient when using it as a spreadsheet, but a nightmare for a database. Because there is always some kind of fixed layout that the database follows. It allows the database engine to calculate the distance and navigate between rows of data. And no database designed without a layout.</p><p>Besides, unless you decided that no-one will ever touch the spreadsheet, someone might accidentally screw it up by renaming the tab or remove it.</p><hr><p>To conclude, Google Sheets is widely used as a tool. But as a database, it comes with some limitations. With proper caching and optimization, it is safe to use it as a database for webs/apps with &lt; 5.000.000 visits monthly.</p><p>Besides, its search limitation can be a huge bottleneck in many scenarios. You can use “developerMetadata” to enable data lookup. With 30k characters limits, it’s a good practice to store only “meta” data.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finverr.com">Try to build a website with Google Sheet, or your own database →</a></p></div></div>]]>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes I would get some interesting questions from my friends about internet security, such as whether it is possible to leak the bank account password when logging to the online bank via an untrusted network, whether it is possible that the message you received from someone via an untrusted network got modified maliciously, and whether it is possible that someone pretends to be you and send messages in your name. My answers to those questions are as long as your computer and cell phone are uncontaminated they are almost impossible thanks to our modern public-key crytosystems and digital signatures.</p>



<p>There are a couple of introductions to the public-key crystosystems and digital signature available online. However, I think most of them are incomplete or hard to understand. In this blog post, I am going to describe the public-key crystosystems and digital signatures using extremely simple math, so that there would be no ambiguity at all.</p>

<h3 id="usages">Usages</h3>

<p>The modern cryptosystems are public-key encryption systems in which everyone has a public-key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public-key is seen by everyone, but the private is only accessible by the owner. The public-key encryption systems could also generate digital signatures which could be used to verify whether the message you received is unmodified and truly sent from the sender.</p>



<p>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a typical algorithm for the public-key cryptosystems used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. However, we are not going to introduce the RSA algorithm in this blog post. Instead, we would describe the public-key cryptosystems and digital signatures at a high level.</p>

<h3 id="essential-features">Essential Features</h3>

<p>Each user has their own encryption and decryption functions, $E$ and $D$, using public-key and private key respectively. We use $M$ to represent the message to be encrypted and sent. There are four features that are essential to a public-key cryptosystem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decrypting an encrypted message gives you the original message (Of course!). Specifically,</li>
</ul><p>

\[D(E(M)) = M\]

</p><ul>
  <li>Encrypting a decrypted message gives you the original message (Hmm…). Specifically,</li>
</ul><p>

\[E(D(M)) = M\]

</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p>$E$ and $D$ are easy to compute. This means the encryption and decryption process should be fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$. This means you could hardly find a way to decrypt the encrypted message, even if you know how to encrypt the message.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We would ignore how to satisfy the four features in this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="message-encryption-and-decryption">Message Encryption and Decryption</h3>

<p>Suppose we have two people, Alice and Bob. Both of them are using the same public-key cryptosystems. This means Alice and Bob both have their private keys stored secretly and have their public key published to some authorities. From the authorities, we could find the public keys of Alice and Bob unambiguously. We denote encrypting the message using Alice and Bob’s public keys to be $E_A$ and $E_B$ respectively, and decrypting the message using Alice and Bob’s private keys to be $D_A$ and $D_B$ respectively.</p>



<p>One day, Alice wanted to send a private message $M$ to Bob. Alice found the public key of Bob, encrypted the message $M$ using Bob’s public key. The encrypted message for Bob is denoted as $C$.</p><p>

\[E_B(M) = C\]

</p><p>Once Bob received the encrypted message $C$, he could decrypt $C$ using his private key.</p><p>

\[D_B(C) = D_B(E_B(M)) = M\]

</p><p>Even if the network was compromised and someone intercepted $C$, it is still almost impossible to decrypt $C$ because of that $D_B$ is unknown and the feature “the publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$” for public-key cryptosystems.</p>



<p>The message content is safe because of the public-key encryption systems. However, it does not provide any assurance about the sender. For example, James could send Bob a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, encrypt it using $E_B$, and send it to Bob. If there is no author verification procedure and Bob is not careful enough, Bob might actually think the message is sent from Alice. In some other scenarios, James might have intercepted the encrypted message $C$ sent out from Alice to Bob, prevented the message transmission to Bob, replaced the original message to $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, encrypt it using $E_B$, and send it to Bob. Bob might also be convinced that the message content $M^\prime$ was actually the original message Alice has sent. Specifically,</p><p>

\[E_B(M^\prime) = C^\prime \\
D_B(C^\prime) = D_B(E_B(M^\prime)) = M^\prime\]

</p><p>Digital signatures, derived from the public-key cryptosystems, are designed to solve these authentication problems.</p>

<h3 id="digital-signatures">Digital Signatures</h3>

<p>In addition to the encrypted message $C$ that Alice sent to Bob, Alice would also have to send her digital signature $S$ to Bob. Namely,</p><p>

\[E_B(D_A(M)) = S\]

</p><p>Alice could find $E_B$ using Bob’s public key and $D_A$ using her private key.</p>



<p>Once Bob received both $S$ and $C$, he could decrypt both $S$ and $C$ using his private key and Alice’s public key. Specially,</p><p>

\[D_B(C) = D_B(E_B(M)) = M \\
E_A(D_B(S)) = E_A(D_B(E_B(D_A(M)))) = E_A((D_A(M))) = M\]

</p><p>We found actually the two decrypted messages from $S$ and $C$ are exactly the same. This is expected if the message was sent from Alice and the content of the message was not modified. Let’s further see what will happen if someone pretends to be Alice to send a message to Bob, or the content of the message has been modified.</p>



<p>James, again, wanted to send Bob a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, or had intercepted an encrypted message $C$ from Alice, blocked it and created a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice. To make the message readable by Bob, James encrypted $M^\prime$ using $E_B$, send the encrypted message $C^\prime$ to Bob.</p><p>

\[E_B(M^\prime) = C^\prime\]

</p><p>Because Bob does not accept any message without a signature, James had to make up a signature. However, because James knew nothing about Alice’s private key, he used a decryption function $D_J$ which is different from Alice’s secrete $D_A$. The signature James generated would be</p><p>

\[E_B(D_J(M^\prime)) = S^\prime\]

</p><p>Once Bob received both $S^\prime$ and $C^\prime$, he could decrypt both $S$ and $C$ using his private key and Alice’s public key as usual. Specially,</p><p>

\[D_B(C^\prime) = D_B(E_B(M^\prime)) = M^\prime \\
E_A(D_B(S^\prime)) = E_A(D_B(E_B(D_J(M^\prime)))) = E_A((D_J(M^\prime))) = M^{\prime\prime}\]

</p><p>In this case, Bob would see the two decrypted messages are not the same. Bob would then realize that there is something unusual happened and he should not trust anything about the message.</p>

<h3 id="hacking-the-public-key-cryptosystems">Hacking the Public-Key Cryptosystems</h3>

<p>As long as the four features of the public-key cryptosystems hold, cracking it is almost impossible. If somedayy, when the almighty quantum computer is available, the feature “the publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$” would be compromised, therefore the modern public-key cryptosystems would no longer be reliable. I may talk about this topic in the future.</p>



<p>There is another way to send fake messages to Bob in name of Alice, without using a quantum computer. If James could somehow crack the account name and password of Alice on the web application, replace the Alice’s public encryption function from $E_A$ to $E_J$, when Bob tried to retrieve Alice’s encryption function, he would get $E_J$ instead of $E_A$. The decryption of signature $S^\prime$ would become $M^\prime$ instead of $M^{\prime\prime}$ then. Concretely,</p><p>

\[E_J(D_B(S^\prime)) = E_J(D_B(E_B(D_J(M^\prime)))) = E_J((D_J(M^\prime))) = M^{\prime}\]

</p><p>In this case the two decrypted messages match. Bob would be convinced that the message is from Alice and it has not been modified.</p>



<p>It should be noted that James was replacing Alice’s public encryption function from $E_A$ to $E_J$, instead of replacing his private decryption function from $D_J$ to $D_A$. In principle, $D_A$ would only be kept on Alice local computer and not anywhere else. Even if James has Alice’s account name and password on the web application, he would not get a copy of $D_A$ unless he specifically hacked Alice’s physical computer.</p>



<p>This reminds us that actually keeping our password safe is the most important.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
	<p>
Floating-point numbers are fine. They are decently designed and well standardized, they provide a good compromise between performance and precision. They work great most of the time. Until the day when they suddenly don't and nobody knows why.
	</p>
	<p>
For me, that day came when I encountered a bug in the Taubin estimator. <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-01-fall/Papers/taubin-smoothing.pdf">Taubin smoothing</a> takes a triangle mesh, a pair of magic numbers called λ and μ, a little time to think, and it makes the input mesh smooth. It also makes sure that the mesh isn't reduced to a perfectly smooth but rather uninteresting sphere or a point.
	</p>
	<p>
The first magic number λ is something between 0 and 1. When it's 0 — nothing happens at all, and when it's 1 — nothing good happens either. It should be somewhere in between. Nobody really knows how to pick this number but an experienced engineer can at least make an educated guess. 
	</p>
	<p>
The second magic number governs shrinkage compensation. It's a negative number slightly greater than λ in its absolute value. Nobody knows how to pick it either but this time even an educated guess is a challenge.
	</p>
	<p>
That's why you need an estimator. Something that picks the μ for you. And we have one. And it was bugged. And I was the one to fix it.
	</p>
	<p>
The first day of the investigation showed that the estimator is in fact entirely correct. The second day of the investigation  showed that the tests covering the bug are correct just as well. The third day of the investigation brought a promising hypothesis that the whole story is just a bad dream and all it takes to solve the mystery is to wake up. The fourth morning killed that hypothesis and left me completely clueless.
	</p>
	<p>
Luckily I have a friend who is smarter than me and he advised to fuzz the input a little and see what happens then. I did. And something happened. The bug didn't go away but the μ changed a lot. Way unproportionally to the small changes in the input. Fascinating!
	</p>
	<p>
We can expect a computation to work with some error. It's fine, we get input data from sensors and they embed some error, to begin with. We print out our finished models, and the printers have some limited precision as well so a small error doesn't upset anyone. It's all good while the error is small. But what if it isn't?
	</p>
	<p>
As it turns out, in my case, a completely correct algorithm had a computational error of about 1. Not 1e-16 or 1e-5 but 1. Just 1. So if you expect your μ to be somewhat close to -0.7, and the estimator says it's 0.3, it is in fact correct. It is still a correct estimation within its error range.
	</p>
	<p>
Correct but entirely useless.
	</p>
	<h2>
Challenge your intuition with a “Guess the Error” game
	</h2>
	<p>
Ok, so it's not the computational error per se that causes trouble but only the unexpected and unpredictable error. Can we predict it though?
	</p>
	<p>
Well, of course, we can. There is a whole field of numerical error analysis for that but let's be honest, most of the time we use our intuition instead. So how good is our intuition exactly?
	</p>
	<p>
I propose a game to find out. Let's take a cubic equation solver. It's a relatively complex computation with a very simple way to validate its precision. We will pick some roots first and then we will generate the cubic equation for these roots. Then we'll make the cubic solver find our roots back through the computation. The difference between the original and the computed value for each root will be our measurable error. This error divided by the original value will be our relative error.
	</p>
	<p>
Here is the exact code for the experiment. It's also <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/blob/master/exp/rational_bounds/rationale/cubic_solver_example.cpp">available on GitHub</a>.
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p>
Now if we pick our roots as 1, 2, and 3, the equation produced will be:
	</p>
	<p>
(x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) = 0
	</p>
	<p>
Expanding the brackets we get this:
	</p>
	<p>
x<sup>3</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup> + 11x - 6 = 0
	</p>
	<p>
And when we run our solver we get:
	</p>
	<p>
x = 1, x = 2, x = 3
	</p>
	<p>
Well, yes. On the equation this simple there is no error whatsoever. The computation works flawlessly. So let's start making it worse.
	</p>
	<h2>Round 1</h2>
	<p>
The slider below lets you pick an interval in the logarithmic scale. The interval may start at 10<sup>-12</sup> and end at 10<sup>12</sup>. It's impossible to predict the exact error up to a single number so you should just pick an appropriate interval that covers the error<span id="shown_note_1"><u onclick="show('note_1')">*</u>.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
Let's say we have the roots of 0.001, 2, 3 000. So to which interval, in your opinion, the maximum relative error for a cubic solver belongs?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_1" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	

	<h2>Round 2</h2>
	<p>
Now let's make our roots even more diverse in magnitude. How about 1e-6, 2, and 3e6?
	</p>
	<p>
Where do you think the error might be?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_2" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	

	<h2>Round 3</h2>
	<p>
And what about 1e-9, 2, and 3e9?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_3" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	
	<h2>Meet the <span id="index_rational_bounds">rational bounds</span></h2>
	<p>
It's not the error per se that is bad. Error is omnipresent. Every measuring device has its error, every 3D printer and every milling machine has its maximal precision. The error is fine.
	</p>
	<p>
It's only the unpredictability that makes it unpleasant.
	</p>
	<p>
People address errors in multiple ways. In metrology, a measured value is supplemented with its absolute error. You don't say that the temperature outside is 10°, you say it's 10° ± 0.5°. This might seem redundant since this is a small error for the weather outside, but in some other context, this very error might become significant. If you're measuring body temperature, a 1-degree difference is enough to tell a sick person from a perfectly healthy one. You can not afford a whole 1-degree error in this scenario.
	</p>
	<p>
If you have this input error written down, you can pull it through your computation to see if the resulting error is still tolerable. To do that, you need to exchange your measured numbers for intervals. A number with error becomes an interval: 10° ± 0.5° becomes [9.5, 10.5]°.
	</p>
	<p>
You can sum these intervals just as you add numbers:
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_4" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
+
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_5" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
=
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_6" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
You can multiply them as well.
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_7" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
×
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_8" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
=
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_9" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
So with intervals, you can accommodate the input error. You can drag it through the computation and see how it plays with other values with their own error. In the end, you will have your computed value within some interval and the size of this interval will indicate the output error. But what about the error of the computation itself?
	</p>
	<p>
A computational error occurs when we can't store the operation result in the same types we keep our operands in and we're forced to throw some data away. Let's say we have Python-style “unlimited” length integers. This means that if our computation only consists of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, we would never face any computational error.
	</p>
	<p>
Of course, with division, things get a little bit different. E. g. we can't store <nobr>16 ¾</nobr> in integers so we have to truncate it into 16. In this case, the whole fractional part becomes our error.
	</p>
	<p>
We can use pairs of integers to represent rational numbers. This will solve the division issue. However, this type of rational number, while does not accumulate errors, accumulates digits. The more digits it has, the slower the computation goes. At some point, it may simply become impractically slow. Just like with the uncontrollable error, uncontrollable size becomes an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
We want a compromise. Some entity that grows error controllably yet still operates in constant speed. And we can get it, for example, by merging two ideas: intervals and rational numbers together.
	</p>
	<p>
Let's say, we want to write a number as an interval of its tenths. We can do that most intuitively by throwing away all the digits after the first one.
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
Just like we can do this with decimal fraction, we can do this with any rational number. We can put it between a pair of rational numbers made by finite integers. In this case, every integer is in the range [0, 1, ..., 99].
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
Ok, this is not entirely true. If the number is greater than 99, then we can't really store it in our tiny rationals but we can say that it's larger than 99 by assigning the 0 divisor to its upper bound. Of course, it's just a dirty hack but let's leave it like that.
	</p>
	<p>
Now if we want to accommodate both input error and computational error, all we have to do is to represent an input interval in its finite rational numbers. A finite rational lower bound of this interval and a finite rational upper bound of the same interval.

	<p>
This entity — a pair of finite rational bounds, represents a real number along with both its input error and representational error. It also grows computational error explicitly while the size of the entity remains constant.
	</p>
	<p>
The implementation example is <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/tree/master/exp/rational_bounds/sketch_in_cpp">available on GitHub</a>. Please note that it's just a proof of concept and not the best possible solution in terms of neither error minimization nor speed.
	</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
The computational error may become a problem at the least appropriate moment. Both rational numbers and intervals are well-known alternatives for floating-point numbers when the error becomes an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
Rational bounds, being a chimeric product of both ideas, let you manage both measurement error and computational error in a coherent way without compromising performance all that much.

As it's the NAT or firewall that opens the destination port, this bypasses any browser-based port restrictions.</p><p>This attack takes advantage of arbitrary control of the data portion of some TCP and UDP packets <i>without</i> including HTTP or other headers; the attack performs this new packet injection technique across all major modern (and older) browsers, and is a modernized version to my original <a target="_blank" href="https://samy.pl/natpin/">NAT Pinning technique from 2010</a> (presented at DEFCON 18 + Black Hat 2010). Additionally, new techniques for local IP address discovery are included.</p><p>This attack requires the NAT/firewall to support ALG (Application Level Gateways), which are mandatory for protocols that can use multiple ports (control channel + data channel) such as SIP and H323 (VoIP protocols), FTP, IRC DCC, etc.</p><div>

<ul>
<li>some browsers (Chrome) only divulge the local IP via WebRTC over HTTPS but some of our attacks require HTTP so we first redirect to the HTTPS version of the attack software to extract the local IP</li>
<li>we then redirect to the HTTP version with the local IP included in the URL if we were able to obtain it to bypass other cross-origin protection mechanisms (the <code>.local</code> mDNS/Bonjour address presented will not be useful for the attack)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>large UDP beacon sent from browser via WebRTC TURN authentication mechanism to non-standard port to attacker's server to force IP fragmentation with TURN <code>username</code> field stuffed

<li>POST data is "stuffed" to exact TCP segment size / packet boundary, then “SIP packet” appended and posted via web form</li>
<li><b>victim IP stack breaks the POST into multiple TCP packets, leaving the "SIP packet" (as part of POST data) in its own TCP packet without any accompanying HTTP headers</b></li>
<li>if browser alters size of multipart/form boundary (Firefox) or packet size changes for any other reason, size change is communicated back to client and client auto-resends with new size</li>
<li>when opening UDP port, SIP packet is sent over TURN protocol inside specially crafted <code>username</code> field forcing IP fragmentation and precise boundary control</li>
</ul></li>
<li>victim NAT sees proper SIP REGISTER packet on SIP port (with no HTTP data), triggering ALG to open any TCP/UDP port defined in packet back to victim
<ul>
<li>victim NAT rewrites SIP packet, replacing internal IP with public IP, hinting to attacker exploit was successful</li>
<li>even if victim NAT normally rewrites source ports, the ALG will still be forced to port forward to the attacker's port of choice as it believes victim machine opened that port and attacker sees new source port in arriving SIP packet </li>

</ul></li>
<li><i>to investigate...perhaps by you?</i>
<ul>
  <li>non-malicious usage: this technique essentially gives browsers full TCP and UDP socket capability to communicate to any protocol locally on the system; the connection can be abstracted through a cloud server that connects back but the browser just talks to the cloud server as if it's the socket and makes browsers much more powerful to communicate on non-web-friendly protocols</li>
  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>
  <li>IP fragmentation allows full control of all data in the IP data section, meaning full control of the <b>UDP header</b>, including source/dest ports in the overflowed packet...what else could this abuse?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting desination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia ala Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Application-level_gateway">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>In the context of computer networking, an application-level 
gateway consists of a security component that augments a 
firewall or NAT employed in a computer network. It allows 
customized NAT traversal filters to be plugged into the 
gateway to support address and port translation for certain 
application layer "control/data" protocols such as FTP, 
BitTorrent, SIP, RTSP, file transfer in IM applications, etc. 
In order for these protocols to work through NAT or a 
firewall, either the application has to know about an address/
port number combination that allows incoming packets, or the 
NAT has to monitor the control traffic and open up port 
mappings (firewall pinhole) dynamically as required. 
Legitimate application data can thus be passed through the 
security checks of the firewall or NAT that would have 
otherwise restricted the traffic for not meeting its limited 
filter criteria.</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="router-investigation--firmware-dumping">Router Investigation / Firmware Dumping</h2>

<p>I'd first like to see how common gateways actually treat packets and multi-port protocols like FTP, SIP, etc. To do this, we’ll want to reverse engineer the firmware from common routers. We could dump the flash from physical routers, however if we can get unencrypted firmware from the manufacturers, we’ll be able to investigate more router models and much faster.</p>

<p>We'll start with a common router, the Netgear Nighthawk R7000. A <a target="_blank" href="http://bfy.tw/NjZh">quick search</a> helps us …</p></div></div>

              <p>Whether you’re using logistic regression or a neural network, all models require data in order to be trained, tested, and deployed. Managing and creating the data sets used for these models requires lots of time and space, and can quickly become muddled due to multiple users altering and updating the data.</p><p>This can lead to unexpected outcomes as data scientists continue to release new versions of the models but test against different data sets. Many data scientists could be training and developing models on the same few sets of training data. This could lead to many subtle changes being made to the data set, which can lead to unexpected outcomes once the models are deployed.</p><p>This blog post discusses the many challenges that come with managing data, and provides an overview of the <strong>top tools for machine learning and data version control</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png" alt="Summary Comparison Table" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 1000w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 1600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 1897w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Summary Table - read further for a more detailed comparison</figcaption></figure><p>Managing data sets and tables for data science and machine learning models requires a significant time investment from data scientists and engineers. Everything from managing storage, versions of data, and access require a lot of manual intervention.</p><h2 id="storage-space">Storage Space</h2><p>Training data can take up a significant amount of space on Git repositories. This is because Git was developed to track changes in text files, not large binary files. So if a team's training data sets involve large audio or video files, this can cause a lot of problems downstream. Each change to the training data set will often result in a duplicated data set in the repositories’ history. This not only creates a large repository but also makes cloning and rebasing very slow.</p><h2 id="data-versioning-management">Data Versioning Management</h2><p>When trying to manage versions, whether it be code or UIs, there is a widespread tendency— even among techies—to “manage versions,” by adding a version number or word to the end of a file name. In the context of data, this means a project might include data.csv, data_v1.csv, data_v2.csv, data_v3_finalversion.csv, etc. This bad habit is beyond cliché, with most developers, data scientists, and UI experts in fact starting out<em> </em>with bad versioning habits.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Nine Eight Seven" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@steve_j?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Steve Johnson</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="multiple-users">Multiple Users</h2><p>When working in a production environment, one of the greatest challenges is dealing with other data scientists. If you’re not using some form of version control in a collaborative environment, files will get deleted, altered, and moved; and you will never know who did what. In addition, it will be difficult to revert your data to its original state. This is one of the biggest obstacles when it comes to managing models and datasets.</p><p>Data versioning is one of the keys to automating a team's machine learning model development. While it can be very complicated if your team attempts to develop its own system to manage the process, this doesn’t need to be the case.</p><p>Let’s explore six great, open source tools your team can use to simplify data management and versioning.</p><h2 id="dvc">DVC</h2><p><a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a>, or Data Version Control, is one of many available open-source tools to help simplify your data science and machine learning projects. The tool takes a Git approach in that it provides a simple command line that can be set up with a few simple steps. DVC doesn’t just focus on data versioning, as its name suggests. It also helps teams manage their pipelines and machine learning models. In the end, DVC will help improve your team's consistency and the <a href="https://thegradient.pub/independently-reproducible-machine-learning/">reproducibility of your models</a>.</p><h3 id="pros">Pros</h3><ul><li>Lightweight, open-source, and usable across all major cloud platforms and storage types.</li><li>Flexible, format and framework agnostic, and easy to implement.</li></ul><h3 id="cons">Cons</h3><ul><li>DVC version control is tightly coupled with pipeline management. This means if your team is already using another data pipeline tool, there will be redundancy.</li><li>DVC is lightweight, which means your team might need to manually develop extra features to make it easy to use.</li></ul><h2 id="delta-lake">Delta Lake</h2><p><a href="https://delta.io/">Delta Lake</a> is an open-source storage layer to help improve data lakes. It does so by providing ACID transactions, data versioning, metadata management, and managing data versions.</p><p>The tool is closer to a data lake abstraction layer, filling in the gaps where most data lakes are limited.</p><h3 id="pros-1">Pros</h3><ul><li>Offers many features that might not be included in your current data storage system, such as ACID transactions or effective metadata management.</li><li>Reduces the need for hands-on data version management and dealing with other data issues, allowing developers to focus on building products on top of their data lakes instead.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-1">Cons</h3><ul><li>Delta Lake is often overkill for most projects as it was developed to operate on Spark and on big data.</li><li>Requires using a dedicated data format which means it is less flexible and not agnostic to your current formats.</li><li>Tool’s primary purpose is to act more like a data abstraction layer, which might not be what your team needs and can detour developers in need of a lighter solution.</li></ul><h2 id="git-lfs">Git LFS</h2><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs">Git LFS</a> is an extension of Git developed by a number of open-source contributors. The software aims to eliminate large files that may be added into your repository (e.g., photos and data sets) by using pointers instead.</p><p>The pointers are lighter weight and point to the LFS store. Thus when you push your repo into the main repository, it doesn’t take long to update and doesn’t take up too much space.</p><p>This is a very lightweight option when it comes to managing data.</p><h3 id="pros-2">Pros</h3><ul><li>Integrates easily into most companies' development workflows.</li><li>Utilizes the same permissions as the Git repository so there is no need for additional permission management.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-2">Cons</h3><ul><li>Git LFS requires dedicated servers for storing your data. This, in turn, eventually leads to your data science teams being locked in as well as increased engineering work.</li><li>Git LFS servers are not meant to scale, unlike DVC, which stores data into a more general easy-to-scale object storage like S3.</li><li>Very specific and may require using a number of other tools for other steps of the data science workflow.</li></ul><h2 id="pachyderm">Pachyderm</h2><p><a href="https://pachyderm.io/">Pachyderm </a>is one of the few data science platforms on this list. Pachyderm’s aim is to create a platform that makes it easy to reproduce the results of machine learning models by managing the entire data workflow. In this regard, Pachyderm is “the Docker of data.”</p><p>Pachyderm leverages Docker containers to package up your execution environment. This makes it easy to reproduce the same output. The combination of both versioned data and Docker makes it easy for data scientists and DevOps teams to deploy models and ensure their consistency.</p><p>Pachyderm has committed itself to its <a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/dsbor/">Data Science Bill of Rights</a>, which outlines the product’s main goals: reproducibility, data provenance, collaboration, incrementality, and autonomy, and infrastructure abstraction.</p><p>These pillars drive many of its features and allow teams to take full advantage of the tool.</p><h3 id="pros-3">Pros</h3><ul><li>Based on containers, which makes your data environments portable and easy to migrate to different cloud providers.</li><li>Robust and can scale from relativity small to very large systems.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-3">Cons</h3><ul><li>More of a learning curve due to so many moving parts, such as the Kubernetes server required to manage Pachyderm’s free version.</li><li>With all the various technical components, it can be difficult to integrate Pachyderm into a company’s existing infrastructure.</li></ul><h2 id="dolt">Dolt</h2><p><a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/tutorials/installation/">Dolt</a> is a unique solution as far as data versioning goes. Unlike some of the other options presented that simply version data, Dolt is a database.</p><p>Dolt is an SQL database with Git-style versioning. Unlike Git, where you version files, Dolt versions tables. This means you can update and change data without worrying about losing the changes.</p><p>While the app is still new, there are plans to make it 100% Git- and MySQL-compatible in the near future.</p><h3 id="pros-4">Pros</h3><ul><li>Lightweight and partially open source.</li><li>SQL interface, making it more accessible for data analysts compared to more obscure options.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-4">Cons</h3><ul><li>Dolt is still a maturing product in comparison to other database versioning options.</li><li>Dolt is a DB, which means you must migrate your data into Dolt in order to get the benefits.</li><li>Built for versioning tables. That means that it won’t cover other types of data (e.g images, freeform text).</li></ul><h2 id="lakefs">LakeFS</h2><p><a href="https://lakefs.io/">LakeFS</a> lets teams build repeatable, atomic, and versioned data lake operations. It's a newcomer on this scene, but it packs a punch. It provides a Git-like branching and version control model that is meant to work with your data lake, scaling to Petabytes of data.</p><p>Similar to Delta Lake, it provides ACID compliance to your data lake.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <article>
<p>It’s halloween and time for another Gleam release! This time it’s an extra
special release as it also includes the first version of <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/otp">Gleam’s type safe
actor system</a>, compatible with Erlang’s OTP.</p>

<h2 id="mutual-recursion">Mutual recursion</h2>

<p>Historically functions in Gleam had to be defined in a module prior to being used.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>helper</span><span>()</span> <span>// Compile error! Function `helper` not found</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>helper</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>0</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has proven to be an annoyance as even though our code <em>should</em> compile
(all the required functions have been defined in the module) the compiler
won’t succeed unless we carefully maintain a specific order of functions in
the module.</p>

<p>This limitation also forced the programmer to write any helper functions at
the top of the file, before the functions that make use of them. Many people
like to write their code in the opposite order with their entry-point at the
top (such as a <code>main</code> function), and then helper functions below. That way
the module reads top-to-bottom, introducing new functions in the order they
are used.</p>

<p>Lastly it also meant that two functions could not call each other, making
useful techniques such as mutual recursion impossible.</p>

<p>With this release statements in a module can be written in any order, and
they still don’t require any type annotations to be fully type checked.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>barry</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"To you!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>paul</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>paul</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"To me!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>barry</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s the only major change to the language this time. For a full list of
changes see the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0120-rc4---2020-10-31.">compiler changelog</a>.</p>

<p>Next up, Gleam’s new type safe actor system!</p>

<h2 id="gleam-otp">Gleam OTP</h2>

<p>Gleam’s actor system is built with a few primary goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full type safety of actors and messages.</li>
  <li>Be compatible with Erlang’s OTP actor framework.</li>
  <li>Provide fault tolerance and self-healing through supervisors.</li>
  <li>Have equivalent performance to Erlang’s OTP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two notable non-goals are that we are not explicitly supporting the BEAM’s
hot code upgrades, and we do not provide type safety for distributed
computing where two BEAM nodes on different computers send messages to each
other.</p>

<p>The core concepts of Gleam OTP are processes, channels, actors, and
supervisors. Let’s take a look at each of them.</p>

<h3 id="processes">Processes</h3>

<p>The core concurrency primitive in Gleam OTP is the process, which is a
lightweight green thread implemented by the BEAM virtual machine. These
processes are extremely cheap to create and run, and a single BEAM instance
can happily run millions of processes at the same time. It’s highly
sophisticated preemptive scheduler will ensure they make full use of all the
cores of the CPU, and no malicious or buggy process can block others from
running.</p>

<p>There’s a wealth of information online about the BEAM’s processes so we won’t
cover it all here, but know that Gleam’s actor system performs well thanks to
decades of excellent work by the Erlang community.</p>

<p>Use processes in Gleam we import the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/"><code>gleam/otp/process</code></a> module which
provides functions for creating and working with them.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>process</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the new process!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>

  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the parent process!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this code snippet we create a new process using the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#start"><code>process.start</code></a> function, before printing a message to
the console.</p>

<p>The newly created process also prints a message, but because the two
processes run asynchronously (and likely run on different CPU cores) we don’t
know which will be printed first. It could be the new one first, or it could
be the parent, and it could be different each time the program runs.</p>

<p>One important thing to note is that there’s no need for an <code>async/await</code>
syntax or callbacks. Asynchronous code in Gleam looks exactly the same to
regular synchronous code and doesn’t require any special types such as
futures or promises.</p>

<p>This should hopefully feel familiar to people familiar with concurrent
programming in languages such as Erlang, Elixir, and Go.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>It’s not good enough to merely be able to create processes, we need processes
to be able to communicate and cooperate. Erlang and Gleam don’t have mutable
state so locks and shared mutable state is not an option- instead Gleam uses
channels.</p>

<p>Channels allow one process to send a message to another in a type safe
fashion, and they may be familiar to Go and Rust programmers.</p>

<p>A channel is made of a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#Sender"><code>Sender</code></a>, which messages as sent into,
and a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#Receiver"><code>Receiver</code></a>, which messages are pulled out of by the
channel owner process.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>process</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Create a new channel owned by the current process</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>receiver</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.new_channel</span><span>()</span>

  <span>process</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the new process!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>// Send a message to the parent process</span>
    <span>process</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>"Done"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>

  <span>// Receive a message from the child, waiting up to 100ms</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.receive</span><span>(</span><span>receiver</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>// This returns Ok("Done")</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the parent process!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the code has been updated to use a channel to coordinate the processes.
The parent process creates a channel and waits for the child to send a
message over the channel before printing. Because of this we know that the
child process will now always print to the console before the parent does.</p>

<p>Here we’re just using a simple string message to synchronize processes but
any type we want can be sent over channel, enabling sharing of data in
concurrent programs.</p>

<p>The Gleam compiler can full type check channels. Because the message sent
with the sender is a <code>String</code> the compiler knows messages pulled from the
receiver must also be strings and will print a helpful error with any program
that doesn’t use these messages correctly.</p>

<h3 id="actors">Actors</h3>

<p>In programs written in Erlang using OTP we tend to not use raw processes
frequently, instead we use a higher level abstraction called <code>gen_server</code>
that builds upon a process to provide additional features making it more
suited to being used in a long-lived Erlang application. Gleam is similar,
though our higher level abstraction is called <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/actor/"><code>actor</code></a> and
differs in design to <code>gen_server</code> in order to provide type safety.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>actor</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>Sender</span><span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Message</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Request</span><span>(</span><span>reply_channel</span><span>:</span> <span>Sender</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>actor</span> <span>=</span> <span>actor</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>handle_message</span><span>)</span>

  <span>// Send a message to the child and wait for a response</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.call</span><span>(</span><span>actor</span><span>,</span> <span>Request</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>// This returns Ok("Done")</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the parent process!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>handle_message</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>:</span> <span>Message</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"The actor got a message"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>.reply_channel</span><span>,</span> <span>"Done"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>actor</span><span>.Continue</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the code has been adapted to use an actor rather than a low-level
process, and instead of explicitly creating a new channel we use the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#call"><code>call</code></a> function. This function is similar to Erlang’s
<code>gen_server:call</code> in that it provides a way to send a message to a process
and then wait until a reply is received.</p>

<p>Since an actor is being used here rather than a raw process it doesn’t shut
down after running the function once, instead the handler function is called
once per message received and the actor continues to run until either it is
requested to shut down or it returns <code>actor.Stop</code> from its handler function.</p>

<p>Any of OTP’s debug or system messages sent to the actor are automatically
handled by the actor implementation, while they would need to be manually
handled when using a raw process.</p>

<h3 id="supervisors">Supervisors</h3>

<p>Supervisors are special actors that start other actors and then monitor them
to ensure they are healthy. If one of the children crashes the supervisor
restarts it along with any younger children, restoring the program to a
healthy state now that any transient problems have ended.</p>

<p>If the problem is not transient and the child continues to crash then the
supervisor will shut down and then the supervisor’s supervisor can attempt a
restart now that more possibly invalid or corrupt state has been reset.</p>

<p>By using this supervision functionality OTP applications can achieve high
reliability by shedding state in an incremental fashion until the program
self-heals. This is kind-of similar to how Kubernetes and other container
orchestrators handle failure in microservices, though faster and more precise
thanks to it being integrated at all levels of the program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>supervisor</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>add</span><span>,</span> <span>returning</span><span>,</span> <span>worker</span><span>}</span>
<span>import</span> <span>my_app</span><span>/</span><span>monitoring</span>
<span>import</span> <span>my_app</span><span>/</span><span>database</span>
<span>import</span> <span>my_app</span><span>/</span><span>web</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>supervisor</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>children</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>children</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>worker</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>.start</span><span>))</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>worker</span><span>(</span><span>monitoring</span><span>.start</span><span>))</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>worker</span><span>(</span><span>web</span><span>.start</span><span>))</span>
  <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we have a supervisor for a pretend Gleam web application. It has 3
children of the type <code>worker</code>, a database connection, an actor responsible
for monitoring, and a HTTP handling actor. If we were adding a supervisor
child we could use the <code>supervisor</code> function instead of <code>worker</code>.</p>

<h3 id="going-forward">Going forward</h3>

<p>Gleam OTP v0.1 is the result of approaching 2 years of research and
implementation, mostly focusing on how to strike a good balance between type
safety and compatibility with existing Erlang OTP patterns.</p>

<p>Rather than build on top of Erlang’s <code>supervisor</code> and <code>gen_server</code> Gleam OTP
has a small core written in Erlang which implements the <code>Receiver</code> half of
channels, and the rest is implemented in Gleam. Thanks to this we can have
greater confidence in the viability of the core abstractions as they have
been sufficient to implement the rest of Gleam OTP in a type safe fashion.</p>

<p>These APIs (particularly supervisor) are experimental and open to breaking
changes as we discover new ways to improve them, but we’ve reach a point
where we can start writing programs using it.</p>

<p>If you write something using Gleam OTP please do get in touch and let us know
how you find it!</p>

<h2 id="discord-chat">Discord chat</h2>

<p>Lastly, we’ve got a new home for the community! The Gleam IRC channel has
been replaced by the Gleam Discord chat server to great success. Since
opening we’ve seen a big increase in activity and lots of new exciting Gleam</p></article></article></div>

<section>
	<h2>WorldWideWeb</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The idea of hypertext preceded the World Wide Web by decades. But nearly all hypertext systems worked on local files. Tim Berners-Lee wanted to create a system that would work across networks so that people could link from a file on one machine to another file on another machine.</p>
		<p>WorldWideWeb wasn't just a programme for browsing files. It was a browser and editor. The introductory text reads:</p>
		<blockquote>HyperMedia Browser/Editor, An excercise in global information availability by Tim Berners-Lee</blockquote>
		<p>Today it's hard to imagine that web browsers might also be used to create web pages. It turned out that people were quite happy to write HTML by hand—something that Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues never expected. They thought that some kind of user interface would be needed for making web pages and links. That's what the WorldWideWeb browser provided. You could open a document in one window and "mark" it. Then, in a document in another window, you could create a link to the marked page.</p>
		<p>You'll notice as you use the WorldWideWeb browser that you need to double-click links to open them. That's because a single click was used for editing.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Browsing</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The user interface of the WorldWideWeb browser somewhat blurred the lines between documents on your own computer and documents out on the network. To "browse" directly to a document out on the network, you need to know its URL. But you can't simply type that URL into an address bar; there is no address bar. Instead you have to follow a sequence of steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Document".</li>
			<li>Now from the newly-opened "Document" menu, select "Open from full document reference".</li>
			<li>Type the URL into the field marked "reference".</li>
			<li>Press the "Open" button</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a web-based document (or web page, as we would say today) open in WorldWideWeb, you can navigate by double-clicking on links. Every link you double-click will open in a new window.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Linking</h2>
	<div>
		<p>At its heart, WorldWideWeb is a word processor …but with links. And just as you <em>can</em> use a word processor purely for reading documents, the real fun comes when you write your own. Especially when you throw hyperlinks into the mix.</p>
		<p>To create a document:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "New File..."</li>
			<li>Type the name of the file you want to create e.g. example.html</li>
			<li>In the boilerplate document, click on the heading to edit. Same with the text.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a document written, it's time to turn from regular text into <em>hyper</em>text:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Links"</li>
			<li>To link to another document, you need to have that other document open in another window. Click on its title bar to focus it.</li>
			<li>With that document in focus, select "Mark all" from the "Links" menu.</li>
			<li>Now switch back to your example.html document and highlight the text you want to be a link.</li>
			<li>From the "Links" menu, select "Link to marked".</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can even save your new document on to your hard drive. Click on "Save a copy offline" under the "Documents" menu.</p>
		<p>Once you've downloaded the file to your computer, you can open it up with a text editor to see what the HTML would have looked like.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<div>
	<p>To edit any document, whether it's one you created, or a page on the world wide web:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the text you want edit.</li>
		<li>Edit it.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's it.</p>
	<p>If you want to keep a copy of the edited document, choose "Save a copy offline" from the "Documents" menu.</p>
	</div>

<p>
Computers used to be fun. Programming felt magical – it gave you the
ability to create something out of nothing. Over the last few decades, personal
computers have become increasingly impersonal, and programming has lost much of
that magic.
</p>
<p>
But some still recognize that programming can be a creative endeavor, undertaken
for its own sake. In fact, there are thriving communities working to create
elegant, empowering tools for the next generation of tinkerers. In this article,
I want to highlight some of my favorite projects that are working to bring magic
back to programming.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" rel="nofollow">PICO-8</a>
is a <i>fantasy console</i> – an emulator for a Commodore 64-era computer
that never existed. You can just boot it up and start typing in commands from
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=manual" rel="nofollow">the manual</a>.
PICO-8 is perfect for people who are new to programming, and its constraints make
it a fun challenge even for experienced programmers.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://pharo.org/" rel="nofollow">Pharo</a>
is a living descendant of the legendary Smalltalk-80 system. Describing it as a
programming language would be inadequate – it's like a world inside a
computer. Pharo is expansive, yet playing around in it feels cozy. Spending a
few weekends with this environment has enriched my appreciation for what
programming can be.
</p>
<p>
Few things are more satisfying than bootstrapping an entire programming language
from scratch.
<a href="https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth" rel="nofollow">Jonesforth</a>
is a complete
implementation of the Forth programming language in
<a href="https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/blob/master/jonesforth.S" rel="nofollow">a couple thousand lines of thoroughly commented assembly code</a>.
Forth sits somewhere in the space between genius and insanity. It's weird and
beautiful, and well worth tinkering with.
</p>
<p>
If you want to go a level deeper, Andreas Kling is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasKling/videos" rel="nofollow">documenting the process of building an entire operating system in C++</a>.
His videos about
<a href="http://serenityos.org/" rel="nofollow">SerenityOS</a>
show just how much work goes into building an operating system – but also
demonstrate that such a feat is remarkably achievable.
</p>
<p>
Modern computers are complicated, but the principles behind them don't have to
be.
<a href="https://eater.net/" rel="nofollow">Ben Eater's</a>
video series in which he
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&amp;list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU" rel="nofollow">builds his own computer on a breadboard</a>
is a must watch, even if you're not planning to follow along yourself. He
explains the process so elegantly that it almost seems obvious.
</p>
<p>
But you don't need an interest in electronics or operating systems to enjoy
programming. Web development has a reputation for being needlessly obtuse, but
at its best, the Web is one of the most amazing technologies we have. It lets
you create something that anyone, anywhere can start using the moment you put it
out there just by clicking a link.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://glitch.com/" rel="nofollow">Glitch</a>
boils Web development down to its basics. With one button click, you get your own
little server on the web where you can build anything you want. There's no
deployment, source control or build pipelines – just code.
</p>
<p>
And the
<a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/" rel="nofollow">Small Web</a>
is home to hundreds of little communities, existing outside the big bubble of
commercial social media. If you want your own space on the Web, there's
<a href="https://neocities.org/" rel="nofollow">Neocities</a>,
<a href="http://tilde.club/" rel="nofollow">tilde.club</a>
and
<a href="https://special.fish/" rel="nofollow">Special Fish</a>
to name a few. Why should you have to sell your data just because you want to
connect with people?
</p>
<hr>
<p>
If programming is getting stale, I encourage you to check out some of the
projects on this list. Try to create something unoriginal, useless and
unfinished – and have fun doing it. You don't need a reason to write a
program or build a website. It's okay to create something just because it's
fun to create.

Programming can still be magical.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>Many applications are automatically tested on each commit inside a GitLab pipeline. If your application relies on a database such as PostgreSQL, it can be tempting to use an in-memory database such as H2 for tests because it is easier to set up and destroy for each execution of your test suite. While this works for simple applications, it is no longer possible once you rely on vendor-specific SQL features (e.g., usage of column types not available in H2).</strong></p><p><strong>In this article, I will demonstrate how you can easily set up PostgreSQL in your GitLab pipeline for Spring Boot applications and improve the quality of your unit and integration tests.</strong></p><h3>Setting Up PostgreSQL in your .gitlab-ci.yml</h3><p>Gitlab allows the definition of (network accessible) <em>services</em> that are linked to your application containers when the pipeline is executed. Databases are perfect examples of such services. They are defined in the <code>services:</code> section of your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">services:

The service can be accessed by its image name (where everything after the : is stripped): <code>postgres</code>.</p><p>The database credentials can be defined using the <code>variables:</code> section:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">variables:
  POSTGRES_DB: my_database
  POSTGRES_USER: bernhard
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "somepassword"
  POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: trust</pre><h3>Configure your application to use the database</h3><p>You can connect to the database the same way you would connect to any database on a network. In Spring Boot, it is best practice to define the database connection via your <code>application.properties</code> file or directly via environment variables.</p><p>For the above credentials, your configuration would look like this:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/my_database
spring.datasource.username=bernhard
spring.datasource.password=somepassword</pre><p>As stated above, the host name of your database service is <code>postgres</code>, which is why your jdbc connection string connects to <code>postgres:5432</code> (which is the default port of PostgreSQL).</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Yes, it is really that easy to use a real PostgreSQL database in your unit and integration test pipeline. By matching the exact database version that is also used in production, you can avoid many subtle errors that may not be apparent when relying on an in-memory database.</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions or whether you found this useful in the comments section.</p></div></div>]]>

  <time datetime="2020-10-30T00:00:00+00:00">30 Oct 2020</time>
  <p><em>Credits: The solution described in this post is based on <a href="https://github.com/alexeagle">Alex Eagle</a>’s suggestion in: <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/issues/773">https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/issues/773</a></em></p>

<p>While migrating the Nexar backend mono-repo to use Bazel as our main build-system I encountered a particularly painful challenge of compiling Go packages with C dependencies, such as <a href="http://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go">confluent-go-kafka</a> or <a href="https://github.com/paulsmith/gogeos">libgeos</a>. For others who will hit this issue, this will be a short and practical post showing what I finally came up with.</p>

<h3 id="first-try-let-gazelle-figure-things-out">First try: let Gazelle figure things out</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle">Gazelle</a>  is a really great project from the Bazel community that helps us automatically generate BUILD files for our Golang Bazel projects. It can look at our <code>go.mod</code> files that describe our external dependencies and translate them for us into <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go">rules_go</a>’s <code>go_repository</code> invocations that will fetch external dependencies into our WORKSPACE and create a BUILD file for them. For 99% of our mono-repo’s dependencies this worked smoothly; all we had to do is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bazel run //:gazelle -- update-repos -from_file=go.mod -to_macro=deps.bzl%go_dependencies
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And Gazelle would generate a macro that contains invocations to <code>go_repository</code> for each of our module’s dependencies. In this post, I focus on the few dependencies that this did not work well with, and document my way around those edges.</p>

<p>Our <code>go.mod</code> file contains a dependency on:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>require (
	github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go v1.4.2
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gazelle analyzes our dependencies and emits this block in the <code>deps.bzl</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>go_repository(
    name = "com_github_confluentinc_confluent_kafka_go",
    importpath = "github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go",
    sum = "h1:13EK9RTujF7lVkvHQ5Hbu6bM+Yfrq8L0MkJNnjHSd4Q=",
    version = "v1.4.2",
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Trying to build we get:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ bazel build @com_github_confluentinc_confluent_kafka_go//kafka:kafka

<h3 id="compiling-cmake-projects-from-within-a-bazel-workspace">Compiling CMake Projects From Within a Bazel Workspace</h3>

<p>We need to compile our C dependencies into a static library (.a file) in order to provide it to the go linker. We could try to create new Bazel BUILD files on top of that project, but that would require us to deep dive into that dependency and mimic anything it’s authors have done in the original build, wouldn’t it make sense to try and invoke the CMake build from within Bazel? A crude way to do this is using a <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule">genrule</a>, which allows us to invoke any arbitrary command as part of our action graph, but it turns out there’s a great project called <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc">rules_foreign_cc</a> which are “<em>[Bazel] Rules for building C/C++ projects using foreign build systems inside Bazel projects.”</em></p>

<p>We add it to our WORKSPACE file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>http_archive</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"rules_foreign_cc"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>strip_prefix</span> <span>=</span> <span>"rules_foreign_cc-master"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc/archive/master.zip"</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>load</span><span>(</span><span>"@rules_foreign_cc//:workspace_definitions.bzl"</span><span>,</span> <span>"rules_foreign_cc_dependencies"</span><span>)</span>

<span>rules_foreign_cc_dependencies</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So instead of figuring out an elaborate, specific  BUILD file for the C library we are using, we can simply use the foreign dependency rules to invoke the original CMake build and integrate it natively with our action graph.</p>

<p>We add this to our WORKSPACE:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>http_archive</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"librdkafka"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>build_file_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""load("@rules_foreign_cc//tools/build_defs:cmake.bzl", "cmake_external")

filegroup(
    name = "sources",
    srcs = glob(["**"]),
)

cmake_external(
    name = "librdkafka",
    cache_entries = {
        "RDKAFKA_BUILD_STATIC": "ON",
        "WITH_ZSTD": "OFF",
        "WITH_SSL": "OFF",
        "WITH_SASL": "OFF",
        "ENABLE_LZ4_EXT": "OFF",
        "WITH_LIBDL": "OFF",
    },
    lib_source = ":sources",
    static_libraries = [
        "librdkafka++.a",
        "librdkafka.a",
    ],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
"""</span><span>,</span>
    <span>sha256</span> <span>=</span> <span>"ae27ea3f3d0d32d29004e7f709efbba2666c5383a107cc45b3a1949486b2eb84"</span><span>,</span>

    <span>urls</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/archive/v1.4.0.tar.gz"</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s break it down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We use <code>http_archive</code> to pull in a resource from the internet into our Bazel project.</li>
  <li>We provide a custom BUILD file for Bazel to use to build this target.</li>
  <li>the invocation of <code>cmake_external</code> tells Bazel how to invoke CMake (<code>cache_entries</code> is the CMake input arguments), and what output files it provides (<code>static_libraries</code>) so this target can be depended on downstream in the Bazel action graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can now build our header files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ bazel build @librdkafka//:librdkafka

INFO: Analyzed target @librdkafka//:librdkafka (3 packages loaded, 530 targets configured).
INFO: Found 1 target...

INFO: Elapsed time: 3.959s, Critical Path: 0.13s
INFO: 0 processes.
INFO: Build completed successfully, 2 total actions
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my specific use-case, I wanted to link the my build of the confluent-go-kafka library with zlib, so I could avoid getting this error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/external/librdkafka/librdkafka/lib/librdkafka.a(rdgz.c.o):rdgz.c:function rd_gz_decompress: error: undefined reference to 'inflateGetHeader'

....
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To do that I did a very similar thing to what I’ve done with the <code>librdkafka</code> library, adding to the WORKSPACE:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>http_archive</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"zlib"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>build_file_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""load("@rules_foreign_cc//tools/build_defs:cmake.bzl", "cmake_external")

filegroup(
    name = "sources",
    srcs = glob(["**"]),
)

cmake_external(
    name = "zlib",
    cache_entries = {

    },
    lib_source = ":sources",
    static_libraries = ["libz.a"],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
"""</span><span>,</span>

    <span>],</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I could now build it:</p>

For more information have a look at the <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">Bitcoin energy consumption index</a>, as at October 2020 the energy consumption is <strong>22.6% of the UK power consumption.</strong> </p><figure><img src="https://blog.dovu.earth/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-23-at-15.47.51.png"><figcaption>Bitcoin’s energy consumption relative to countries <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">see reference link</a></figcaption></figure><p>Although this is a known problem and there is a range of solutions that solve the "energy" problem including using <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_Stake">Proof of Stake</a> but there is an ICO issue.

October 31, 2020 | https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One piece of unattributed wisdom that's stuck with me is "don't take more than one technology bet". At <a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ladder</a>, our big bet is using <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Clojure</a> for fullstack app development. Ladder's used Clojure since day 1 in 2015, and we wouldn't want it any different! In particular, Clojure's Lisp heritage, focus on pure functions and immutable data structures, unified client-server support, and superior developer experience have helped us write higher quality code faster.</p>
<p><strong>Ladder is hiring! If you're interested, please check out our job description <a href="https://grnh.se/5cebfb331us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</strong></p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2>Pure functions and immutability</h2>
<p>One of the challenges with ordinary, imperative programming languages like Javascript or Python is the increasing complexity of state management. As your application grows, it becomes harder and harder to isolate where in the codebase specific changes to your application state occur. This is because with typical application architectures in those languages, any function can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">side effects</a> or modify incoming or global state. On the other hand, Clojure strongly emphasizes working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pure functions</a> (well, if you discount I/O...) and <a href="https://clojure.org/about/state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">immutable data structures</a>. A Clojure programmer must be explicit when defining and modifying mutable state - this helps minimize its usage and makes it easier to reason about.</p>
<p>Immutable data structures and pure functions also lend themselves well to concurrent programming. We rarely find ourselves worrying about locks and shared data in a multi-threaded environment, because our functions are rarely modifying shared state. And when we do, Clojure provides <code>atom</code>, a thread-safe wrapper around ordinary data structures. Behind the scenes, setting an <code>atom</code>'s value calls <code>compare-and-set!</code>. That means no fussing around with locks or mutexes and no worrying about your data changing before you modify it. With this one simple construct, Clojure removes 99% of our concurrency headaches.</p>
<h2>Clojure is a Lisp</h2>
<p>There are probably enough Lisp arguments on the Internet already - I'll defer to <a href="https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_lisp_is_a_good_thing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rich Hickey</a> (Clojure's creator) and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Graham</a> instead of adding another rehash. That said, Clojure provides some advantages over other Lisps like Common Lisp and Scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>CL only includes lists in its core language spec. Clojure introduces vectors, sets, and maps which makes reading and writing code so much less tedious. Of course Scheme has all of these except sets.</li>
<li>Clojure's core data structures are immutable which, as discussed above, makes reasoning about code, especially concurrent code, much easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clojure runs everywhere</h2>
<p>Clojure provides first class support for sharing code between platforms with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reader conditionals</a>. Most of our namespaces at Ladder take advantage of this and are shared across our client (Clojurescript) and server (Clojure). In fact, all of our client React code (aside from browser-specific API calls like clipboard, input handlers, etc) supports being run on the JVM. This lets us run what we call "full-stack tests" entirely within a Java process. For example, we can run full user flows like "user can accept a life insurance policy" and assert against both client and server state <strong>in the same test</strong>. The closest analogue without this superpower would be running a Selenium test against a running webserver, which introduces all sorts of potential flakiness. For more on full-stack tests, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijWBPYkRAQ&amp;t=346s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this talk</a> two of our engineers gave at Clojure West in 2017.</p>
<p>Clojure also provides easy <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals#_host_interop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">host interop</a> for each supported platform. This lets us leverage the full JVM (and Javascript) ecosystem. For example, we use popular Java libraries like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jetty</a>, <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">kafka-clients</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/tink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tink</a>, and more. On the frontend, we use React, and can easily include other Javascript libraries for analytics, error handling, and session replays.</p>
<h2>Developer experience</h2>
<p>When I’ve worked with Typescript and Python in the past, I was constantly waiting for my development server to reload. Clojure makes updating code on your local server as simple as reloading the updated namespace in your REPL. If you want, you can even <a href="https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">update remote, (hopefully) non-production webservers</a>! Being able to evaluate code in a REPL and have your running web server update in less than a second makes exploration and iteration on your actual backend so much faster. Instant feedback makes developers more playful and experimental. Ultimately, it helps them write better code faster.</p>
<p>It’s also super easy to run small chunks of code in the REPL. Ladder, like other Clojure shops, has a convention of documenting namespace usage with a <code>comment</code> block at the bottom. Developers can use the code within to learn the namespace’s API, run commonly used procedures, or test changes to the rest of the namespace - all without leaving their editor!</p>
<h2>Why not Clojure?</h2>
<p>While we're extremely satisfied with our choice of Clojure, we've had our fair share of headaches. First, Clojure processes take a long time to start up - especially as the size of the application grows. Our webserver at Ladder takes a full minute before it can accept web requests. This makes autoscaling in response to load more challenging - some of our load can spike in well under a minute, so we have to be consistently overprovisioned to handle it. Second, Clojure produces pretty big artifacts. This matters less on the backend, where our webserver JAR is over 1.5GB, but hurts us on the frontend. We still have work to do here, but our initial bundle is 7.2MB uncompressed (1.0MB gzipped)! If raw performance or bundle size is your primary concern, you might be better off choosing another language.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a small company, we have more ideas to try than we have bandwidth to implement. Using Clojure has helped our team be more iterative and more productive, so we can ship more experiments and projects than we would otherwise be able to. I feel super lucky that Ladder introduced me to Clojure - and I'm excited to see how Clojure and our use of it continues to evolve!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Programming is a game of abstractions, and we programmers traffic in ideas.
When I find an idea that resonates with me, I turn into an evangelist for it to
everyone who works with me.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorites. There’s a recency bias; I can’t remember some of
the formative essays from my early years as a programmer. </p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/">Ben Kuhn</a> for this idea!</p>
<h3>Essays</h3>
<p>Jeff Atwood, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault/">The First Rule of Programming: It’s Always Your Fault</a>. I
like to answer questions on Stack Overflow, and an amazing amount of questions
on that website have a title like “Found a bug in React?” paired with an
introductory sentence: “I’m brand new to React.” It’s human to assume there’s a
problem with your tools or materials. To me, this essay’s point is that it’s
more profitable to assume the opposite, because your code hasn’t stood up to
anything close to the scrutiny of the code from a popular software project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you truly aspire to being a humble programmer, you should have no qualms
about saying “hey, this is my fault— and I’ll get to the bottom of it.”
— Jeff Atwood</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Shawn Wang, <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>. Be public, leverage the encouragement and
criticism of others, and build a footprint for yourself on the internet. There
are a bunch of detours you can take as a junior developer that waste time and
potentially graduate you to <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">expert beginner</a> status; one of
them is hiding your work in an attempt to avoid criticism. I think one of the
smartest parts of argument this can be summed up in the adage: “The fastest way
to get the right answer to a question is to post the wrong answer on the
internet.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People think you suck? Good. You agree. Ask them to explain, in detail, why
you suck. You want to just feel good or you want to be good? No objections, no
hurt feelings. Then go away and prove them wrong.
— Shawn Wang</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Elisabeth Hendrickson, <a href="https://testobsessed.com/2020/02/momentum-urgency/">Momentum &gt;
Urgency</a>. I found this post
recently, and it describes the best teams I’ve worked with. Effective teams
focus on process, not outcome. Managers of such teams know that a team member
being blocked isn’t a frustrating detail that that team member will have to
remedy, but rather a process failure that was luckily exposed while many more
remain hidden. They’ll use their managerial clout to fight with you against
that obstacle, considering it a top priority.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I’ve learned is that if we want things to go fast, a sense of momentum
is much more effective than a sense of urgency.
— Elisabeth Hendrickson</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Scott Hanselman, <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes">Do they deserve the gift of your
keystrokes?</a>.
This post isn’t just for programmers, but the statistical nature of it
resonated with me. Since reading it, I often consider the reach of my chosen
communication method, and whether I’m making efficient use of time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming you want your message to reach as many people as possible, blog it. You only have so many hours in the day.
— Scott Hanselman</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Joel Spolsky, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/02/13/the-iceberg-secret-revealed/">The Iceberg Secret,
Revealed</a>.
Programmers know that what we can see on a web page can represent a small
fraction or none of the true functionality, completeness, and complexity of the
application. People who don’t write software don’t automatically know that.
Factor this into all communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Customers Don’t Know What They Want. Stop Expecting Customers to Know What
They Want. It’s just never going to happen. Get over it.
— Joel Spolsky</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Understand that any demos you do in a darkened room with a projector are
going to be all about pixels. If you can, build your UI in such a way that
unfinished parts look unfinished.
— Joel Spolsky</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://xyproblem.info/">XY Problem</a>. When you’re asking for programming help
from someone, start by easing them into your situation, stating the problem,
your assumptions, and what you’ve tried and learned. Give them the chance to
poke holes in your logic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that if your diagnostic theories were accurate, you wouldn’t be asking for help right?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Jon Evans, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/07/why-the-new-guy-cant-code/">Why The New Guy Can’t
Code</a>. The truth
of this argument has confirmed itself to me over and over again. I think that I
became a programmer on the job. But you can become a programmer right now by
doing just one hard thing: committing to a meaningful project, no matter how
small, and finishing it, in spite of the obstacles you will face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what should a real interview consist of? Let me offer a humble proposal:
don’t interview anyone who hasn’t accomplished anything. Ever. Certificates and
degrees are not accomplishments; I mean real-world projects with real-world
users.
— Jon Evans</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Paul Slaughter, <a href="https://conventionalcomments.org/">Conventional comments</a>. I
believe in code reviews as a technique to raise quality, share information, and
help people grow. But they can go wrong in so many ways and have an almost
opposite effect. This technique– labeling comments to help the recipient
contextualize your feedback– has had a positive impact on several teams I’ve
been a part of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Labeling comments saves hours of undercommunication and misunderstandings.
They are also parseable by machines!
— Paul Slaughter</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Zed Shaw via Abhishek Nagekar, <a href="https://www.nagekar.com/2018/06/advice-from-an-old-programmer-zed-shaw.html">Advice From An Old Programmer</a>. There will
likely come a day when you find programming to be a little bit boring. It will
cease to be joyful as a pure exercise. What do you do then? It’s a question I’m
grappling with. I’m choosing to use that skill to build things I care about,
and help others become programmers through volunteering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good
job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food
joint. You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another
profession.
— Zed Shaw</p>

Business does not. Copying is a zero-sum game and all participating players will compete profits away until they reach a Nash-equilibrium, where a further lowering of price, and thus margins, is unsustainable.

There are certain guidelines successful businesses seem to use but in the end, you’ll still have to go with your gut and make a judgment call according to your own ethical values.</em></p><p>Arguably, replicating findings is one of the best tools we have in our scientific arsenal in order to test the validity of a conclusion.</p><p>Which is why the psychology community was not amused when the methodological crisis now known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" target="_blank">Replication crisis</a> started, where it was discovered that many studies weren’t replicable (Nosek et al., 2015).</p><p>Even some of the most cited and well-known studies such as the study that power posing makes you act bolder (Carney, Cuddy &amp; Yap, 2010).</p><p>Which, incidentally, is why it’s so important to not just reference research (instead of parroting some YouTube influencer or blogger) but to also carefully analyze the literature and its limitations yourself. *1</p><p>This doesn’t guarantee perfection, but it does decrease obvious and preventable mistakes.</p><p>JP Ioannidis pointed out serious problems with published research in ‘’Why most published research findings are false.’’</p><blockquote><p>‘’ Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.’’ (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/" target="_blank">Ioannidis, 2005</a>).</p></blockquote><p>Methodological issues aside, replication matters.</p><p>Well, that’s all fine and dandy weren’t it for the pesky fact that our field relies on innovation.</p><p>Even if you extract all the knowledge from the brains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Systrom" target="_blank">Kevin Systrom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krieger" target="_blank">Mike Krieger </a>and build Instagram, you’d get the complete opposite result because Instagram already exists.</p><p>Even Kevin and Mike can’t replicate it because the variables have changed.</p><p>The entire environment and current social climate (regarding privacy, advertising, users as the product, and social media addiction) are different, and even if it weren’t, no user is gonna switch to an IG clone when IG already exists.</p><p>There are some guidelines that most successful companies seem to follow, however, you can’t formulate a step-by-step plan for the reasons laid out above.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel" target="_blank">Peter Thiel</a> was one of the first to point out this distinction between companies that go from 0 to 1, innovation, and companies that go from 1 to n (copying), in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296" target="_blank">Zero to One</a>.</p><p>Companies that do copy and thus employ a formula they copied from another company open themselves up to fierce competition.</p><p>As more players participate in this zero-sum game, the fixed pie of users and profits will get competed away because there are too many mouths to feed with finite resources. *2</p><p>If you copy each other with no (or no meaningful) distinctions then price will be the only thing you can compete on, which is exactly what we see in commodity markets.</p><p>Player B will lower prices in order to steal market share from Player A. Player A lowers them still. Player C lowers it below both of them.

What did you mean by that?</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong>Groupon started out with these really tight principles about how the site was going to work, really being pro-customer. And as we expanded people in the company would say, “Hey, why don’t we try running two deals a day?” “Why don’t we start sending two emails a day?” And I’d think, <em>That sounds awful. Who wants to get two emails every single day from a company. </em>And they’d be like, <em>Sure, it sounds awful to you. But we’re a data-driven company, so why don’t we let the data decide? Why don’t we do a test?</em> And we’d do a test, and it would show that maybe people would unsubscribe at a slightly higher rate, but the increase in purchasing would more than make up for it. You’d get in a situation where it doesn’t feel right, but it does seem like a rational decision.</p><p>The problem was when you’re in hypergrowth like this, you don’t have time to see what is going to happen to the data in the long term. The churn would catch up with you. People would unsubscribe at higher rates, and then, before you know it, the service has just turned into something — if you look at Groupon now, it’s just this vestige of what it once was. There’s no real copywriting. It’s a marketplace of coupons. It’s still a service that a lot of people get a lot of value out of, but it doesn’t have the spirit it once did.</p><p>There are certain things you have to be religious about in the company. That’s what I’ve taken away from that: There are some things where you have to say, “I’m sorry. I’m not going to look at the data on that. This is just what we’re going to do. We know that it’s right, and there’s nothing that’s going to shake us from that.” (Blumberg, 2018).</p></blockquote><p><em>*1 The fact that almost everyone is lazy and assume others have done their homework vs. doing the hard work of checking it themselves is a cognitive error known as </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank"><em>diffusion of responsibility</em></a><em>. ‘’The individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.’’</em></p><p><em>*2 This is often …</em></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <td colspan="3">
            
            <div id="content">
              <p>I have a couple of different stationary computers. A
                custom-built PC running Windows, an iMac G3 running Mac
                OS 9 and an old HP microtower running Alpine Linux,
                acting as a home server of sorts. Out of all these, I
                spend most of my time on the Windows PC. I use Windows
                for the majority of my work, including a large part of
                the programming that I do.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Even though I mainly use Windows, most of my
                web/software development is grounded in or at least
                inspired by Unix in some way: most obviously, I use Git,
                which is a tool designed for the Unix shell. This turns
                out to be a rather awkward match: on the one hand, I use
                Windows Explorer to manage the files; on the other hand,
                I have a command prompt open to manage the repository.</p>
              <p>For my workflow, it would be much better if the Git
                commands were integrated into Explorer itself. So I
                added what amounts to the following code to <a href="http://git.ankarstrom.se/ahk.git/">my AutoHotKey
                  script</a>: <br>
              </p>

              <p>(The actual code is contained in <a href="http://git.ankarstrom.se/ahk.git/tree/tt.programs.explorer.ahk">this

                  file</a>, most of it near the bottom.) </p>
              <p>This adds a bunch of hotkeys to any Explorer window:</p>
              <dl>
                <dt><b>Alt-A</b></dt>
                <dd>"git add" the selected file; then "git status"<br>
                </dd>

                <dd>"git diff", comparing the previous and current
                  commit</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-Shift-I</b></dt>
                <dd>"git diff" the selected file, comparing the previous
                  and current commit</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-L</b></dt>
                <dd>"git log"</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-Shift-L</b></dt>
                <dd>"git log" the selected file<br>
                </dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-P</b></dt>
                <dd>"git push"</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-R</b></dt>

                <dd>"git status"</dd>
              </dl>
              <p>All of these hotkeys open a new command prompt window,
                displaying the results of the Git command, which the
                user can close by pressing any key.</p>
              <p>In my experience, these hotkeys make it incalculably
                less bothersome to work with Git on Windows, and I think
                it shows how incredibly useful even very simple
                AutoHotKey scripts can be. If you have any suggestions
                on other hotkeys, please write a comment below.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We started this series with <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">an overview of the CPython VM</a>. We learned that to run a Python program, CPython first compiles it to bytecode, and we studied how the compiler works in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">part two</a>. <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">Last time</a> we stepped through the CPython source code starting with the <code>main()</code> function until we reached the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. The main reason why we spent time studying these things was to prepare for the discussion that we start today. The goal of this discussion is to understand how CPython does what we tell it to do, that is, how it executes the bytecode to which the code we write compiles.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h3>Starting point</h3>
<p>Let's briefly recall what we learned in the previous parts. We tell CPython what to do by writing Python code. The CPython VM, however, understands only Python bytecode. This is the job of the compiler to translate Python code to bytecode. The compiler stores bytecode in a code object, which is a structure that fully describes what a code block, like a module or a function, does. To execute a code object, CPython first creates a state of execution for it called a frame object. Then it passes a frame object to a frame evaluation function to perform the actual computation. The default frame evaluation function is <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Python/ceval.c#L889">Python/ceval.c</a>. This function implements the core of the CPython VM. Namely, it implements the logic for the execution of Python bytecode. So, this function is what we're going to study today.</p>
<p>To understand how <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> works, it is crucial to have an idea of what its input, a frame object, is. A frame object is a Python object defined by the following C struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// typedef struct _frame PyFrameObject; in other place</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>_frame</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject_VAR_HEAD</span>

    <span>char</span> <span>f_trace_lines</span><span>;</span>         <span>/* Emit per-line trace events? */</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>f_trace_opcodes</span><span>;</span>       <span>/* Emit per-opcode trace events? */</span>

    <span>/* Borrowed reference to a generator, or NULL */</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>f_gen</span><span>;</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>f_lineno</span><span>;</span>               <span>/* Current line number */</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>f_iblock</span><span>;</span>               <span>/* index in f_blockstack */</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>f_executing</span><span>;</span>           <span>/* whether the frame is still executing */</span>
    <span>PyTryBlock</span> <span>f_blockstack</span><span>[</span><span>CO_MAXBLOCKS</span><span>];</span> <span>/* for try and loop blocks */</span>

<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>f_code</code> field of a frame object points to a code object. A code object is also a Python object. Here's its definition:</p>

<p>The most important field of a code object is <code>co_code</code>. It's a pointer to a Python bytes object representing the bytecode. The bytecode is a sequence of two-byte instructions: one byte for an opcode and one byte for an argument.</p>
<p>Don't worry if some members of the above structures are still a mystery to you. We'll see what they are used for as we move forward in our attempt to understand how the CPython VM executes the bytecode.</p>
<h3>Overview of the evaluation loop</h3>
<p>The problem of executing Python bytecode may seem a no-brainer to you. Indeed, all the VM has to do is to iterate over the instructions and to act according to them. And this is what essentially <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> does. It contains an infinite <code>for (;;)</code> loop that we refer to as the evaluation loop. Inside that loop there is a giant <code>switch</code> statement over all possible opcodes. Each opcode has a corresponding <code>case</code> block containing the code for executing that opcode. The bytecode is represented by an array of 16-bit unsigned integers, one integer per instruction. The VM keeps track of the next instruction to be executed using the <code>next_instr</code> variable, which is a pointer to the array of instructions. At the start of each iteration of the evaluation loop, the VM calculates the next opcode and its argument by taking the least significant and the most significant byte of the next instruction respectively and increments <code>next_instr</code>. The <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> function is nearly 3000 lines long, but its essence can be captured by the following simplified version:</p>

        <span>}</span>

        <span>// ... error handling</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// ... termination</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a more realistic picture, let's discuss some of the omitted pieces in more detail.</p>
<h4>reasons to suspend the loop</h4>
<p>From time to time, the currently running thread stops executing the bytecode to do something else or to do nothing. This can happen due to one of the four reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are signals to handle. When you register a function as a signal handler using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.signal"><code>signal.signal()</code></a>, CPython stores this function in the array of handlers. The function that will actually be called when a thread receives a signal is <code>signal_handler()</code> (it's passed to the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"><code>sigaction()</code></a> library function on Unix-like systems). When called, <code>signal_handler()</code> sets a boolean variable telling that the function in the array of handlers corresponding to the received signal has to be called. Periodically, the main thread of the main interpreter calls the tripped handlers.</li>
<li>There are pending calls to call. Pending calls is a mechanism that allows to schedule a function to be executed from the main thread. This mechanism is exposed by the Python/C API via the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_AddPendingCall"><code>Py_AddPendingCall()</code></a> function.</li>
<li>The asynchronous exception is raised. The asynchronous exception is an exception set in one thread from another. This can be done using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc"><code>PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc()</code></a> function provided by the Python/C API.</li>
<li>The currently running thread is requested to drop the GIL. When it sees such a request, it drops the GIL and waits until it acquires the GIL again.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPython has indicators for each of these events. The variable indicating that there are handlers to call is a member of <code>runtime-&gt;ceval</code>, which is a <code>_ceval_runtime_state</code> struct:</p></div></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>According to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_time#Statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American survey,</a> children&nbsp;between the ages of 8-12 and 13-18 spend a daily average of 4 hours, 44 minutes and 7 hours, 22 minutes respectively, staring at screens.</p>
<p>The data for these numbers were collected in 2019. For adults, this figure is higher and according to an article on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post </a>earlier this year, the amount of screen time increased considerably during the quarantine period due to <strong>COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>Today, mobile devices take a large percentage of the amount of time people spend staring at screens, this is why there is a need for applications to have a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> option for its users.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> according to <strong>Wikipedia,</strong><em> is a color scheme that uses light-coloured text, icons, and graphical user interface elements on a dark background and is often discussed in terms of computer user interface design and web design.</em></p>
<p>Now, let us look at the 5 reasons why <strong>Dark Mode</strong> really matters for the end-users of an application!<br>
<a name="reasons-for-dark-mode"></a></p>
<h2>Reasons For Dark Mode</h2>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-300x200.jpg" alt="visual appeal" width="1055" height="703" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"><br>
<a name="visual-attraction"></a></p>
<h3>1). Visual Attraction</h3>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> when applied in the right manner always looks really appealing to the eye. It provides the opportunity to present a unique user interface to the end-users of an application.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of data presentation for graphical contents like dashboards that contain graphs and charts, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> brings out the elegance in the design as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-300x156.png" alt="Dark Mode" width="1106" height="575" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-300x156.png 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-1024x531.png 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-768x398.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px"></p>
<p>Unlike the drab white look that most applications have, the above image shows how <strong>Dark Mode</strong> can bring a significantly deeper and more attractive visual perception to an application.<br>
<a name="user-experience"></a></p>
<h3>2). User Experience</h3>
<p>Providing the users of a product with the option of a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is a good business decision, especially if the application requires users to spend lots of time on the application. A streaming site, for example, implementing a dark mode feature is a good business decision.</p>
<p>Streaming a video in <strong>light-mode</strong> under a dark environment or at night may not be a good experience for the eyes. Hence, applications that require people spending lots of screen time should provide an option for <strong>Dark Mode</strong> for a better user experience.</p>
<p>Above all, it is worthy to note that context is a key factor in making decisions on whether to implement the option of a <strong>Dark Mode</strong>.<br>
<a name="eye-strain"></a></p>
<h3>3). Eye Strain &amp; Blue Light Removal</h3>
<p>By default, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> helps to reduce overall screen brightness. Although no study has outrightly confirmed that <strong>Dark Mode</strong> reduces eye strain, it can, however, be effective in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> helps to reduce exposure to <strong>Blue Light.</strong>&nbsp;Blue light is a high-frequency colour in the “visible light spectrum” that can be seen by the human eye.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-300x200.jpg" alt="blue-light" width="990" height="660" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px"></p>
<p><strong>Blue Light&nbsp;</strong>can be found almost everywhere, from smartphones to computers and other digital devices. Another source of Blue Light is the sun, so by stepping out of your house, you are exposed to a certain degree of blue light.</p>
<p>Too many exposures to Blue Light can lead to digital eye strain.</p>
<p>Since not everyone can see well with <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, some mobile devices provide the option for Blue Light filters. This can be found in the display settings area and can be easily adjusted to the level of blue light exposure you want.<br>
<a name="reduction-of-photophobia"></a></p>
<h3>4). Reduction of Photophobia</h3>
<p>Photophobia is a symptom of abnormal intolerance to the visual perception of light. The source of this light could be any form of light source including sunlight.</p>
<p>There are so many things that can cause photophobia, some of which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive light entering the eyes</li>
<li>Eye infection</li>
<li>Medications</li>
<li>Meningitis</li>
<li>Lack of eye pigment (Albinism)</li>
<li>Wearing contact lenses for an extended period of time, or wearing it wrongly.</li>
<li>Post Eye Surgery</li>
</ul>
<p>Photophobia usually disappears once the underlying cause is treated. A good way to deal with photophobia is making use of the <strong>Dark Mode </strong>of a mobile device or an application. This helps to reduce the amount of bright light that goes directly into the eyes.</p>
<p>An extension you may consider installing on your desktop browser is &nbsp;<a href="https://nighteye.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night Eye</a>. It is supported by almost all major web browsers. It helps you enable <strong>Dark Mode </strong>and other features across almost all the websites you view, to help cope with the light sensitivity.</p>
<p>However, if light sensitivity persists, you may want to see your doctor!<br>
<a name="battery-saver"></a></p>
<h3>5). Battery Saver</h3>
<p>Another positive impact of <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is the impact it has on the battery life of mobile devices. <strong>Dark Mode </strong>can significantly help reduce the battery drain on devices which use OLED(Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screens.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-205x300.jpg" alt="battery-saver" width="952" height="1393" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-205x300.jpg 205w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-699x1024.jpg 699w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-768x1125.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></p>
<p>Numerous studies have confirmed the fact that <strong>Dark Mode</strong> saves battery life. In an<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UljafaxRcEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Android Dev Summit</a> in November of 2018, Google also confirmed that themes on android devices have a significant impact on the battery life of a mobile device.</p>
<p>If you are using an Android device, you should consider using <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, especially at night. Not only is it easy on the eyes, but it also helps save your battery life.<br>
<a name="factors-to-consider"></a></p>
<h3>Factors To Consider When Selecting Dark Mode</h3>
<p>In as much as <strong>Dark Mode</strong> seems trendy, it is necessary to consider some factors before deciding to implement it in an application. Some of these factors are discussed below:</p>
<p><strong>Readability and Visibility:&nbsp;</strong>Readability simply means the ease at which a reader can easily understand or perceive a written text. Applications that contain lots of text in their interface will have to be careful about how <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is implemented.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is not well implemented, this will lead to a poor user experience with the users struggling to read the texts. This defeats one of the purposes for which <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is created and could lead to eye strain.</p>
<p>Lots of research must go into how the backgrounds, text colour and font will work together.</p>
<p><strong>Test Before Implementation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Testing helps to discover the strength and weakness of the Color scheme used in an application. <strong>Dark Mode</strong> does not work well for all applications. A website that contains lots of elements(text, images, tables) may make it difficult for <strong>Dark Mode</strong> to be implemented.</p>
<p>Other factors to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of the target audience</li>
<li>Providing an option to switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode</li>
<li>The Environment</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The decision to always use <strong>Dark Mode </strong>should always be a relative one. For users of an application, knowing when to use light mode and <strong>Dark Mode </strong>at different times of the day is very essential for the eye.</p>

            <p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After a very, very long delay, here comes finally another development report about the <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/BIM_Workbench">BIM tools</a> for <a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>. Awfully sorry about the black-out during these last months, lots of things <a href="https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/liege/detail_circuit-de-spa-francorchamps-80-millions-d-investissements-et-le-retour-de-la-moto?id=10604892">happened</a> (all the 3D&amp;BIM done with FreeCAD and Blender) and  of course the pandemic didn't ease things either. Anyway, that doesn't mean nothing happened on the FreeCAD front, on the contrary, bugs still get addressed, things get fin-tuned, ideas get discussed, and FreeCAD gets everyday better.</p>
<p>This last month we also had a hectic turnover, because Autodesk changed the terms of the free version of  their <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview">Fusion360</a>. There is a full load of new limitations that restrain much the use for personal/hobby users. For example, the g-code you export from Fusion360 to CNC machines (that cut objects out of a block of material), is now making the machine running slower (and therefore raising the production costs), for no apparent reason other than nagging the users into buying a subscription. As a result, we saw a massive migration of users to FreeCAD, and it's really thrilling to see people discovering FreeCAD and learning it and liking it.</p>
<p>Thanks once more to everybody who contributes to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yorikvanhavre">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://liberapay.com/yorik/">Liberapay</a> campaigns, I'm really grateful you guys didn't just drop me away when I fail to write for 3 months.</p>
<p>Also, for who didn't notice, FreeCAD now has a proper <a href="https://liberapay.com/FreeCAD/">Liberapay teams account</a> where all money received is divided equally between the FreeCAD developers registered there (currently 7). This account has seen a huge raise of donations these last weeks (it receives around 1000 USD/month at the moment), thanks to the flow of new ex-Fusion360 users, and the impressive job Kunda1 is doing on <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeCADNews">the official FreeCAD twitter account</a> (subscribe to it if you are a twitter user, that account used to be just a mirror of the FreeCAD Facebook page, but is now very, very well maintained) and the campaigning of other people (special thanks to my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/beatnikqueen">girlfriend</a>, the most awesome person in the world).</p>
<p>So, no more loitering, to the news! Here is what we got this month:</p>
<h3>Customizable section color</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_SetMaterial">Materials</a> now have a new <strong>Section Color</strong> property, which allows to give a different color when the material is viewed and when it is cut through. So for example you can now have your walls appear white when viewed, but black when cut and seen on a TechDraw page.</p>
<p>This is a small improvement so far, but it laid the structure to have more advanced things, such as supporting hatch patterns. The main problem for this, is that, although the SVG format has an excellent support for hatch patterns (anything can become a hatch pattern, even bitmap images), the Qt implementation of the SVG format lacks support for it (it has its own <a href="https://doc.qt.io/Qt-5/qbrush.html#details">system</a> but it's not very practical to make that compatible with SVG). Therefore at the moment we have no clear idea of how to go further.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_Module">TechDraw</a>'s implementation of hatch patterns internally recreates OpenCasCade geometry, which works very well but might be heavy for large BIM models. In any case, that's a track I'm <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/FreeCAD/tree/td-makedrawgeomhatch">exploring</a> too.</p>
<h3>Default windows are now openable</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another very small fix, but the default door and windows created with the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_Window">Door and windows tools</a> now have a hinge edge defined, so their <strong>Opening</strong> property now works out-of-the-box. It might not open in the direction you want, though, so you might still need to tweak this. But next items on my list are adding a couple of controls to easily switch opening directions.</p>
<h3>Default pattern size option</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Draft patterns system is now working again (hatch patterns can be added to all closed Draft objects such as rectangles, polylines, circles, etc). I also added a preferences option under <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Draft -&gt; Visual settings</em> to set a default hatch pattern scale, which is useful when you always work with objects of a similar size range, for example building plans. I still have to experiment a bit (0.0025 seems like a very good default setting for BIM), but will add that to the BIM setup screen once I found a couple of good settings.</p>
<h3>Section plane label</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_SectionPlane">Section planes</a> now have a <strong>Show Label</strong> property, which, when turned on, show the section plane label on the plane in the 3D view. This is useful to easily identify these section planes when there are many in your document. The text size currently depends on the arrow size, but I'll make all this better customizable later on.</p>
<p>We have further plans too for the section planes, such as be able to double-click or activate them somehow, and find yourself in a separate 2D view with all needed geometry cut or turned off, where you can still work on the model in a 2D environment. This would be a bit like an intermediary step between the full 3D model and a TechDraw view. You can see a first draft of that coded by Carlo Pavan on the experimental tools palette in the BIM workbench.</p>
<h3>TechDraw tools in BIM workbench</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-06.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Among the annotation tools on the BIM workbench, you'll now find two TechDraw tools, <strong>Create page</strong> and <strong>Create view</strong>. The first one is the same of the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_PageTemplate">Create page from template</a> TechDraw tool, except that it remembers the last template you used and gets you right there when you use the tool again, so it gives a little bit faster workflow. The second tool is currently the same as the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_ArchView">TechDraw ArchView tool</a> but I plan to make it a bit more flexible in the future so it would become a mix of TechDraw's ArchView and DraftView tools, depending on the selected objects.</p>
<h3>TSV export</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_Schedule">Schedule</a> tool has been extended to now allow to export results to the .tsv (Tab-Separated Values) format, which is basically the same as the .csv (Comma-Separated Values) format, but using tab characters to separate columns, instead of commas. The big problem of csv, of course, is if there are commas in the columns texts. Usually spreadsheet apps are pretty tolerant with .csv files, they will usually ask you what character to consider as column separator on import, but others (for example GitHub) doesn't display them correctly if they don't use a comma as separator. So from now on there is a correct way to please everybody <i></i></p>
<h3>Blender exporter upgrade</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-07.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/yorikvanhavre/029f6fcce9f4d0e62fb6163804b7f80d">FreeCAD exporter for Blender</a> has seen several small fixes, it now automatically adds the .FCStd extension to the generated file if you haven't added it yourself, it now correctly handles object rotation and scaling, and it applies modifiers before exporting. It now also supports faceless objects (wireframe objects).</p>
<p>This coupled with the <a href="https://blenderbim.org/">BlenderBIM</a> improvements, it now becomes increasingly easy to work on BIM models in Blender, or parts of BIM models, and when needed, integrate everything seamlessly in FreeCAD. There are many more joint FreeCAD/Blender developments going on, such as the new <a href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=51069&amp;p=438881">Sverchok nodes</a> that use FreeCAD internally, literally creating a kind of new interface for FreeCAD withing Blender.</p>
<h3>Detect and suggest development version</h3>
<p>The BIM workbench will now detect your FreeCAD version on the setup screen, and suggest you to install a development version if you are not using one. This will help people to be aware of the existence of development versions, and become more used to them and how to install and mange them.</p>
<h3>Grid extension setting in Working Plane panel</h3>
<p>The overall size of the grid is now settable directly from the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Draft_SelectPlane">Working Plane</a> task panel.</p>
<h3>Multiple custom folders on start page</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-08.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Start_Workbench">start page</a> can now show multiple custom folders. To achieve that, go to the start page preferences under menu <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Start</em> and instead of choosing one custom folder, type manually several folder paths, separated by ;;</p>
<p>For example: <code>/home/yorik;;/home/yorik/Examples;;/home/yorik/FreeCAD/Examples</code></p>
<h3>Image Plane scaling</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-09.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Draft_Scale">Draft Scale</a> tool now support image planes created with the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Image_Module">Image workbench</a>. So it is now easy to import reference images such as scanned floor plans, position them on a common reference point, and scale them to the desired size.</p>
<h3>Unit and Show Unit in Draft dimension preferences</h3>
<p>You can now set default value for these two settings under <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Draft -&gt; Dimensions and Texts</em>, that will affect all newly created dimensions.</p>
<h3>Manual upgrade</h3>
<p>And last but not least, I started upgrading the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Manual">manual</a> to FreeCAD 0.19, and this time I intend well to produce a printed book with it. To be continued!</p>
<p>That's it for this month I guess, I promise to do everything I can to resume posting once per month!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Yorik</p>

Or, switch off video."</p><p>"I need to take a break, and have enough time to play one game of FIFA."</p><p>"How the hell is she so motivated and well dressed every day? I can hardly get out of bed and brush my teeth before the first meeting."</p><p>"I am tired already, will anyone notice if I log off at 2 PM?"</p><p>👆 is a snapshot of the thoughts I've had in the last 30+ weeks of work from home. The actual list is much longer, but let's not go there.</p><p>For almost six weeks now, I have felt that my productivity is lesser than what it was earlier. But the thing with productivity is that there is no scientific measure for it, nor is there a universal scale to determine how productive is productive enough for a superstar PM. (Yes, I think of myself as a superstar PM 😛)</p><p>To give some meaning to the said feeling, I decided to investigate further.</p><p>The goal was to design a system to measure my productivity, identify factors that negatively affect it and develop a method to keep it high.</p><p>TLDR:</p><ol><li>My mood at the end of the workday is a representation of how productive I was on that day - &nbsp;good mood equals a highly productive day. A low <em>task completion rate</em> and <em>high task completion time</em> negatively affected my productivity and my mood.</li><li>I lose focus more easily working from home than working from the office. This has a direct impact on the completion rate and completion time. I, then, identified the triggers that lead me to lose focus. [Read questions at the top.]</li><li>I researched productivity hacks and shortlisted the ones that I think could work for me.</li></ol><p>Deep dive:</p><h2 id="how-to-measure-productivity">How to measure productivity?</h2><p>There is no easy way for me to estimate productivity objectively. And that doesn't worry me. So I chose to limit the measures to subjective criteria like work-related mood and a sense of achievement at the end of the day.</p><p>I am the only one measuring my productivity. There are no external persons who can influence the measurement. Most importantly, I have no incentive to cheat or to justify it to anyone. Hence, this system works. It helps me track directional changes to productivity. As long as I am progressing in the right direction, I am happy.</p><h2 id="why-do-i-lose-focus-more-often-at-home-vs-the-office">Why do I lose focus more often at home vs the office?</h2><p>There are too many variables at home. [Read questions at the top.]</p><p>There is no standard start and end to my day. I start 15 minutes before my first meeting and only stop when I am exhausted. Not having an end time makes me more lenient about micro deadlines. And that leniency triggers the part of the brain which prefers getting distracted.</p><p>This was very different in a physical office.</p><ul><li><strong>The 20-minute commute to the office</strong> helped me prepare for my day, and the commute back helped me unwind and shutdown. The commute primed me to switch on and off, with enough prep time on both ends.

I highly recommend it. I am more efficient with my tasks when there is a timer counting down. For those who are not aware - the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. It breaks down work into intervals of 25 minutes in length. Each interval, known as the Pomodoro, is separated by a short break (typically of 5 minutes).</li><li>I am not fond of being late. Ever. I use that to my advantage by <strong>creating and advertising time-bound goals</strong>. For example, suppose the engineers need a document by Friday. In that case, I commit (in front of the entire team) to deliver it by Wednesday. The ambition to fulfil my commitments keeps me focused for longer periods of time.</li><li><strong>Having something to look forward to at the end of the day</strong> keeps me efficient all day. I play football on Wednesday evenings, and miraculously I am the most productive on Wednesdays.</li><li><strong>A comfortable home office is quintessential. </strong>The most important part of the home office - something that I learned the hard way - is a comfortable chair. If you don't already have one, buy one right now. Thank me later.</li><li><strong>Keep your home office organized and clean</strong>.

October 31, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 1978 Japan's <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%8C%E6%B8%88%E7%94%A3%E6%A5%AD%E7%9C%81">Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry</a>
established the encoding that would later be known as JIS X 0208, which still
serves as an important reference for all Japanese encodings. However, after the
JIS standard was released people noticed something strange - several of the
added characters had no obvious sources, and nobody could tell what they meant
or how they should be pronounced. Nobody was sure where they came from. These
are what came to be known as the ghost characters
(<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97">幽霊文字</a>).</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/ghostcanvas.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/ghostcanvas.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>Be careful what you write. <a href="http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1312837">via the NDL</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>For a long time the ghost characters remained an unexplained and mostly
forgotten curiosity, but in 1997 an investigation was launched to discover
where they had come from.  While all characters in the JIS standard were
supposed to have a record of their sources, even when it existed it
wasn't very specific, typically just listing the document it was sourced from.</p>
<p>You'd think that listing the source would make tracking down the origins of the
characters easy, but it's important to clarify what counts as a "source" - one
of the more common sources for the ghost characters was the "Overview of
National Administrative Districts" (国土行政区画総覧), a comprehensive list of
place names in Japan. You might, as I initially did, imagine this to be a kind
of atlas, an oversize book with at most a few hundred pages. It turns out the
<a href="http://kokudo.or.jp/books/index.html">latest edition</a> is a seven volume set
with each volume having roughly nine hundred pages. Imagine tracking down a
single character without a page reference.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulty, the investigation into the ghost characters was
successful in discovering their origins - mostly. By interviewing the
catalogers involved in the creation of the standard, the investigators
established that some characters were inadvertently invented as mistakes in the
cataloging process. For example, 妛 was an error introduced while trying to
record "山 over 女". "山 over 女" occurs in the name of a particular place and
was thus suitable for inclusion in the JIS standard, but because they couldn't
print it as one character yet, 山 and 女 were printed separately, cut out, and
pasted onto a sheet of paper, and then copied. When reading the copy, the line
where the two little pieces of paper met looked like a stroke and was added to
the character by mistake. The original character
(<a href="https://ja.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%A1%9A%B4">𡚴</a>) was not added to JIS or
Unicode until much later and doesn't display on most sites for me.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/yuureimoji.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/yuureimoji.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>The core ghost characters: 妛挧暃椦槞蟐袮閠駲墸壥彁
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the end only one character had neither a clear source nor any historical
precedent: 彁. The most likely explanation is that it was created as a
misreading of the 彊 character, but no specific incident was uncovered.</p>
<p>Following the general adoption of the JIS standards these characters all made
their way into Unicode, which has its own <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK%E7%B5%B1%E5%90%88%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97#%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97">separate set of ghost
characters</a>
introduced during CJK unification.</p>
<p>To sum up - in 1978 a series of small mistakes created some characters out of
nothing. The errors went undiscovered just long enough to be set in stone, and
now these ghosts are, at least in potential, a part of every computer on the
planet, lurking in the dark corners of character tables.</p>
<p>At this rate they'll presumably be with humanity forever. Ψ</p>

So that’s very concrete,” he said. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>“Everyone is enthusiastic. People are thinking this is the light at the end of the tunnel. Let’s go for it,” Levi added.</p><p>Several thousand staff at the University College London Hospitals, which Levi leads, are participating in the Phase 3 study of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Levi himself also got an injection. “I had pain in my arm for two days, muscle pain. Thirty percent of people get a little fever, like the flu. That is why it is also advisable to take paracetamol before vaccination. But the staff are doing well,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who has any major complaints.”</p><p>In the Western world, the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Pfizer are the furthest along in developing a COVID-19 vaccine. Levi said that “everything indicates that these two vaccines have a good immune response against the <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/your-cough-cloud-is-7-to-23-times-larger-when-youre-not-wearing-a-mask/">coronavirus</a> and are safe.”</p><h2>Calculated risks</h2><p>“I don’t think it’s rocket science,” <a href="https://www.ad.nl/wetenschap/doe-niet-zo-krampachtig-en-breng-het-coronavaccin-nu-al-op-de-markt~a1526f7c/">Levi told the newspaper</a>. “AstraZeneca’s Oxford vaccine is now being tested on 50,000 people, and one person has experienced a serious side effect but has also recovered. Contrast that to the many hundreds of people who die every day, to hospitals that are filling up. And the only remedy we have now is shutting down society. Shouldn’t we have the courage to say: we will release it?”<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>“You take a certain risk by releasing the vaccine now. But it is a limited, very small risk,” he said. “And you take that because the alternative is much worse. Let’s assume there’s a 1 in 50,000 risk of a serious side effect with the Oxford vaccine. The chance that you will have a traffic accident in the Netherlands is 1 in 1000 per year. Nobody is talking about that. You have to put things in perspective.”</p><p>In the Netherlands, <a href="https://www.government.nl/government/members-of-cabinet/hugo-de-jonge">Health Minster Hugo de Jonge</a> has taken a more cautious approach. He has said that a vaccine is unlikely to become available in the Netherlands before the first months of 2021.</p><p>“If there are images from England of rows of people getting vaccinated,” Levi said, “then I think it will happen everywhere, including in the Netherlands.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>I feel like I should start off this blog post by mentioning that I am a Product Designer with little to no development skills, so I heavily rely on no-code tools to get my side projects up and running.</code></p>
<p>The idea of creating something that thousands of users could potentially use was just so exciting to me. Over the course of just shy of a year, I worked on 2 projects that made me less than $20, <strong>combined</strong>, so I feel like it's safe to say I can share my experience with you guys and hopefully you'll learn from my mistakes.</p>

<p> <img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604131920818/D9DxXPfJk.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Custom Size – 3.png"></p>
<p>Oof, designtarget was a wild ride. On 18-8-2019, god knows what happened but I just hopped on Namecheap and purchased the domain <a href="http://designtarget.org/" target="_blank">designtarget.org</a> with no prior experience in web development. I was just so into the idea of creating the 'ultimate design directory' that I really didn't think anything through. How would I monetize the platform? Do I even have a list of resources that I can work with? Where will I market the website? So many questions, and little to no answers.</p>
<p>I remembered seeing an ad for a visual editor plugin on Wordpress called Elementor, it seemed intuitive so I go to Namecheap's cPanel and install Wordpress, purchase a year's subscription to Elementor and I get building. Literally next day I was done, I didn't think the design through, I just wanted to get an MVP out right away, and this atrociousness was born, but I was proud of it. I had no web development knowledge and I made a website, and it felt great.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604132243316/TKr68CyWaA.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Web 1920 – 1.png"></p>
<p>Naturally, I wanted people to see what I had built, so I go on Reddit and post the website on /r/webdev - no it wasn't a Saturday(you can only post your work on Feedback Saturday on /r/webdev), yes the post was locked. But that doesn't matter, why you ask?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604132936013/UONs_j1_Z.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 1.png"></p>
<p>8.5k visitors in less than 2 hours of being on reddit when I wasn't supposed to. I knew I was onto something, but a little after the hype died down, it dawned on me, I just missed a huge chance to build an audience. I rushed creating the website that I missed some essentials such as <strong>creating a newsletter sign up</strong> or even just a <strong>blog</strong>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few months, I eventually create a newsletter, Instagram page, and even a blog. </p>
<p>📧 ~300 newsletter subscribers.</p>
<p>📸 ~400 Instagram followers.</p>
<p>and most importantly, my blogs were ranking on Google. I don't have Search Console screenshots but I had ranked around ~11th or so for a few articles. </p>
<p>I had solved the traffic problem of any side project, but monetization was where this project went downhill. I simply had no monetization plan whatsoever. And this is where the story of designtarget, ends, well, I sold off the project for a measly amount but that was it.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned:</h3>
<p>👉 No matter how excited you are, keep cool and think things through.</p>
<p>👉 Traffic is easy, business is hard. </p>
<p>👉 Think things through, but also do not spend much time working on an MVP.</p>
<p>👉 It is fine to not know what you're doing.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604133785236/39YjxeLlg.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="screencapture-moeminm-github-io-goodcode-2020-10-31-10_42_27.png"></p>
<p>This one is close to my heart, it really is. You can read my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/good-code/temporarily-pausing-work-on-good-code--MKnKtlnidKMGLMQAuyr">post on IndieHackers</a> to know why I stopped working on Good Code.</p>
<p>The idea originally came to me when I discovered  <a target="_blank" href="http://frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a>, by then I had learned HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript and wanted to improve my skills. I liked FEM, but the free templates were just not the level of design I wanted to work on, queue Good Code.</p>
<p>This time, I was ready, monetization plan was straight-forward, content was ready, community building was in place, newsletter was in place. I cook up a static version of the website using HTML and CSS and release it on Github Pages, you can view Good Code  <a target="_blank" href="https://moeminm.github.io/goodcode">here</a> and straight to reddit I go (and IndieHackers this time as well). </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604134249747/BPvkUcJ5j.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 2.png"></p>
<p>September 3rd, to September 15th. I was onto something, again. Shortly after launching, I view my Gumroad page only to find 2 customers have purchased templates for a total of $10. My first internet money! </p>
<p>I also had people posting their solutions on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCodeChallenge/">subreddit</a>  I created just for this website, it felt great.</p>
<p>I really wanted to continue working on Good Code, as it stands, it's only hosted on GH Pages, so there's a good chance there <em>could</em> have been more sales had it been on an actual domain. I might resume working on Good Code in a future date, but for now, I'm pausing for reasons listed in the  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/good-code/temporarily-pausing-work-on-good-code--MKnKtlnidKMGLMQAuyr">IndieHackers post</a>. </p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned:</h3>
<p>👉 Spin ideas. I could have just released this as just another website selling Adobe XD templates, but I feel like the 'improve your HTML and CSS skills' twist was what brought this to life.</p>
<p>👉 Create a community for your side-project.</p>
<p> 👉 Don't be afraid to shut down.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, had I not started designtarget, I wouldn't have learned how to code (albeit being bad at it), had I not learned how to code, I wouldn't have started Good Code and made my first $ from a side-project, who knows what my next had I not started is going to be, but I feel like it might be success.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the last years I’ve been working on very different operating
systems. Operating systems are usually incredibly complex beasts. I
think there are mainly three drivers of this complexity. Surprisingly
enough, neither of these is having to deal with hardware.</p>

<p>The first one is resource <strong>discovery</strong>, i.e. figuring out how the
computer the OS is running on actually looks like. On x86, this
involves parsing countless bitfields, tables, executing byte code
provided by the firmware, probing individual features, etc. The most
painful example of this I’ve seen so far is figuring out which
interrupt a particular PCI interrupt line is routed to. It’s worth a
set of posts, but until then, feel free to checkout <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/501912/">this
description</a>. (If it’s down, it’s
also cached by
<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CXZUV61m7hwJ:https://habr.com/en/post/501912/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk">Google</a>.)</p>

<p>The second issue is <strong>resource management</strong>. Essentially, how do you
hand out and eventually reclaim all the resources you discovered. For
some workloads performance matters here, so this code is usually
written with speed in mind.</p>

<p>The third reason is that at compile time the <strong>workload</strong> is
unclear. So the kernel has to assume the worst. It must be ready to
start a couple of hundred VMs or create a thousand TCP sockets in a
blink of an eye, because there is no way to know what’s going to
happen or what the actual requirements are.</p>

<p>A fun exercise is to checkout the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/virt/kvm/kvm_main.c#L739">KVM code for creating
VMs</a>. Try
to follow
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c#L9904">the</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c#L7059">code</a>
to where the actual VM is created in hardware. <em>Spoiler:</em> There is
none. It’s all figuring out what the platform can do and then setting
up a bunch of spinlock, mutexes, lists, arrays, structs, …</p>

<p>I don’t want to pick on KVM in particular. I think it’s pretty ok as
far as Linux kernel code goes. Operating System kernel code is mostly
like this: A lot of really mind numbing platform discovery and
resource management code written for speed assuming the worst case
requirements in a language that doesn’t do parsing, resource
management or concurrency well (among other things).</p>

<p>People take this all for granted. But when I look around, I see many
systems that don’t need this complexity and where it is only a safety
and security burden. Consider most appliance-type products, e.g. a
Wi-Fi router. Or a system that runs one service on a cloud VM. You
know everything in advance!</p>

<p>If you read until this point, you are probably asking yourself, where
I am going with this. If you think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_kernel">separation
kernel</a>, you are
right. My rough plan to write a couple of more posts to flesh out the
idea of doing all the complicated OS parts at compile time and how
this results in an incredibly simple, secure, and efficient system at
runtime. There will be <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a>,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>,
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> content.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

October 31, 2020 | https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<p><small>Compiled on the basis of the original list presented here: <i><a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of genius and creativity</a></i>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> (2001)</small>
</p>
<h2><span id="How_to_become_a_genius">How to become a genius</span></h2>
<p>A majority of people carry the potential to become a genius. There are factors that are far <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_formula_for_high_intelligence" title="Simple formula for high intelligence">more important than genes and IQ</a>. I have compiled a checklist that I believe should work, when followed. All you need to begin with is to be free and reasonably healthy. I try to list the factors that prevent many people from accomplishing their greatest potential. The list begins with the stumbling blocks that are most likely to occur on one's road to genius. Some factors need to be balanced against each other, and some factors overlap. For example, the first three preconditions of genius are strongly related: freedom from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">good sleep</a>, and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. They may provide the key to answering why we are not (yet) a planet of geniuses. I listed individual points separately on the basis of their ability to motivate and inspire. Before you start reading, however, remember what Herbert Simon said about genius: it takes about ten years to develop it. Not only will you have to meet all the criteria listed below, but lots of hard work and patience will be required before you climb that summit!
</p>
<p>If you follow these rules religiously, you will be amazed by how much progress you can make in a decade</p> 
<p>If I scare you with a decade-long time-frame, remember that chances are good that you will love your self-transformation in weeks. The younger you are, the 'messier' your life, the less you know about your future, the more powerful the effect.
</p>
<h3><span id="Eliminate_stress">Eliminate stress</span></h3>
<p>Stress is understood here as rapid change resulting in an increase in stress hormones (catecholamines, ACTH, cortisol, etc.). Stressful change can come from conflict, illness, the death of a relative, or unemployment. Stress can also result from seemingly happy events such as a wedding or a hasty vacation. A simple test here is to make sure that creative problems circulate in your mind while you are brushing your teeth. You will fail the test if, instead of creative thinking, you are preoccupied with problems at work or in the family. Stress will dramatically cut down your creative efficiency. Most of all, it will affect your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>: another cornerstone of genius. In addition, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic_stress" title="Chronic stress">chronic stress</a> will result in excess cortisol, increased activity in the sympathetic system, and a resulting inhibition of neurogenesis, memory consolidation, creativity, and more. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">Stress resilience</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Sleep">Sleep</span></h3>
<p>Make sure to always get as much quality sleep as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">your brain requires</a>. The simplest first step is: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Kill_the_alarm_clock" title="Kill the alarm clock">throw away your alarm clock</a>! Lack of sleep delivers a quadruple whammy: (1) it suppresses memory consolidation, (2) it prevents <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">memory optimization</a>, (3) it makes you unwilling to exert mental effort, and (4) it undermines your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. Submit to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">natural creativity cycle</a>. For more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">Science of sleep</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</span></h3>
<p>Lack of self-discipline aggravated by stress and a lack of sleep is the number one cause of low productivity. The trick to achieving good self-discipline is to make incremental progress, and convert discipline into a habit and then into the pleasure of productivity (for more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</a>).
If you develop healthy self-discipline habits early, your life is likely to take an entirely different course. If you believe you are lacking in this field, try the following exercise: as soon as a valuable activity comes to your mind that you are really unwilling to do, <b>do it</b>. Within the scope and in agreement with human biology, your rational brain must be the master of your decision making. Stand over a pool of cold water. Do you hate jumping in? The more you hate it, the sooner you should jump. And in the end you will <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Winter_swimming" title="Winter swimming">love it</a>. A cold shower is a minor inconvenience once you experience the volitional power of the brain. You need to master the skill of perfect execution of your own plans. The more precise your plan, the harder it is to execute, yet the more tangible the results. Learn to delay gratification. If you focus on your long-term goals, your daily inconveniences will be more bearable or even pleasurable. A strenuous quest towards the goal is the best reward for a genius mind. Minor awards of laziness do not befit a true genius. Think of self-discipline daily. Even the strongest minds can relax it all too easily. Remember about stress and sleep. Stress and sleepiness are chief factors that undermine self-discipline. Self-discipline cannot quarrel with biology. In extreme cases, it can actually <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/War_of_the_networks" title="War of the networks">undermine your genius</a>. If you are sick, stop working. If you are sleepy, go to sleep. For comfort, you should know, that with each passing year, self-discipline will gradually transform into a pleasure. Not only will you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">execute your plans instinctively</a>, you will also reap the benefits of your earlier efforts to steer your life in a good direction. In later years, you will not need much self-discipline to employ your genius mind to do good things.
</p>
<h3><span id="Learn_day_and_night">Learn day and night</span></h3>
<p>Knowledge is the substance you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">convert to great ideas</a>. Although it is possible to learn in stress or in a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deficit</a>, learning is listed here behind stress, sleep and self-discipline. This is because humans exhibit <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">inborn curiosity</a> that makes them crave learning. TV, tabloid press, and social media thrive on this need for learning. Most people understand the importance of learning but are prevented from executing their plans due to stress, lack of sleep or lack of self-discipline. To breed genius, your whole life should revolve around learning. You should use every single little opportunity to learn important things. This could be reading Einstein's biography or talking with a homeless person. Read, talk, watch, surf, and keep on thinking. Do not avoid hard subjects (e.g. mathematics). Mold your learning strictly to your creative needs, but do not fail to explore a wide range of topics. Touch all the bases and avoid tunnel vision! Remember that your success in learning will require appropriate <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">knowledge representation</a> and timing of review (as in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>). Are you lacking a university education? <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_dropouts" title="School dropouts">Never mind</a>. Look at Edison, Lincoln, or Leibnitz to see the power of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-learning" title="Self-learning">self-instruction</a>. All the seemingly contradictory requirements listed above can be reconciled if you structure your learning with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advantages_of_incremental_reading" title="Advantages of incremental reading">Advantages of incremental reading</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Abstract_knowledge">Abstract knowledge</span></h3>
<p>Except for a great deal of learning, you will need to pay attention to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">quality of knowledge</a> and its general <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a>. You cannot just memorize thousands of facts. You have to consciously explore areas such as logic, probability, statistics, game theory, decision theory, computing sciences, optimization, as well as other branches of mathematics and sciences. You have to develop a love for logical thinking, the scientific method, and skepticism. Even if you are a movie critic, you will still need quality logic to frame your judgment. Remember that all knowledge is volatile and may be subject to falsification at any time. Keep your mind open to new truths even if they seem to turn your present vision of the world upside down
</p>
<h3><span id="Knowledge_representation">Knowledge representation</span></h3>
<p>The main thing that makes a genius brain stand out is its ability to store <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">quality knowledge</a> in a way that is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">easy to remember</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">easy to use</a>. A genius mind can see complex things in a simple form. It looks at the same text or picture and sees a dozen times more than an average individual. An average reader will say: <i>"I understand, so what?"</i>. A genius reader will say: <i>"Eureka!"</i>, and list several applications of the just acquired piece of knowledge. Geniuses simplify while learning. They <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalize</a>. They build <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract models</a>. They develop abstract languages for representing knowledge. Those representation skills can also be developed by training. Have you ever tried to learn Kanji (Japanese language symbols)? If you see Kanji as a tangle of confused sticks, you are a typical beginner. Over time, however, Kanji symbols should begin to sing to you and talk to you in their own language. Once you pass the first few hundred, the next thousand should go smoothly. The same happens if you learn the 20x20 multiplication table. With time you learn simple tricks for running simple and repetitive calculations. Instead of memorizing 20x20 combinations, you limit yourself to a standard 10x10 table (just 25% of all combinations) and add to this a few rules for manipulating numbers in your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Working_memory" title="Working memory">working memory</a>. The best way to develop good representations is to (1) understand the way the memory works (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">20 rules of formulating knowledge</a>), (2) consciously modify representations in the learning process (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> supports this process naturally) (3) work on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> (the more you learn the easier it becomes), and (4) get <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep" title="Good sleep">good sleep</a> to employ <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Neural optimization in sleep">neural optimization in sleep</a>. If you encounter a difficult problem in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>, postpone it. With luck, some other information source will present to you a better representation that is easier to assimilate.
</p>
<h3><span id="Health">Health</span></h3>
<p>Take obsessive care of your health! Keep your blood pressure down (high blood pressure damages your brain), do not <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Impact_of_alcohol_on_sleep" title="Impact of alcohol on sleep">abuse alcohol</a> (any dose that visibly affects your mental performance may be poisonous to your brain), use medication only when absolutely necessary, exercise, stay away from smoking or illicit drugs, learn medical sciences!!! Your brain is a highly sensitive organ that needs a healthy environment to operate in. Health and understanding of the biological needs of your brain may dramatically affect your performance in the long run. Don't waste time on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_common_cold_prevention" title="Formula for common cold prevention">colds and flu</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>October 25, 2020</p></header><section><h3>Problem</h3>
<p>It’s very common while building any project we use certain third party libraries, in the case of Javascript; <code>npm packages</code>, which recursively use more packages, and eventually your code includes a huge chunk of third party code.<br>
There is nothing wrong with it, there is no point re-inventing the wheel. We include the required library, make our code work, write tests. Deploy to a staging environment, pass through automation and finally deploy to production.  </p>
<p>The problem is when a library tries to load remote content on our website. It can be an image, font, style, or even Javascript. This content bypasses all our tests, checks, and is executed directly on production. Even worse we don’t know where the content is being served from.</p>
<h3>Content Security Policy</h3>
<p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/">W3C specification</a> that helps to avoid <code>XSS</code> attacks. CSP enables developers to define rules for fetching the resources(images, javascript, fonts, etc.) on the client browser. Developers can define policies to allow/restrict loading any resource, restrict resources to load only from certain domains, and disallow from any other domain. For example, you can write a CSP to restrict browsers to load images only from <code>example.com</code>, any images from other domains will be not loaded and would throw errors. In addition to resources, CSP also offers control over the embeds.<br>
In the following example, the CSP forces to load images/scripts only from self domain and prevents the loading of images from other domains.</p>

    </span></p>
<p><em>From the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/">W3c specification</a> docs:</em> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the CSP goal is to mitigate the risk of content-injection attacks by giving developers fairly granular control over</p>
<ul>
<li>The resources which can be requested (and subsequently embedded or executed) on behalf of a specific Document or Worker</li>
<li>The execution of inline script</li>
<li>Dynamic code execution (via eval() and similar constructs)</li>
<li>The application of inline style</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>CSP can be implemented in following two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Specify in <strong>HTTP headers</strong> </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: __Policy__</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify in <strong>META tags</strong> </p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span> <span>http-equiv</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Content-Security-Policy<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span> __Policy__ <span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Defining a policy</h4>
<p>The Policy is the accumulation of directives which defines the allowed location of each resource, no directive means allowed for all. Some of the useful directives are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>default-src</em> : This defines the loading policy for all types of resources.</li>
<li><em>script-src</em> : This defines the loading policy for all javascript, from where javascript can be loaded.</li>
<li><em>img-src</em> : This defines the loading policy for all images, from where images can be loaded. </li>
</ul>
<p>List of directives for the other resources is <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp#policy_applies_to_a_wide_variety_of_resources">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples of policies are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';</code></pre></div>
<p>This would allow resources only from the same domain, and all other resources will fail to load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: img-src example.com;</code></pre></div>
<p>This would allow images only from <code>example.com</code>, and all other images will fail to load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src example.com;</code></pre></div>
<p>This would allow any resources to load only if from the same domain, except images which can be from <code>example.com</code> too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Reporting</h4>
<p>CSP also provides a way to send violation reports, in case any logging is required, via <code>report-uri</code> directive. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.com/cspfails` </code></pre></div>
<p>The reports will be sent as POST request and with following JSON: </p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
 <span>"csp-report"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>"document-uri"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://example.com/"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"referrer"</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"blocked-uri"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://example.com/some_malware.js"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"violated-directive"</span><span>:</span> <span>"default-src self"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"original-policy"</span><span>:</span> <span>"default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.com/cspfails"</span>
 <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<br>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>Before defining a CSP you should be completely aware of all the resources and respective origin required for your webapp, else some vital resources may be blocked and eventually random bugs.
In case you are not sure what all resources are being required for running your web page smoothly, you can implement the CSP in reporting mode, in this way the violations will be reported but no resource will be blocked, once you are sure what are the resources really required, you can implement CSP. To do this instead of <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> we need to use <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: __Policy__ + report-uri</code></pre></div>

  2020-10-31
</p>
<p>I recently released <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.3/">Oil 0.8.3</a>, and it's the biggest release in
recent memory!  What's new?</p>
<ul>
<li>Many changes to the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil expression language</a>, including
Python compatibility and legacy syntax removal.</li>
<li>Changes to the <strong>word</strong> syntax, e.g. the <code>@</code> sigil.</li>
<li>Keyword changes, like the removal of <code>pass</code>.</li>
<li>New <strong>functions</strong>, like <code>_match()</code> to access <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">eggex</a> matches.</li>
<li>Enhancements to <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=shell-builtin#shell-builtin">shell builtins</a>, including <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>
support in <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>.</li>
<li>The comprehensive <code>errexit</code> overhaul, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/10/osh-features.html#reliable-error-handling">mentioned in the last
post</a>.</li>
<li>Many new docs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first of two posts that describe the language changes.  Separately,
I plan to write "the ultimate guide" to error handling in shell.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Oil, see the <strong>new</strong> <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/language-influences.html">Language
Influences</a> and  <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language
Idioms</a> docs, as well as posts tagged
#<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">oil-language</a>.</p>
 
<a name="help-wanted"></a>
<h2>Help Wanted</h2>
<p>If you're interested in Oil, now is a great time to get involved.  Recall that
the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/10/osh-features.html">last post</a> said that OSH would have four significant
fixes, but the rest of the project was too much work.  <strong>The work described
here is what I need help with</strong>!</p>
<p>Toward the end, I recently updated these pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil#important-we-accept-small-contributions">We Accept Small Contributions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Contributing">Contributing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Asking questions and leaving feedback about the language on
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zulip#zulip">Zulip</a> is also appreciated!  Several people have influenced the
language design this way.</p>
<a name="operators-expression-mode"></a>
<h2>Operators (Expression Mode)</h2>
<p>The expression language lets you talk about typed data with operators and
literals.  Let's review those changes first.</p>
<a name="return-to-python-compatibility"></a>
<h3>Return to Python Compatibility</h3>
<p>Last year, Oil had some "cleanups" of the Python expression language, but I
decided that the unfamiliarity isn't worth it.  I reverted them, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer division <code>div</code> is back to <code>//</code></li>
<li>Modulus <code>mod</code> is back to <code>%</code></li>
<li><code>xor</code> is back to <code>^</code></li>
<li>Exponentiation <code>^</code> is back to <code>**</code></li>
</ul>
<p>(The <a href="#appendix">appendix</a> has some rationale for this.)</p>
<a name="to-concatenate-and-to-match-globs"></a>
<h3><code>++</code> to concatenate, <code>~~</code> and <code>!~~</code> to match globs</h3>
<p>The <code>++</code> operator is for string and list concatenation.  That is, <code>a + b</code>
always does <strong>math</strong>, and <code>a ++ b</code> always does concatenation.</p>
<p>This is to support Awk-like auto-type conversion.  Similarly, comparison
operators like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> will only work on numbers, and we'll use a
different syntax for strings.  (Yes, I realize the danger with such type
conversion!)</p>
<p>The <code>~~</code> and <code>!~~</code> operators are for glob matching.  They deprecate <code>[[ x == *.py ]]</code> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.</p>
<a name="literals-expression-mode"></a>
<h2>Literals (Expression Mode)</h2>
<a name="dicts-are-not"></a>
<h3>Dicts are <code>{}</code>, not <code>%{}</code></h3>
<p>This is another return to Python compatibility.</p>
<p>We used sigils like <code>%{foo: 42}</code> in dict literals because Oil uses <code>{ }</code> for
C-like statement  blocks, and it lacks semicolons.</p>
<p>Making the tokens distinct is one way to avoid a subtle parsing issue.  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22706645">This
Hacker News comment</a> about the
Dart language describes some of the difficulties with using <code>{}</code>  in both
expressions and statements.</p>
<p>However, Oil's problem  is not as hard as Dart's, and I solved it by simply
including newlines in the grammar.  A key-value pair can be on a line:</p>
<pre><code>var mydict = {
  server: "www.example.com"  
  port: 80
}
</code></pre>
<p>But you can't split it across lines</p>
<pre><code>
var mydict = {
  server:
    "www.example.com"
}
</code></pre>
<p>without either <code>()</code> or <code>\</code>:</p>
<pre><code>var mydict = {
  
  server: (
    "www.example.com"
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>It was bugging me that lists are just <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, while dicts were <code>%{key: 'value'}</code>.  This is now fixed!</p>
<p>(<a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/121540-oil-discuss/topic/Expression.20Language.20Improvements/near/212235586">Good Zulip Feedback on Line
Breaking</a>.
I'm still looking for more feedback.)</p>
<hr>
<p>I also removed the <code>%[]</code> syntax , which was an overly ambitious idea for typed
array literals.  We already have <code>%(one two)</code> for shell-like arrays, and
<code>['one', 'two']</code> for Python/JS-like lists.</p>
<p>(Aside: Perl and Ruby have <code>qw(one two)</code> or <code>qw[one two]</code> which is like our
<code>%(one two)</code>.)</p>
<a name="blocks-are-echo-pwd"></a>
<h3>Blocks are <code>&amp;(echo $PWD)</code></h3>
<p>Oil's Ruby-like blocks are "first class".  Normally they're passed to procs as
the last argument:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp {
  echo $PWD
}
</code></pre>
<p>But we also need them in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/command-vs-expression-mode.html">expression
mode</a>.
I decided on the syntax <span><code>&amp;(echo $PWD)</code></span>.</p>
<p>This may seem inconsistent at first, but it's consistent with command subs:</p>
<pre><code>var b1 = $(echo $PWD)  
var b2 = &amp;(echo $PWD)  
</code></pre>
<a name="chars-are-u012345"></a>
<h3>Chars are <code>\u{012345}</code></h3>
<p>Character literals <strong>stand alone</strong> in the expression language, like</p>
<pre><code>var x = \u{3bf}  
</code></pre>
<p>That is, you don't need quotes.  They're for both "code point literals"
("runes" in Go) and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">eggex</a> char classes.</p>
<p>This syntax is now consistent within C-escaped strings like <code>$''</code> and <code>c''</code>,
and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>, which leads us into the next section.</p>
<a name="tightened-up-string-literals"></a>
<h2>Tightened Up String Literals</h2>
<p>Shell has a rich string literal syntax.  Oil inherits all of its power, but (as
of this release) removes unnecessary flexibility.</p>
<a name="c-style"></a>
<h3>C-Style</h3>
<p>Here are some C-style strings:</p>
<pre><code>echo $'C-style'
echo $'\n \i'               
echo $'\0123 \x01 \x1'      
echo $' \u1234 \U00012345'  
</code></pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>\n</code> is a valid char escape, but <code>\i</code> is an <strong>invalid</strong> one.  Bash accepts
it and prints <code>\i</code> literally.</li>
<li>Octal escapes and hex escapes can express exactly the same bytes.</li>
<li>Hex escapes can be abbreviated <code>\x1</code> instead of <code>\x01</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I made the following changes to simplify this syntax:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disallow invalid char escapes.</li>
<li>Disallow <strong>all</strong> octal escapes.</li>
<li>Disallow single char hex escapes.  Must be <code>\xHH</code>.</li>
<li>Disallow the two unicode escapes in favor of the QSN/Rust style <code>\u{12345}</code>,
which I added support for.</li>
</ol>
<p>As usual, <strong>we do a dance to avoid breaking existing code</strong>, while preventing
legacy from creeping into the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In command mode, <code>shopt --unset parse_backslash</code> enables all these syntax
errors.  This is the default in <code>bin/oil</code> (option group <code>oil:all</code>).</li>
<li>In expression mode, they're always disallowed, even when running <code>bin/osh</code>.
Legacy shell scripts don't have expressions, so this is OK!</li>
</ul>
<a name="a-superset-of-qsn"></a>
<h3>A Superset of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have <code>\u{12345}</code>, we have an interesting property: any <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>
string is now an Oil string!  Though you have to add a <code>$</code> sigil:</p>
<pre><code>echo $'QSN and Oil \\ \n'    

var mystr = $'\x01 \u{3bf}'  
var mystr = c'\x01 \u{3bf}'  
</code></pre>
<a name="double-quoted"></a>
<h3>Double Quoted</h3>
<p>Here are some doubled quoted strings:</p>
<pre><code>echo "double quoted"
echo "\$ \i"         
echo "\\ \ ."        
echo "\$ $ ."        
echo "old: `hostname`, new: $(hostname)"  
</code></pre>
<p>Oil makes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parse_backslash</code> makes <code>\i</code> and <code>\</code> a syntax error.  Add the
<code>\</code> to fix it.</li>
<li><code>parse_dollar</code> makes <code>$</code> a syntax error.  Ditto.</li>
<li><code>parse_backticks</code> makes the old command sub style a syntax
error.  Use the new style.</li>
</ul>
<p>These options are <strong>unset</strong> in the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/oil-options.html">option group</a>
<code>oil:all</code>.</p>
<p>Aside: our <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=lexing#lexing">lexing style</a> is awesome for making these
changes!</p>
<a name="word-syntax-command-mode"></a>
<h2>Word Syntax (Command Mode)</h2>
<p>I made similar changes to <strong>unquoted words</strong>.</p>
<a name="parse_at_all-reserves-words-beginning-with"></a>
<h3><code>parse_at_all</code> Reserves Words Beginning With <code>@</code></h3>
<p>In the <code>oil:basic</code> option group, we allow this syntax, but we only break the
bare minimum:</p>
<pre><code>echo @myarray
</code></pre>
<p>But the <code>oil:all</code> option group reserves <strong>any</strong> word beginning with <code>@</code>, like:</p>
<pre><code>@{} @[] @// @'' @""
</code></pre>
<p>This will be useful for future language extensions.  That is, creating more
syntax errors lets the language <strong>evolve</strong>.</p>
<p>I also expect <code>shopt --unset parse_dollar</code> to have this benefit.  It allows us
to parse inline eggexes like <code>$/ digit+ /</code>.</p>
<a name="parse_dollar-again-for-strictness"></a>
<h3><code>parse_dollar</code> Again, For Strictness</h3>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p>No:</p>
<pre><code>echo $
echo "$"
</code></pre>
<p>Yes:</p>
<pre><code>echo \$
echo "\$"
</code></pre>
<p>TODO: We also need to support <code>strict_backslash</code> in unquoted words.</p>
<a name="next"></a>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>This post got long, so I split it into two parts.  The next part will review
changes in Oil keywords, stdlib functions, shell builtins, and documentations.</p>
<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jle86e/big_changes_to_the_oil_language/?">Let me know</a> what you think of these changes!</p>

<a name="appendix-the-tea-language"></a>
<h2>Appendix: The Tea Language</h2>
<p>One reason to be more Python compatible is that I have a quixotic plan to
self-host Oil and expose the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=metalanguage#metalanguage">metalanguage</a> to users.  That is, our DSLs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=opy#opy">OPy</a> / <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mypy#mypy">MyPy</a> subset</li>
<li>Zephyr <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zephyr-asdl#zephyr-asdl">ASDL</a></li>
<li>A dialect of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=regular-language#regular-language">regular languages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>should be combined into one language, which I'm calling "Tea".</p>
<p>Against my better judgement, I brought this up <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/jb5i5m/help_i_keep_stealing_features_from_elixir_because/g8urxou/">on
Reddit</a>
and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/4hx42h/assorted_thoughts_on_zig_rust#c_mqpg6e">on
lobste.rs</a>.
Briefly, Tea can be described as <strong>statically-typed Python with sum types</strong>
— which someone asked actually for!</p>
<p>And it should have <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=metaprogramming#metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> features to express the equivalent
of Oil's use of textual code generation.</p>
<p>I wrote a working grammar to design Tea's syntax (*), but that's the only
implementation so far.  It would be a large project, but it's also a concrete
one, because we have 30K-60K+ lines of working code as a use case.</p>
<p>If you want to work on a statically typed language, let me know!  I don't know
how to write a type checker, and can use help.</p>
<p>Even if Tea doesn't get done, Oil will be useful either way.  We can continue
using these DSLs for a long time.</p>
<hr>
<p>(*) The entire language is expressed in the grammar as a big expression, using
a single <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=lexer-modes#lexer-modes">lexer mode</a>.  It's nowhere near as complicated as
shell!</p>

                        <p>A pilot project using sniffer dogs to provide instant and pain-free coronavirus testing at Helsinki airport has shown promising early results and proven popular with travellers, researchers said on Wednesday.</p><p>Three dogs, named Kossi, ET and Miina, have sniffed swabs taken from 2,200 passengers in the month since the testing booth was set up at the airport's arrivals hall, and have found the virus in 0.6 percent of travellers.</p><p>Although the research is not due for completion until December, the team say the initial findings appear broadly in line with detection rates of the nasal PCR tests also conducted on arriving travellers.</p><p>"We have done 16-17,000 PCR tests at the airport and less than one percent are positive," Timo Aronkyto, deputy mayor of Vantaa, told reporters.</p><p>Compared to the results found by the dogs, "they are about the same, I don't think there is a statistical difference," Aronkyto said.</p><p>The researchers are now analysing how closely the two sets of test results match each other -- whether the dogs found coronavirus in passengers whose infection was confirmed by a PCR test -- and hope to publicise their findings at the end of the year.</p><p>Preliminary experiments in the first major wave of infections earlier in the year suggested the dogs can detect the virus with close to 100 percent accuracy, up to five days earlier than a PCR test.</p><p>Feedback from arriving passengers, who take the free-of-charge test voluntarily, "has been exceptionally positive," project manager Soile Turunen said. </p><p>Around 100 travellers a day have been queuing up for the test, which involves wiping a swab onto the skin which is then put in front of the dog, who will quickly pass over a negative sample but will be attracted to a positive one.</p><p>"People don't complain about the queues, in fact it's the opposite," Turunen said. </p><p>"They're coming up to us to to say 'Hi' from morning until evening," she added.</p><p>A fourth dog, a German shepherd called Valo, is currently in training to begin work at the airport testing booth.</p><p>The Helsinki University researchers behind the trial, working with sniffer-dog specialists from the organisation Wise Nose, hope that their research will persuade the government to fund a rollout of the dogs for other uses, such as at tourist hotspots or large public gatherings.</p><p>Although sniffer dog trials have been undertaken elsewhere, such as in the UAE, France, Ruussia and Chile, use of canine scent-detectors to bolster coronavirus testing has not yet been widely adopted by authorities, in part because of a lack of peer-reviewed literature, some researchers believe.</p><p>Dog handling charities have previously worked with dogs to detect cancers, Parkinson's disease and bacterial infections using samples taken from humans.</p>

<p><b>LIL</b> (stands for <b>L</b>ittle <b>I</b>nterpreted <b>L</b>anguage)
is a small highly dynamic scripting language inspired by Tcl and
unix shells. LIL has two implementations, one written in <b>C</b>,
which consists of a pair of <tt>.c</tt> and <tt>.h</tt> files
and one in <b><a href="http://freepascal.org/">Free Pascal</a></b>,
which consists of a single <tt>pas</tt> file (a unit). Also a
<a href="http://lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus</a> package for the
latter is provided.</p>

<h2><a name="downloads"></a>Downloads</h2>

<p>LIL is currently available as source code snapshots of both
the C and the Free Pascal version combined in a single ZIP file.
These snapshots are versioned using their release date. Note that
the interpreter's reflect version command will report <i>0.1</i>
regardless of date versioning. Both of these will change at some
point in the future to provide proper versioned releases.</p>

<h3><a name="latestversion"></a>Latest version</h3>

<p>The latest version of LIL is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lil20190821.zip">lil20190821.zip</a>
(159KB). This is an extract from my private Fossil repository
(the files are mostly the same as the older archives, but this
also includes a full changelog from the repository going back
to 2010 and the LIL logo as an XCF image which can be opened with
GIMP).</p>

<p>Please note that <b>20190821</b> contains slightly altered
behavior for line breaking during list parsing that <i>could</i>
affect some scripts, especially with lists that contain code inside
square brackets, however the previous behavior was completely
broken (e.g. having multiple commands inside brackets in a list
would merge all commands into a single one and if a semicolon
was used for the multiple commands, the entire command wouldn't
be parsed properly). Because of that i expect any reliance on
the previous behavior to be accidental (and in practice i do not
really expect any such script to even exist). Also in the same
version a Bash script is introduced to check the differences between
different executables by running the same scripts under both and
comparing the results, which show that FPLIL contains a few incompatibilities
with C LIL. At this moment FPLIL doesn't implement the changes
mentioned so far - all these incompatibilities and changes will
be fixed in a later release.</p>

<h3><a name="olderversions"></a>Older versions</h3>

<p>Some older versions are also available in case you need them.
LIL should be mostly backwards compatible (see below), but right
now there is no promise for strict API or ABI compatibility.</p>

<h3><a name="winlil"></a>WinLIL</h3>

<p>If you are using Windows you can also download <b>WinLIL</b>,
a small Windows-based environment with editor, console and extra
graphics functions that can be used to experiment with LIL. It
is self-contained in a single executable, including the LIL documentation.</p>

<p>The latest version is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil14.zip">WinLIL 1.4</a>
(204KB) based on <i>C LIL 20190821</i>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil.png">Here
is a screenshot</a> of it in action. Also a small doodle program
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.lil">downloaded here</a> and a <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.gif">screenshot
seen here</a>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190821231511.zip">This archive</a>
(45KB) contains the source code, but note that it uses the original
Borland C++ Builder and to compile with a newer version (such
as the free Community Edition) you'll need to recreate the project
file and make a few modifications to the code.</p>

<p>Older versions of WinLIL can be found in these files: <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil13.zip">winlil13.zip</a>
(1.3 binary), <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190524200539.zip">winlil20190524200539.zip</a>
(1.3 source), <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20170425.zip">winlil20170424.zip</a>
(binary), <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlilsrc20161220.7z">winlilsrc20161220.7z</a>
(source).</p>

<h3><a name="lilgui"></a>LILGUI</h3>

<p><b>LILGUI</b> is an experimental API specification for GUI
applications that provide scripting functionality through LIL
to expose a simple GUI API. It is mainly intended for creating
embeddable GUIs (e.g. a panel in a sidebar) although it can also
be used for popup windows and dialogs. Currently the only implementation
for LILGUI is <b>LazLILGUI</b>, which is a component for Lazarus
that uses LCL to provide the actual GUI functionality.</p>

<p>The latest version of LILGUI files (which include the API spec,
LazLILGUI and a couple of examples) can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lilgui20190708215135.zip">downloaded
here</a> (85KB). A 64bit windows binary for <b>LazLILGUI Notepad</b>,
a text editor that provides a sidebar to try out LILGUI code,
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepad20190708.zip">downloaded here</a> (1.3MB).
Also you can see the screenshots of program in action under <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadwin.png">Windows</a>, <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadlin.png">Linux</a>
and <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadosx.png">Mac OS X</a> and also the <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgcce.png">Custom Control Example</a> under Windows.</p>

<h2><a name="stability"></a>API stability and compatibility</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, both the C and Free Pascal implementation
APIs are stable <i>for the most part</i>. The <b>C API</b> was
broken only once in middle 2010 when <code>lil_command_t</code>
was renamed to <code>lil_func_t</code> and the <b>C ABI</b> for
the Windows DLL is also backwards compatible since late 2010.
The <b>Free Pascal</b> implementation has a less stable API but
as Free Pascal itself does not support ABI stability, this is
less of a concern.</p>

<p>In the foreseeable future the C API should be stable, but i'd
recommend <i>against</i> building a system-wide shared version
of the library before a proper versioned release is made. Once
a versioned release is made, both the API and ABI will remain
stable for as long as it is technically possible.</p>

<p>Script code should be backwards compatible even as new commands
are introduced since scripts and host applications will redefine
any conflicting functions anyway. The only time script code was
broken was in 2012 when the multiline comments were introduced
so any script that used a comment line like <code>#####</code>
was broken. This was addressed in a fix in 2014 that added a special
check for such cases so that multiline comments can only start
and end with two <code>#</code>s but not three or more (while
this could have broken any script that used three or more <code>#</code>s
to start and end multiline comments, the chances for such a script
are very slim).</p>

<p>Like with the C API, the script backwards compatibility currently
is mostly stable, but minor changes (like the multiline comment
changes mentioned above) might be made until a versioned release
is made or fixes to the script behavior to be closer to what is
described in the documentation or simply fix broken behavior.
At that point no changes will be made that may affect backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>LILGUI and LazLILGUI are more experimental and may see backwards
incompatible changes in the future.</p>

<h2><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>

<p>Currently the only documentation is the (lengthy) <tt>readme.txt</tt>
file that <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/readme.txt">you can read here</a> or as part
of the archive containing the source code. At some point i'll
write better formatted documentation. Free Pascal has its own
API documentation <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/pasreadme.txt">readable here</a> and
also as a part of the archive containing the source code.</p>

<p>The LILGUI API can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/api.txt">found here</a> and
the documentation for LazLILGUI can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgreadme.txt">found
here</a>. Both are also part of the LILGUI archive.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/badsectoracula/lil-presentation">an
old LIL presentation can be found on SlideShare</a>. Please note
that the URLs in the presentation are not valid anymore.</p>

<h2><a name="status"></a>Status</h2>

<p>LIL is practically <i>feature-complete</i> and i do very little
development of it. I do not plan on making it a big and bloated
library that tries to provide everything - if anything, in the
future i might add some conditionals to remove bits of the library
for users who do not need, e.g, the string or list functions.</p>

<p>Further work is mostly "around" LIL and not on the
language itself: improving the documentation, writing a test suite
(currently there are several examples which i run after making
changes and almost half of them come from bug fixes, but i'd like
somethnig more automated), fixing some issues with the Free Pascal
implementation, adding more functions on the C API to access LIL's
state, etc.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>About every year or so I decide to change note-taking apps. Or at least I change <em>most</em> of my notes to a new app. This time I'm going back to an old app, but because of a "new" note-taking paradigm. The one I'm going back to is <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>, but with a twist. In this post, I hope to look at some of the new ideas in note-taking and some of the apps available.</p><p>The new paradigm that I'm talking about is backlinking. It's actually not a new idea at all of course, but there have been many apps that have started to take advantage of backlinking. The one that launched off the fad was <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. Many of these tools are based on or enable, a note-taking method called Zettelkasten.</p><p>Zettelkasten is a technique of note taking and indexing popularized by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist from the middle of the 20th century. Zettelkasten, literally "slip box", was a note-taking method in which small slips of paper were ID'd and linked to one another, creating a linked system of knowledge that Luhmann could then use in his books, research, and papers. As the links were maintained in two directions, ideas could be backward linked to other ideas. Ideas from various sources could then form a new network and hopefully, new links could be formed between information. There's more to it, such as the idea that each note should be an atomic, well-formed idea. For more information, and because I'm failing to explain it, visit <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">https://zettelkasten.de/</a>.</p><p>I won't pretend to be an expert in Zettelkasten, and all of this is new to me. Frankly, I'm not even sure that the Zettelkasten method would be useful to me as I need longer form notes on many of the things that I do. But the idea of backlinking notes so that you can refer to notes that refer to the note that you're on seems extremely powerful. It feels like the next innovation in note-taking, beyond simple outlining or linking, precisely because you're essentially forming a distributed network of notes.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2><p>Let me give you an example. Say that I'm working on Kubernetes and can't remember the name of a tool that I had used. I can just pull up the Kubernetes note and look at the backlinks and see which notes are tagged as Kubernetes. Why couldn't I just create a link on the Kubernetes note? Well, of course, I could, but that would require opening that note and adding a link that may have nothing to do with the context for the primary Kubernetes notes.</p><p>Or another example, I am taking notes on a sermon being preached on John 3. I can then dive into John 3's note and look at all other sources tagged with John 3, including sermon notes, book notes, or personal devotional notes. From there I could dive into individual topics such as love or the kingdom of God.</p><p>At least, that's how I hope it will work in practice. Again, I'm just getting started</p><p>It seems that with the release of Roam Research, there have now been a plethora of tools in development that work off of the idea of backlinks, as well as atomic thoughts. I've done a lot of research in the last week, and have formed some opinions about some. Let's start first with the note-taking app I'm coming from:</p><h2>Notion</h2><p><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> seemed to take off in 2018-2019 as the premiere note-taking app. Indeed, Notion has introduced backlinks in a recent release.</p><p>I like Notion, and will both keep paying for it and taking notes there. It has a lot of power in organizing and reorganizing notes, as well as pulling in other content such as code, videos, images, etc. It even goes so far as to include database-like tables and Kanban-style boards.</p><p>Backlinks in Notion seem to primarily work at the "page" level, rather than the block//heading level like Roam Research. And while I love Notion as a clean interface for notes, I'm not wild about its lack of capabilities in making TODOs and alerts and finding notes after the fact. Its search is great but basic.</p><h2>Roam Research</h2><p><a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> seems like a really powerful system, particularly for a research-style Zettelkasten. I honestly have not tried it, both because I didn't get into the trial, but now because of the cost and the concern of people losing notes and the lack of good backups. Most of the posts I've seen about note stability have disappeared, but you can see one graveyard here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hsrg0z/lost_all_my_notes_need_recommendations_for/">https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hsrg0z/lost_all_my_notes_need_recommendations_for/</a>. There was even a post today about it: <a href="https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Recovering-Lost-Roam-Notes/">https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Recovering-Lost-Roam-Notes/</a></p><p>Frankly, I prefer open source and being in control of my own content and notes. I know Notion doesn't fit into that well, but it also seemed ahead of its time to me.</p><h2>TiddlyWiki</h2><p><a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> has been around a while and was the note system I used before Notion. TiddlyWiki is many things, but at its heart, it was a single file HTML that you could download and make changes to in wiki syntax. TiddlyWiki has had backlinks for a while, possibly even before Roam Research, but recently the community has released some versions specifically for backlinking: <a href="https://akhater.github.io/drift/">Drift</a> and <a href="https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch/">Tiddly Research</a> are two that I've tried out.</p><p>They're great, but there are a few problems that I've had with TiddlyWiki that just make me hesitant. I had a lot of notes in it as I was working in Seminary, wrote a custom Bible linking plugin, etc, but updating it was a nightmare on the node version with my customization. For each upgrade, I'd have to manually diff my plugin changes against the upgrades. Of course, this may have just been me not knowing what I was doing, but it still wasn't fun. Also, just the speed of entering notes and using the mouse doesn't appeal to me. Being a Vim guy, I like my keyboard.</p><h2>Obsidian</h2><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a recent and gorgeous option for note-taking. It was actually my first introduction to backlinking and this whole area of decentralized notes. It's a commercial-style app (more on that below), but also works off of just a directory of markdown files. So you get to keep your content regardless. It feels great to use, I like its editor (not as well as <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a> or Notion though), and it's fast, responsive, and the keyboard shortcuts are great. It even has a basic Vim mode.</p><p>My only hangups are: if you use it for commercial purposes, the license becomes a pay-as-you-go SAAS license. The free license is just for personal use. Also, it's not open source, so there's always the risk that the company could go under and disappear, or worse, that they start charging way after I'm invested in it. Sure, they're just markdown files...I could make my own note-taking app if that were the case...but I don't have that much time or interest. Also, the backlinks seem to just be at the note level, but I didn't mind that as much in this app.</p><p>Still, if you're looking for a personal note-taking app that's easy to get into, supports backlinks, has the graph, uses markdown, is modern-looking, and is nice to use, totally give Obsidian a try.</p><h2>Joplin</h2><p><a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a> is one that I've just tried a little bit. It looks fine as far as an editor, has nice backlinking, etc. The one hangup that made me put it down quickly is that links are always based on note ID, so you have to find a note to get its ID and insert it. It didn't seem nearly as fast or practical as I wanted. It is open source though, and worth a look.</p><h2>Trilium</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium">Trilium</a> is an app I see recommended often. It's also free and open source. It claims to have automatic markdown conversion, but I couldn't get it to work. I gave up pretty soon after that.</p><h2>Zim</h2><p><a href="https://zim-wiki.org/">Zim</a> is a desktop wiki that I've used quite a lot in the past. It also has a backlinks plugin. It works great, is open source as well, and is very quick for taking notes. The negatives for this one are that it looks old and that it uses a custom wiki syntax that I don't like as well as markdown or Org.</p><h2>MindForger</h2><p><a href="https://www.mindforger.com/">MindForger</a> kind of does its own thing. It's difficult to explain, but worth checking out. It kind of has backlinks in that it has notes that are related to each other, but in more of an AI/intuitive way than in a manual way. It takes the headlines of Markdown files and makes them notes, but for each note lets you embed other top headlines/etc. It's weird but worth checking out. For a great intro, watch the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlW2e1X3O-I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlW2e1X3O-I</a>.</p><p>MindForger is open source and seems really powerful. I'm going to keep playing with it. The only negative is that it's got the whole split-screen preview/markdown editor like many of the others on this list, but there's no graphical component to the editor at all. The keyboard shortcuts are multi-key and not configurable as well, but they're intuitive.</p><h2>Foam</h2><p><a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a> is a plugin to Visual Studio code that emulates many features from Roam/Obsidian. It has backlinks, a graph, and looks decent.</p><p>Honestly, though, I don't like Visual Studio code, it's not the greatest editing experience, and the backlinks seem majorly delayed from saving. But maybe that was just my experience. This is one that has a lot of promise and I would keep my eye on in the future, but seems it has a little ways to go.</p><p>I'll give an honorable mention to <a href="https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron">Dendron</a>, which seems to be at least on par with Foam. It also has a hierarchical system but seems to keep all of the files in the same directory using a dot-separated notation. Also worth checking out and watching, but also had delayed backlink processing and note a great markdown editing experience.</p><h2>Org-roam</h2><p><a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org-roam</a> is where I landed for now. Org-roam is an extension of the famous <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> for Emacs. I used Org Mode a LOT when I was new to Emacs. It's really crazy how deep the rabbit hole goes for Org Mode. Org Mode is best described as an outliner, journal, day planner, calendar, TODO list, kanban board, interactive coding tool, TODO capture tool (including linking to source code lines, a browser, or even against a pdf as you're reading it), and presentation software. I'm sure there are a dozen or two things I'm missing too.</p><p>I'll caveat this though...you have to be a little crazy to use org-mode. Configuring it alone can be a trial in insanity, but once you master …</p></div></div>

But what does it take to secure one of these highly sought-after positions? Like any job in technology, machine learning positions require candidates to go through a rigorous series of technical interviews. </p><p id="viewer-43gc5">What is the structure of these interviews? What topics are covered? Are these interviews similar to software engineering? (Spoiler: sorta, kinda) Who is paying for lunch? </p><p id="viewer-781mt">There are a lot of questions, but not a lot of answers out there. This is largely because the field of machine learning is still young and learning to stand on its own two feet. </p><p id="viewer-cemkd">This article is intended to be the missing guide for what to expect in a machine learning interview. The observations in this post are born out of collective experiences interviewing for machine learning engineer and scientist positions, comprising over 90 hours of interview time across 80+ interviews at big (FAANG) companies, small (just out of Y-Combinator) companies, and everything in-between.</p><p id="viewer-522i9">Let's get started.</p><h3 id="viewer-32gml"><strong>Machine learning interviews are diverse...sometimes</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ecirs">The machine learning landscape is constantly evolving. If you were entering the world of machine learning ~4 years ago, the most in-demand skill would be the ability to build and debug deep learning models. Today with the rise of tools like PyTorch and Tensorflow, a bigger issue is not so much how to build machine learning prototypes but rather how to take them all the way to a deployed system in production (also called the last-mile problem). </p><p id="viewer-63ac7">What this means is that over the course of several years of interviewing for these positions, we've learned that the nature of these assessments can be incredibly diverse. For example, the following are examples of real interview types/questions that we've had:</p><p id="viewer-ac86k">	1) Read a recent paper on unsupervised learning for noise reduction and whiteboard extensions to the techniques proposed in the paper</p><p id="viewer-aj8c3">	2) Explain the nodes in the Tensorflow computational graph for a feedforward layer of a neural network</p><p id="viewer-5lue8">	3) Give an hour-long talk about some machine learning project you have done and get grilled on its details</p><p id="viewer-4bjvl">	4)  Describe how you would implement Google's autocomplete </p><p id="viewer-2p8og">	5) Explain why L1 regularization encourages sparsity in features</p><p id="viewer-5hjhh">Sound like these questions are all over the place? Don't get overwhelmed: they are.</p><p id="viewer-53d1i">Does that mean you will have to know how to do all of the above for your interview? No, definitely not. This variety is only meant to illustrate that many things are fair game depending on the company you are applying to and what they expect your responsibilities will be. </p><p id="viewer-3hihv">For example, if you are applying to a more research-intensive machine learning position, you may be asked to explain research-caliber work (either yours or that of others). Or if you are going to be a machine learning engineer at a young company, you may have to be more familiar with the internals of a framework or technology stack that is in high-demand. It really depends.</p><p id="viewer-7annu">That being said, as the field has matured, we've seen that the responsibilities of these positions are getting more well-defined leading to more standardized assessment structures.</p><p id="viewer-ciu37">Nowadays for most machine learning engineer positions, you can expect your interview journey to look something like the following:</p><ul><li id="viewer-6irq6"><p>First screening call with a recruiter</p></li><li id="viewer-edt1j"><p>Technical phone interview covering some software engineering and machine learning theory</p></li><li id="viewer-e1103"><p>Onsite (~4-5 interviews)</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-esrfv">                - Software engineering principles (~2 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-62fec">                - Machine learning theory (~1 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-2ugbd">                - Machine learning system design (~1-2 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-es0je">                - Interview with management (cultural fit check, typical in startups)</p><p id="viewer-73jhi">This can be subject to change depending on the company, but we've largely seen that common format across interviews today. Now let's discuss what to expect in terms of specific skills being evaluated.</p><h3 id="viewer-avlia"><strong>Know your machine learning theory</strong></h3><p id="viewer-dob3m">When applying for machine learning jobs you will always be asked about machine learning theory. In a sense, this a "well duh" moment but the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>machine learning</u></a> <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>theory</u></a> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>literature</u></a> is vast so knowing what to focus on rather than working through multiple 1000-page textbooks is the key question.</p><p id="viewer-et0di"> Conceptual questions are asked in one of two forms: 1) in the context of some larger problem (i.e. while describing a system design, discuss model tradeoffs) or 2) in isolation (i.e. spend 30+ minutes describing how your favorite supervised learning algorithm works).</p><p id="viewer-t28k">In either case, the types of questions and concepts you'll be asked about stay pretty consistent. Our survey of past machine learning interviews has shown that you will tend to be tested on topics such as the following:</p><p id="viewer-5srhm">	1) What is the bias-variance tradeoff?</p><p id="viewer-fo0au">	2) What is overfitting/underfitting and how do you know when your model is suffering from those issues?</p><p id="viewer-bg784">	3) How do you evaluate model performance (which metrics are used and why)?</p><p id="viewer-b17gt">	4) Can you explain how some classical machine learning models work (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, etc.)?</p><p id="viewer-2o3la">	5) What are common techniques for unsupervised learning?</p><p id="viewer-3sb7r">	6) How do you pick the best features for your model?</p><p id="viewer-b7b5m">That being said, because the collection of potential theory topics is so large, we've distilled the key concepts seen in interviews into a <a href="https://www.confetti.ai/assets/ml-primer/ml_primer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>primer with practice exercises</u></a>. </p><h3 id="viewer-537k4"><strong>Software engineering is still important</strong></h3><p id="viewer-8v5gq">While the focus of machine learning jobs isn't just software engineering, you should still expect to be asked some more traditional coding and algorithms questions. These questions will be very similar, if not identical, to those you would be asked in a standard engineering interview. </p><p id="viewer-27v4b">Although this may seem unrelated to what you would think a machine learning practitioner does, when you are on the job knowing <em>how</em> to theoretically build a model is not the same as doing the actual building. This is true whether or not you are applying to be a machine learning scientist or a machine learning engineer. You need to be proficient in coding, debugging, and thinking through algorithms exercises. As an example of topics you can expect to be asked about:</p><p id="viewer-eal72">	1) Recursion and memoization (you'll basically never use recursion in the real world but 		   it's often used to evaluate your ability to think through an algorithm)</p><p id="viewer-cmind">	2) Memory and run-time complexity analysis</p><p id="viewer-d4m4q">	3) Standard data structures like trees, linked lists, hash maps, and general graphs</p><p id="viewer-9rse9">That being said, the standards for coding may not be the same in your interviews as they would be of someone applying for a pure software development position. In other words your engineering abilities might not need to be as sophisticated, especially if you are just coming out of an advanced graduate degree program in machine learning where your focus was more on pushing state-of-the-art rather than building robust training pipelines. </p><p id="viewer-dkeon">For software engineering, there are a number of popular <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>books</u></a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>services</u></a> that can help you practice these skills.</p><h3 id="viewer-76m1h"><strong>Know how to build machine learning systems</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ba220">Knowing how to architect machine learning systems is one of the most important skills you can have going into the field of machine learning. One of the big aspects of machine learning's evolution in the past 1-2 years is that companies are going all-in on integrating data-driven solutions to extract business value across their teams. At scale this can lead to <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/accepted-papers/view/150-successful-machine-learning-models-6-lessons-learned-at-booking.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>tremendous improvements</u></a> in the quality of a service. </p><p id="viewer-2j318">When you are being brought into a team as a machine learning expert, the expectation is that you will be able to apply machine learning skills to improve some existing manual process. Oftentimes you will be presented with very vague problem descriptions (e.g. "I want these recommendations to be better") and you will have to break down and frame the problem in a form where machine learning is applicable.</p><p id="viewer-bj4et">This is the core of designing and architecting machine learning systems. This skill is among the most crucial ones that companies look for when evaluating candidates. A system design interview will involve being presented with a case study (e.g. "we want a tool that can help us detect offensive content on our platform") and then talking through how to set up a machine learning pipeline that can address the problem. Along the way you will be assessed on your ability to:</p><p id="viewer-b3dv8">	1) Gather and validate datasets needed for your models</p><p id="viewer-3ctv5">	2) Build training infrastructure</p><p id="viewer-actbm">	3) Discuss the tradeoffs among potential modelling solutions</p><p id="viewer-7bofr">	4) Know what metrics you will track for model performance</p><p id="viewer-5tid6">	5) Interpret model predictions and do error analysis</p><p id="viewer-b2nej">	6) Architect a deployment solution (e.g. cloud-based, on-device, etc.)</p><p id="viewer-3hr9b">	7) Iterate on user feedback to improve the solution</p><p id="viewer-2fn8e">The important thing to recognize in these types of interviews is that there is never one "correct" answer. Your interviewers are more interested in knowing how you think through a problem. You will be asked to justify your decisions and also adapt them based on new situations (e.g. "now imagine we don't have enough money to gather 1 million annotated images...").</p><p id="viewer-2plnr">When preparing for these types of interviews, there's no substitute for real-world experience. Build projects so you witness firsthand what tradeoffs are necessary to consider. If that's not possible, spend a lot of time reading through company use-cases and learning how others have <a href="https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>solved similar problems</u></a>. </p><h3 id="viewer-44oq9"><strong>Technical interviews are just one signal</strong></h3><p id="viewer-dmrea">The last point worth mentioning is that while technical interviews are important signals in determining whether you get the job, they are still only one of many contributing signals. In particular, many startups also place great emphasis on your cultural fit …</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

                <div>
                  <p>When we started Reify, the idea was pretty simple – let’s take the experience we’ve gained as marketers at developer facing companies, and apply that knowledge to as many software companies as we can. Let’s raise the tide for everyone, and help everyone become better marketers. After more than 4 years and 75 clients, we’re extremely happy with the results, and it felt like the right time to take a step back, consider what we’ve accomplished and learned (and, glaringly, what mistakes we made), and try to do what every great marketer and consultant loves to do: define a framework.</p>

<p>Our first few clients, bless their souls, were very patient with us as we slowly but surely codified our methods. What started as a somewhat amorphous (but very enthusiastic, and usually quite successful somehow) “process” turned into a repeatable set of working sessions, asynchronous assignments for our clients, and research and synthesis on our parts. We figured out just the right way to start with the stakeholders, document their story, do the hard work, and then end up with a <em>messaging framework that succinctly and successfully communicated the value of the product</em>.</p>

<p>Once we settled on the basic outline of the process, we did it again. And again. And again. We’ve done this essential, foundational marketing engagement with more than 75 companies, from solo bootstrapped founders to public companies, and everything in-between. We expanded our initial notion of working with developer facing companies to working with a wide range of companies from <a href="https://testdouble.com/">award-winning software consultancies</a> to <a href="https://getchannels.com/">TV tech plays</a>, and even <a href="https://omg.network/">blockchain tech</a> (a category that barely existed when we started the company). We partnered with <a href="https://www.brightscout.com/">fabulous designers</a>, <a href="https://devrelate.io/">top content producers and community builders</a>, <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/">VC firms and event producers</a>, and we even started a <a href="https://epicconf.com/">little online conference with our friends.</a></p>

<p>Throughout all of this work, one thing remained very clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing is more important than the story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so it was a few months back when Brian and I tried to finally put a name to this process we’ve developed that we settled on a name: The Value Story Framework (VSF). This post will focus on what the VSF is, and it will be followed by another post outlining how the VSF can be put to use in nearly any company to start with solid foundations, set reasonable goals, and execute marketing like a pro.</p>

<center><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/vsf1.png"></center>



<h2 id="the-value-story-framework">The Value Story Framework</h2>

<p>The VSF has three concrete outputs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>value story</em>, which sums up the <em>Why</em> of the product</li>
  <li>The <em>refined persona</em>, which describes the <em>Who</em>, based on the essentials uncovered in the value story</li>
  <li>The <em>messaging framework</em>, which contains the words used to describe <em>What</em>, <em>Why</em>, and <em>How</em> to the refined persona</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the keys to the VSF is that <em>these outputs are entirely driven by inputs from the company’s key stakeholders</em>. We often tell our clients that they will have all of the good ideas during this process, and our job is to massage words, curate ideas, and present a complete, consistent package of ideas – something that can be difficult to do if you’ve never done it before.</p>

<p>The value story’s inputs come in the form of answering a series of questions about the origins of the company, focused initially on understanding <em>why</em> the people responsible for forming it came together. Beyond that, a timeline is established, and we also ask questions about other key factors: we get to know the competitive landscape a bit, we discuss important customers, and we discuss companies our clients admire and learn why.</p>

<p>Once we’ve established your <em>value story</em>, we move on to the <em>refined persona</em>. This persona document, which we’ve written about a few times over the years, is designed to allow you to focus in on what really matters when deciding what kind of marketing to do, when to do it, and what kind of content you need to produce. We ask stakeholders to list the key challenges of skills of the target persona, to consider what other tools they use and love, to tell us everything they know about what key roles and responsibilities that individual has at work. Once we’ve honed in on the <em>one initial persona</em> we’re going to use, we give it a memorable nickname and then move on to the part that most people actually think about when they think about marketing: messaging and positioning.</p>

<p>Our <em>messaging framework</em> itself is nothing unique – in fact we cribbed the structure of it by combining two different frameworks we found on the internet back when we were both marketing practitioners 5+ years ago. What does differentiate our process, however, is the process itself. While marketing is often done by thinking of cool sounding phrases and interesting angles first, and then matching the product’s marketing to it, we take the opposite approach.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use your story, focus on your persona, deliver your message</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We ask our clients to, <em>while considering the persona very closely</em>, produce lists of examples that support the basic argument that your product is a great fit for this persona. The messaging framework is assembled by combining existing facts about the product, aimed directly at the persona, in a way that leads us and the clients naturally to the great sounding slogans that companies often come to us in search of.</p>

<h2 id="prove-it">Prove it!</h2>

<p>We’ve been around a while, and worked with a decent number of clients you may have heard of, but the proof is in the pudding, right? How do you know that this stuff works at all? Beyond the fact that clients of ours who have used our frameworks directly have gone on to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, added at least that much in revenue, come to dominate their own market niches, etc., nothing communicates out impact as effectively as their own words. To that end, here are some of our favorite client quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Reify’s marketing framework helped us discover and communicate the value of FireHydrant in a way that has really resonated with our core audience.” – Robert Ross, CEO, FireHydrant</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Determined AI is a technically complicated product, and communicating our value proposition early on was always a challenge. Reify’s frameworks helped us calibrate, and we went to market with messaging that helped us communicate clearly and effectively.” – <em>Evan Sparks, Founder and CEO, Determined AI</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Reify helped us develop a messaging framework that not only enabled us to level up how we communicate with our customers, but was also instrumental in telling the story that resulted in our recent Series A financing. We have a confidence and focus now that we didn’t before.” - <em>Caleb Hailey, CEO, Sensu</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And just because we love them so much, here are some of the great brand promises we’ve helped our clients come up with, in the context of any software company’s core marketing asset, the website homepage:</p>

<center><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/hero_stackbit.png"></center>

<p>And there are tons more.</p>

<h2 id="so--how-do-i-use-it">So … How Do I Use It?</h2>

<p>We’re working on a few different ways to share the VSF with the world. The first step will be a followup to this post, which will contextualize the Value Story, Refined Persona, and Messaging Framework in day to day marketing operations. After that, we’re planning on opening up a software platform version of our framework that will allow <em>anyone to leverage these tools</em> to become the awesome marketers we know they’re capable of. Yes, after all this time teaching people how to fish, we’re going to be fishing ourselves a bit – and making a small software product to sell to early marketing teams.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="article">
<p>Today is a big day for me as after many months (or years depending how you look at it), I've <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brandvantage">finally launched the first product for my business, BrandVantage</a>.
This post is the story of how I started with one idea and ended up launching with a different one.</p>
<h2>The Original Idea: Let's build a digital brand expert!</h2>
<p>I worked as a web developer for a local web development agency for a number of years and in that time, I learnt a lot about how a variety of different businesses operated online.</p>
<p>There were a few key "problems" I found in common across many of those businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under-utilising analytics</li>
<li>Misunderstanding analytics</li>
<li>Not keeping on top of industry information</li>
<li>Lack of competitor analysis/understanding</li>
<li>Difficulty with Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
</ul>
<p>In moderate-to-large companies where you have marketing departments, most of this stuff can be covered by one or more staff dedicated to these things.
In smaller companies, the business owner is normally the one where these tasks fall on to, but they are already wearing many different hats.
It felt like something was here - if I could automate some of these tasks in different ways, I could both help business owners and earn myself some money along the way.</p>
<p>Automation of tasks, especially ones in analytics or SEO spaces, isn't a new idea.
In fact, I've seen many businesses in a similar space launch on Product Hunt over the years since starting, but that didn't deter me.
I was building <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+better+mousetrap"><em>a better mousetrap</em></a> and wanting to launch it at a lower price, not something truly innovative so it was going to be an uphill battle.
This area though, helping small businesses online be as efficient in tasks as some bigger businesses can, is something I felt passionately about so I proceeded anyway.</p>
<h3>Attempt One: Very Hacky (in PHP)</h3>
<p>Way back in 2015/16/17, while still at my full-time job, I spent nights and weekends building and tinkering on solutions to the problems business owners face.
It was a hacky PHP solution pulling real-time information from sources like Twitter, Google Analytics and Facebook.
A hacky approach seemed like a good idea as that seemed to be the way people launched things, do the quickest and hackiest thing you can to get it out the door.</p>
<p>While working on it, I had a few interested parties though what I built could barely be considered a prototype.
The thing was a mess.
I could do some basic queries, but it wasn't what I considered sellable and definitely not user-friendly, something I considered key to the product.
I was also running into technical problems with scale - any sufficiently complex query was performed real-time, which was getting more complicated.
Real-time processing had to be out.
I needed to pre-compute and store it in a database.</p>
<p>I wanted to take this more seriously and I didn't feel like a "quick and hacky" approach to building a product was right for me.
With this in mind, it seemed like a good opportunity to change the tech stack to something that would be better long term.</p>
<h3>Attempt Two: Slightly Less Hacky (in .NET)</h3>
<p>Moving to .NET felt like the smart move for me as at my job I had spent a lot more time working in .NET than PHP, plus I vastly prefered the tooling in .NET vs PHP.
That said, the .NET code I had worked on to-date would definitely be considered "legacy code".</p>
<p>My first version in .NET (specifically .NET Framework), predating my use of version control, was trying to keep costs low by using MySQL through Entity Framework.
After a lot of pain and suffering with that, I had a short stint of MSSQL before I settled upon MongoDB.</p>
<p>MongoDB might seem like a weird choice - there are some people that have very strong opinions about which type of database you should use.
Honestly it came down to a gut feel after messing around with it - it seemed more compatible to the way I was approaching problems than a relational database would.
I liked the code-first approach to Entity Framework so much though that I recreated the "feel" of Entity Framework for MongoDB with some custom code.
This later became an open source project of mine called <a href="https://www.mongoframework.com/">MongoFramework</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie, progress was... slow.
While I was putting quite a lot of time into working on it, it was still an extremely ambitious project.
I have strong feelings about building "MVPs" where some people focus too much on the "minimum" without enough focus on the "viable".
At the end of the day people buy products that meet their needs, and cutting too much out would meet no-ones needs.
If someone was going to use this, in a market with many competitors of varying quality, it had to do its job well.
There didn't seem much I could reasonably cut to make it any more minimal if I wanted people to buy it.</p>
<p>I kept working at it every night, building pieces to extract and store data from a variety of sources.
I was pulling in data from Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools (now called Google Search Console), Twitter, Facebook, IP Geolocation, DNS information and also from news articles.
What I thought I could do is once I had the different data sources together, I would write custom rules that could infer insights from individual or combined data sets.
These insights would form the basis of the "digital brand expert".
After all, that was the goal of the idea, something that could help out small business owners.</p>
<p>After 2 years of working on this in my spare time, it felt the right time to leave my job and go into this full time.
I felt like I was <em>so close</em> to launching and I just needed something more than the same day-to-day work.
So I did it - <a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/i-left-my-job-today-after-seven-years">I left my job after 7 years</a>.</p>
<h3>Going Full-time into the Idea</h3>
<p>Right out of the gate, I had moved from .NET Framework to .NET Core, was working on UI/UX improvements for the application and launched the website for it.
I worked with an accountant and a lawyer to setup the business, bought a trade mark for the product name, and I felt good like I was only a few months away from launching.
This feeling didn't last though...</p>
<p>Over time, it felt like I was taking two steps forward then one step back - some technical, some business related.
Sure, that is still progress, but having new issues crop up every day or so can really crush your motivation.</p>
<p>My best/happiest/most productive days were days I ignored or avoided different issues I had.
If I had a problem with the login system, I would focus on how the UX of the menus worked.
If I had a problem with data gathering, I would add more tests to the codebase.
While I didn't entirely ignore the problem, I would wait a week or two before I looked at it again, somewhat hoping it would solve itself - unfortunately that isn't how things work.</p>
<p>In time though, I got to a stage where it felt like I could launch and was hyping myself up until reality struck: I didn't actually build what I set out to build.</p>
<p>The UI/UX was good, I had strategies for deployment and plans for next steps, but it wasn't a "digital brand expert".
It was instead a glorified data store for information that people could better access through existing tools.
That's kinda a big problem!</p>
<p><img src="https://turnerj.com/blog/2020/images/a-better-mousetrap-ive-made-a-huge-mistake.gif" alt="Gob Bluth saying &quot;I've made a huge mistake.&quot; from the TV Show &quot;Arrested Development&quot;"></p>
<p>When realising this I poured time into fixing that huge lapse in judgement, but I couldn't do it.
No matter how I tried, I just couldn't figure out how to build this rules engine.
It was like my entire thought process was just clouded.
I couldn't see the solution to the problem like I can for most other things.</p>
<p>This was depressing and I ended up having a month or so hiatus from working on it.
When I have had stints of not feeling like or not being able to do programming in the past, I try and spur it on again by watching some show or movie which has some strong relation to technology (fictional or not).
My go-to is usually something like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Iron Man</a>, but this time I was rewatching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a> where I found some inspiration.</p>
<h2>The Pivot: An API to the Internet</h2>
<p>Later in the series a lot of the focus is around the Web, and it was in these episodes where my thoughts about the Internet and the data on it have changed.
There is a quote from one of the main characters at the end of Season 3 that resonates with me:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The moment we decide what the Web is, we've lost. The moment we try to tell people what to do with it, we've lost.
All we have to do is build a door and let them inside."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 3, Episode 10)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Internet is a treasure trove of information, it is searchable but generally unstructured.
People have managed to create all sorts of different pages in HTML, but in the process of making a website everything is designed for a human user.
It is this way for obvious reasons, <em>we</em> are the consumers of web pages after all... aren't we?</p>
<p>Behind these user-friendly web pages are usually other specific bits of markup, providing some level of structured data for specific situations.
Sometimes it is a description metatag for search engines, other times it might be <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> metatags for social media links.
We build these things to help aid computers processing our web pages.</p>
<p>In 2011, <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> was created.
This was a collaborative effort between Google, Bing and Yahoo (later that year, Yandex as well) with the mission to "create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond".
Through 3 different encodings (<a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/what-is-microdata-and-why-should-i-care">Microdata</a>, <a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a> and <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>), websites could express detailed structured data.</p>
<p>There is another quote from Halt and Catch Fire which I like:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers aren't the thing. They're the thing that gets us to the thing."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 1, Episode 1)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As much as I like computers and programming, they are used to help us achieve other goals.
From my attempts of trying to build a "digital brand expert", I knew that data is fundamental to help build more advanced systems and give new insights.
Having easier access to other forms of data from web pages around the world may allow new and different tools to be built.</p>
<p>So I decided rather than try and solve a problem that I was clouded by, I …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last few years have seen rapid automation of many Systems Administration/DevOps tasks. The new mantra is if you need to ssh to a server, your automation is not working right. But even for the occasional ssh access to the servers, the SSH authentication must be managed. Over the years, SSH has added many new features/techniques to enhance authentication and put some governance around it. This article is about the use of SSH Certificate-based authentication and why every organization, using SSH, must use it.</p><p>SSH Key-based authentication (aka passwordless login) has been with us for over two decades now. The mechanism works based on public-key cryptography. One adds his/her RSA/DSA key to the authorized_keys file on the server. The user with the corresponding private key can login without a password. It works great except for a few fundamental problems:</p><ol><li>When a user accesses the server using ssh for the first time, s/he always gets Trust On First Use (TOFU) warning.</li></ol><pre><code>$ ssh -l alice mavrix5.dbsentry.com
The authenticity of host 'mavrix5.dbsentry.com (72.191.40.116)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:PoK81UWgOBMn6owOoHXjGoBLWqcJ4E9JCiLQyiFF60s.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
</code></pre><p>As the server is not trusted at this point, theoretically a man-in-the-middle attack could be launched. I tried to find damaging incidents of such attacks on the internet but could not find any. Nevertheless, the possibility exists and we’d be better off getting rid of this warning.</p><ol start="2"><li>When the number of servers increases, authorized_keys files proliferate and they are hard to manage. Moreover, once added they are active perpetually and have to be removed manually to block access to its corresponding private key. That is probably the reason why many security guys frown on the use of authorized_keys.</li></ol><p>Fortunately, the newer version of SSH included many improvements that give us the ability to centralize and better manage authorized_keys using <code>AuthorizedKeysCommand</code>. However, the TOFU remains. Although the solutions exist in either the use of SSHFP or SSH Certificates, their usage never caught on.</p><p>Having said that, in addition to taking care of TOFU, SSH Certificates have many more advantages/features (for e.g. certificate expiration, use of principals, etc) that enhance SSH authentication governance and should be used by all organizations that use SSH.</p><p>Instead of using complex X.509 style certificates, SSH chose to use their own simpler format of certificates, which can be easily managed using CLI <code>ssh-keygen</code>. In order to use SSH certificate-based authentication one needs to set up SSH Certificate Authority (CA). So, how does one set up SSH CA?</p><p>SSH Certificate authority can be setup on any computer with <code>ssh-keygen</code>. It is a key pair that is used to sign SSH Public Keys to generate certificates. It is recommended to set up two pairs of CA keys: one for host certificates and others for user’s certificates.</p><p>Use <code>ssh-keygen</code> to genearet CA Keys:</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_host_key
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_user_key
</code></pre><p>The above would generate two pairs of SSH Keys. for e.g.</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_host_key
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in ca_host_key.
Your public key has been saved in ca_host_key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:Epoq1Vy0/orivKOwxepBLqD7mGuaWbUKh+SoycMpKy0 manish@picanmix4
The key's randomart image is:

</code></pre><p>Optional: In addition you can also setup SSH Key Revocation List (KRL). This is a list of all revoked certificates.</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -k -f ca_krl
</code></pre><p>And, thats it. your SSH CA is in business. Now, going forward, you just need to configure your servers and clients to use certificates with private keys.</p><h2 id="ssh-server-configuration">SSH Server Configuration</h2><p>Follow these steps to configure host to use SSH certificates:</p><ol><li>Copy your servers SSH Public Key, typically located under <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</code> or <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub</code> and get it signed.</li></ol><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -h -s ca_host_key -z &lt;serial no.&gt; -I &lt;hostname&gt; -V &lt;duration&gt; -n &lt;principal list&gt; ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
</code></pre><p>for e.g</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -vvv -h -s ca_host_key -z 100 -I mavrix2 -V +52w -n mavrix2,mavrix2.dbsentry.com ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
Signed host key ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub: id "mavrix2" serial 100 for mavrix2,mavrix2.dbsentry.com valid from 2020-10-30T14:46:00 to 2021-10-29T14:47:02
</code></pre><ol start="2"><li>Copy the certifcate back to the host under <code>/etc/ssh</code></li><li>Copy CA User Public Key(<code>ca_user_key.pub</code>) to the host under <code>/etc/ssh</code></li><li>Add the following to <code>sshd_conf</code> file:</li></ol><pre><code>TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca_user_key.pub
HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub
</code></pre><p><code>TrustedUserCAKeys</code> directs SSH to trust certificates signed by <code>ca_user_key</code>. And, <code>HostCertificate</code> directs SSH to send the host certificate instead of public key to the client.
5. Restart SSH</p><pre><code>$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
</code></pre><h2 id="ssh-client-configuration">SSH Client Configuration</h2><p>Follow the following steps to configure client/user to use SSH certificates:</p><ol><li>Copy user’s SSH Public Key (typically located under <code>&lt;usershome&gt;/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. If not present, it can be generated using <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code>) to the CA host and get it signed</li></ol><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -s ca_user_key -z &lt;serial no&gt; -I &lt;username&gt; -V &lt;duration&gt; -n &lt;principal list&gt; id_rsa.pub
</code></pre><p>for e.g</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -s ca_user_key -z 100 -I alice -V +2h -n alice,apache id_rsa.pub
Signed user key id_rsa-cert.pub: id "alice" serial 100 for alice,apache valid from 2020-10-30T14:56:00 to 2020-10-30T16:57:51
</code></pre><p>You can look at the content of the certificate using the following command:</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -L -f id_rsa-cert.pub 
id_rsa-cert.pub:
      Type: ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com user certificate
      Public key: RSA-CERT SHA256:2J9G7t6Dn11nKlI5l9USbHAFRTuBUUVxqbL+uHQaaDc
      Signing CA: RSA SHA256:X75sKpv1L2B6y/mIUYKZc0QVmQD8CgpcBS+ZhRPbRmk (using ssh-rsa)
      Key ID: "alice"
      Serial: 100

              permit-port-forwarding
              permit-pty
              permit-user-rc
</code></pre><ol start="2"><li>Copy certifcate to the client under <code>&lt;userhome&gt;/.ssh</code></li><li>Copy CA Host Public Key (<code>ca_host_key.pub</code>) to the client and put it either in known_hosts file under <code>&lt;userhome&gt;/.ssh</code> (local) or <code>/etc/known_hosts</code> (global) file in the following format:</li></ol><pre><code>@cert-authority *.dbsentry.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDDN4F3JKuAS1V0nQmBRNl5fS8dZS49FKUp5wwy8R0wDcNYdrq+M5/tdS6K/R07445VWpVKwExZGboaQ/YR5iQ392YHM55ThMjSP5CTywmiP033MX3zG5eO9Iec5fz/hHtwrDtxb4Xm3FfGhXjjKTozNf/uMcOjIM1STr/I6t2zfZ42bnCq4DFj1GWHSrOtnxjN0PPOfCLH+1AmKhEUFqf0NBD3CQoPamaRVf4ouAc9KxOLFge+gebJe9jmqkaVHYfZD2CPoLVGHXZCphSQ3gyEKpvgD8VnfU9/la6BNtcK9lSONZWLFcw523HdlnbGVz+t15zZAXLu/3H6yK5SPC/L 
</code></pre><p>Above instructs SSH client to trust host certificate signed by the CA.
4. Test ssh. You should not receive TOFU warning and should not be asked for the password either. The generated certificate should work for the principals (i.e. users on server) for the validity period.</p><h2 id="summation">Summation</h2><p>In this article, I have demonstrated setup of SSH Certifciate Authority and why and how SSH authentication use SSH certificates.</p><p><code>&lt;Shameless-Plug&gt;</code><br>Although the use of certificates results in more secure SSH authentication, SSH CA adds the burden of ssh certificate management. To ease that burden one can use a centralized system such as
<a href="https://keyper.dbsentry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyper</a>. Keyper is an Open Source SSH Key and Certificate-Based Authentication Manager. Keyper acts as an SSH Certificate Authority (CA) and it standardizes and centralizes the storage of SSH public keys and SSH Certificates for all Linux users in your organization saving significant time and effort it takes to manage SSH public keys and certificates on each Linux Server. Keyper also maintains an active Key Revocation List, which prevents the use of Key/Cert once revoked. Keyper is a lightweight container taking less than 100MB. It is launched either using Docker or Podman. You can be up and running within minutes instead of days.<br><code>&lt;/Shameless-Plug&gt;</code></p><p>Thats it folks! Happy more secure SSH’ing.</p></div></div>]]>

There are so many new business models and new applications of existing business models into new markets that capture one or two of these, but in order to get the high multiples that SaaS companies achieve, it's critical to have all three. In addition, the "rule of thumb" metrics that I previously mentioned don't work so well in the absence of any of these characteristics. While the fundamental subscription math remains true, you have to dig much deeper to understand the impact on the cash flows, working capital needs, scalability, customer lifetime value and long term profitability to be able to assess the health and viability of a business.</p><p>For example, if we look at <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/">Lemonade</a>, which priced its IPO today (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1691421/000104746920003943/a2242013z424b4.htm">424B4 here</a>). Lemonade is a technology-enabled insurance company and insurance broker. I think most people would agree that it is not a software company. But if we look through the lens of these three characteristics and some of the key metrics, we can learn a lot about its long term prospects as a business.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Insurance is probably one of the original subscription businesses, with people paying annual or monthly premiums. Revenue comes in regularly to support the clients’ claims.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Assuming there's access to re-insurance and the capital to back up the insurance plans, this business is highly scalable and in a huge market.</li><li><strong>Margins:</strong> This is where it gets a bit more complicated. This is not a 90% margin, AWS-expense only business. It's a complicated financial cycle and risk assessment business with very different capital, accounting and cash flow dynamics. Lemonade runs a few different businesses with varying risk ownership which have an impact on gross profit, and overall they achieved a gross margin of 17% in 2019.</li></ol><p>Now let's take a look at some of the key metrics:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>LTV</strong>: In most software businesses, especially those either creating or selling into new markets, it's almost impossible to calculate a lifetime value because we don't have enough data on the lifetime of a customer. In the insurance business, there's tons of data going back decades for hundreds of millions of people. Insurance companies run on actuarial science, which one could argue is the original data science application. To put it lightly, they understand data and have lots of it. While in a new-fangled enterprise or consumer software business, lifetime value is a shot in the dark, in the insurance business it's not, where it's reasonable to expect your customers to stay with you for 25+ years.</li><li><strong>CAC Payback</strong>: Knowing you can keep your customers for a very long time is great and now you can calculate the CAC you can afford to invest in order to acquire them. Lemonade runs efficiently now with $1 of marketing to $2 of in-force premium on their platform. Gross margin-adjusted this obviously shifts the timeline out, but that's OK because the likelihood of keeping the customers for a long time is high. This introduces a new question: capital. With short paybacks, cash management isn't so much of a challenge, but as those payback times increase, so does the need to fund the working capital needs of the business. The time value of money becomes a factor here, but is manageable and calculable.</li></ol><p>So a quick look through the lens of the fundamental subscription concepts makes it clear that even though Lemonade is not a software business, it is a subscription business with some highly favorable business and customer economics.</p><p>And congrats to the Lemonade team on the IPO!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f6128d02bc85546e3a93976_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Faa34c7a7-d833-453f-a3cb-79b88beb7eda_1536x1025.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>MPEG is releasing three new video codecs in 2020-2021 called Versatile Video Coding (H.266), Essential Video Coding (EVC MPEG-5 Part 1), and Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC MPEG-5 Part 2). Let’s take a look at the highlights of each of these codecs and what they bring to the table.</strong></p>




<h2 id="video-compression-is-critical-to-your-infrastructure"><span id="Video_Compression_is_Critical_To_Your_Infrastructure"></span>Video Compression is Critical To Your Infrastructure<span></span></h2>



<p>Video traffic is growing by the day and that is not going to stop any time soon. The pandemic might have stymied other industries, but, has actually given a filip to the streaming industry, because people are stuck indoors, and watching videos provides a much-needed escape from the daily routine!</p>



<p>Video Compression is a critical component in the video delivery pipeline and can make a massive make-or-break impression in the minds of the end-user. If you “tune” your encoders to maximize video quality, you’ll have to compromise on compression efficiency and spend more bits; and vice-versa. If you compromise on compression efficiency and create larger files, then you will have to spend more on CDN delivery costs.</p>



<p>So, the goal of every encoder team is to create a fine-balance between quality and bitrate. In other words, balance video quality with dollars.</p>



<p>The easiest way to perform this balancing act is to upgrade to the best encoder or encoding technology on the market. Hypothetically, this is simple, but practically, this is difficult. You need to make sure that the quality-complexity-efficiency trade-offs are met and decoder support is available amongst other things.</p>



<h2 id="the-failure-of-hevc"><span id="The_Failure_of_HEVC"></span>The Failure of HEVC<span></span></h2>



<p>When we talk about encoders, the discussion isn’t complete without mentioning H.264/AVC which is still ruling supreme since its introduction by MPEG (in 2003, I think). The MPEG announced a successor to H.264/AVC and called it H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) that had a slew of new coding tools such as quadtree decomposition, new picture types, SAO filtering, etc.</p>



<p>However, HEVC turned out to be a flop and the failure of HEVC had almost nothing to do with the algorithms. For HEVC R&amp;D teams, getting 20-30% gains over AVC was easy. </p>



<p><strong>You may disagree, but, as someone who wrote HEVC code for years, I stand by what I said.</strong></p>



<p>The “failure” of MPEG’s H.265/HEVC was due to patent-pools and licensing issues and this created the need for a new codec to fill the gap left by HEVC and to replace H.264/AVC (which by-design will struggle to compress 4K, UHD, and large resolutions).</p>



<p>In this regards, MPEG has announced that three new video codecs will soon be standardized and they are :-</p>



<ul><li>Versatile Video Coding (H.266)</li><li>Essential Video Coding (EVC MPEG-5 Part 1)</li><li>Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC MPEG-5 Part 2)</li></ul>



<p>Let’s take a quick look at the objective of each of these codecs and see what gap they’re trying to plug, shall we?</p>

<p>Touted as a successor to HEVC, the Versatile Video Coding standard has a lofty goal of achieving at least a 30% improvement in compression efficiency over HEVC. This should be doable considering the allowance of the “10x complexity increase” that the committee has provided.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/sites/default/files/files/standards/parts/docs/w17074.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the MPEG Requirements document</a>&nbsp;for VVC (H.266), a few interesting points stand out with regards to compression efficiency, coding complexity, etc.</p>



<ul><li><strong>A substantial improvement in compression efficiency compared to HEVC Main Profile is required for the target application(s);</strong>&nbsp;at no point of the entire bit rate range shall it be worse than existing standard(s).&nbsp;<strong>30% bitrate reduction for the same perceptual quality is sufficient for some important use-cases and may justify a future video coding standard</strong>. Other use-cases may require higher bit-rate reductions such as 50%.</li><li><strong>Encoding complexity of approximately 10 times or more than that of HEVC</strong>&nbsp;is acceptable for many applications.</li><li><strong>The standard shall enable the use of efficient prediction structures (e.g. so-called open groups of pictures) without compromising from the fast and seamless representation switching capability between representations of different properties, such as different spatial resolutions.</strong></li><li>Support for&nbsp;<strong>progressive scanning shall be required for all Profiles and Levels</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>What stands out to me the most in the Requirements document are the references to “<strong>fast-switching</strong>” and “<strong>progressive scanning</strong>“. This is a clear indication of the importance that the MPEG body is placing on OTT streaming&nbsp;<em>(and the implicit absence of interlaced video in OTT)</em>.</p>



<p>This was a HUGE problem in HEVC where interlaced support was an after-thought; and it lead to a lot of code-wrangling to retro-fit interlaced support into commercial codecs. I hope VVC does not tread the same interlaced path.</p>



<p>The second comment about fast-switching is interesting and might put pressure on codec vendors to insert more IDRs in the bitstream to support smaller segment sizes and clean, fast, switching between profiles in the ABR bitrate ladder. The reference to open-gops is interesting, because Open-GOPs are very helpful in increasing compression efficiency – so this is something fun to watch out for.</p>



<p>Whenever a discussion about MPEG’s video codecs comes up, the elephant in the room has to be&nbsp;<strong>licensing</strong>. Fraunhofer HHI said in their&nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.fraunhofer.de/-viewonline2/17386/465/11/14SHcBTt/V44RELLZBp/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsletter</a>&nbsp;that,</p>



<blockquote><p>A uniform and transparent licensing model based on the FRAND principle (i.e., fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) is planned to be established for the use of standard essential patents related to H.266/VVC. For this purpose, the Media Coding Industry Forum (MC-IF) was founded.</p></blockquote>



<p>I hope VVC pans out because I’d love to see it in action crunching 4K/8K videos!</p>



<p><strong>Read <a href="https://ottverse.com/x266-vvc-multicoreware-opensource-encoder/">OTTVerse’s update of MulticoreWare’s x266 encoder for VVC.</a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Reference</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/exploration/future-video-coding/requirements-a-future-video-coding-standard-v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Requirements for a Future Video Coding Standard V5</a></p>



<h2 id="essential-video-coding---evc-mpeg-5-part-1"><span id="Essential_Video_Coding_%E2%80%93_EVC_(MPEG5_Part_1)"></span>Essential Video Coding – EVC (MPEG-5 Part 1)<span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG-5 EVC or Essential Video Coding is an MPEG standard backed by Samsung, Huawei, Qualcomm, Divideon as a response to the patent pool mess that HEVC ran it that essentially stymied large-scale adoption of a powerful video compression standard.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/sites/default/files/files/standards/parts/docs/w17928.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirements of the EVC standard</a>&nbsp;were very clearly specified by MPEG as follows –</p>



<ul><li>The test model should consist of two tool sets:&nbsp;<strong>a base and an enhanced tool set</strong></li><li>The base tool set should be configured with tools that were made public more than 20 years ago or for which a Type 1 declaration is received</li><li>There should be additional tools in the enhanced tool set, each of which shall provide a significant improvement in coding efficiency and be capable of being cleanly switched off on an individual basis</li></ul>



<p>EVC’s aim is crystal-clear – provide a royalty-free option for content producers while also providing adequate tools, algorithms, and knobs to produce higher quality video (than the base tool set). And, the enhancement layer’s tools (also referred to as the Main layer) will be subject to royalties.</p>



<p>Sounds good, eh?</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note the following sentence from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibc.org/download?ac=10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBC 2019 paper on EVC</a>&nbsp;and I quote,</p>



<blockquote><p>No considerations have been taken on licensing aspects of the technology other than a requirement for FRAND commitment by the contributors.&nbsp;<strong>Commercial aspects, and in particular, licensing aspects have been handled externally and independently of MPEG.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>They’ve been handled, huh? Okay cool, but I still cross my fingers and say a prayer when I hear “MPEG” and “Licensing” in the same sentence.</p>



<p>Let’s hope that EVC is adopted and supported in the industry quickly – its a good concept and means well.</p>



<p>In a future article, we will do a deep dive into the tools supported in the Base and the Main layers of EVC.</p>



<p><strong>Reference</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibc.org/download?ac=10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Emerging MPEG-5 EVC Standard – Applications, Technology, and Results presented at IBC 2019</a></p>



<h2 id="low-complexity-enhancement-video-coding---lcevc-mpeg-5-part-2"><span id="Low_Complexity_Enhancement_Video_Coding_%E2%80%93_LCEVC_(MPEG5_Part_2)"></span>Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding – LCEVC (MPEG-5 Part 2)<span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG-5 Part 2 LCEVC is being introduced with the aim of increased compression efficiency for existing codecs at little or no-increase in coding complexity by using a base bitstream and an enhancement bitstream.</p>



<p>The LCEVC codec’s output is essentially a combination of a “base bitstream” produced by an existing video codec such as AVC, HEVC, VP9, AV1, etc. along with enhancement layers that can be used conditionally to improve the quality of the video.</p>



<p>If the decoder/end-device supports LCEVC, the enhancement layers are decoded, else, the base codec alone is used to decode the bitstream and the video is rendered to the user. This ensures backward-compatibility and encourages roll-out of the LCEVC codec without the fear of breaking the end-user’s experience.</p>



<p>This concept is nicely captured in the figure below taken from Guido Meardi’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/20191008/Documents/Guido_Meardi_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a>&nbsp;at the ITU Workshop on the Future of Media in Geneva.</p>

<h2 id="what-next"><span id="What_Next"></span>What Next?<span></span></h2>



<p>I think 2020 and 2021 present great challenges and opportunities for the field of video compression.</p>



<p>With consumption increasing due to the COVID-19 situation, most content providers are under the gun to reduce their streaming costs. Dropping the bitrates is one way of reducing your streaming costs, but, conversely, it will be hard to compete with the likes of Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Peacock, fuboTV, DAZN with poor video quality.</p>



<p>If the compression experts can pull off VVC’s goals of 30% bitrate savings over HEVC, then it will be a huge win. The only thing they’ll have to ensure is that they don’t blow their foot off with licensing issues (<em>a-la-HEVC</em>). If things work out properly, VVC should be a good competitor to AV1 especially at high resolutions such as 4K and 8K.</p>



<p><em><strong>However</strong></em>, that being said, I think that among the three codecs …</p></div></div>

</section><p>What if I told you that $2=1$? You may say I’m wrong. OK, well, what if I proved it to you? We can both agree that there’s an $x$ and a $y$ where $x = y$. From there, <a href="https://math.hmc.edu/funfacts/one-equals-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiply, subtract, factorise, divide, substitute, divide again</a>, and you get $2 = 1$.</p>
<p>Still not happy? You’re probably unconvinced by my so-called ‘proof’. OK, I say, and, after a minute, hand you a sheet of paper with the following hastily scrawled on it: <a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=204%2C188" alt="" width="204" height="188" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=300%2C277 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?w=470 470w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>It’s better, but you’re still displeased. This time, I’ve made clear what steps I’m taking from $x = y$ to $2 = 1$. However, you point out, I don’t connect any of these steps. Nodding slowly, I take my time and write out a very nice, orderly proof, complete with justifications for each line:<a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=454%2C241" alt="" width="454" height="241" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?w=1200 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=300%2C160 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=1024%2C544 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=768%2C408 768w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>At this point, you spot my mistake: in going from line 4 to 5, I have divided both sides by $x-y$. But we began with the assumption that $x = y$, meaning that $x-y = 0$, and dividing by 0 is not defined! This means that lines 5 to 7 are operating on nonexistent values and are therefore meaningless.</p>
<p>You’re happy with yourself, but something is bothering you. To reveal my mistake, you asked me to be more precise. But why stop here? Because you found what you were looking for? That’s not how truth is found.</p>
<p>My proof, like all proofs, is a path from one statement to another, just as we may follow the path from $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ to $x = \big(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}\big)/{2a}$, or from the existence of rectangles to the transitivity of parallelism (see below). Along this path I have made several intermediate statements, and linked them together with justifications. You found that one of my links is flawed, and you wonder how we know that the others aren’t also wrong. You begin to question foundational principles, wondering, for instance, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/805939/24325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why we’re even allowed to do the same thing to both sides of an equation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Euclidean geometry:</strong> For the unfamiliar—Euclidean geometry (standard geometry on a flat surface) rests on 5 assumptions, one of which (the <em>parallel postulate</em>) has historically been regarded as ugly. In attempting to eliminate the parallel postulate, mathematicians have found numerous other statements that are equivalent to it, such as that a rectangle exists or that parallelism is transitive.</p>
<p>You keep digging deeper and deeper, questioning more and more of what you previously took to be correct. Eventually, you come across a piece of mathematics that is perhaps the most beautiful and elegant thing you’ve ever laid your eyes upon: <em>natural deduction</em>.</p>
<h2>Natural deduction</h2>
<p>Natural deduction is one result of asking for deeper and deeper justification when doing maths. A system of natural deduction is a set of very simple, almost irrefutable rules that act to formalise our intuition about what is <em>definitely true</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_15535"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15535" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?resize=124%2C71" alt="" width="124" height="71" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?w=293 293w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 124px) 100vw, 124px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15535">Reiteration (R): if $P$, then $P$.</p></div>
<p>These rules include such things as <em>reiteration</em>, which simply allows us to repeat ourselves. Precisely, reiteration says that if you know that a statement $P$ is true, then you can conclude that $P$ is true. This is hardly controversial.</p>
<div id="attachment_15536"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15536" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=193%2C120" alt="" width="193" height="120" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?w=422 422w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=300%2C187 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15536">Conjunction introduction ($\land$I): if $P$ and $Q$ then $P\land Q$.</p></div>
<p>There are two rules for the natural idea of ‘and’. First is the so-called <em>conjunction introduction</em> rule, stating that if you know that $P$ and $Q$ are both true, then you may conclude $P \land Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ and $Q$’. On the other side, we have <em>conjunction elimination</em>, stating that if you know that $P \land Q$ is true, then you may conclude $P$ and also may conclude $Q$.</p>
<div id="attachment_15537"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15537" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=176%2C121" alt="" width="176" height="121" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?w=384 384w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=300%2C205 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15537">Conjunction elimination ($\land$E): if $P\land Q$, then $P$ and $Q$.</p></div>
<p>These rules don’t feel like they do much besides swapping out ‘and’ for ‘$\land$’; however, doing so is important for formality and precision.</p>
<div id="attachment_15538"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15538" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=172%2C78" alt="" width="172" height="78" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?w=373 373w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=300%2C136 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15538">Disjunction introduction ($\lor$I): if $P$, then $P\lor Q$.</p></div>
<p>Things start to get tricky with the rules codifying ‘or’. The first, <em>disjunction introduction</em>, tells us that if $P$ is true, then you may conclude $P \lor Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ or $Q$’: if I am hungry, then it’s also true that I’m either hungry or tired.</p>
<div id="attachment_15539"><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15539" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=258%2C332" alt="" width="258" height="332" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?w=568 568w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=232%2C300 232w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15539">Disjunction elimination ($\lor$E): if $P\lor Q$ and from $P$ we can prove $X$ and from $Q$ we can prove $X$, then $X$.</p></div>
<p>The second rule, <em>disjunction elimination</em>, states that if $P \lor Q$ is true, and from $P$ you can prove $X$, and from $Q$ you can prove $X$, then you may conclude $X$. More colloquially, if either $P$ or $Q$ is true, and in both cases $X$ is true, too, then $X$ is true. For example, if I’m either well-rested or well-fed, and being well-rested makes me happy, and being well-fed makes me happy, then I must be happy.</p>
<div id="attachment_15540"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15540" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=222%2C212" alt="" width="222" height="212" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?w=472 472w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=300%2C287 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15540">Implication introduction ($\Rightarrow$I): if from $P$ we can prove $Q$, then $P\Rightarrow Q$.</p></div>
<p>Then come the rules regarding implication. We have <em>implication introduction</em>, stating that if from $P$ we can prove $Q$, then we may conclude $P \Rightarrow Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ implies $Q$’. And we have <em>implication elimination</em> (also known as <em>modus ponens</em>), which states that if $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true and $P$ is true, then we can conclude $Q$. If the weather being rainy implies that I am cosy, and the weather is rainy, then I must be cosy.</p>
<div id="attachment_15541"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15541" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=220%2C121" alt="" width="220" height="121" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?w=477 477w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=300%2C165 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15541">Implication elimination ($\Rightarrow$E): if $P\Rightarrow Q$ and $P$, then $Q$.</p></div>
<p>Finally, we come to the most arcane rules, those handling negation. The negation of $P$ is written $\neg P$ and pronounced ‘not $P$’. Before talking about the $\neg P$ rules, however, we must first introduce a new symbol: $\bot$ (pronounced ‘bottom’), which represents impossibility or contradiction. We can then introduce <em>bottom introduction</em>, which states that if both $P$ and $\neg P$ are true, which is absurd (usually… there are systems of logic that admit both $P$ and $\neg P$ at the same time, called <em>paraconsistent</em> logics), then we can conclude $\bot$, to represent this impossibility.</p>
<div id="attachment_15542"><p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15542" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=195%2C134" alt="" width="195" height="134" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?w=383 383w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=300%2C206 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15542">Bottom introduction ($\bot$I): if $P$ and $\neg P$, then $\bot$.</p></div>
<p>We’re then able to make use of $\bot$ through <em>negation introduction</em>, which states that if from $P$ we can prove $\bot$, then we can conclude $\neg P$. This is reasonable; if $P$ being true led to a contradiction, then $P$ isn’t true, so $\neg P$ is.</p>
<div id="attachment_15543"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15543" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=228%2C231" alt="" width="228" height="231" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?w=443 443w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=295%2C300 295w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=45%2C45 45w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15543">Negation introduction ($\neg$I): if from $P$ we can prove $\bot$, then $\neg P$.</p></div>
<p>Finally we have <em>negation elimination</em>. This one is a nice easy way to end: it says that if we know $\neg \neg P$, then we can conclude $P$. If something isn’t not true, then it must be true!</p>
<div id="attachment_15532"><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15532" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?resize=173%2C78" alt="" width="173" height="78" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?w=372 372w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?resize=300%2C135 300w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 173px) 100vw, 173px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15532">Negation elimination ($\neg$E): if $\neg\neg P$, then $P$.</p></div>
<p>And with that, we have completed (one kind of) natural deduction, laying out a framework for proofs based on undeniable principles so that we can be <em>completely</em> confident in our results.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering, hey, maths is about numbers and shapes and functions and vector fields, but all we’ve been working with are $P$s and $Q$s! Not a single $n$ or $x$, let alone an $f$, has been written so far!</p>
<p>Fear not! Purely logical systems such as natural deduction are key ingredient for building typical maths. For example, to define numbers, we may first extend to <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-precise-difference-between-propositional-and-predicate-logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicate logic</a>, then construct the naturals (via the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peano axioms</a></em>), which we’ll use to make the <a href="http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~pavel/syllabi_old/aluffi_321/NZ.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integers</a> and the <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/groisser/files/rationals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rationals</a> (via equivalence classes), then finally the reals (via <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedekind cuts</a></em>).</p>
<p>So, in fact, we still we get to work with all the maths we’re used to! Plus, due to the use of natural deduction, we have the added benefit of being confident about what we’re doing at every layer of abstraction!</p>
<p><strong>Predicate and propositional logic:</strong> The logic we’ve been building, with $\land$, $\lor$, $\Rightarrow$, $\neg$, and $\bot$, is known as <em>propositional</em> or <em>zeroth-order logic</em>. <em>Predicate</em> or <em>first-order logic</em> is an extension of propositional logic wherein our statements ($P$, $Q$, $X$, etc) may be parametrised. So as well as having $H$ mean that ‘I am hungry’, we may also have $\mathcal H(x)$ mean that ‘$x$ is hungry’. Additionally, predicate logic includes two <em>quantifiers</em>, $\forall$ and $\exists$, which respectively mean ‘for every’ and ‘there exists’: $\forall x \mathcal H(x)$ means that everyone is hungry, and $\exists x \mathcal H(x)$ means that (at least) one person is hungry.</p>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>If you’re anything like I was at age 17, or anything like how I portrayed you in the beginning of this article, you’re drooling right now. It’s like all of your fantasies regarding rigour and precision have been heard and answered by divine mathematicians.</p>
<p>But maybe you’re not intrinsically motivated by rigour, so you’re less excited by natural deduction. Which is fine! I’m not hurt. Maybe a little bit. Or maybe you just feel that this is overkill—did you <em>really</em> need all this work to know that $2 \neq 1$? Or maybe you’re not convinced that these rules are correct; perhaps you don’t agree that from $\neg \neg P$ we can conclude $P$.</p>
<p><strong>Excluding the middle:</strong> If you don’t agree, you are not alone! That $\neg \neg P$ entails $P$ is a consequence of a rule called the <em>law of excluded middle</em>, which states that $P \lor \neg P$. (This law is built-in to the system of natural deduction that we created.) Some mathematicians (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>intuitionists</em> or <em>constructionists</em></a>) reject the law of excluded middle, thus also forfeiting that $\neg \neg P$ entails $P$. One reason to question the law of excluded middle is that it allows us to state that something exists without stating what it is. For instance, we are able to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/104121/243259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prove that an irrational number raised to the power of an irrational number can be rational</a>, but <em>without</em> giving an actual example. If we reject the law of excluded middle, then all such proofs must <em>actually construct</em> an example.</p>
<p>Still, I posit, natural deduction is worth your time. Because we’ve been so rigorous in building the system up, we gain the benefit of knowing <em>exactly what we’re talking about</em>. Before establishing such precision, we may have used $P \Rightarrow Q$, but without a sense of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The key reason why you (and likely most developers) struggle with CSS, is that you underestimate it.</p><p>Underestimating CSS leads to a strange feeling of tediousness when writing it, which makes having to deal with it a laborious and seemingly unrewarding task. Style by style, div by div, media query by media query. Having to make endless small tweaks in what feels like an open-ended ‘design’ process with no direction at all can feel like torture to a development-oriented mind.</p><p>Not to mention a complete lack of debugging tools and methods available for when things go wrong.</p><p>This underestimation is a subset of a problem that we developers tend to have with design in general. In short, we don’t think it’s that important. We don’t understand or appreciate its <em>meaning</em>.</p><p>In reality, CSS is as complicated, maybe more so, as any programming language or framework you will ever come across.</p><p>But the general feeling that it is an afterthought within the development process overall, only adds fuel to fire of the thought that leads you to feel that it is tedious.</p><p>The best way to start to get better at it then, is to gain a new appreciation for it, as a 'hard', technical thing. Which it is.</p><p><strong>You do this by reframing how you see it.</strong></p><p>You can start to learn to like CSS by understanding it from a problem solving technical aspect. As an act of 'constructing' a page rather than 'designing' it. By <a target="_blank" title="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/" href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/">engaging the engineering side of your mind</a>.</p><p>Instead of seeing CSS as an annoying way to 'style' pages, see it instead as a visual programming language for constructing visual guides (UI's) for your user.</p><p>You don't 'style' pages, you 'construct' and 'architect' them. It sounds weird to use these words, but they have a massive effect on changing your perception of what you're doing. And that has a massive effect on your impression and willingness to learn how to do it well.</p><p>Essentially, you can properly learn CSS by transforming it in your mind from a 'styling' problem thing, to an 'engineering' problem thing.</p><p>This defeats the feeling of tedium that your mind has when you’re dealing with CSS, and over time, if applied with some of the specific additional tactics that I will explain below, leads to actually _enjoying_ the process of writing CSS.</p><h2>Tactics That Reduce CSS Tediousness &amp; Lead To CSS Enjoyment</h2><p>Once you’ve started to reframe the act of utilizing CSS in your mind, and start to see it as more of a tool for an engineering problem rather than a ‘design’ problem, embers of enjoyment will start to emerge within you as you are writing your CSS. From here, you can start to add some fuel to the growing fire. </p><p>You can do this by utilizing some strategies, tools and techniques that further reduce the tediousness of CSS. </p><p><strong>Let’s go through them.</strong></p><h3>Use tediousness reducing tools, such as <a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. So you can abstract CSS.</h3><p>I remember back a few years ago when the <a target="_blank" title="https://laravel.com/" href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a> came out. PHP Programmers all over the web were fawning over it. The most common phrase I heard was that it gave programmers “their enjoyment of programming” back. This with a language that was notoriously derided as one that was tedious to use.</p><p>What Laravel did was abstract a lot of the annoying parts of most of these developers' workflows when writing PHP code. These developers, at this newfound higher level of abstraction, could now focus on ‘crafting’ their applications, becoming ‘artisans’ of their code rather than simply PHP programmers.</p><p>TailwindCSS does the same thing for CSS. Instead of moving from one file to another to define your styles, Tailwind uses standard default class presets that allow you to write your CSS, essentially directly onto your HTML elements. This <a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">might sound weird</a> at first, but in the end, actually results in a LOT of saved time in development.</p><p>Over time, it, along with other tools, such as Flexbox, also massively increases enjoyment, as you start to intuitively ‘craft’ and construct pages at a higher level of abstraction, rather than simply ‘style’ them.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong><strong>:</strong> The creator of TailwindCSS, <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> actually started out as a Laravel Developer, so maybe that enthusiasm crossed over to his other project areas.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><strong>:</strong> I recently came across a very nice feature in Firefox that helps in debugging overflow issues (one of the most common CSS problems). You can see it in action <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386" href="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386">here</a>.</p><h3>Understand how to solve common problems in CSS</h3><p>Because of the lack of debugging tools that are currently available for CSS. Most of debugging within it largely consists of cross-referencing ways that others have dealt with the issue you’re currently facing.</p><p>While this is likely not an uncommon practice in your development workflow (its why StackOverflow exists), it is very time consuming if it is the ONLY way that you can debug. </p><p>One way around this issue is to become familiar with the most common pattern of problems that occur within CSS, and then try to build a repository of solutions to those problems in your mind over time. This sounds simple enough but it very dramatically decreases tedium and increases productivity and speed of development, which ultimately increases your enjoyment.</p><p>For example, one of the most common issues, as referenced in the post drawing, is ‘overflow’ of elements occurring within the page. Sometimes causing the entire page itself to overflow at certain screen sizes. A tutorial like this, outlines the best way to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>Sidenote</strong><strong>:</strong> We are creating a short ebook that deals with this problem, by outlining these most common CSS problems and their solutions, you can sign up for notification of this here: <a target="_blank" title="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8" href="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8">How To Debug CSS</a>.</p><h3>Master layouts and positioning in CSS (the most tedious aspect of it)</h3><p>As a follow-on to the above point on simply gaining an understanding of the most common aspects of the CSS writing process, the most common of these in terms of general page creation, is that of simply layout out a page, and its elements and making sure that they are positioned and aligned properly. </p><p>The best way to approach problems in a way that solves them most effectively is in an 80/20 way. Mastery of layouts and positioning is the 20% that leads to the 80% of results with CSS. And what will have the most dramatic effect on reducing the tediousness of your CSS writing process.</p><p>Using tools such as Flexbox, as is mentioned above, also makes layouts and positioning twice as easy, once you understand the fundamentals behind it. </p><p>Overall, it’s with this knowledge that you may start to enjoy and view the process as ‘constructing’ pages, rather than simply ‘styling’ them.</p><h3>Practice regularly until it becomes second nature</h3><p>One simple thing that I found, as I started to implement some of the tactics above into my own workflow, was that as I became more proficient in writing CSS and it started to become second nature, my enjoyment of it also started to increase, which lead to a positive feedback loop that kept increasing my overall ability.</p><p>This is a very positive flywheel that I highly encourage. Once you’ve started to change your mindset about CSS and use the right tools to abstract a lot of the tediousness out of it, practicing it regularly is then like adding jet fuel to your workflow. Eventually, CSS will become something you look forward to, rather than an afterthought that you try to avoid.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Service-to-service authentication is the ability of one service to identify its clients. It’s a good idea to ensure that a service accepts requests only from specified services. But how to implement access controls (authorization)?</p>
<p>For instance, only the service <code>cart</code> is granted to bind to the service <code>invoice</code>, and only two services <code>invoice</code> and <code>billing</code> are granted to bind to the service <code>payment</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://regeda.me/s2s_seq.svg" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Firstly, we must decide on the unique key of service, the attribute of a caller to be verified by a recipient. Do you think the IP address or hostname is manageable in the infrastructure at scale? It’s challenging in a multi-tenant environment where different personas can park successively the same network identity in a short period.</p>
<p>Let’s consider an <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/X509-certificate">X.509 certificate</a> which is a widely used standard for network security and identity verification.</p>
<h2 id="give-a-secure-identity-to-components">Give a secure identity to components</h2>
<p>We could go over the long way to <a href="https://www.semurity.com/how-to-setup-your-own-certificate-authority-ca-using-openssl/">set up your own Certificate Authority and sign a certificate using OpenSSL</a>. For the sake of simplicity, I use the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl"><strong>sfssl</strong></a> toolkit for certificates management.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">go get -u github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/...
</code></pre></div><h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>The <code>sfssl</code> toolkit expects two files to generate a certificate:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>config.json</code> – settings for the issuer</li>
<li><code>csr.json</code> – request for a certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The file <code>config.json</code> contains settings for the Certificate Authority. We are interested in the <code>profiles</code> section for our certificates:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"signing"</span>: {
    <span>"profiles"</span>: {
      <span>"service"</span>: {
        <span>"usages"</span>: [
          <span>"signing"</span>,
          <span>"key encipherment"</span>,
          <span>"server auth"</span>,
          <span>"client auth"</span>
        ],
        <span>"expiry"</span>: <span>"720h"</span>
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The file <code>csr/ca.json</code> contains the request for the Certificate Authority certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"CN"</span>: <span>"Demo Citadel"</span>,
  <span>"names"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"C"</span>: <span>"US"</span>,
      <span>"L"</span>: <span>"San Francisco"</span>,
      <span>"O"</span>: <span>"Citadel, Inc."</span>,
      <span>"ST"</span>: <span>"CA"</span>
    }
  ],
  <span>"ca"</span>: {
    <span>"expiry"</span>: <span>"86700h"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The file <code>csr/service.json</code> contains the request for the service certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"CN"</span>: <span>"citadel.xyz"</span>,
  <span>"names"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"C"</span>: <span>"US"</span>,
      <span>"L"</span>: <span>"San Francisco"</span>,
      <span>"O"</span>: <span>"Citadel, Inc."</span>,
      <span>"ST"</span>: <span>"CA"</span>
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre></div><h3 id="generating">Generating</h3>
<p>The Certificate Authority certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">cfssl gencert -initca csr/ca.json | cfssljson -bare pki/ca –
</code></pre></div><p>Meantime, we reached the important step and have to define the unique attribute of service. Usually, the service has a name and it belongs to a company. Hence we need to stamp the identity <code>citadel:srv-invoice</code> into the handcrafted X.509 certificate along with the server hostname <code>host1.infra.citadel.net</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">cfssl gencert <span>\
</span><span></span>-ca pki/ca.pem -ca-key pki/ca-key.pem <span>\
</span><span></span>-config config.json <span>\
</span><span></span>-profile service <span>\
</span><span></span>-hostname <span>'host1.infra.citadel.net,citadel:srv-invoice'</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>csr/service.json | cfssljson -bare pki/srv-invoice-host1 -
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s check the resulted alternative name from the issued certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">openssl x509 -in pki/srv-invoice-host1.pem -text | grep -A <span>1</span> <span>'Alternative Name'</span>
</code></pre></div><pre><code>X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:host1.infra.citadel.net, URI:citadel:srv-invoice
</code></pre><p>💚 The service identity <code>citadel:srv-invoice</code> successfully assigned to the server <code>host1.infra.citadel.net</code>.</p>
<h2 id="consume-the-service-identity-in-go">Consume the service identity in Go</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the callback <code>VerifyConnection</code> of <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#Config"><code>tls.Config</code></a> was introduced in Go 1.15:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>tls</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Config</span> <span>struct</span> {
    <span>VerifyConnection</span> <span>func</span>(<span>ConnectionState</span>) <span>error</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>The Go documentation says: if the function returns an error, the TLS handshake is aborted. Hence we are enabled to restrain the TLS connection permit by own.</p>
<p>For testing purposes, we make the simplest access control by a prefix:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>var</span> <span>errAccessForbidden</span> = <span>errors</span>.<span>New</span>(<span>"access forbidden"</span>)

<span>func</span> <span>verifyPeerPrefix</span>(<span>prefix</span> <span>string</span>) <span>func</span>(<span>tls</span>.<span>ConnectionState</span>) <span>error</span> {
	<span>return</span> <span>func</span>(<span>s</span> <span>tls</span>.<span>ConnectionState</span>) <span>error</span> {
		<span>// The first element is the leaf certificate
</span><span></span>		<span>// that the connection is verified against.
</span><span></span>		<span>for</span> <span>_</span>, <span>uri</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>s</span>.<span>PeerCertificates</span>[<span>0</span>].<span>URIs</span> {
			<span>if</span> <span>strings</span>.<span>HasPrefix</span>(<span>uri</span>.<span>String</span>(), <span>prefix</span>) {
				<span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
			}
		}
		<span>return</span> <span>errAccessForbidden</span>
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>Then prepare <code>tls.Config</code> for the server listener. Necessarily, the callback should be provided in conjunction with the mutual TLS authentication enabled:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>cfg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>tls</span>.<span>Config</span>{
	<span>ClientAuth</span>:       <span>tls</span>.<span>RequireAndVerifyClientCert</span>,
	<span>VerifyConnection</span>: <span>verifyPeerPrefix</span>(<span>"citadel:srv"</span>),
}
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>The constant <code>tls.RequireAndVerifyClientCert</code> of <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#ClientAuthType"><code>tls.ClientAuthType</code></a> indicates the server will request a client certificate and if none is provided the session will terminate, if the client certificate cannot be verified (a corresponding CA (root) certificate cannot be found) the session will also be terminated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hooray! We implemented service-to-service authorization based on well-known standards (X.509 certificates and the TLS protocol) with vital features out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity issuing</strong> through the standard toolkit for generating certificates.</li>
<li><strong>Identity verification</strong> by the trusted Certificate Authority</li>
<li><strong>Identity expiration and revocation</strong>  to be confident that the temporary access or a compromised certificate have never been used for years.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the approach has the undeniable advantage to be fluently integrated into the running infrastructure leveraging the TLS protocol. For instance, traffic in Service Mesh is not only secured by TLS, but it’s also hardened by access and identity management through X.509 certificates.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><div><main><section><p><a href="https://vectorized.io/redpanda-raison-detre">As I have previously observed</a>, software does not run on category theory, it runs on superscalar CPUs with wide, multi-channel GB/s memory units and NVMe SSD access times in the order of 10-100’s of microseconds. The reason some software written a decade ago - on a different hardware platform - feels slow is because it fails to exploit the advances in modern hardware.</p>
<p>The new bottleneck in storage systems is the CPU. SSD devices are 100-1000x faster than spinning disks and are 10x cheaper today[1] than they were a decade ago, from $2,500 down to $200 per Terabyte. Networks have 100x higher throughput in public clouds from 1Gbps to 100Gbps.</p>
<p>Although computers did, in fact, get faster, single-core speeds remain roughly the same. The reason being that CPU frequency has a cubic dependency on power consumption, and we’ve hit a wall. Instruction level parallelism, prefetching, speculative execution, branch prediction, deep hierarchy of data caches and instruction caches, etc, have contributed to programs <em>feeling</em> faster when you interact with them, but in the datacenter, the material improvements have come from the rise in core count. While the instructions per clock are 3x higher than a decade ago, core count is up 20x.</p>
<p>This is all to say that the rise of readily available, many-core systems necessitates a different approach for building infrastructure. Case in point[9]: in order to take full advantage of 96 vCPUs on a i3en.metal on AWS, you’ll need to find a way to exploit sustained CPU clock speed of 3.1 GHz, 60 TB of total NVMe instance storage, 768 GiB of memory and NVMe devices capable of delivering up to 2 million random IOPS at 4 KB block sizes. This kind of beast necessitates a new kind of storage engine and threading model that leverages these hardware advances.</p>
<p><a href="https://vectorized.io/tpc-buffers/vectorized.io/redpanda">Redpanda</a> - a Kafka-API compatible system for mission critical workloads[3] - addresses all of these issues. It uses a thread-per-core architecture with Structured Message Passing (SMP) to communicate between these pinned threads. Threading is a foundational decision for any application, whether you are using a thread-pool, pinned threads with a network of Single Producer Single Consumer SPSC[7] queues, or any other of the advanced Safe Memory Reclamation (SMR) techniques, threading is your ring-0, the true kernel of your application. It tells you what your sensitivity is for blocking - which for Redpanda is less than 500 microseconds - otherwise, Seastar’s[4] reactor will print a stack trace warning you of the blocking since it effectively injects latency on the network poller.</p>
<p>Once you have decided on your threading model, the next step is your memory model and ultimately, for storage engines, your buffer management. In this post, we’ll cover the perils of buffer management in a thread-per-core environment and describe <code>iobuf</code>, our solution for a 0-copy memory management in the world of Seastar.</p>
<h2 id="Request-Flow-Architecture">Request Flow Architecture<a href="#Request-Flow-Architecture" aria-label="Request Flow Architecture permalink"></a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Redpanda uses a <em>single</em> pinned thread per core architecture to do everything. Network polling, submitting async IO to the kernel, reaping events, triggering timers, scheduling compute tasks, etc. Structurally, it means nothing can block for longer than 500 microseconds, or you’ll be introducing latency in other parts of your stack. This is an incredibly strict programming paradigm, but this opinionated idea forces a truly asynchronous system, whether you like it or not as the programmer.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/31d1a730c507b605e6c1ebea60eb1e56/flow.svg" alt="Kafka request flow">
<small>
Figure 1: request flow architecture. Core-0 accepts the connection from the Kafka Java client and becomes the source core. After the request goes through the metadata cache(valid request) it filters through the partition router which decides to send the request to core-1, the destination core. Core-1 then accepts the write through the Raft-log interface and saves it to disk.
</small></p>
<p>The challenge in a TpC (thread-per-core) architecture[8] is that all communication between cores is explicit. This muscles the programmer into implementing algorithms that favor core-locality (d-cache, i-cache) over the straightforward multi-threaded implementations via mutexes. This imperative has to be co-designed with the asynchronicity of a <strong>future&lt;&gt;</strong>-based implementation.</p>
<p>For our Kafka-API implementation as shown in Figure 1, we explicitly trade memory usage to reduce latency and increase throughput by materializing key components. The metadata Cache is materialized on every core since every request has to know if the partition exists, and that that particular machine is, in fact, the leader of the partition. The Partition Router maintains a map of which logical core actually owns the underlying Kafka partition on the machine. Other things like Access Control Lists (ACLs) are deferred until the request reaches the destination core since they can get unwieldy in memory footprint.  We have no hard and fast rule of what we materialize on every core vs. what is deferred for the destination core, and it’s often a function of memory (smaller data structures are good candidates for broadcast), computation (how much time is spent deciding) and frequency of access (very likely operations tend to get materialized on every core).</p>
<p>One question remaining is how, exactly, does memory management work in a TpC architecture? How does data actually travel from L-core-0 to L-core-66 safely using a network of SPSC queues within a fully asynchronous execution model where things can suspend at any point in time?</p>
<h2 id="struct-iobuf--">struct iobuf { };<a href="#struct-iobuf--" aria-label="struct iobuf   permalink"></a></h2>
<h3 id="Redpandas-0-copy-buffer-management-for-TpC">Redpanda’s 0-copy buffer management for TpC<a href="#Redpandas-0-copy-buffer-management-for-TpC" aria-label="Redpandas 0 copy buffer management for TpC permalink"></a></h3>
<p>To understand <strong>iobuf</strong>, we need to understand the actual memory constraints of Seastar, our TpC framework. During program bootstrap, Seastar allocates the full memory of the computer and splits it evenly across all the cores. It consults the hardware to understand what memory belongs to each particular core, reducing inter-core traffic to main memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/efa273909c5b695bf7f978f77b32c12b/seastar_model.svg" alt="Seastar mental model">

Figure 2: Copy from alexgallego.org (<a href="https://www.alexgallego.org/concurrency/smf/2017/12/16/future.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow">https://www.alexgallego.org/concurrency/smf/2017/12/16/future.html</a>) Seastar threading model. Seastar uses a network of SPS queues to send messages to neighboring cores. Similar to other message passing or actor models like Erlang, Orleans and Pony, once a function is futurized, transitive functions too will become futurized. Both approaches, however, are intrinsically safe. The programmer worries about correctness and construction while the frameworks worry about efficient execution. Counter to general wisdom, it is actually faster and more scalable than the synchronous approach. While the machine does more work, it is executing your code simultaneously. This simultaneity is the key to finishing work sooner.
</small></p>
<p>As Figure 2 suggests, memory allocated on core-0, <em>must</em> be deallocated on core-0. However, there is no way to guarantee that a Java or Go client connecting to Redpanda will actually communicate with the exact core that owns the data.</p>
<p>At its core, an iobuf is a ref-counted, fragmented-buffer-chain with deferred deletes that allows Redpanda to simply share a view of a remote core’s parsed messages as the fragments come in, without incurring a copy overhead.</p>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/6df6fc00e05201d068dc5d03e080606a/iobuf.svg" alt="iobuf architecture"></p>
<p>The fragmented buffers abstraction is not new. The linux kernel has <strong>sk_buff</strong>[5] and the freebsd kernel has an <strong>mbuf</strong>[6] which are roughly similar. The additional extension of an iobuf is that it works in the TCP model leveraging Seastar’s network of SPSC queues to have proper deletes in addition to being able to share sub-views arbitrarily, tailored for a storage-like workload.</p>
<p>Removing the C++ templates, allocators, pooling, pointer caching, etc, one could think of an iobuf as being equivalent to:</p>
<div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>fragment</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span> data<span>;</span>
    size_t ref_count<span>;</span>
    size_t capacity<span>;</span>
    size_t size<span>;</span>

    fragment<span>*</span> next<span>;</span>  
    fragment<span>*</span> prev<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>iobuf</span> <span>{</span>
    fragment<span>*</span> head<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The origins of iobuf are rooted in one of our central product tenets for building a Kafka® replacement for mission critical systems - giving users 10x lower tail latencies for most workloads. Aside from a thread-per-core architecture, the memory management would have been our second bottleneck if not designed from the ground up for latency. On long running storage systems, memory fragmentation is a real problem, and one that is eventually either met with a proper solution (iobuf), stalls or an OOM.</p>
<p>Like its predecessors skbuff and mbuff, iobuf allows us to optimize and train our memory allocator with predictable memory sizes. Here is our iobuf allocation table logic:</p>
<div data-language="cpp"><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>io_allocation_size</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>static</span> <span>constexpr</span> size_t max_chunk_size <span>=</span> <span>128</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span><span>;</span>   </code></pre></div>
<p>Predictability, memory pooling, fixed sizes, size capping, fragmented traversal, etc, are all known techniques to reduce latency. Asking for contiguous and variably sized memory could cause the allocator to compact all of the arenas and reshuffle a lot of bytes for what could be a short-lived request, not only injecting latency on the request path, but for the entire system since we have exactly one thread performing all operations.</p>
<p>Hardware is the platform. When we ask the network layer to give us exactly 11225 bytes in contiguous memory, we are simply asking the allocator to linearize an empty buffer of that exact size and for the network layer to copy bytes as the fragments come from the hardware into the destination buffer. There is ultimately no free lunch when it comes to trying to squeeze every single ounce of performance of your hardware and often it requires re-architecting from zero.</p>

They are doing this through the use of third party tracking scripts, cookies, and pixels which they have embedded on their taxpayer funded official .house.gov and .senate.gov domains.

</p><p>A handful of congressmen also have installed an impressive array of advertising and marketing tech on their .gov websites, sending data about their .gov websites’ visitors to both domestic and foreign data brokers and advertising exchanges such as Avocet, OnAudience, Adobe Demdex, Eyeota, and Weborama. Several congressional websites use more than fifteen times as many third party tracking scripts as ebay.com. Multiple sites also utilize a social media feed widget that communicates with servers belonging to a company based on the outskirts of Moscow, Russia when users open their websites. One congressman even has actual Google Ads iframes embedded on his .house.gov domain.&nbsp;</p><p>A few congressmen may be utilizing their taxpayer funded .gov websites to gather data for their re-election campaigns, which may potentially be in violation of Congressional ethics rules, Federal Election Commission regulations, and Constitutional protections against unwarranted government surveillance.</p>

</ol><p>If you are a technically minded individual or want to jump straight into interesting findings, I recommend you go directly to the Results and Analysis sections. If you want some background on consumer privacy and how tracking tech works, this Introduction section is designed to provide some background context.</p><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>In recent months, there have been increased calls in the US Capitol for strengthening consumer privacy protections and to evaluate the amount of influence tech giants such as Facebook and Google wield over social media, digital advertising, and news dissemination.</p><p>
These two companies command over <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-demand-for-digital-advertising-plummets-google-and-facebook-could-have-shrinking-revenues-2020-04-28">70 percent</a> of the U.S. market share for digital ads. Google and Facebook built their sprawling billion-dollar businesses by providing a myriad of ‘free’ services - social media, content feeds, search results, video, photo sharing, email, and messenger services. They also provide free software tools such as Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel, which website developers can embed within their pages to track user behavior. These consumer and business tools follow hundreds of millions of users around on the internet, placing cookies on users’ browsers and tracking scripts on websites to log peoples’ visits, thereby building detailed profiles of consumers based on their browsing habits and interests. These datasets can then be used to target potential consumers with targeted shoe, vacation, housing, job or political ads.</p><p>
Google and Facebook’s tracking scripts and pixels are among their most popular ‘free’ software tools, and they appear on websites in every corner of the internet. Even lawmakers calling for greater privacy protections use these tools on their congressional .gov websites purportedly to “improve” their websites. What they may actually be doing is sending their constituents’ data to Google and Facebook, thereby augmenting Google and Facebook’s virtual profiles of users.</p><p>There is no shortage of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle clamoring to crown themselves as the champions of our right to privacy online.&nbsp;
</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (MA), one of the most vocal critics of Big Tech, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/3/20965463/tech-2020-candidate-policies-online-data-equifax">argues</a> that breaking up Big Tech would drive accountability into their models and give “people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and sold.”&nbsp;</p><p>
Senator Josh Hawley (MO), a rising Republican star, teamed up with Senator Mark Warner (VA) to introduce the <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senators-warner-and-hawley-introduce-bill-force-social-media-companies-disclose-how-they-are">Do Not Track Act</a> to allow Americans to opt-out of having their data collected. Sen. Hawley explains, “When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads.” He continues, “Tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold.”</p><p>Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) put forward the Mind Your Own Business Act, which he bills&nbsp; as “the strongest-ever protections for Americans’ private data” that “goes further than Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).”&nbsp;</p><p>
<strong>Given these lawmakers’ promises to protect Americans’ online privacy, I was curious how their own, taxpayer funded, .</strong><strong><em>gov</em></strong><strong> websites fare in protecting and respecting users’ privacy?</strong> Do their congressional websites, paid for and maintained with taxpayer funds, hold up to their own standards?</p><p>A few months ago, while I was working on a <a href="https://adalytics.io/">chrome extension</a> to collect and analyze digital ads, I noticed many representatives’ websites host dozens of 3rd party cookies and tracking scripts on their .house.gov and .senate.gov websites. This means that the moment you (or a child in your household) visits your Senator or Congressperson’s website, all sorts of information about you--your IP address, physical location, how much time you spend on the page, what browser you’re using, the dimensions of your computer monitor, your computer’s operating system, social media identifiers -- can potentially be sent over to Google, Facebook, and other third party companies.</p><h2 id="context">Context</h2><p>So how exactly do data brokers or tech companies track users across different internet domains? Here I will provide a quick background on the technical means through which tracking tools operate.</p><p>When you open a website such as example.com, your computer’s browser makes a network call over the internet to that domain’s servers, which return an initial HTML document. That document contains instructions your browser parses to show text and styling, as well as further instructions for loading images or dynamic Javascript elements.</p><p>By making that initial request to example.com, your device established a quick internet connection that allowed example.com’s servers to see a few pieces of information about your browser, including your IP address. Services such as <a href="https://ipinfo.io/">ipinfo.io</a> allow one to translate a numeric IP address into a geographic location, such as that of your house or the cafe whose WiFi you are using.&nbsp;</p><p>If a web developer installed third party javascript files on a website, this serves as an embedded instruction to make your browser fetch additional files from another domain besides the one you are currently perusing. Tracking scripts such as Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel can be loaded this way, and they then act as data sensors, transmitting additional data points back not only to example.com, but also to Google and Facebook’s servers. Certain audience management or data brokers operate on this principle - a developer installs the data broker’s Javascript on their website, and then the data broker can gather information about the website’s visitors and cross-reference with other website’s data, as well as real world data such as credit cars, public records, and real estate ownership records.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to javascript, many trackers load tiny, transparent images referred to as <a href="https://adtechbook.clearcode.cc/user-identification/">pixels</a>. Facebook <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight/2020/09/22/how-we-built-a-real-time-privacy-inspector#facebook-pixel">Pixel</a> is such an image. When a website configures Facebook Pixel on its pages, that causes users’ browsers to make a network call to Facebook’s servers to retrieve that tiny image. Facebook Pixel can identify a particular user’s Facebook account ID and relay that over the network. This information can then be used to target ads, including potentially <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-in-2020/political-advertising-on-social-media-platforms/">political</a> ads. Facebook Pixel can track activity even when a user is not logged into their Facebook account. Facebook’s targeted ad system ‘learns’ from Pixel events as well as custom user profile lists marketers can upload to create a target audience profile.&nbsp;</p><p>When your browser fetches images, javascript, or other resources after parsing a webpage’s HTML instructions, it can also receive instructions to store short pieces of text known as ‘cookies’. A first party cookie is one that is set by the domain you are currently visiting - so if you are on example.com, any cookies from example.com are first party. First party cookies can only be read by code sent from example.com.</p><p>If your browser receives instructions to store a cookie from Facebook or Youtube, those are <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-cookies-and-similar-technologies/">third</a> party cookies. First party cookies are frequently used to maintain user login state or save website specific preferences. Third party cookies can serve an additional purpose, which is to allow user’s behavior and usage across different web properties to be tracked. When you navigate to a different website, those third party cookies can be used to identify you as the user that was previously on …</p></div></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the last years I’ve been working on very different operating
systems. Operating systems are usually incredibly complex beasts. I
think there are mainly three drivers of this complexity. Surprisingly
enough, neither of these is having to deal with hardware.</p>

<p>The first one is resource <strong>discovery</strong>, i.e. figuring out how the
computer the OS is running on actually looks like. On x86, this
involves parsing countless bitfields, tables, executing byte code
provided by the firmware, probing individual features, etc. The most
painful example of this I’ve seen so far is figuring out which
interrupt a particular PCI interrupt line is routed to. It’s worth a
set of posts, but until then, feel free to checkout <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/501912/">this
description</a>. (If it’s down, it’s
also cached by
<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CXZUV61m7hwJ:https://habr.com/en/post/501912/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk">Google</a>.)</p>

<p>The second issue is <strong>resource management</strong>. Essentially, how do you
hand out and eventually reclaim all the resources you discovered. For
some workloads performance matters here, so this code is usually
written with speed in mind.</p>

<p>The third reason is that at compile time the <strong>workload</strong> is
unclear. So the kernel has to assume the worst. It must be ready to
start a couple of hundred VMs or create a thousand TCP sockets in a
blink of an eye, because there is no way to know what’s going to
happen or what the actual requirements are.</p>

<p>A fun exercise is to checkout the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/virt/kvm/kvm_main.c#L739">KVM code for creating
VMs</a>. Try
to follow
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c#L9904">the</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c#L7059">code</a>
to where the actual VM is created in hardware. <em>Spoiler:</em> There is
none. It’s all figuring out what the platform can do and then setting
up a bunch of spinlock, mutexes, lists, arrays, structs, …</p>

<p>I don’t want to pick on KVM in particular. I think it’s pretty ok as
far as Linux kernel code goes. Operating System kernel code is mostly
like this: A lot of really mind numbing platform discovery and
resource management code written for speed assuming the worst case
requirements in a language that doesn’t do parsing, resource
management or concurrency well (among other things).</p>

<p>People take this all for granted. But when I look around, I see many
systems that don’t need this complexity and where it is only a safety
and security burden. Consider most appliance-type products, e.g. a
Wi-Fi router. Or a system that runs one service on a cloud VM. You
know everything in advance!</p>

<p>If you read until this point, you are probably asking yourself, where
I am going with this. If you think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_kernel">separation
kernel</a>, you are
right. My rough plan to write a couple of more posts to flesh out the
idea of doing all the complicated OS parts at compile time and how
this results in an incredibly simple, secure, and efficient system at
runtime. There will be <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a>,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>,
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> content.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">George
Orwell’s review of C. S. Lewis, <i>That
Hideous Strength</i> (1945)<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>



<p><span lang="EN-US">THE SCIENTISTS TAKE OVER<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><i><span lang="EN-US">Manchester Evening News</span></i></b><b><span lang="EN-US">, 16 August 1945. </span></b><span lang="EN-US">Reprinted in <i>The Complete Works of George Orwell</i>, ed. Peter Davison,
Vol. XVII (1998), No. 2720 (first half), pp. 250–251<o:p></o:p></span></p>











<p><span lang="EN-GB">On</span><span lang="EN-US"> the whole, novels are better when there are no
miracles in them. Still, it is possible to think of a fairly large number of worth-while
books in which ghosts, magic, second-sight, angels, mermaids, and what-not play
a part.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Mr. C. S. Lewis’s “That Hideous Strength” can be included in their number –
though, curiously enough, it would probably have been a better book if the
magical element had been left out. For in essence it is a crime story, and the
miraculous happenings, though they grow more frequent towards the end, are not
integral to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">In general outline, and to some extent in atmosphere, it rather resembles
G. K. Chesterton’s “The Man Who Was Thursday.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Mr. Lewis probably owes something to Chesterton as a writer, and certainly
shares his horror of modern machine <span>civilisation</span> (the
title of the book, by the way, is taken from a poem about the Tower of Babel)
and his reliance on the “eternal verities” of the Christian Church, as against
scientific materialism or nihilism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">His book describes the struggle of a little group of sane people against a
nightmare that nearly conquers the world. A company of mad scientists – or,
perhaps, they are not mad, but have merely destroyed in themselves all human
feeling, all notion of good and evil – are plotting to conquer Britain, then
the whole planet, and then other planets, until they have brought the universe
under their control.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">All superfluous life is to be wiped out, all natural forces tamed, the
common people are to be used as slaves and vivisection subjects by the ruling
caste of scientists, who even see their way to conferring immortal life upon
themselves. Man, in short, is to storm the heavens and overthrow the gods, or
even to become a god himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">There is nothing outrageously improbable in such a conspiracy. Indeed, at a
moment when a single atomic bomb – of a type already pronounced “obsolete” –
has just blown probably three hundred thousand people to fragments, it sounds
all too topical. Plenty of people in our age do entertain the monstrous dreams
of power that Mr. Lewis attributes to his characters, and we are within sight
of the time when such dreams will be <span>realisable</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">His description of the N.I.C.E. (National Institute of Co-ordinated
Experiments), with its world-wide ramifications, its private army, its secret
torture chambers, and its inner ring of adepts ruled over by a mysterious
personage known as The Head, is as exciting as any detective story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">It would be a very hardened reader who would not experience a thrill on
learning that The Head is actually – however, that would be giving the game
away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">One could recommend this book unreservedly if Mr. Lewis had succeeded in keeping
it all on a single level. Unfortunately, the supernatural keeps breaking in,
and it does so in rather confusing, undisciplined ways. The scientists are <span>endeavouring</span>, among other things, to get hold of the body
of the ancient Celtic magician Merlin, who has been buried – not dead, but in a
trance – for the last 1,500 years, in hopes of learning from him the secrets of
pre-Christian magic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">They are frustrated by a character who is only doubtfully a human being,
having spent part of his time on another planet where he has been gifted with
eternal youth. Then there is a woman with second sight, one or two ghosts, and
various superhuman visitors from outer space, some of them with rather tiresome
names which derive from earlier books of Mr. Lewis’s. The book ends in a way
that is so preposterous that it does not even succeed in being horrible in
spite of much bloodshed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Much is made of the fact that the scientists are actually in touch with
evil spirits, although this fact is known only to the inmost circle. Mr. Lewis
appears to believe in the existence of such spirits, and of benevolent ones as
well. He is entitled to his beliefs, but they weaken his story, not only
because they offend the average reader’s sense of probability but because in
effect they decide the issue in advance. When one is told that God and the
Devil are in conflict one always knows which side is going to win. The whole
drama of the struggle against evil lies in the fact that one does not have
supernatural aid. However, by the standard of the novels appearing nowadays
this is a book worth reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        <article lang="en">
          
          <p>Recent posts about the state of Xorg and its future has been stirring the
internets as of late and, as almost always, it is best to stay clear of the
comments sections. The more insightful post is <a href="https://ajaxnwnk.blogspot.com/2020/10/on-abandoning-x-server.html">On Abandoning the X Server</a>.</p>

<p>There are a few details in it that should be emphasised before we move on.</p>

<div><div><pre><blockquote>Though the code happens to implement an unfortunate
specification, the code itself is quite well structured, easy to hack on, and
not far off from being easily embeddable.</blockquote></pre></div></div>

<p>From my own experiences with Xorg internals, I agree completely. A whole lot
of the code there is noticably better than corresponding paths in certain
Wayland compositors. There is more thought; domain expertise; engineering and
pure elbow grease behind it than you might have been led to believe -- if you
have only listened in to the collective moans in various discussion groups.</p>

<div><div><pre><blockquote>So is Xorg abandoned? To the extent that means using it to actually
control the display, and not just keep X apps running, I'd say yes. But xserver
is more than xfree86. Xwayland, Xwin, Xephyr, Xvnc, Xvfb: these are projects
with real value that we should not give up. A better way to say it is that we
can finally abandon xfree86.</blockquote></pre></div></div>

<p>There are some nuances here that many will miss as it requires you to know
something about the architecture of the X server. The main thing is to not
conflate ‘xfree86’ with rest of what you think of as X, hence why the blog post
separates out XFree86-the-project from 'xfree86 the hardware driver'. It is
unfortunate that the predecessor to Xorg was also called XFree86. Naming
things is hard and all that.</p>

<p>If you look at the xorg code, recommended reading for many who can
understand the language, you will see that the device-dependent code used to
drive displays (hw/ in the source tree) has a few backends, mentioned above.
Venture into the hw/xfree86 part and you will hopefully see why Adam Jackson
and others deserve the software engineering equivalent of a Purple Heart for
their service to your desktop, possibly alongside anyone that ever had to work
on ASN.1.</p>

<p>
<i>Rightfully throw Xorg-xfree86 into the fires of Mt. Doom. If you
still need Xorg-xfree86 to be your graphics card driver, you have bigger things
to worry about, such as plain old bitrot.</i></p>

<p>Is there something else? Yes. I’m not going to say <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/">Arcan</a> – it is <i>very</i> likely that there
is only a small percentage of the stakeholders we would ever get along with.
That is fine. The goals and agenda reach much further than many will ever care
to travel -- unless you really want to push the boundaries of computing, or you
are actively targeted by nefarious individuals; our funding is not based on
popularity or mass adoption, but rather sticking to the shadows.</p>

<h2>The Compromise</h2>
<p>So what can we do instead? The current Wayland maintainer has
<a href="https://github.com/emersion/libliftoff">libliftoff</a> for smoothing
over the rather ‘unergonomic’ APIs that are used to get the open, modern,
graphics stack up and running. <em>Write a DDX backend that uses it.
hw/liftoff!</em></p>

<p>This will get liftoff the lift-off and mileage it needs to become good
enough for Wayland compositors to use as their default, and as a slightly more
polite migration path in order for NVIDIA to be less contemptible in the
unlikely event that they are one day struck by some capitalist version of
religious insight. Thus, it improves parts of the Wayland compositor situation
that is, politely put, chaotic.</p>

<p>Those that don’t care about what Wayland tries to achieve can stay with X and
not worry about their graphics breaking after a kernel update, or well, more
than usual -- Linux gotta Linux. NVIDIA blob users can continue down that path
and stop bothering Wayland developers, yet still run their Steam games without
submitting to open source ideals.</p>

<p>Next steps. This is for the window managers. Take libarcan-shmif-server and
embed as a module in Xorg, fork it off even. If you are unaware, this is the
IPC system part of Arcan. Both the server and the client sides of it are fairly
trivial to use and are written with developers, not toolkits, in mind.</p>

<p>It is beyond feature parity with the rest of X, but has a comparable view on
capabilities and division of responsibility. You will only get a fraction of
the benefits of Arcan as a display server, but without other dependencies or
friction - many of the problems that X clients are plagued with can be worked
around while leaving the X11 protocol and its family of extensions to rest.
Hacks relying on facilities like uinput can be put down.</p>

<p>The security around these clients will be much tighter and they can be
gradually tuned to the specification of the developer. It lets XFCE, AwesomeWM,
WindowMaker and the tens to hundreds of others WM projects to continue to
improve their respective ecosystems, specialized widgets and other tools,
rather than to burn resources they don't have to rewrite themselves with bugs
that won't be discovered or fixed in time to matter.</p>

<p>It also gives the conservative side of BSDs a portable way of improving
their use of the graphics stack without reworking fundamentals they care little
about. The OpenBSD fork 'Xenocara' can be dropped.</p>

<p>This way, the heritage is preserved and kept alive, with a band aid to live
out another decade or three. It will still work for the marginalized that have
little interest- or option- in going elsewhere. It will be less painful to
maintain and work with.</p>

<h2>The Reality</h2>
<p>Wayland only is not an option that will ever work across the board. It is
not a replacement, it is a fundamental change of principles. Stop trying to
market it as some kind of inevitable transition. There are strong differences
that will not get smoothed over regardless of how many 'protocols' you define;
<i>Wayland is Policy over Mechanism, X11 is Mechanism over Policy</i>. This is
the real barrier. Not unsubstantiated claims of 'security'. It is a tectonic
shift and no matter your feelings about that, we won't all be in the same
country or continent anymore.</p>

<p>Heralding a 'Screenshot Protocol' and similar exercises as the fix that will
bridge this gap will only serve to distract from the fact that the power of all
these little tools and hacks from the crowd of X11 users comes from the
'screenshot' being just one case of <i>'give me the contents of a specific
window and all of its children'</i> or <i>'composite these windows to an
offscreen buffer and send me the results'</i> as the building blocks
available to be creative with.

</p><p>The mechanism approach provides a huge set of possibilities and opens up for
experimentation and 'works for me' kind of hacks. The downside is that it
surrenders control on the server side and are much harder to make robust.</p>

<p>The policy aproach will only do what both sides agree to, and <i>that
	agreement has the final say</i>. If you violate this contract, you are to be
blamed. However, that contract has to be bikeshedded to near state-space
exhaustion and carefully screened for conflicts as more contracts are added to
the pile.</p>

<p>The current trajectory is Gnomelanders and Swaylanders and Kwinners and so
on continuing to lock down singular uses cases and with political gunplay try
to push that as the one solution that will convince a few more bread crumbs.
The hand that controls the toolkit will eventually just decide. <i> This will
erode the strength of the policy contract</i>.</p>

<p>This has already led to a substantial amount of dissonance -- it turns out
that the 'opting-server-side decoration protocol' in the mix had implications
for how to interpret the 'subsurface protocol' and the 'redshift gamma
protocol' will clash with whatever 'color management protocol' that materialize
and so on. To get a feel for how involved such policies become, just <a href="https://github.com/wayland-project/wayland-protocols/blob/3a74660e94d85fde24f504cc9d4375d42192e84a/stable/xdg-shell/xdg-shell.xml#L402">
read the specification</a> and you will see why no implementation arrives at
the same calculation.</p>

<p>Take the perspective of a client developer chasing after the tumbleweed of
'protocols' drifting around and try to answer 'what am I supposed to implement
and use'? To me it looked like like a Picasso painting of ill-fitting- and
internally conflicted ideas. Let this continue a few cycles more and X11 will
look clean and balanced by comparison. Someone should propose a desktop icon
protocol for the sake of it, then again, someone probably already has.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach will force Wayland to demonstrate its worth through the
virtues of its properties alone or by inventing actually compelling features
rather than by throwing shade on the elderly; or reimplementing the past
through rebranded and traced outlines from shadows cast by grander window
managers of yore.</p>

<p>The proposal leaves us with three well-defined paths.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wayland lets your own solipsist thiefdoms expand towards the horizon,
while trying to save embedded from the Android expanse.</li>
<li>People that have invested their hearts and souls into the X ecosystem can
continue to use their computers without fear of a kernel upgrade leaving them
with broken graphics, or a switch of display server paradigm leaving them with
an incompatible mental model of how system graphics work, and perhaps, one day,
stop whining about Wayland ruining their day and leave the devs alone.</li>
<li>Arcan lets you play with crazy ideas at a low initial cost. The ones
that might revolutionise your world or fail miserably. It will continue to
pushing things towards whatever is beyond the Twilight Zone in order to answer
profound questions such as 'what happens to productivity if your heartbeat
aligns with the blink rate of the cursor' (well that's actually be done since
forever and the RESULTS WOULD SHOCK YOU! - but it still illustrates the
point).</li>
</ul>

<p>It might even turn out so well that one of these paths will have a
fighting chance against the open desktop being further marginalised as a thin
client in the Azure clouded future; nothing more than a silhouette behind
unwashed Windows, a virtualized ghost of its former self.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Playing cards have been around for much longer than any of us think. Even though the cards we use today are relatively recent, the earliest records of playing cards date back to the Tan dynasty around the 9th century AD. Even though card games were called leaf games back in 868AD when princess Tongchang played with them, the concept remains the same.</p>
<p>Playing card design has been used as a means of political expressions over the centuries, and represent a glimpse into political feelings of the time. Weâ€™ve compiled some of the most interesting political decks below. </p>
<h3 id="1973politicalplayingcards">1973 Political Playing Cards</h3>
<p>Released by Fournier in 1973, the deck contains humorist drawings of politicians and other kinds of leaders from the 20th century, including religious leaders, despots, dictators, presidents, and more.
<img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/spain.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="antifascistpropaganda">Anti-Fascist Propaganda</h3>
<p>An anti-fascist card deck from 1943, designed and printed by order of Stalin with a goal of making fun of the German empire from that era.
<img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/antifacist.png"></p>
<h3 id="antinapoleon">Anti-Napoleon</h3>
<p>Most likely German-made around 1815, this deck of cards was designed and printed to portray the liberation war between Napoleon and the opposing forces.
<img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/napoleon.png"></p>
<h3 id="backtotheussr">Back to the USSR</h3>
<p>Designed and printed mainly for the Russian market back in 1995, the cards portray the most popular leaders and politicians from USSR history.</p>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/ussr.png"></p>
<h3 id="bicyclecivilwardeck">Bicycle Civil War Deck</h3>
<p>Aimed at showing important historical characters from the American civil war era, these playing cards are relatively new and came into production in 2017. <a href="https://www.wopc.co.uk/usa/uspcc/bicycle-civil-war" rel="â€�nofollowâ€�">Check it out.</a></p>
<h3 id="cartesimperialesetroyales">Cartes Imperiales et Royales</h3>
<p>Going back to the mid-19th century, we have cards that show consorts and imperial rulers from England, Austria, France, and Russia.</p>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/royals.png"></p>
<h3 id="churchillinww2">Churchill in WW2</h3>
<p>An entire deck dedicated to Winston Churchill in World War 2 shows him in multiple positions as an officer, politician, writer, and salesman.</p>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/church.png"></p>
<h3 id="dutchroyalfamily1879">Dutch Royal Family 1879</h3>
<p>A deck of cards dedicated to King William III's second marriage to Princess Emma of Waldeck-Pyrmont, where most of the cards consist of Dutch Royalty and soldiers.</p>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/dutch.png"></p>
<h3 id="imperialroyalpack">Imperial Royal Pack</h3>
<p>Published in London in 1828, the Imperial Royal Pack contains portraits of important people from the Spanish, Turkish, French, and English empires.</p>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/imperial.png"></p>
<h3 id="frenchrevolution">French Revolution</h3>
<p>A French Revolution deck printed in 1793 on woodblocks with stencils coloring showing the plain old people of France, including farmers and philosophers.</p>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/french.png"></p>
<h3 id="satireofolivercromwellsgovernmentfrom1679">Satire of Oliver Cromwellâ€™s Government from 1679</h3>
<p>Quite older than most here, this desk was engraved and was intended to mock the government of Oliver Cromwell during the Rump Parliament era.</p>

October 30, 2020 | https://thistooshallgrow.com/blog/6-ways-mindful-ux-daily-life | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thistooshallgrow.com/blog/6-ways-mindful-ux-daily-life">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-a7abb749998f8defa959"><div><p>Mindful UX protects users' mental health, privacy, and mental state. It's inclusive and accessible. It aims to prevent harm and to help recover from it.</p><h2>Managing the level of interruptions</h2><p>A product has various ways to communicate information. Visual and auditive senses are the most commonly used. Digital items sometimes use touch, for instance with haptic feedback. Some notifications require your attention immediately, for instance if your cooking timer goes off and you don't want to burn your shakshuka. Some are neither urgent nor important. Yes, airline company newsletter, I'm looking at you, especially at the moment. Finally, some don't have any fixed level of urgency or importance: you will adapt them to your contextual needs. My phone is always in silent mode, but I'll activate the ringtone if I'm expecting an important call.</p><p>We can admire Slack's fantastic workflow for notifications. (<a href="https://slack.engineering/reducing-slacks-memory-footprint/" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604080575308_6648"><div><p>In real life, how do you decide on the way you're communicating news with someone? It can depend on:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Your interlocutor (professional relation, family, long lost friend)</p></li><li><p>The number of interlocutors</p></li><li><p>The nature of the news (sensitive or not)</p></li><li><p>The urgency</p></li><li><p>The importance: paying your taxes might not be urgent if the deadline is 2 months from now, but it is important as you certainly don't want to miss it</p></li></ul><p>Based on all of that, are you going to call, email, text, video call, send a Twitter DM, leave a post-it note? Are you going to send reminders?</p><h2>Limiting distractions, protecting your attention</h2><p>We all know about this, you don't need me to spell it out: everyone is competing for our attention. You might have already taken measures to limit distractions: your phone might be in silent mode, you might even disable some notifications, block ads, disable autoplay, etc. Android and iOS even carry <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17426922/apple-digital-health-vs-google-wellbeing-time-well-spent-wwdc-2018" target="_blank">native features to help us protect our attention</a>.</p><p>Apart from the digital measures I've just mentioned, there's another way you can mitigate distractions. If you share your physical work space with others - like I am doing in our current lockdown - you can signal when you're available to be interrupted and when you're not. Leave a sign on your door, place an object on your desk, etc.</p><p>There are even different levels for that:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Available</p></li><li><p>Only disturb if urgent</p></li><li><p>Do not disturb under any circumstances</p></li></ul><h2>Paying attention to accessibility</h2><p>An accessible product is a product that's usable by everyone. The quintessence of inaccessible design are Terms &amp; Conditions. Never-ending walls of text with little to no page layout, all written in legalese. For those of you who don't know, "legalese" represents legal lingo that's completely closed off to the uninitiated.</p><p>An easy way to be more mindful of accessibility in your daily life, is to adapt your communication. If you want to use jargon with people who might not be familiar with it, explain what it means - just like I did above with "legalese". In a group discussion, give background and context so that everyone has the same level of information and everyone can follow. When writing up a document, highlight the key information to make it easily scannable.</p><h2>Removing visual clutter</h2><p>We are well aware that visual overstimulation is detrimental for us. I even asked people on Twitter about it, and the results are telling.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604080575308_11640"><div><p>Whether it's in your room or at your desk, trimming down the visual clutter allows by contrast to shine more light on what's important, on the few things that you decide to leave in sight. Not only does that make it easier for you to find something you're looking for, but it's also nicer and less stressful on the eyes, because you have less visual stimuli.</p><p>The same applies to your digital places. Leaving white space and room to breathe is beneficial and so much more relaxing. Here's what my phone and laptop screens look like: much better than having files and apps filling up the space.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604080575308_30876"><div><h2>Avoiding cognitive overload</h2><p>Cognitive load refers to the mental effort we have to make to use a product, achieve a task, etc. We've all known someone who had the bad habit of starting Matryoshka sentences - or Russian dolls sentences if you prefer. "<em>I had a call with Tamara, because we have a group chat with Marie, and by the way did you know Marie and Tamara had never met? Because last time we met with Awa and had delicious ice cream, I can give you the address, and it was such a sunny day</em>" and this sentence alone tackled 6 different topics. Yes, some people talk like that, and it exhausts me because I can't follow.</p><p>Some strategies to make it easier:</p><h3>Chunking</h3><p>Do you write phone numbers as 0123456789 or 01.23.45.67.89? Splitting your content in smaller chunks makes it easier to both <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/" target="_blank">scan</a> and <a href="https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/151291/1/Thalmann.et.al.Chunking.final.pdf" target="_blank">memorise</a>.</p><h3>Reducing the number of options</h3><p>You don't have to go all the way and reduce your wardrobe to 15 items, but... I suppose that's the spirit? In UX, this is known as <a href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law" target="_blank">Hick's law</a>. Choosing what to have between 10 options will take longer than between 3 options. That won't stop me from having 10 different teas at home though. 😌 This isn't something to apply religiously, just to be aware of and to use whenever relevant.</p><h3><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/" target="_blank">Recognition rather than recall</a></h3><p>Yet another interesting UX principle for your daily life. Recognition leaves cues (e.g. "<em>Are mint &amp; lime in a mojito?</em>”), whereas recall doesn't ("<em>What are the main ingredients in a mojito?</em>"). The end goal of these questions is the same, but the former is easier to answer: you just have to recognise whether the information given to you is accurate.</p><p>You can then make your environment work for you. I leave my keys in the lock, so that I'm naturally prompted to take them with me as I go out, I don't need to remember it. If I want to wear something specific the next day, I'll take it out of the wardrobe and leave it in plain sight. If I need to eat something soon, as it expires the next day, I'll place it on the kitchen counter.</p><h2>Choosing between streaks or flexible goals</h2><p>Several products use streaks to entice you into practicing something daily. Headspace does it for meditation, Github does it with your code commits. Streaks can be useful, but they shouldn't be a default goal for any habit you want to learn. Aiming to be flexible, and to complete a task 3 or 5 times per week, is much more realistic than sticking to it everyday, especially if you're just getting started. Streaks create pressure to perform everyday, while more manageable goals leave room for contigencies.</p><p>Additionally, since you're more likely to complete <a href="https://nesslabs.com/flexible-consistency" target="_blank">flexible goals</a>, you can observe your own progress, which encourages you to keep going. Finally, it's important to differenciate whether your completion of a task comes from pressure or from desire. Daily streaks are more likely to be completed from internal coercion, and malleable goals from desire, because if you don't feel like doing it on Monday, it's no big deal. Listen to yourself, listen to what you feel like doing in the moment, and adapt.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why use Scala? We listed the advantages of Scala we see in our startup. See whether the benefits of Scala could help you too.</p><p>1. Focus on what matters: Expressiveness + High order functions</p><p>2. Get less bugs: Statically typed + Clean error management by design</p><p>3. Benefit from JVM ecosystem: Performant libraries + Good tooling environment</p><p>4. Attract talents</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Scala is a JVM based language. It’s flexible, you can write code in both imperative or functional styles. Scala is a pragmatic language that mixes the best of functional and object-oriented programming. It basically means that you can create classes to encapsulate state and methods but you can’t mutate them.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>The main power of Scala is to let the developers focus on what’s most important.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Expressiveness</strong></h2><p>Running on the JVM, Scala is as powerful as Java but it is way clearer and more concise. It makes the code easier (and faster) to write and read!</p><p>For example, look at how we create a list of string in Java vs Scala:</p><h4><strong>Java:</strong></h4><figure id="w-node-069225ecd5f7-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df66d44ec7c4592663ddc_20201019%20Scala%20Article_1.png" loading="lazy" alt="how we create a list of string in Java"></p></figure><h4><strong>Scala:</strong></h4><figure id="w-node-713e2fe2bca1-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df6bca2fdb8e00bb006a6_20201019%20Scala%20Article_2.png" loading="lazy" alt="how we create a list of string in Scala"></p></figure><h2><strong>High order function</strong></h2><p>High order functions are functions that abstract some control structure like a loop to update every element of an array.</p><p>They’re the functions we use most in Scala. They work by taking a function as a parameter. Used with anonymous functions, they’re perfect to focus on implementing the business logic instead of juggling with indexes to increment and stop conditions.</p><p>Look at how we can convert this list of string into a list of integers:</p><figure id="w-node-b9f12ec503cb-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df77fa26c394e0b5e18b1_20201019%20Scala%20Article_3.png" loading="lazy" alt="how to convert a list of string into a list of ints in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>We can also compute the sum of it by using the high-order function fold:</p><figure id="w-node-dc33ae72b25f-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df7b68e690322a1f2341e_20201019%20Scala%20Article_4.png" loading="lazy" alt="How to compute the sum by using the high-order function fold in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Statically typed</strong></h2><p>By checking the type during the compilation, Scala type system reduces considerably the amount of bugs caused by type errors.</p><p>Type inference allows typing without being too verbose:</p><p>def square(x: Int) = x * x&nbsp;</p><p>Here the type of square (Int) is inferred from the * operator which multiplies an Int by an Int giving an Int in output.</p><p>And thanks to pattern matching, we can still write flexible code:</p><figure id="w-node-5d4c922f320c-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df82d19cead6575ed2edd_20201019%20Scala%20Article_5.png" loading="lazy" alt="How to decompose an object to pattern match on its attributes, add pattern guards, pattern match a regex or the elements of a List in Scala"></p></figure><p>Here we can even decompose an object to pattern match on its attributes. We can even add pattern guards (if condition in a case), pattern match a regex or the elements of a List.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Clean error management by design</strong></h2><h3><strong>Option and Either</strong></h3><p>There are some useful standard types in Scala to manage errors. The most commonly used are Option and Either. An Option can either be a class Some containing a value or a None object. So we can associate a valid result to Some and an error to None. Let's write a function to safely update a String to Int.</p><figure id="w-node-60c03b54f3c2-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df92687207e98effd9699_20201019%20Scala%20Article_6.png" loading="lazy" alt="How to to safely update a String to Int in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>And if we need an error message we can use the Either class that will return a Right containing the value or a Left with an error type.</p><figure id="w-node-b021a222808e-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8dfb98068c68637d53699d_20201019%20Scala%20Article_7.png" loading="lazy" alt="If we need an error message we can use the Either class that will return a Right containing the value or a Left with an error type in Scala"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Try is also a great type to manage error, especially to encapsulate every call to Java functions that can throw errors.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Combine them with for-comprehension</strong></h3><p>Option, Either or Try allow us to return a result or an error and not throw it to whatever will catch it. And thanks to a special Scala control structure, the “for-comprehension”, we can easily combine them to return the first error encountered.</p><figure id="w-node-c336c52f22b2-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8df9f519cead4e10ed589d_20201019%20Scala%20Article_8.png" loading="lazy" alt="The Scala control structure “for-comprehension” allows to easily combine Option, Either and Try to return the first error encountered."></p></figure><p>dividend on the left part of dividend &lt;- convertStringToInt(dividendStr) is the value in the Right of the convertStringToInt(dividendStr) result. If convertStringToInt(dividendStr) returns an error, it will stop immediately and return that error in a Left for safeStringDivision.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Perfect to handle asynchronous code</strong></h3><p>“for-comprehension” are also amazing to work with asynchronous code like HTTP calls encapsulated in a Future. We can combine them and return an error for the first error we encounter.</p><figure id="w-node-6dcad4d139cc-d0a68507"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5de53075747d4101db8251cb/5f8dfab1a0c47639e33ad40f_20201019%20Scala%20Article_9.png" loading="lazy" alt="In Scala, for-comprehension are also amazing to work with asynchronous code like HTTP calls encapsulate in a Future."></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>We can even combine Future with other error types like Either by using functional libraries like <a href="https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/eithert.html" target="_blank">cats</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>JVM allows to use powerful java libraries</strong></h2><p>For example we use db connectors, libraries to manage timestamps, logging &amp; monitoring clients and more!</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Good tooling environment</strong></h2><p>There is a great IDE with Intellij Idea.

Over the next decade and beyond, we see this market evolving and enabling the emergence of multiple billion dollar startups that build upon Adobe’s foundation. These include several companies already well on their way such as Canva, Figma, and others. </p><p>In this article, we: i) introduce a framework for evaluating Adobe as a platform company; ii) analyze Adobe’s history and the factors that enabled its rise, iii) describe the technology &amp; behavioral waves catalyzing innovation, and iv) suggest areas of opportunity for emerging startups. More specifically, we highlight video workflows, analytics capabilities, and document alternatives as 3 key areas of opportunity, and also link a growing <a href="https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invL8RfK15a1yqHG1&amp;inviteToken=752ceb35a51bae83e02f6f454798d979e147d6f162b3bb3ad10ca0bc0b95a15c">repository</a> of startups in various creative software categories. Please feel free to read the entire article, or skip to the section(s) that are most interesting to you.</p><hr><h2>I. Introduction</h2><hr><p>Over the past few years, much attention has been paid to the “unbundling” of companies including eBay, Craigslist, and Linkedin. The basis of the unbundling concept is that while the aggregation of multiple products and services initially results in network effects and scale economies in the first wave of a technology market, it also limits personalization, customization, and quality of experience. This creates an opportunity for new startups to displace the incumbent by providing more customized solutions as the market matures.</p><p>While the unbundling approach has worked well for startups attacking certain incumbents, it has limitations as a framework. This is particularly true for platform companies upon which new startups rely on in order to successfully build and distribute products. In these markets, innovation takes a more layered approach, with newer companies building upon a foundation laid by an incumbent. Rather than unbundling, we call this <em>an evolution</em> of a platform, and we believe that this is the best framework for evaluating Adobe, its innovation track record, and the startups innovating in this market today. </p><p>In comparison to better-known software giants in Silicon Valley, Adobe has flourished relatively quietly for much of its 38-year history. What began as a small publishing software company has now expanded into a conglomerate providing an extensive suite of products across its Creative, Document, and Experience Clouds. Today, Adobe employs over 22,000 employees and generates over $11 billion in revenue annually, with a market capitalization of ~$245 billion. <a href="">1</a></p><p>Along the way, it has made numerous transformative acquisitions, including Macromedia ($3.4 billion), Omniture ($1.8 billion), and Marketo ($4.8 billion). Its acquisition of Behance ($150 million) also enabled it to build the leading online platform to showcase and discover creative work. It has also successfully expanded into new pockets of creative software, which eventually yielded large business lines. Adobe’s ability to consistently innovate through organic and inorganic growth, while successfully transitioning leadership between different CEOs over multiple decades, is one of the tech industry’s great overlooked stories. The company’s Creative Cloud launch and move to a subscription-based pricing model at the end of 2013 precipitated a quadrupling of its market cap since that time. <a href="">2</a></p><p><img alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 12.09.42 PM" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/clfay1lxzjey/7nSKcMyD30evkeX4plmIQa/b0fb3bc9358b4724e76df9b2ae2b20bc/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_12.09.42_PM.png"></p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>Adobe’s Stock Price Has Skyrocketed over the Past Two Decades</em></strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>As we explain below, we believe Adobe is entering a new phase, where new startups are building upon its platform and legacy. The growth of this new generation of startups is driven by technological and behavioral inflections. Rather than replace Adobe’s products, these startups are innovating  upon Adobe’s foundation to build a new generation of creative software. </p><hr><h2>II. The Growth of Adobe and its Significance</h2><hr><p>Adobe was founded by Chuck Geschke and John Warnock (above) to enable more accessible publishing and printing software.Throughout its first decade, Adobe aggressively targeted designers and creative professionals, creating new categories of software across graphics, photo, video, and publishing. Along with Apple, Adobe helped bring about the desktop publishing revolution, launching products such as Illustrator, Photoshop, and Acrobat. Over the past two decades, Adobe then made several transformative acquisitions, enabling it to expand into web-based products (Macromedia), enterprise analytics (Omniture), e-commerce software (Magento), and marketing automation software (Marketo). </p><p>We believe that Adobe’s success has been driven largely by the following three characteristics:</p><p>1) <strong>Successful Partnerships:</strong> From the very beginning, Adobe has secured successful partnerships through a thoughtful and strategic approach to choosing the right partners. Adobe’s first product, PostScript, was a page description language, which allowed users to print to external printers. Adobe understood that the proliferation of its software was dependent on high-quality hardware, and it strategically chose to partner with the best hardware company for creative users, Apple. In 1985, Apple debuted the LaserWriter printer with Postscript, and it was the first printer to use the language. Combined with a third partnership with Aldus Software, the trio established the desktop publishing revolution, and elevated Adobe’s positioning within the corporate ecosystem. Taking this further, Adobe capitalized on this position and cultivated deep partnerships with other large technology companies, such as IBM and Microsoft, ensuring it is deeply entrenched as the defacto creative software suite. </p><p>2) <strong>Ability to Bundle Products:</strong> Adobe has consistently been able to bundle its products into an integrated suite, while ensuring that value was strong enough for customers to pay a premium price for the bundle. In its early years, Adobe quickly amassed a wide variety of capabilities and was able to bundle new offerings with existing products to accelerate adoption. The company understood that the customer of that time wasn’t seeking point solutions, and instead wanted an integrated software solution that could solve multiple needs. Adobe has built on this strategy over time, culminating in the launch of its full product suite in 2003. What has been most unique about Adobe’s bundling approach is its ability to charge premium prices for the full subscription offering. For example, Adobe’s Creative Cloud offering is currently $80 per month for the base business license, or almost $1k per year. Adobe has an estimated 15 million paying subscribers today, evidencing the power of its integrated suite and the fact that Adobe is the standard. The network effects of Adobe’s products also enhance its lock-in. </p><p>3) <strong>Successful Acquisitions:</strong> Throughout its tenure, Adobe strategically selected acquisitions to enter into new markets, often choosing to buy versus build, and then subsequently successfully integrated those acquisitions. Adobe’s acquisition strategy is differentiated due to the fact that the company is not afraid to make large, bold bets, at same time dedicating the time and resources over a long period to ensure that these bets pay off. For example, Adobe’s $1.8 billion acquisition of Omniture in 2009 was seemingly off strategy and non-complementary. Why was a creative/design software company making such a large bet to acquire the leading player in enterprise analytics? Adobe understood that the future of marketing was uniting content creation with marketing analytics. Disciplines that were historically the purview of different enterprise departments would merge, and the rise of web/mobile analytics would enable a much tighter feedback loop within content creation and design. More than ten years later, the deal is seen as a brilliant strategic move that enabled Adobe to build its Experience Cloud.</p><p><img alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 12.14.59 PM" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/clfay1lxzjey/4E8RcynEAKHogL4YZDJccI/ebebfd21f11b47ddbe794c2778afa757/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_12.14.59_PM.png"></p><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><em>Adobe Has Made Several Successful Acquisitions over the Past Two Decades</em></strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>4) <strong>Transition to Cloud-based Company:</strong> In 2012, Adobe released Creative Cloud and fundamentally changed the way its products were offered, updated, and priced. While risky at the time, it enabled Adobe to transform the types of users they targeted and more importantly, stay relevant as more cloud-based competitors emerged. Growth in subscriptions for the Creative Cloud over the two years following launch can be seen below.</p><p><img alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-14 at 12.17.42 PM" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/clfay1lxzjey/16qjRVLN4x3x0fpmLeZHeB/18dbd03bacb9f8e0bbdfd8937dbbbd01/updated_chart.jpg"></p><p>How did Adobe accomplish its transition to becoming a cloud company, and why did they succeed where many large companies have stumbled? They succeeded through a series of strategic moves led by CEO Shantanu Narayen. These included the acquisition of Omniture, which enabled Adobe to immediately become the leader in enterprise cloud analytics. It also included the $150m acquisition of Behance, which provided the company with a large community of designers who desired to showcase creative work. By 2018, Behance had over 10 million users, 10x the number when it was acquired by Adobe.</p><p>Adobe was also willing to absorb the financial impact of switching from a one-time license of ~$1800 to a per-month subscription of $50 for its Creative Cloud software, which results in an initial revenue shortfall. Adobe did this over five years, first introducing Creative Cloud in April 2012, and not retiring its license option until January 2017.</p><p>Finally, Adobe displayed pragmatism in listening to the market where its products were not well-received. By far the most notable example was Adobe Flash. In 2010, Steve Jobs posted his letter “Thoughts on Flash,” which criticized Flash and stated why Flash would not be allowed on iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. While Adobe’s CEO Narayen initially fired back at Jobs, Adobe eventually decided to discontinue Flash and focus resources on HTML5. Through this move, Adobe displayed pragmatism, realizing that there was more money in building and acquiring SaaS apps than supporting media software on hardware …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post dives deep into a scary data loss scenario - we'll cover identifying the data loss, investigating the root cause, and finally recovering the data.</p>
<p><strong>This bug affected Readwise users who exported their highlights (both manually &amp; automatically) to Roam on 10/27. If you are one of those users, you should contact Roam support &amp; use <a href="https://github.com/jchen1/roam-restore" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">my recovery code</a> ASAP!</strong></p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Roam</a> is a "note-taking tool for networked thought". It supports all sorts of cool things - what's relevant here is that it automatically creates a new page for every day, your Daily Notes. Recently, I started using <a href="https://readwise.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Readwise</a>, which ingests Kindle highlights and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">spaced repetition</a> to help you remember what you read. Readwise has a Roam integration, which automatically adds Kindle highlights to Roam. Unfortunately, since Roam doesn't have a public API yet, Readwise's integration seems to be effectively using Selenium - clicking on elements and pasting highlights which is inherently flaky.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I woke up without my Daily Notes from the day before. Disaster! Fortunately, with the help of the Roam Slack group and Tristan from Readwise, I was able to isolate the cause of note deletion and even restore my lost data. Here's what happened:</p>
<h2>Roam architecture</h2>
<p>Roam uses <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Datascript</a> for its client-side database. Like Datomic, Datascript stores data as a <code>datom</code>, defined as <code>[e a v tx]</code>, or <code>entity</code>, <code>attribute</code>, <code>value</code>, and <code>transaction-id</code> (incrementing integer). If you're interested in learning more, <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/datascript-internals/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Datascript's author has an excellent overview</a>.</p>
<p>Importantly for us, Roam differs from other webapps in that it doesn't store all state and history in its backend. Instead, Roam's backend just stores a snapshotted Datascript database (updated ~daily as far as I can tell) and the list of transactions since that last snapshot. If we can download those two things before Roam's next snapshot, we have two breadcrumbs towards recovery: 1. We can find the transaction that deleted my Daily Notes page 2. We can also reconstruct our Datascript database, replaying transactions up until the point of deletion, and recover our Daily Notes from that!</p>
<h2>Capturing state</h2>
<p>Our first step is to store Roam's database snapshot and transaction list. Instead of REST API calls, Roam uses a Websocket connection to send these to its web client. This complicates things for us: instead of just saving API responses with <code>curl</code>, we need to download a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_%28file_format%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">HAR file</a>, which, fortunately for us, includes Websocket traffic with more recent Chrome versions. HAR files are just JSON archives stored in chronological order - it's easy to select just the Websocket traffic:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>defn</span></span> parse-har
  [harfile]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [json (<span>json/parse-string</span> (<span><span>slurp</span></span> harfile) <span>true</span>)
        ws-messages (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> json <span>:log</span> <span>:entries</span> (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>some?</span> (<span>:_webSocketMessages</span> %))) second <span>:_webSocketMessages</span>)
        ws-data (<span><span>map</span></span> <span>:data</span> ws-messages)]
    ws-data))</code></pre>
<p>Inspecting this data more closely, it appears that Roam's websocket messages are generally JSON strings (and occasionally numbers). When a message is more than 16KB, it's split into multiple messages without wrapping - so we'll need to stitch these bigger messages together. One way to detect a non-split-message is to just try and parse it as JSON - if it's valid, we can say it's non-split. (There's an edge case we're unlikely to hit here: if the 16KB chunk just so happens to be valid JSON as well we'll be out of luck. Lucky for us, I didn't run into this!) Now, we can extend <code>parse-har</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>defn</span></span> parse-har
  [harfile]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [json (<span>json/parse-string</span> (<span><span>slurp</span></span> harfile) <span>true</span>)
        ws-messages (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> json <span>:log</span> <span>:entries</span> (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>some?</span> (<span>:_webSocketMessages</span> %))) second <span>:_webSocketMessages</span>)
        ws-data (<span><span>map</span></span> <span>:data</span> ws-messages)
        try-parse #(<span><span>try</span></span> (<span>json/parse-string</span> % <span>true</span>)
                        (<span>catch</span> Throwable _ <span>nil</span>))
        
        
        
        ws-json (<span><span>reduce</span></span> (<span><span>fn</span></span> [{<span>:keys</span> [done partial]} next]
                          (<span><span>let</span></span> [potential-json-str (<span><span>str</span></span> partial next)]
                            (<span><span>if-let</span></span> [json (<span>try-parse</span> potential-json-str)]
                              {<span>:done</span> (<span><span>conj</span></span> done json)
                               <span>:partial</span> <span>""</span>}
                              {<span>:done</span> done
                               <span>:partial</span> potential-json-str})))
                        {<span>:done</span> [] <span>:partial</span> <span>""</span>}
                        ws-data)]
    (<span><span>assert</span></span> (<span><span>=</span></span> (<span>:partial</span> ws-json) <span>""</span>))
    (<span>:done</span> ws-json)))</code></pre>
<h2>Finding the culprit</h2>
<p>Armed with our parsed websocket messages, we can see that many of them look like transactions. One that looks particularly suspicious has a nested field named <code>tx-meta</code> with the value <code>delete-page</code>! The transaction looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{<span>:app-version</span> <span>"0.7.4"</span>,
 <span>:email</span> <span>"hello@jeff.yt"</span>,
 <span>:session-id</span> <span>"uuid95d98efd-c8fa-4412-87a4-e7b7201bee24"</span>,
 <span>:t</span> <span>1603947791561</span>,
 <span>:time</span> <span>1603947791542</span>,
 <span>:tx</span> <span>"[[\"^ \",\"~:block/uid\",\"ogCRjInhE\",\"~:block/string\",\"some-text-here\",\"~:edit/time\",1603947791363,\"~:edit/email\",\"hello@jeff.yt\"],[\"^ \",\"^0\",\"4CpSytRnt\",\"^1\",\"Highlights first synced by #Readwise October 28th, 2020\",\"^2\",1603947791364,\"^3\",\"hello@jeff.yt\"],[\"^ \",\"^0\",\"C-IOsE50G\",\"^1\",\"New highlights added October 28th, 2020 at 11:03 PM\",\"^2\",1603947791364,\"^3\",\"hello@jeff.yt\"],[\"~:db.fn/retractEntity\",[\"^0\",\"hLBqaz4gS\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"vwD08rqdT\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"6VWOGgeAd\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"P56-fWN2O\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"SffV3NfN2\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"qnZBZCGCv\"]],[\"^4\",[\"^0\",\"10-28-2020\"]]]"</span>,
 <span>:tx-meta</span> {<span>:event-id</span> <span>"uuid719b009f-b969-47b6-b2db-41542d10b328"</span>,
           <span>:event-name</span> <span>"delete-page"</span>,
           <span>:tx-id</span> <span>"uuid289e80fc-4c27-4d54-9df4-d83ac0ceeaed"</span>,
           <span>:tx-name</span> <span>"delete-page"</span>}}</code></pre>
<p>I omitted ~90% of the transaction to save space - but it's more of the same. This definitely looks like the transaction that deleted my Daily Notes page: I see <code>db.fn/retractEntity</code> as well as <code>10-28-2020</code> in the transaction. Interestingly, this transaction captures two Readwise interactions as well. It's not a smoking gun, but it's definitely suspicious that Readwise was operating on my database at the <strong>exact same time</strong> that my page was mysteriously deleted!</p>
<p>Let's pause here, and check in with the Roam Slack group. Someone else has already started a thread about data loss! They and others quickly confirm that they also all have Readwise's auto-export enabled. Again, it's not confirmation that Readwise is to blame, but it's enough for me to stop what I'm doing and disable my Readwise integration! We'll also share our knowledge in the Slack thread and ask affected users to save their Roam HAR file like we did.</p>
<p>Later, <a href="https://twitter.com/homsiT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tristan, founder of Readwise</a>, pops into Slack and quickly confirms that <a href="https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1321856588022513665" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a recent Roam behavior change combined with the Readwise integration can cause deleted pages</a>. Huge props to Tristan who responds perfectly: he triages the issue, disables the feature to prevent any more users from hitting it, and fixes &amp; re-enables auto-export all within a couple hours! Tristan also remains communicative and takes full responsibility, even offering refunds, though I'd argue that these hiccups are bound to happen when Roam still hasn't opened up their public API.</p>
<h2>Deserializing the database</h2>
<p>Peeking again at our parsed HAR file, we see what appears to be our serialized database - it's stored like this:</p>
<pre><code>{<span>:split-db</span> {<span>0</span> <span>"transit-encoded-str-0"</span>
            <span>1</span> <span>"transit-encoded-str-1"</span>
            ...}}</code></pre>
<p>Each string looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^H\\\",\\\"zeciaTJfg\\\",536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^17\\\",\\\"hello@jeff.yt\\\",536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^18\\\",1583270770601,536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^R\\\",\\\"hello@jeff.yt\\\",536877373]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1641,\\\"^S\\\",1583270784121,536877377]],[\\\"^P\\\",[1642,\\\"^E\\\",1643,536877384]]
</code></pre>
<p>This looks like Transit! <a href="https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Transit</a> is a JSON-like format for sending data between applications (<a href="https://blog.klipse.tech/clojure/2016/09/22/transit-clojure.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this post</a> is a good introduction). Datascript has its own <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/datascript-transit/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">set of Transit handlers</a> - let's import that and see if we get a working database! Of course, we'll also need to combine <code>split-db</code> by smashing the Transit-encoded strings together.</p>
<pre><code>(<span>require</span> '[datascript.transit <span>:as</span> dt])

(<span><span>defn</span></span> parse-db
  [parsed-har]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [db-str (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> parsed-har
                    
                    (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>some-&gt;</span> % <span>:d</span> <span>:b</span> <span>:d</span> <span>:split-db</span>))
                    first <span>:d</span> <span>:b</span> <span>:d</span> <span>:split-db</span>
                    vals
                    (<span>string/join</span> <span>""</span>))]
    (<span>dt/read-transit-str</span> db-str)))</code></pre>
<p>Voila - a real Datascript database! We can confirm it's my Roam database by querying it:</p>
<pre><code>(<span>require</span> '[datascript.core <span>:as</span> d])
(<span><span>let</span></span> [db (<span><span>-&gt;</span></span> harfile (<span>parse-har</span>) (<span>parse-db</span>))
      conn (<span>d/conn-from-db</span> db)]
  (<span>d/q</span> '[<span>:find</span> ?e <span>:where</span> [?e <span>:node/title</span> <span>"Daily Template"</span>]] @conn))

</code></pre>
<p>With a working Roam database, our next step is to apply all of the transactions we have up until the deletion event. Transactions are Transit-encoded, and we'll have to do quite a bit of data manipulation to get a list of them. Once we have that list, we can sort the transactions and apply them sequentially:</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>defn</span></span> apply-transactions-until
  [db parsed-har until-time]
  (<span><span>let</span></span> [transactions-to-apply (<span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span></span> parsed-har
                                   (<span><span>map</span></span> #(<span>some-&gt;</span> % <span>:d</span> <span>:b</span> <span>:d</span>))
                                   (<span><span>filter</span></span> seqable?)
                                   (<span><span>apply</span></span> concat)
                                   (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span>string/starts-with?</span> (<span><span>-&gt;</span></span> % first name) <span>"-MK"</span>))
                                   (<span><span>map</span></span> second)
                                   (<span><span>filter</span></span> #(<span><span>&lt;</span></span> (<span>:time</span> %) until-time))
                                   (<span><span>sort-by</span></span> <span>:time</span>)
                                   (<span><span>map</span></span> <span>:tx</span>)
                                   (<span><span>map</span></span> dt/read-transit-str))
        conn (<span>d/conn-from-db</span> db)]
    (<span><span>doseq</span></span> [tx transactions-to-apply]
      (<span>d/transact!</span> conn tx))
    (<span>d/db</span> conn)))</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>until-time</code> is the time of the deletion transaction. We're so close now! We've managed to materialize my Roam database from <strong>right before my notes were deleted</strong>! All we need to do now is pull that deleted page, and we'll be done!</p>

<p>There’s a story about an art teacher that split their class in half. They told one half of the students that they’d be graded based on a single piece of work, and the other half that they would be graded on the quantity of work produced.</p>

<p>The half that was being graded on quantity ended up producing higher quality pieces.</p>

<p>By iterating and learning from their mistakes they actually ended up producing better work than the students that only had to produce one piece.</p>

<p>Quantity leads to quality.</p>



<p>Sharing work helps you to think and develop. The feedback you get feeds into the next iteration.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed creating something then there’s a good chance that at least a handful of people in the world will enjoy seeing it or hearing about it.</p>

<p>Promoting yourself and your work can be a good way to clarify your thinking and future direction.</p>

<h2 id="get-better-by-creating-more">Get better by creating more</h2>

<p>Produce lots of stuff and share it.</p>

<p>Being prolific doesn’t mean that everything you produce has to be absolute gold. But the process of producing large quantities of work ultimately leads to a higher quality of work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Bill Walsh is one of the greatest coaches in the history of the NFL. He
started with a 49ers team that only won two games and within two years they
had won their first Super Bowl. He retired after 10 years but before he was
done they would win two more. A decade later more than half of the head
coaches in the NFL had once served on his staff.</p>
<p>Just before he passed away he wrote a book on leadership entitled “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Score-Takes-Care-Itself-Philosophy/dp/1591843472/">The Score
Takes Care of
Itself</a>.”
His idea was simple enough: you don’t win football games by trying to score.
You don’t build championship teams by trying to win.  Instead he set a high
standard of performance and held people to it on the execution of every play.
He believed there were good losses and bad wins. He believed that if you had
good people, a good culture, and strong guiding principles then the score
would take care of itself.</p>
<p>If you go back to 2012 there are some analogies one could draw between the
49ers of that era and the performance of Facebook ads. I don’t know if we even
had two wins before 2012. But after? Well, they don’t give out Lombardi
trophies for digital advertising but I think if they did we’d be a contender.</p>
<p>The far more interesting connection between these stories is the approach. We
didn’t establish ourselves as a leading digital advertising platform by
focusing on the obvious metric of revenue. We realized that when it came to
revenue there were good losses and bad wins. We explicitly focused on
advertiser value and consumer value even when it came at the cost of revenue.
This wasn’t just cultural; our ranking systems and auction focus on optimizing
advertiser value and consumer experience rather than revenue to Facebook. By
focusing on our people, on our culture, and on strong guiding principles we
have been able to demonstrate that the revenue takes care of itself.</p>
<p>Focusing on metrics has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">well established
problems</a>, but in the case of
revenue there are two even more pathological ones.</p>
<p>Revenue is a trailing indicator. When people are just getting started with a
new service they don’t just dive in with their full budget. They invest a
little and revise their budget allocation incrementally. If you push too hard
on revenue you can get 100% of the budget they allocated you today but you are
missing the bigger opportunity to give them outsized returns which is what
will cause them to allocate you more of their budget in the future.</p>
<p>Revenue is short term. In many of our products a focus on maximizing revenue
would lead us down a very different path than maximizing value. Maximizing
value often requires long term investments whose return profile is risky or
entirely unknown. But we know that without those types of long term
investments our business growth will start to plateau as we saturate the value
created by existing solutions.</p>
<p>Mark had a famous line in the S-1 we filed for our IPO: “We don’t build
products to make money, we make money to build great products.” I agree
wholeheartedly which is why the mission of the Facebook ads organization isn’t
to make money. It is to make meaningful connections between people and
businesses. And we take that seriously.</p></section></div></div>]]>

October 30, 2020 | https://carlschwan.eu/2020/10/30/kde-org-hugo.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://carlschwan.eu/2020/10/30/kde-org-hugo.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img src="https://carlschwan.eu/assets/img/heading_hugo.png" alt="Screenshot KDE.org"></p>

<p><a href="https://kde.org/">KDE.org</a> now uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Hugo is a fast and modern static site
generator written in Go. It provides a few improvements over the old system that was
using plain PHP. A large part of the work was done by Anuj during GSoC 2020. This
was a massive work, converting the repository storing more than 20 years of KDE
history.</p>

<p>The website is now generated once and no longer uses PHP to generate itself at runtime.
This improves the loading speed of the website, but the speed boost is not significant,
since the PHP code used before was quite small and KDE’s servers are powerful.</p>

<p>But the biggest improvement is in terms of features. We are now working with markdown
files instead of raw HTML files, this makes the life of the promo team much easier.</p>

<p>The internationalization of the website now creates a unique URL per language, this
should allow Google to link to the version of the website using the correct language.
A <a href="https://kde.org/fr/">French</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/uk/">Ukrainian</a>,
<a href="https://kde.org/ca/">Catalan</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/nl/">Dutch</a>, and a few more languages
are already available. There is also a proper language selector! We also don’t need
to manually tag each string for translations.</p>

<p>There is also now an <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/index.xml">RSS feed</a> with all the
latest announcements. Another big improvement is that the announcements list is
autogenerated and no longer modified by hand and with the help of the release scripts.</p>

<p>Another nice change for website developers is that now the SCSS code for the individual
pages is located in the kde-org repository itself instead of another repository.
Overall the developer experience is much better, there is no need to set up an apache
server and to the PHP configs to include the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/websites/capacity">capacity framework</a>, just to get the
website running locally. Now you only need to download the Hugo binary from their
release page and run it on the repo.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-and-gettext">Hugo and Gettext</h2>

<p>The internationalization of KDE.org was quite a challenge. When working on a multilingual
website with Hugo, Hugo expects a markdown document per language for each translated
page.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plasma-desktop.md
plasma-desktop.es.md
plasma-desktop.fr.md
plasma-desktop.uk.md
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is that traditional translations workflow rely on a string-based approach,
where a document is split in paragraphs and translated individually. So I couldn’t
just put each file markdown file as big blobs in the po files. To solve this problem,
I created a python script splitting the markdown files in paragraphs, simplifying
the markdown syntax (removing leading <code>#</code> and <code>+</code> for heading and list item). This
script also handles Hugo shortcodes transforming:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{&lt; img caption="My figure caption" alt="My accessible description" src="..." &gt;}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in two strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My figure caption</li>
  <li>My accessible description</li>
</ul>

<p>The script can obliviously put the individual strings back in place. The scripts also
handle the menu translation, and the translations of the strings in the footers.
For now, the script is just a file in the kde-org repository, but I would like to
transform it to a standalone library so that other gettext and Hugo users can
translate their website.</p>

<p>Using Hugo API, the language selector was trivial to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
&lt;ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto"&gt;
  {{ if .IsTranslated }}
    &lt;li class="nav-item dropdown" aria-describedby="language-picker-description"&gt;
      &lt;p class="sr-only" id="language-picker-description"&gt;{{ i18n "Select-your-language" }}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/Language-Icons/icon20x24px-exported-transparent.png" alt="" /&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;{{ i18n "translations" }}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;div class="dropdown-menu dropdonw-trans" role="listbox"&gt;
        &lt;a class="dropdown-item" aria-selected="true" hreflang="{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}" role="option" lang="{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}" href="{{ .Permalink }}"&gt;{{ .Site.Language.LanguageName }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{ range .Translations }}
          &lt;a class="dropdown-item" hreflang="{{ .Language.Lang }}" role="option" lang="{{ .Language.Lang }}" href="{{ .Permalink }}"&gt;{{ .Language.LanguageName }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{ end }}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/ul&gt;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a bit verbose because this selector is also fully accessible for screen readers.</p>

<p>There are a few more tricks employed in kde.org to improve the internationalization, for
example when a page doesn’t exist in a language, there is an Apache rule redirecting it
to the English version. Another nice trick is that there is a special Hugo shortcode
called <code>i18n_var</code> and used to parametrize the strings. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{&lt; i18n_var "Today KDE releases a bugfix update to KDE Plasma 5, versioned %[1]s" "5.20.2" &gt;}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the extractor is clever and only extract the part that needs to be translated.</p>

The integers are <em>opcodes</em> (short for â€œoperation codesâ€�), 8-bit numbers that correspond to an operation. Opcodes take parameters as strings, positive numbers, or JSON values (that is: the actual data that is changing). The list of available opcodes is as follows, notice that 10-18 are composites of the preceding ones:</p><ul><li>0 <code>Value<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>1 <code>Copy<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>2 <code>Blank<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>3 <code>ReturnIntoArray<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>4 <code>ReturnIntoObject<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>5 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKey<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>6 <code>PushField<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>7 <code>PushElement<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>8 <code>PushParent<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>9 <code>Pop<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>10 <code>PushFieldCopy</code></li><li>11 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>12 <code>PushElementCopy</code></li><li>13 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>14 <code>ReturnIntoObjectPop</code></li><li>15 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKeyPop</code></li><li>16 <code>ReturnIntoArrayPop</code></li><li>17 <code>ObjectSetFieldValue</code></li><li>18 <code>ObjectCopyField</code></li><li>19 <code>ObjectDeleteField</code>â€‹ </li><li>20 <code>ArrayAppendValue</code>â€‹ </li><li>21 <code>ArrayAppendSlice<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>22 <code>StringAppendString<!-- -->â€‹</code></li></ul><p>Mendoza reads these opcodes from the patch and produces the resulting document from them. Depending on the patch, Mendoza might choose not to strictly follow the opcodes but take a simpler path. If every field and value has changed, for example, itâ€™s more efficient just to replace the whole document with the new data without going through all the operations. Or if you have a list of objects where one has moved to another position and changed a key-value, Mendoza will manage to go back to the original and represent the change in a cheap way.</p><p>Mendoza is implemented in Go and can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza">GitHub repository</a>. We have also made <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza-js">a parser for Mendoza patches in JavaScript</a>, that you can use in your own application. </p><p>Of course, you can dive into <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity/blob/a3f7158016d63728a9b435e6ab444ff2b90fd424/packages/%40sanity/desk-tool/src/panes/documentPane/documentHistory/history/timeline.ts#L421">the source code for the Sanity Studio</a> and explore how Mendoza is used there. If you want a slightly simpler use-case, you can also <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store/blob/main/src/patch.ts">check out how weâ€™re using Mendoza to simulate a part of Sanityâ€™s real-time datastore</a> in the browser to power the <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity">real-time preview for Next.js</a>. </p><p>Naming a project is always difficult. Since this project is focused on representing changes between <em>JSON</em> documents I naturally started thinking about names like "JSON differ, JSON changes, JSON patch, â€¦". However, most of these names have already been used by existing projects. While I was muttering "JSON, JSON, JSON" it suddenly turned into "JSON, JSON, Jason, Jason Mendoza".</p><p>Jason Mendoza is a character from the show The Good Place, and while this project has little in common with the stupidest DJ from Florida, at least it's short and catchy.</p><p>Since a Mendoza patch is just describing the effect of a change it is also limited to work for the documents it was based on. It doesnâ€™t come with guarantees for consistency if the document you apply it on has changed from the original in meanwhile. This is one of the tradeoffs that we needed to do to make it really compressed. </p></div></div></div>]]>

October 30, 2020 | http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/amazon_manyrepo_builds.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/amazon_manyrepo_builds.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>A while ago,
<a href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/monorepo_vcs.html">I pondered monorepo version control systems</a>.
This article is at the opposite end of the spectrum: Manyrepos.</p>
<h2>Why Manyrepo?</h2>
<p>Monorepos are alluring since Google, Facebook, and Microsoft use that approach.
Is that a part of their secret sauce or accidental?
There is another big tech company which does the opposite.
At Amazon, teams work more independently.
Some use different version control systems which are not git
like Subversion and Perforce.
I guess that most companies do <em>not</em> have a monorepo
because it is really easy to split of a separate project
but hard to merge them just from an organizational point of view.
So maybe we can learn more from Amazon than Google?</p>
<p>A common pattern is that Amazon like the others built its own infrastructure
and engineers love it and miss it after they leave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've heard descriptions and seen blog entries about many other large companies build systems, but to be honest, nothing even comes close to the amazing technology Amazon has produced.
I would probably argue that what Google, Facebook, and most other companies of comparable size and larger do is at best objectively less good and at worst wasting millions of dollars of lost productivity.
–<a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0">terabyte</a></p>
<p>Once you understand the build and deployment tools you first wonder how you ever did anything before and then start to fear how you'll do anything once you leave.
–<a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0#gistcomment-3356000">hohle</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like Ex-Googlers reinvented their build system on the outside
with <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs">Pants</a>
and <a href="https://buck.build/">Buck</a>.
Likewise <a href="https://qbtbuildtool.com/">QBT</a> reinvents the Amazon build system.
Unfortunately, QBT is less known and less mature.</p>
<h2>Amazon's Build System</h2>
<p>There is less information about Amazon unfortunately.
Mine is from <a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0">this gist</a>
and discussions on 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24722214">HN</a> and
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ykk54d/amazon_s_build_system">lobste.rs</a>.
If I got something wrong, please tell me.
The short version is that Amazon's "Brazil" tool is
more of a package system than a build system.
It is closer to Nix than to Bazel.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/terabyte/15a2d3d407285b8b5a0a7964dd6283b0#gistcomment-3356000">Brazil delegates the actual build process to language-specific tools</a>.
Tools, like tmux, are also packaged with Brazil.
The interesting part is how packages are managed
and the core concept to understand is <em>version set</em>.</p>
<p>If you create a package at Amazon,
you specify an <em>interface version</em> like "1.1".
As long as changes are backwards-compatible,
the interface version is not changed.
When Brazil builds a package,
it appends an additional number to turn it into a <em>build version</em>
like "1.1.3847523".
You can only specify dependencies on interface versions.</p>
<p>Another thing Brazil does when building a package
is to record the transitive closure of dependencies
with their build versions.
Modern packaging tools differ between
"dependencies you want"
and "dependencies you actually used".
For example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html">Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock in Rust</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>version set</em> is a collection of packages.
The "live" package is the special global one
which corresponds to a trunk branch in version control.
When you build a package "against" a version set,
the tests of all packages in the version set are executed,
and the version set is incremented.
Thus the individual package is updated
(or published if it was not part of the version set before).</p>
<p>Brazil dependencies are classified as runtime, build, and test dependencies.
So for deployment, it can strip everything but the runtime dependencies
from a version set.</p>
<p>Dependencies must be carefully managed in this environment
as a "dependency hell" scenario is possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest ways that brazil was misused was around handling of major versions [aka interface version].
For context, only a single major version of a package is allowed to exist in a versionset at a time. If you tried to merge in a different major version of a package into your versionset, your pipeline would fail to build due to "Major version conflicts". One of the biggest sins was around bumping the major versions of the dependencies in a library without bumping the major version of that library at the same time. This would lead to many broken pipelines. Let's say you have a library Foo-1.0 with a bunch of users on other teams. You decide to bump up the Guava version from 25 to 29 and publish the new version of Foo-1.0. Anyone consuming Foo-1.0 would automatically pick up the new version of that lib because it's just a minor version change, however the merge would fail with a "major version conflict" because the major version of Guava they're using in their versionset is still 25. This means you would either have to pin that library back at a previous version, or bump your dependency on Guava in all of you packages to 29.
–<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24731537">pentlander</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an insight that generalizes:
Updating a dependency major version is a breaking change
even if your API is stable.</p>
<h2>The Point?</h2>
<p>Overall, it sounds a lot like a distribution package manager like apt or Nix.
The difference of version sets is
that they provide a branching mechanism
and this is how teams can work independently.
How is that unique though?
You can fork with apt and Nix as well.
In a monorepo, it would be a branch.
It must be about something different.</p>
<p>One advantage of monorepos is that one can track all users.
Version sets in Brazil provide a similar mechanism
since it is a <em>central</em> database.
This is important in case of security updates, for example.
Unfortunately, in manyrepo environments this information is usually not available
and when an issue arise it must be arduously researched.
So maybe companies should build such infrastructure
instead of dreaming about monorepos?</p>
<p>Coming back to the advantage of manyrepos,
refering to Amazon we can describe it concretely:
Version sets allow you to use multiple interface versions of the same package
at once (not multiple build versions though).
This mixture is not technically possible with a git monorepo
(but with Subversion or Perforce).
This is at least one example of the general tradeoff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t really think there’s a better or worse between the Amazon and Google/FB style build/deploy/source control systems, it’s primarily a reflection of the org/team structure and what they prioritize - there’s tension between team independence/velocity and crosscutting changes that optimize the whole codebase.
–<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ykk54d/amazon_s_build_system#c_fzyzg6">revert</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more discussion online about this.
Many companies should value the team independence over the crosscutting changes.
So the question is:
How to get the advantages we currently uniquely attribute to monorepos
in a manyrepo setting?
Amazon's Brazil has valuable ideas to contribute
and should be more widely known.</p>

</article><p>Amazon's build system provides valuable insights for manyrepo environments.</p></div>]]>

October 30, 2020 | https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I was a power user of <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> for many years, so I had mixed
feelings recently about <a href="https://archive.is/zpx2r">their decision</a> to change
their pricing model. Under IFTTT's new pricing, you can only have 3 “custom”
actions created/enabled at any time – which is quite a downgrade from the
current unlimited free plan. On the one hand, I'm glad to see IFTTT take
necessary steps to ensure it has long-term financial stability, but on the other
hand, I don't personally get enough value from their service anymore to justify
a recurring cost. (The plan will likely be
$4/month<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but if you sign up before a deadline, you
can lock in a price as low as $2/month)</p>
<p>IFTTT was an awesome and uniquely easy-to-use service when it first came out,
but now there are better options for personal automation for people like me, who
like to tinker with this sort of thing. Systems like
<a href="https://nodered.org/">node-red</a> and iOS shortcuts can be self hosted or run on
device, and they provide more sophisticated logic for workflows than IFTTT.</p>
<p>I stayed on IFTTT this long mostly due to inertia, and it's fantastically long
list of supported services. If I needed to throw together a quick
spreadsheet-recording automation, or cron-like trigger, IFTTT was a great
starting place. However, it does have limitations. Until now (though it seems
like this might change with their premium offering), IFTTT basically only did
what its name implied: “if this, then that”. No “if X then Y else Z”, no “if X
and Z then Y”, etc. Often times, you don't need any complicated logic or
filtering, but it was frustrating that there wasn't the option for more advanced
automation. Ultimately, IFTTT had a great “on-ramp”, but once you were on board
with their system, you realize how shallow it is. Excellent breadth, mediocre
depth.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the past couple years IFTTT's UI has leaned heavily into the
“applet” metaphor, with these big goofy toggle switches to enable/disable
automations. The site also transitioned towards a focus on community- (or, more
often corporate-) created automations, at the expense of the experience for
creating your own applets. Like seriously, why is 30% of the UI for an applet
<em>details page</em> (!) taken up by the connection status toggle?</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt.png">

        </a>
</figure>

<p>The settings page, too, is woefully information sparse. As a user, this makes me
feel that desktop-usability was not high on IFTTT's design priorities. You have
to scroll the page to begin to start to see what the automation is doing:</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt-settings.png">

        </a>
</figure>

<p>Eventually, the UI got to the point where it felt like using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Duplo">Duplos</a> or something. It didn't have
to be this way! There are great low-to-no-code tools that have much more usable
interfaces, like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a>.</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png">

        </a>
</figure>

<p>So, I decided to migrate away, since the move to premium was already going to
substantially limit what I could do with IFTTT. In going through my catalog of
IFTTT “applets”, I identified 3 main patterns of automations that I used IFTTT
for: (1) triggering an action to happen at a specific time, (2) triggering an
action to happen in response to a location change (i.e. geofencing), or (3)
triggering an action to happen in response to an event in a web service.</p>
<p>Of these 3 buckets, iOS shortcuts readily handles the first 2: as of iOS 14,
Shortcuts can be triggered in the background at a specific time of day, or in
response to entering/leaving a geofence. Shortcuts also has a much more
sophisticated integration with iOS than any of IFTTT's apps, so more exciting
mobile automation becomes possible – for example, setting my phone to Low Power
Mode once the battery drops below a certain threshold. Of course, you are
restricted to apps/services that support Shortcuts, and the number of supported
services is considerably smaller than IFTTT.</p>
<p>Node-red handles buckets 1 and 3: it has good support for time-based actions,
and can receive webhooks to respond to events from external services. It also
has a great plugin ecosystem, so it's support begins to rival IFTTT's impressive
selection of supported services. Additionally, node-red has many “escape
hatches” that IFTTT does not: you can use it to make raw HTTP requests and write
your own plugins/logic in Javascript, allowing for much more complex automation.</p>
<p>Neither node-red nor iOS shortcuts are as easy to use as IFTTT for putting
together a simple automation, which is a shame. However, between them (and other
alternative automation frameworks that I've trialed, like <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/huginn/huginn">huginn</a>), I've more than covered my
personal automation needs.</p>
<p>And so, goodbye IFTTT! ðŸ‘‹ I'm not put off by them charging for their service; I
think charging for software is a good thing! It's just that this was the nudge I
needed to move my automations to infrastructure that I have more control over,
which has other benefits outside the scope of this article. I'm thankful that a
service like IFTTT continues to exist; I still think it's a fantastic tool to
“on-ramp” less technical folks into automation and no-code tools.</p>

October 30, 2020 | https://www.ryansmulholland.com/writing/peer-assessment-bias | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ryansmulholland.com/writing/peer-assessment-bias">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-63067710b8dc43d7e49b"><div><p><strong>What’s the difference between you and an expert?</strong></p><p>It’s kind of obvious, isn’t it? Television appearances, thousands of dollars, and an audience of fans that accept ideas as thought leadership.</p><p>But seriously, what even <em>is</em> an expert?</p><p>Experts are peers who’ve had their ideas catch on through hard work, exhibition of talent, or luck.</p><p>I believe that statement, but it drastically simplifies everything that’s gone into someone establishing themselves as an expert. It’s not easy to get to the place where people assume you know what you’re talking about. It takes time, effort, and passion to get there. Overnight experts only exist in viral moments, it takes real expertise to have staying power.</p><p>The experts of the pre-internet age almost always hailed from academia. Earning credentials and conducting research was the only way to prove to others that you know what the hell you’re talking about. There was a gatekeeper to every distribution vessel and no public forum where a great idea from anyone could win the day.</p><p>Now we have that forum. The internet is full of people who are trying to be experts — people who think they’re experts — and as a result, there’s a monsoon of content on any given topic. And with access to information on anything, it’s the top 1% of information that we rely on, which usually belongs to...experts.</p><p>But experts are peers, remember? Just really fancy ones.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604023959443_6131"><div><p>So why don’t we consider the ideas of our peers in the same way we adopt the ideas of established thinkers?</p><p>To you, my peers, I’d like to present Peer Assessment Bias.</p><h3><strong>Peer Assessment Bias</strong></h3><p>Peer Assessment Bias is why this essay won’t be read tens of thousands of times. It’s why your best original ideas aren’t being talked about in bestselling books. It’s why you read something that a friend wrote and thought, “hmm, that was pretty good,” but not, “press the pause button on life, I need to take notes!”</p><p><strong>Peer Assessment Bias is the natural inclination to be more skeptical of the ideas of those perceived as peers, more so than the ideas of those perceived as experts.</strong></p><p>Simply put, when it’s your friend’s idea it’s solid, but when it’s coming from Peter Thiel, it’s genius.</p><p>There’s an overlap here with another bias that you may be familiar with. Survivorship Bias.</p><p>Survivorship Bias is a cognitive error that occurs when a successful subgroup is mistaken as an <em>entire</em> group due to the visibility of the successful group and the invisibility of the unsuccessful group (<a href="https://fs.blog/2020/10/sharks-survivorship-bias/" target="_blank">link here to illustrate</a>).</p><p>As it applies here, most of the ideas we consume come from experts. This is because they’ve already defeated the gatekeeper and have been elevated to the point where their thoughts matter more than others. They’re the successful survivors.</p><p>So what’s the difference between my idea of Peer Assessment Bias and good old Survivorship Bias? And how do they overlap?</p><p>Survivorship Bias is a layer of Peer Assessment Bias, but they’re not the same.</p><p>Survivorship Bias, as it relates to assessment, would lead us to believe that the best ideas come from the people who have the largest audiences. We perceive these successful survivors as experts and give more weight to the ideas they produce, even those unrelated to why they became successful in the first place. This doesn’t explain what happens on the peer side of the equation.</p><p>Peer Assessment Bias is about how we perceive those “at the same level” as us, and it’s especially focused on those who are unestablished. “Experts” were once peers and have now moved on to an evolved state. Becoming an expert takes time, and many of the strong ideas that experts share are ideated during the time when they were an unheard of “peer.”</p><p>Peer Assessment Bias has less to do with the success of the idea and more to do with the source of it. It’s different because we may very well look a great idea straight in the face and treat it as a commoner instead of as the royalty that it is.</p><h3><strong>PAB Awareness</strong></h3><p>Why does any of this matter?</p><p>Because it’s important to recognize good ideas when you hear them.</p><p>There are two sides to Peer Assessment Bias to be aware of.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Don’t automatically elevate ideas from experts</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t automatically dismiss ideas from peers</strong></p></li></ol><p>Experts, the people we look up to, are placed on a pedestal. They’re given status as infallible.&nbsp;</p><p>This is wrong.</p><p>Yes, the people who’ve earned their expertise are most likely to keep producing thoughts or content that’s worth consuming, but never blindly. “Because Musk said it,” is not reason enough to accept an idea.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604023959443_8762"><div><p>But you know this already, you’re a responsible human. So let’s take a look at the other side of Peer Assessment Bias, the side that doesn’t come naturally.</p><p><strong>Don’t automatically dismiss ideas from peers.</strong></p><p>Pay attention to those around you. They can have ideas that are just as strong as those who’ve already earned the world’s attention. Often it’s not perfectly polished, not precisely explained, and never published in the Washington Post, but it could be just as good.</p><p>Allow me to illustrate.</p><p>This is Ayomide:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604023959443_10888"><div><p>Sure, he’s a doctor, so he’s a proven smart guy, but the point is that you don’t know him. Ayomide is in my writing community, <a href="https://writersblochq.com/" target="_blank">Writer’s Bloc</a>, and I’ve had the pleasure of reading some of his work in the draft phase.</p><p>In August, he wrote this essay called “<a href="https://docayomide.com/love/" target="_blank">Love Your Neighbor Doesn’t Mean What We Think</a>.” It’s excellent, you should read it. But to summarize, it comes down to this one sentence:</p><blockquote><p>“Act in your neighbor’s interest as if it was your own.”</p></blockquote><p>That’s an objectively brilliant way of reframing “love your neighbor as yourself.” It may not seem like it, but that little tweak makes things click mentally in a different way than we’re used to.</p><p>Ayomide isn’t an established personality. He’s not looked upon by thousands as a brilliant mind to be listened to or read each week.</p><p>But he has some fantastic ideas worth reading, and so do your peers.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Empower Your Peers</strong></h3><p>The moral of this story is to cut your peers some slack.</p><p>The path to expertise is filled with early days of thoughts sent out into an empty void and then slowly adopted by a group of early fans. Those early fans are peers, and peer fans are the most important fans you can have. A show of support, a reliable voice for feedback, or a bit of help from someone promoting your work is sometimes all you need to keep pushing on to the point where you become an expert.</p><p>I’m no scientist, but there’s no doubt we’re harsher critics of our peers than we are of others we don’t know. Does this stem from personal self-doubt (I couldn’t do that, so they couldn’t do it either), a hint of jealousy, or another psychological misplacement? Maybe. But it does happen.</p><p>We have a mental bias to keep peers as peers and experts as experts. This is a bias like any other. One worthy of acknowledging and defeating.</p><p>Cut your peers some slack. Read their work. Promote their content. Champion their ideas. Stand behind them. Encourage their efforts.</p><p>To steal from my peer Ayomide; believe in your peer’s work the same way you believe in your own.</p><p>Now, go forth and lift up your peers.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The new EC2 Nitro Enclaves enable virtual machines to process private data without exposing its encryption key to the parent instance. In this post we will explore how Nitro Enclaves are used to securely process private keys stored in ACM.</p>
<p>This is part 2 in a two-part article. In the first part we review why Nitro Enclaves matter and how they can benefit your sensitive workloads: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-its-a-big-deal">ACM for Nitro Enclaves - It’s a Big Deal</a>.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This article follows the steps outlined in AWS’ documentation: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html">AWS Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves</a>. In their article, AWS builds the following architecture.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/4volL2Vsj6GH8kyvLASvYq/ceb73ac4e50f8779794628e56900f2b7/refarch.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="ACM Reference Architecture"></p>
<p>As discussed in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-its-a-big-deal">part 1</a>, it’s essential for private keys stored in ACM to never be exposed. As such, it’s interesting to see how AWS keeps these private keys secure, while still hosting them on your (relatively insecure) EC2 instance. The answer, of course, lies in the new <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-isolated-ec2-environments-to-process-confidential-data/">Nitro Enclaves</a>.</p>
<p>The two main topics for this post are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are private keys transmitted (and can we intercept them)?</li>
<li>How are permissions assigned to the Nitro Enclave (and can we assume them)?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Launching an EC2 instance</h3>
<p>The first step is to launch an Enclave-enabled EC2 instance. From the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave.html#nitro-enclave-reqs">requirements</a> we learn this can be any Nitro instance with an Intel or AMD processor. Further digging shows that the minimum size is an <code>m5a.xlarge</code>.</p>
<p>The operating system needs to be Linux. On Amazon Linux 2 the Nitro CLI is available in a yum repository. Installation instructions for other operating systems can be found on the Nitro Enclaves CLI <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli">Github page</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon has provided ready-to-go AMIs with NginX and the Nitro CLI pre-installed, so for this article we will use those. We will assign an IAM role with admin permissions to the instance so we won’t be limited in exploring access methods.</p>
<p>With the pre-build AMI deployed in a default VPC and an IAM role with admin permissions, our current architecture looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/4HFodRfnVjsleJ2YI6pVgg/66fce88c7b5ea3ba5234ae1bdee35d5e/deployment-1.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="Deployment 1"></p>
<h3>Creating an ACM certificate</h3>
<p>ACM certificates are free, but we do need a valid domain name. I’ve once purchased <code>vpcdemo.net</code>, so that’s what I will use for this article.</p>
<p>After we’ve moved through the steps of requesting a certificate, it shows as <code>Issued</code> and has an ARN. We will need this ARN in the next step.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/5Oxxf6wRYgkMm7QgYxHyq/6933f73ec20c723ed0bd6a790e43b9d9/valid_cert.jpg?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="Valid Certificate"></p>
<h3>Associating the IAM role with the certificate</h3>
<p>This is where it gets interesting. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html#role-cert">next step</a> in the process is to “Associate the role with the ACM certificate”.</p>
<p>The command to achieve this is <code>aws ec2 --region [region] associate-enclave-certificate-iam-role --certificate-arn [certificate_ARN] --role-arn [role_ARN]</code></p>
<p>This means we’re telling ACM that our EC2 instance role is allowed to access this certificate and private key. But we haven’t created a Nitro Enclave yet, and this role is assigned to an EC2 instance <strong>we</strong> control. Does that mean we will be able to access the private key from our instance? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Running the command above yields the following output:</p>
<pre><code>aws ec2 --region eu-central-1 associate-enclave-certificate-iam-role --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role
{
    "EncryptionKmsKeyId": "cb8e3d89-cd82-4560-867c-641c0008fab2", 
    "CertificateS3BucketName": "aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod", 
    "CertificateS3ObjectKey": "arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role/arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103"
}
</code></pre>
<p>This output obviously refers to three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>An S3 bucket (owned by AWS)</li>
<li>An S3 object (that likely contains our certificate and private key)</li>
<li>A KMS key (that is likely used to decrypt sensitive data)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next step, AWS describes we should assign new permissions to our EC2 instance’s IAM role:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject"
        ],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod/*"]
    },
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "kms:Decrypt"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:*:key/cb8e3d89-cd82-4560-867c-641c0008fab2"
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>These permissions allow our role to fetch an object from the AWS-owned S3 bucket, and to use the AWS-owned KMS key to decrypt data. Let’s update our architecture diagram with these new components.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/7MJ5bL64JTG0hyNkvSiMhp/485436f06a14e2c4165a4ec00c940209/deployment-2.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="Deployment 2"></p>
<h3>Retrieving the file from S3</h3>
<p>The <code>CertificateS3BucketName</code> and <code>CertificateS3ObjectKey</code> clearly identify where the ACM files are stored. Since our IAM Role now has all the necessary permissions, we can try to download the file.</p>
<pre><code>[ec2-user@ip-172-31-42-108 ~]$ aws s3 cp s3://aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod/arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role/arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 .
download: s3://aws-ec2-enclave-certificate-eu-central-1-prod/arn:aws:iam::123412341234:role/admin-role/arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123412341234:certificate/f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 to ./f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103
</code></pre>
<p>Lo and behold: it worked! We now have the ACM certificate files on our local machine. The million dollar question is what they contain.</p>
<h3>Analyzing the file contents</h3>
<p>We’ll output the file and run it through <code>jq</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/XdI3Sa3jYldy7criKPzHb/7ca202e4e65aaec1061f4400ee683073/file-contents.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="File Contents"></p>
<p>The contents are in JSON format, with four keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>certificate</code></li>
<li><code>certificateChain</code></li>
<li><code>encryptedPrivateKey</code></li>
<li><code>encryptionMethod</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The first two values are unencrypted, but these are the public certificate files anyone visiting <code>vpcdemo.net</code> would receive. No secrets there.</p>
<p>The third value is the private key we’re looking for. Obviously, it’s been encrypted. However, we also got access to a KMS key… Let’s see if we can use that to decrypt this value!</p>
<h3>Decrypting the private key</h3>
<p>First we’ll store the <code>encryptedPrivateKey</code> in a variable: <code>PRIVKEY=$(cat f2bb1a6e-5704-4702-beb7-a2c3f36e7103 | jq -r '.encryptedPrivateKey')</code>.</p>
<p>Then we’ll run the private key through KMS: <code>aws kms --region eu-central-1 decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://&lt;(echo $PRIVKEY | base64 -d) --output text --query Plaintext</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, but expectedly, this results in the following output:</p>
<pre><code>An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the Decrypt operation: The ciphertext refers to a customer master key that does not exist, does not exist in this region, or you are not allowed to access.
</code></pre>
<p>So this doesn’t work. Let’s find out why. We’ll start by looking at CloudTrail. It shows an interesting line:</p>
<pre><code>"errorMessage": "User: arn:aws:sts::123412341234:assumed-role/admin-role/i-025be0b6a191a2cde is not authorized to perform: kms:Decrypt on resource: arn:aws:kms:eu-central-1:194321236082:key/cb8e3d89-cd82-4560-867c-641c0008fab2",
</code></pre>
<p>This shows us that the KMS key is stored in account <code>194321236082</code>, and that our role was not allowed to use it. This is interesting, because we did exactly follow AWS’ instructions, which added permissions for our role to use this KMS key. The answer must lie somewhere in the Nitro Enclaves.</p>
<h3>Running NginX with Nitro Enclaves</h3>
<p>After walking through the last few steps in the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html#config-nginx">AWS docs</a> we’ve got a running server with HTTPS:</p>
<pre><code>➜  ~ curl -I -XGET https://vpcdemo.net
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0
Date: Fri, 30 Oct 2020 13:24:26 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 3520
Last-Modified: Wed, 24 Jun 2020 18:17:11 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "5ef398a7-dc0"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
</code></pre>
<p>In the NginX configuration at <code>/etc/pki/nginx/nginx-acm.conf</code> we see the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>ssl_certificate_key "engine:pkcs11:pkcs11:model=p11ne-token;manufacturer=Amazon;token=nginx-acm-token;id=%01;object=acm-key;type=private?pin-value=8c9d293b5fcbe9bc5f70fa400822a936";
ssl_certificate "/run/nitro_enclaves/acm/nginx-cert-6e67696e782d61636d2d746f6b656e.pem";
</code></pre>
<p>So the Nitro Enclave was able to download and decrypt my certificate, even though the parent instance wasn’t. The next question is how AWS has secured their KMS key so the parent instance can’t use it, but the Nitro Enclave using the same IAM Role <em>can</em>.</p>
<h3>Attestation</h3>
<p>The answer can be found in Jeff Barr’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-isolated-ec2-environments-to-process-confidential-data/">blog post</a> and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/set-up-attestation.html">Cryptographic attestation</a> chapter in the documentation. When a new enclave image file (the OS and code that runs in the enclave) is created, it will automatically hash its contents in various ways. These are then returned as platform configuration registers (PCRs). There are eight PCRs:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCR[0]: a hash of the enclave image file</li>
<li>PCR[1]: a hash of the Linux kernel and bootstrap</li>
<li>PCR[2]: a hash of the application</li>
<li>PCR[3]: a hash of the IAM role assigned to the parent instance</li>
<li>PCR[4]: a hash of the Instance ID of the parent instance</li>
<li>PCR[8]: a hash of the Enclave image file signing certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one (PCR0) can be used in a KMS condition. From the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/policy-conditions.html">KMS docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The kms:RecipientAttestation:ImageSha384 condition key allows the kms-decrypt, kms-generate-data-key, and kms-generate-random operations from an enclave only when the image hash from the signed attestation document in the request matches the value in the condition key. The ImageSha384 value corresponds to PCR[0] in the attestation document. This condition key is effective only when you call these APIs from an enclave using the Nitro Enclaves SDK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from Jeff Barr’s blog post: “In a real-world environment, I would create a KMS key policy that checks the PCR value as part of a Condition statement:”</p>
<pre><code>"Condition": {
"StringEqualsIgnoreCase": {
 "kms:RecipientAttestation:ImageSha384": "ecfd7aa6d1dcca1e0bba646e7d49ede2761651c68f13cee68b1141c182cd836baae37d05dd8e6260aa847369a7b27e24"
}
</code></pre>
<p>In simple terms: every enclave image has a signature that changes when the content of the enclave image changes. By setting the PCR[0] value at the time the image was built as a condition in KMS, the <code>Decrypt</code> operation will only be allowed when executed by this exact version of the enclave image. When somebody tampers with the image - or tries to use the role from the parent instance as we did above - the PCR0 will change, the KMS condition will no longer match, and access will be denied.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The new AWS Nitro Enclaves allow EC2 instances to spin up an isolated child VM for cryptographic operations. This unlocks new security features, the first and maybe most important of which is ACM on EC2.</p>
<p>In this post we will explore why Nitro Enclaves are important. Specifically, we’ll discuss why Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) on EC2 matters. This is part 1 in a two-part article. In the second part - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-how-secure-are-they">ACM for Nitro Enclaves - How Secure Are They?</a> - we will do a deep dive on the internal mechanisms that make Nitro Enclaves tick.</p>
<h3>A brief introduction to HTTPS</h3>
<p>HTTPS, or HTTP over SSL, encrypts web traffic in transit. This prevents eavesdropping on sensitive information and guarantees that your browser is talking to the right server. To understand ACM, we need a quick overview of the basics of HTTPS. Please note that the details of this process might vary for different versions of SSL, TLS and cypher suites.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/1tLEomZQnmb8bsbzf6IeQM/729a794d26969cdc531622271c8e2b27/handshake.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="SSL Handshake"></p>
<p>When a browser connects to a server over HTTPS, it first requests the server’s public certificate (1). It then verifies if the certificate was signed by a trusted certificate authority (3). This validates that the server is allowed to use this domain name.</p>
<p>Next, the browser generates a new, random key, called the <em>session key</em>. It encrypts this session key with the public key stored in the server’s certificate. Then it sends the session key back to the server (4).</p>
<p>The server uses the private key it has locally (and privately, hence the name) stored to decrypt the session key (5). It is essential to understand that <em>only</em> this private key can decrypt the session key. If the private key would leak or be stolen, anyone would be able to decrypt traffic destined for this server, or they would be able to impersonate this server.</p>
<p>The server and client use the session key to encrypt all traffic from that moment on, and the communication between browser and server is secured.</p>
<p>For additional context, check out my YouTube session on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUpUIw5zH2g&amp;list=PLeJgtCMvQjZd0kuK82-Et9IYcp6EiOeYa&amp;index=10&amp;ab_channel=SentiaCloud">SSL and Scaling</a>.</p>
<h3>Introducing ACM</h3>
<p>From the introduction to HTTPS it should be clear that the private key is an extremely sensitive piece of data and should be protected at all costs. However, the web server <em>needs</em> access to the private key to decrypt traffic. Classically, this meant that any user or administrator with access to the server might also gain access to the private key and use it to nefarious ends.</p>
<p>This is where Amazon Certificate Manager comes in. ACM allows you to generate and store certificates in a highly secure Amazon environment. Specific trusted services, like Elastic Load Balancers and CloudFront, integrate with ACM and are allowed to retrieve the private keys stored in ACM. They then use these private keys to decrypt your traffic and forward the unencrypted traffic to your EC2 instances. The core feature of ACM is that it will <strong>never</strong> expose your private keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/65dW6dIbfPccC4HHz48dUS/1e53a34ad6880bae189ff27e3b08867e/acm-intro.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="ACM Intro"></p>
<p>With the traffic to EC2 decrypted, there is no reason to store private keys on the EC2 instances anymore. This reduces the impact of users gaining access to your servers, regardless whether they are malicious or not.</p>
<h3>End-to-end encryption</h3>
<p>The attentive reader will have noticed that this solution does not result in end-to-end encryption. The unencrypted traffic stays within Amazon’s boundaries, but strict industries like finance or healthcare will not appreciate their data being plainly transmitted - inside or outside of Amazon’s virtual walls.</p>
<p>This means that if end-to-end encryption is a requirement, we need to go back to the drawing board. Amazon offers CloudHSM, which can do SSL offloading for EC2 instances in a very secure way, but CloudHSM is very expensive. The cost for a single CloudHSM instance in Ireland is $1.47 per hour. In a highly available setup you need to, at $2.94 per hour, or over $2000,- per month. Strict security requirements obviously come at a cost.</p>
<p>Additionally, CloudHSM does not integrate with ACM, which often means you’re managing your certificates in more than one place.</p>
<h3>The new Nitro Enclaves</h3>
<p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-isolated-ec2-environments-to-process-confidential-data/">new Nitro Enclaves</a> change this landscape significantly. You can now have end-to-end encryption without CloudHSM, while keeping your private keys secure.</p>
<p>With Nitro Enclaves, you separate part of your virtual machine’s hardware - for example 1 CPU and 512MB of its memory - to run as an independent virtual machine. This VM runs in full isolation. You can’t access its disk or network, you can’t login to it, you can do hardly anything with it. The only interaction you can have is over a <code>vsock</code> interface that is mounted on your parent instance.</p>
<p>In the second part of this article (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/acm-for-nitro-enclaves-how-secure-are-they">ACM for Nitro Enclaves - How Secure Are They?</a>) we will go into the inner workings of this process. The important details for now are that the Nitro Enclave <em>can</em> access the KMS service through a KMS proxy running on the parent host, and that the Nitro Enclave is cryptographically signed. This means that when the enclave connects to KMS, KMS can verify that the request is coming from a trusted enclave. Because the enclave is isolated, KMS can securely transfer data to the enclave, without any risk of that data being intercepted or retrieved.</p>
<h3>The result for ACM on EC2</h3>
<p>Let’s look at how the Nitro Enclaves enable end-to-end encryption. As discussed before, the essence of ACM is that it will never expose your private keys. Nitro Enclaves, on the other hand, run in full isolation but can securely communicate with KMS. ACM for Nitro Enclaves combines these properties by sending encrypted traffic to the parent EC2 instance, which requests its child Nitro Enclave to decrypt the traffic. The Nitro Enclave securely communicates with ACM to fetch the private key, and all requirements are met.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/79B9BqMV4DUxzpWvYcIFq5/4fa51c30ce67678a905cf69bd8ed234f/enclave-kms-acm.png?fit=scale&amp;w=1330" alt="ACM, KMS, Enclave"></p>
<h3>Technological marvel</h3>
<p>AWS are flexing their technological prowess here - big time. The ACM and KMS part is impressive, but mostly an elaboration on existing technologies. The Nitro Enclaves themselves, however, are taking virtualization to a whole new level. Taking a virtual machine and carving out CPU cores and memory to run <em>another</em> virtual machine in isolation, while the machine is running? Consider my mind blown.</p>
<p>This is the point where we see Amazon’s lead versus their competitors. While other public cloud providers are still building multi-AZ designs and getting their networking backbone in order, AWS has built a foundation that allows them to capitalize on completely new technologies and solutions.</p>
<p>I believe the Nitro architecture is still in its early days, and many more futuristic virtualization features await.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>No solution is perfect, and there are a few things you should know before rushing to implement Nitro Enclaves. First, there is instance sizing. Currently, the smallest supported instance for Nitro Enclaves is an <code>m5a.xlarge</code> with four vCPUs. You will likely split this into two vCPUs for the parent instance and two vCPUs for the enclave. Technically, you’re reserving an <code>m5a.large</code>'s worth of CPU for your enclave. In Ireland, this will cost $0.096 per hour, or about $70,- per instance per month. This is significantly cheaper than CloudHSM, but it’s not free either.</p>
<p>Second, only Linux and NginX currently support ACM for Nitro Enclaves. This means that if you’re running Apache, Tomcat, IIS or another solution for your web servers, you will need to wait for future support.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The new Nitro Enclaves unlock new ways to securely process sensitive data. ACM is a first example, but I’m sure many other implementations will soon be released. This article has explored why being able to process private data on an EC2 instance is a big deal.

<p>One of my favorite team retrospective activities is what I call the “I Suck” awards. </p>



<p>It’s simple. Here’s the process:</p>



<ul><li>Step 1: Someone kicks it off by saying why they suck at that moment</li><li>Step 2: The rest of the team laughs or empathizes or whatever the situation calls for</li><li>Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until everyone has said why they suck</li><li>Step 4: Vote on the winner of the “I Suck” award, aka the person with the most impressive suckitude that time around. </li></ul>



<p>Everyone sucks for some reason at any given time. Maybe they procrastinated. Maybe they missed an obvious bug. Maybe they keep forgetting to update the sprint board. Maybe they have been talking too much on calls. Maybe they didn’t submit their dang timesheet. Whatever it is, everyone has one.</p>



<p>There are a few reasons why I love this activity:</p>



<ul><li>It’s fun and often hilarious</li><li>It discourages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass">Cover Your Ass (CYA)</a> Engineering</li><li>It gives people a chance to drop some tips for next time</li><li>It’s great for <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/27/the-whys-and-hows-of-jelling-teams/">team jelling</a> </li><li>It lets us learn from each other’s mistakes</li><li>It reduces the sense of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">shame that accompanies messing up</a></li></ul>



<p>I stole the idea from Radical Candor, which calls it the “<a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/encourage-feedback/#:~:text=Introduce%20Whoops-a-Daisy">Whoops-A-Daisy</a>“. </p>



<p>It’s powerful and it’s fun, so give it a shot! Why do you suck?</p>

AI plays chess and Go, AI plays video games, AI makes people dance. It is time to stop this madness and finally apply AI in a meaningful way. Therefore, we proudly present the dish-o-tron. The dish-o-tron is an AI system designed to solve an actual real-world problem impacting millions of people around the world every day: facing dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink.</p><div id="attachment_77683"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77683" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-250x107.png" alt="dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink" width="250" height="107" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-250x107.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-700x300.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-768x329.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-1536x659.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem-120x51.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/real_world_problem.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77683">dirty dishes in the community kitchen sink – a real-world problem</p></div><p>Reading this blog series will equip you with the ultimate power to solve this long-lasting problem in your community kitchen once and for all by using state-of-the-art AI technology.</p><h2>The dish-o-tron</h2><p>At first glance, the dish-o-tron is an inconspicuous, well-positioned webcam in the kitchen observing the shared kitchen sink. In its natural state the dish-o-tron is just happy and enjoys life. The dish-o-tron doesn’t care whether you prefer tea or coffee and it likes all kinds of kitchen talk. However, there is one single thing that the dish-o-tron absolutely hates: watching someone put dirty dishes in the community sink.</p><p>Detecting dirty dishes in the sink enrages the peace-loving dish-o-tron so much that it starts beeping. The only way to return it to its natural peaceful state and thus stopping the noise is to admit one’s mistake and remove all dirty dishes from the community sink, leaving it neat and clean again.</p><div id="attachment_78576"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78576" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-250x166.png" alt="respect privacy in the kitchen" width="250" height="166" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-250x166.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-700x465.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-768x510.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-1536x1020.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen-120x80.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/surveillance_in_kitchen.png 1984w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-78576">privacy in the kitchen has to be respected.</p></div><p>Building the dish-o-tron requires three high-level steps:</p><ul><li>Gathering and preparing data</li><li>Training an AI model</li><li>Deployment of the model</li></ul><p>In the following, we will discuss these steps further.</p><h2>Gathering and preparing data</h2><p>Trying to solve real-world problems with AI often starts with the realisation that there is little or even no data available. This issue prevents many problem solvers from actually solving the problem. “If only data collection had started years ago!”, they say, “then we could now actually solve the problem”. While this is a reasonable thought, it simply doesn’t help.</p><p>Consoling users currently facing a problem by saying that it is necessary to gather lots of data for quite some time before we can start building a solution is at least challenging. Typically a more promising approach is to build a system addressing the problem which is able to improve over time.</p><p>In this way, we will not solve the problem completely in the first step; however, we will tackle the problem right away and put ourselves in a position to iteratively adjust the solution to match the requirements which also become more and more clear while working on the problem.</p><p>Since our problem is unique in a sense that there is no Kaggle dataset readily available, we start our journey to building the dish-o-tron by doing our best to collect a suitable dataset for a first working system. Here, we will make videos of various kitchen sinks clean and not clean and split them up into a first labeled dataset.</p><p>In this way, we started collecting the DIRTY-DISHES-DATASET with thousands of pictures that we will share with you in the next article.</p><div id="attachment_77687"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77687" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-250x151.png" alt="sample images from the dirty-dishes dataset" width="250" height="151" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-250x151.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-700x424.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-768x465.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset-120x73.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/dirty_dishes_dataset.png 1004w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77687">sample images from the dirty-dishes dataset</p></div><h2>Training an AI model</h2><p>Not so long ago, training an AI model was tedious and required expert knowledge. In many cases this is still true today. Depending on the problem, we have to figure out a suitable model architecture and feature engineering and this requires some experimentation before we can train a suitable AI model. This is another issue which prevents problem solvers from building a solution tackling the whole problem even if data is available.</p><p>Fortunately, image classification is one of the best understood use cases in AI. There are lots of established best practices regarding model architectures and training of models. Among others this led to two things:</p><ul><li>High-level software libraries such as fast.ai which abstract away lots of the nitty-gritty details of image classification, providing a black-box kind of approach where state-of-the-art practises are simply utilised without burdening the user with the details.</li><li>Machine Learning as a service offerings from various public cloud providers such as automl and rekognition allowing training of image classification models on custom data in a few simple steps.</li></ul><p>Both approaches will typically not lead to the absolutely best solution. However, most of the time this is not necessary and ‘good enough’ will be just fine and a nice trade-off between time &amp; money spent vs. result. For our first version of the dish-o-tron, we will employ the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoML Service</a> from Google Cloud to train a first model.</p><p>We can use various tools to inspect the model and try to explain if the black box learns what we expect.</p><div id="attachment_77689"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77689" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-250x191.png" alt="visualizing what the dish-o-tron model has actually learned" width="250" height="191" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-250x191.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-700x535.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-768x587.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model-120x92.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/explain_model.png 1412w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77689">Visualizing what the model has actually learned.</p></div><p>The training of the AI model with AutoML and its technical details will be discussed in a follow-up blog post.</p><h2>Deployment of the model</h2><p>Having an AI model generally will not solve an actual real-life problem. For a viable solution, the AI model has to be integrated into a suitable context. Many times, this is the key step to generating any value at all. Nevertheless, this step is often postponed to the distant future after “collecting high quality data” and “building the best AI model”. This is, more often than not, a mistake because integrating the model into its context poses various challenges on its own. Hence, it should not be ignored and instead tackled early in order to learn and identify the associated challenges.</p><p>While building the dish-o-tron, we tried multiple options to run the model. We deployed it on a Pi Zero which is a really small and cheap device that can be glued anywhere with a small powerbank. But it is rather slow. We ran the model in the browser using our notebook’s webcam with TensorFlow.js. We used the Google AIY Kit, which is much faster than the Pi Zero and also comes with a beeper and blinking lights (but it is quite old and deploying state-of-the-art models is hacky). Finally, we used the Google Coral device, which is made for this kind of workload and well-integrated into Google AutoML but comes with a price tag.</p><p>The community kitchen is a special place. It’s a place where rumors are born, where gossip is produced and where you can openly chat about the most secret secrets of your company! That’s why dish-o-tron is living on the edge. Edge devices enable you to run audio and video analytics AND respect the privacy of your community kitchen. No image is transferred to the cloud. Nothing is saved. Dish-o-tron sees and forgets.</p><div id="attachment_77691"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77691" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-250x85.png" alt="various edge devices" width="250" height="85" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-250x85.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-700x237.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-768x261.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-1536x521.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-2048x695.png 2048w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/various_edge_devices-120x41.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77691">Various edge devices</p></div><p>Moreover, the hardware we consider and buy in order to actually build the dish-o-tron will establish basic conditions for our solution space. In other words, we have to mind that it is possible to painlessly deploy the AI model on our preferred edge device. For the first version of the dish-o-tron, we decided to use a Google AIY kit (see video below). For the next version, we chose a Google Coral edge device, which allows us to run advanced computer vision tasks on a Raspberry-size mini computer. Fortunately, AutoML allows us to export models in a viable format.</p><div id="attachment_77693"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77693" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-250x131.png" alt="Google coral device" width="250" height="131" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-250x131.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-700x366.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-768x401.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-1536x803.png 1536w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device-120x63.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/09/google_coral_device.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-77693">Google coral device</p></div><p>The construction of the dish-o-tron including the deployment of the model on the Coral device and its technical details will be discussed in an upcoming blog post.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>AI research has brought us new technology that can solve problems that couldn’t be solved before.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Next month, Brazil will launch its first nationwide digital instant-payment system. On November 16, Pix will go live on banking apps, digital wallets, and other services throughout Latin America’s largest financial market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pix was created by Brazil’s <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/w-006-8837?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;__lrTS=20191105091102789&amp;firstPage=true">Central Bank</a>, which has the power of life and death over all Brazilian financial institutions. The system is virtually free to use, a novelty in a country with a very efficient but expensive banking system.</p>



<p>Although it will be mandatory only for the largest banks, Pix will be available for all Brazilians whose bank or credit union opts in. Already, people are embracing the new system; on the first registration day ahead of launch, <a href="https://neofeed.com.br/blog/home/no-pix-uma-lista-e-a-chave-da-discordia-entre-bancos-e-fintechs/">millions of users</a> signed up for the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But not everyone is so enthusiastic. Pix’s simplicity and low cost will eat into the revenue streams of big banks, which typically charge users for fast transfers. It also complicates the business models of some of Brazil’s most successful startups. And by combining these features with a countrywide mandate, Pix might finally accomplish something that up until a few years ago was unthinkable: killing cash transactions in Brazil.</p>



<h3><strong>Why did the Brazilian Central Bank create Pix?</strong></h3>



<p>Pix has been in the works<a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/gtpaginst_reunioes"> since mid-2018</a>. Back then, there were a few instant-payment systems available in Brazil. Yet those that did exist were either limited to a specific bank’s clientele or had been launched by startups.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>“We had been signaling the need for instant payments to the market since 2013,” said Mayara Yano, an analyst at the Central Bank. But, according to Yano, there were too many barriers and not enough incentives for a private company to create a service to be adopted by the banking system as a whole.</p><p>With Pix, the Central Bank also means to restrain the use of paper money, still popular in everyday life. It’s typical of mom and pop shops to offer 5% to 10% discounts for cash payments to avoid card-processing fees, for example.</p></div>



<p>Limiting paper currency with Pix would help the Central Bank with two other problems: limit its expenses with producing and distributing bills and coins, and boost the government’s investigations of financial fraud, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/bolsonaro-declares-brazil-corruption-free-and-ends-carwash-probe">a hot-button issue in Brazil</a>. After all, cash transactions are almost impossible to track, but Pix payments will be all saved in their users’ banking apps.<br></p>



<p>Pix isn’t the first government-imposed payment mandate in Brazil’s history. In 2002, the Central Bank created a money transfer mechanism that took less than one hour on weekdays and would be completed by the next working day on weekends and holidays. The mechanism, called TED, was mandatory for all banks.</p>



<p><br>Pix, of course, isn’t mandatory for everybody. But it may as well be, since it is mandatory for banks with more than 500,000 clients; the group comprises 34 banks, which serve 90% of the <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/10/pandemia-leva-a-bancarizacao-de-quase-10-milhoes-de-pessoas.shtml">175.4 million Brazilians who own bank accounts</a>. It is optional for smaller banks, fintech startups, credit unions, and other financial service providers.</p>



<h3><strong>How will it work?</strong></h3>



<div><p>Pix relies on identifiers like QR codes, email addresses, and telephone numbers to perform money transfers in up to 10 seconds, including on weekends and holidays. It will be incorporated into banking and payment apps, digital wallets, and other kinds of financial services. Once available, Pix will provide an alternative to existing fast money transfers, which cost an average of 10 Brazilian reais each in fees ($2).</p><p>The system functions virtually for free<strong>; </strong>the Central Bank charges financial institutions just 1 Brazilian centavo ($0.0018) for every 10 Pix transactions, and it’s up to them if they will pass along that cost to their clients.</p><p>To sign up, a user must submit up to five pieces of personal information, such as an email address, a cell phone number, or a tax ID, that will be used as a “Pix key” to identify them in a money transfer. Users will also be given a QR code, which can be used to send or receive payments. If they have a bank account, they can use their checking account information to process a Pix transaction, much like a traditional bank transfer.</p></div>

<h3><strong>How will Pix affect Brazilian banks and fintech startups?</strong></h3>



<p>The government hasn’t disclosed any studies of how Pix could impact Brazil’s economy. But it’s clear that the new technology will hit big banks the hardest, as well as big-name payment intermediaries, like point-of-sale and card-machine operators Cielo and Rede. German consulting group Roland Berger forecasts that the latter could lose up to <a href="https://valorinveste.globo.com/mercados/renda-variavel/empresas/noticia/2020/07/03/pix-tira-ate-r-13-bi-de-credenciadoras.ghtml"></a><a href="https://valorinveste.globo.com/mercados/renda-variavel/empresas/noticia/2020/07/03/pix-tira-ate-r-13-bi-de-credenciadoras.ghtml">13 billion reais</a> ($2.6 billion).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pix also threatens what has been a lucrative revenue stream for Brazil’s “Big Five” banks — Itaú, Bradesco, Santander, Banco do Brasil, and Caixa Econômica Federal — which collectively make 2.2 billion reais ($440 million) a year from fees for same-day money transfers.</p>







<p>But a potential loss in transfer revenues isn’t the only danger to the Big Five. Now that they’re on the same footing when it comes to transfer fees, they risk losing clients to digital wallets and online-only banks. As of 2019, more than <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/publicacoes/relatorioeconomiabancaria/REB_2019.pdf">80% of Brazil’s total credit operations</a>, valued at 2.90 trillion reais ($580 billion), were concentrated in the Big Five. “Pix will challenge the entire market to provide quality digital services at lower prices,” said Cláudio Guimarães Júnior, executive director of the Brazilian Association of Banks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional banks such as Itaú e Bradesco<a href="https://einvestidor.estadao.com.br/ultimas-noticias/itau-e-do-bradesco-chamam-atencao-para-seguranca-e-defendem-pix"> have voiced concerns</a> about the system’s security and complained that the launch date is too early. “[Battling Pix] is like trying to stop the wind with your hands,” said João Bragança, specialist in payment methods at Roland Berger.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>But the effects of Pix could cut both ways. Established digital payment startups like <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/brazilian-instant-payment-pix-will-allow-withdrawals-in-retail-stores/">PicPay</a>, with its 20 million active users, and <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/brazils-pagseguro-digital-raises-23-billion-ipo-stock-jumps-2018-01-24">PagSeguro</a>, which raised about 13.2 billion reais ($2.3 billion) during its initial public offering on Nasdaq, may be in trouble. One of their services is instant digital payments, something Pix will provide universally and for free.</p><p>But whether you’re a big bank or a small fintech firm, there’s no fighting the Central Bank. The Brazilian government will also allow big retailers to adopt Pix as a payment option, often with cashback offers, a novelty in Brazil. In order to compete, PicPay and other digital-payment companies will need to diversify their services.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h3><strong>What will change for Brazilians?</strong></h3>



<p>Even with Brazilians being as fond of cash as they are now, financial experts are expecting Pix to gain a stranglehold on non-cash payments and money transfers within the next few years. An analysis by Accenture anticipates some <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/technology/brazils-instant-payments-system-can-reach-20-million-users-in-its-first-year/">48 billion reais</a> ($9.6 billion) to move through the Pix system by the end of its first year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study predicts that Pix will achieve mass adoption (i.e., be used for 25% of all household payments) within five years and move between 1 trillion reais ($200 billion) and 1.5 trillion reais ($300 billion) per year. That’s close to 20% of Brazil’s current GDP of 7.3 trillion reais ($1.46 trillion). “The Brazilian card industry, both debit and credit, moved 1.8 trillion reais ($360 billion) in 2019. So Pix can have practically that same size in 2025,” said Ricardo Pandur, payment specialist at Accenture.</p>



<p>But it remains to be seen who exactly will turn to Pix. The Central Bank is betting on its appeal to the <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/10/pandemia-leva-a-bancarizacao-de-quase-10-milhoes-de-pessoas.shtml">36 million Brazilians</a> with no bank accounts. For them, Pix could serve as an entry point to financial services.</p>

<div><p>For consumers, Pix will be an alternative to cash and debit cards, a cheap, fast method of money transfer, and even an easy way to pay taxes. For retailers, Pix will be cheaper than card operators, with potentially zero cost to them or their customers.</p><p>But access to Pix is conditional on access to a smartphone or a computer as well as a stable data connection. Even with increased connectivity and phone use, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/Pew-Research-Center_Global-Technology-Use-2018_2019-02-05.pdf">40% of all Brazilian adults</a> still don’t have a smartphone. Potential users might have trouble understanding the system of personal keys and QR codes. “Understanding a payment mechanism is not as simple as learning to use social media,” said Ricardo Rocha, a professor of finance at Insper in São Paulo.</p></div>



<div><p>With new technology comes new vulnerabilities to scams and phishing attempts. Pix will be incorporated into banks’ native apps and websites and have the added benefit of encrypted transactions. But it will be up to the same banks to explain the risks while pushing for widespread adoption.</p><p>Some startups might have been pushing for adoption a little too far.&nbsp;Clients of online banks <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/david-velez-nubank/">Nubank</a> and C6 and digital wallets PagSeguro and MercadoPago took to social media to complain that the companies registered their keys <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2020/10/19/procon-notifica-nubank-e-mercado-pago-sobre-cadastramento-de-chaves-no-pix.ghtml">without their explicit consent</a>. The Central Bank started a <a href="https://exame.com/seu-dinheiro/bc-investiga-denuncia-de-cadastramento-indevido-das-chaves-do-pix/">formal investigation</a> and Brazil’s primary consumer defense entity <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2020/10/19/procon-notifica-nubank-e-mercado-pago-sobre-cadastramento-de-chaves-no-pix.ghtml">questioned</a> their methods, but the corporations claimed they followed all guidelines and that their clients were notified via apps.</p></div>



<p>Even so, the future of Pix looks promising. Between October 5, when the Central Bank started to allow users to enroll their Pix keys ahead of the November launch date, and October 22, there have been 50 million enrollments. On the first day alone, 3.5 million keys entered the system, and the demand was so high that many banking apps crashed.</p>

Without it, your site and 3rd party tags are not in direct connection. Those services are mostly JavaScript libraries for marketing or tracking tools that are implemented with a tag. But any other tags apply as well.</p><p>The only exception to the rule applies when you do&nbsp;conversion optimization&nbsp;with split-testing tools.</p><p>Because during conversion rate optimization, A/B tests are going to load different variants of a page. So the visitor may see how the content is re-rendered for a split-second.</p><p>To avoid CSS flicker and ensure that variant tests load fast, a split-testing tag may also go directly into the source code.</p><p>Now that we have this out of the way, let’s look at the implementation.</p><h2 id="install-google-tag-manager-on-your-website"><a href="#install-google-tag-manager-on-your-website" aria-label="Install Google Tag Manager on your website" title="Right click to copy link to paragraph"></a>Install Google Tag Manager on your website</h2><p>Let's start the Google Tag Manager tutorial by showing you where to get the Google Tag Manager code snippet and then where to install it on the website.

<p>In this edition of the <a href="https://ottverse.com/category/industry-spotlight/">Industry Spotlight</a> series, we take a look at <a href="https://www.piconets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picoNETS</a>; a startup focused on building Deep Edge Content Delivery Networks or Deep Edge Caching for Telcos and Content Providers.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at their product, journey, USP, and what sets them apart from the rest, shall we?</p>




<h2><span id="Who_is_picoNETS"></span>Who is picoNETS?<span></span></h2>



<p>picoNETS is a&nbsp;<strong>Deep Edge Content Delivery Network</strong>&nbsp;provider started in 2016, and they primarily work with telecom and content providers. Some of their USPs and accomplishments are –</p>



<ul><li>They are a Deep Edge CDN for media delivery and also provide edge computing resources.</li><li>picoNETS is a partner of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ruralcloud.com/">Rural Cloud Initiative</a>&nbsp;in the US and is engaged with top OTT platforms in India</li><li>They are live in 5G Labs for a US Telco and have gained traction with Carriers, Telcos, and ISPs in the US, UK, India, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Fiji.</li></ul>



<h2><span id="How_does_picoNETS%E2%80%99_Edge_Caching_Work"></span>How does picoNETS’ Edge Caching Work?<span></span></h2>



<p>Before we dive into the “how,” let’s understand why there is a need for a&nbsp;<strong>deep edge CDN</strong>&nbsp;like the one offered by picoNETS.</p>



<p>Let’s take the example of rural America. </p>



<p>A recent article from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/21504476/online-school-covid-pandemic-rural-low-income-internet-broadband">The Verge</a>&nbsp;highlighted the struggle faced by rural Americans in their pursuit of high speed Internet and how this problem was exacerbated in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. A&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/j6wor7/americas_internet_wasnt_prepared_for_online/">raging debate on the same article in Reddit</a>&nbsp;underscored the struggle of everyday, rural America.</p>



<p>In addition to a lack of high-speed internet, if a CDN provider does not have a point of presence (PoP) near your city/town/village, then you are going to face problems with streaming video. </p>



<p>Video streaming problems manifest in different ways – a long delay in showing the first picture (startup delay or latency), buffering issues during playback, or while seeking back or forth in the video, and in the worst case, complete stalls or fatal errors. Apart from these problems, a low-bandwidth connection is quite likely to result in a low resolution (or bitrate) video being delivered to your device.</p>



<p>All of these problems amount to an abysmal viewing experience, right?</p>



<p>So what’s the solution to these problems?</p>



<p>Well, one could argue that it’s up to the CDN provider to establish more POPs (geographically distributed) and improve their coverage. While this is a reasonable argument, it can be challenging in terms of infrastructural costs and the RoI for the CDN provider.</p>



<p>However, if you continue this train of thought, you end up with a business model that establishes POPs at a much more granular level.</p>



<p>What do I mean by this?</p>



<p>Well, instead of establishing a POP in every town or city, why not go deeper and install a POP at every airport, shopping mall, school, university, or post office?</p>



<p>Is it possible? Well, it sure is and <strong>this is the USP of picoNETS.</strong></p>



<p>picoNETS go “deep” and establish “deep edge caches” right next to your underserved target audience to ensure that they get a fantastic QoE.</p>



<p>A prototypical customer of picoNETS could be a university that uses the deep edge cache to provide buffer-free, high quality, online classes for their students (live or on-demand).</p>



<p>Here is an illustration of the concept we just discussed. </p>

<h2><span id="The_benefit_of_using_picoNETS"></span>The benefit of using picoNETS<span></span></h2>



<p>Now that we’ve established that picoNETS brings caching closer to your customer (the “why” and the “how”), the benefits are evident and critical to a good user experience. </p>



<p>With picoNETS, you get,</p>



<ul><li><strong>low latency media delivery</strong>&nbsp;– this is important in reducing stalls, and time-to-first-byte, startup-delay</li><li><strong>reduced buffering</strong>&nbsp;during playback and during seeks.</li><li>the ability to <strong>scale and deliver media</strong> when content goes viral especially, in a geo-localized manner. </li></ul>



<p>Another cool use-case for picoNETS is in the online multiplayer gaming industry. </p>



<p>It is important for gaming engines to synchronize each player’s location with the rest of the players, or else the game-play is spoiled, and there could be unfair advantages to certain players over others.</p>



<p>picoNETS tries to solve such problems by&nbsp;<strong>providing edge-computing</strong>&nbsp;in addition to their edge caching capabilities. By moving the decision and synchronization engines closer to the players (edge, i.e.), game-play is improved, and the latency incurred in player-synchronization is reduced.</p>



<p>All this sounds nice, right? But, my mind went straight to a commercial deployment scenario and I wasn’t sure how picoNETS would work alongside a traditional CDN. Do you need to use both or either one?</p>



<p>Well, let’s find out. </p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_You_Choose_Between_a_CDN_and_picoNETS_Deep_Edge_Cache"></span>How Do You Choose Between a CDN and picoNETS Deep Edge Cache?<span></span></h2>



<p>While speaking to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishrbedekar">Ashish Bedekar</a>, picoNETS’ COO, I asked him what a typical deployment looks like and how does it impact their customers’ operations?</p>



<p>He mentioned that the deployment is quite straightforward (similar to other CDN deployments). And, the decision to switch between a customers’ incumbent, traditional CDN and picoNETS happens at the CMS level.</p>



<p>At the CMS, a decision is taken to playback a stream using the CDN or with the picoNETS Deep Edge Cache. The decision is based on the ASN value, and Ashish told me that the rules could be more fine-grained as needed.</p>



<p>For example, their multi-CDN router allows you to add rules to direct premium subscribers’ traffic vs. others. Also, they have fail-over policies to ensure that the end-user is never left hanging!</p>



<p>This multi-CDN approach is smart and allows you to fine-tune your deployment to take advantage of each service (CDN &amp; picoNETS) in its “area of strength”.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of their architecture that demonstrates this. </p>

		Study says happy people are less likely to experience memory decline with age.	</p><div>

<p>The structure and function of brain cells continues to change throughout life, and most of its aspects decline as we age in response to a number of lifestyle factors. As these cells lose their ability to communicate with each other, our ability to retain memory disintegrates. But, is there a way to stop it from happening, or at least slow it down a bit?</p>
<p>Yes, and that’s by keeping a positive outlook in life.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/2020-oct-positive-outlook-memory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new study</a> at Association for Psychological Science has revealed that people who lead a cheerful, enthusiastic life full of pride and joy are less likely to experience memory decline as they age. Psychologists have a term for it, and it’s called “<a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-79061-9_2193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">positive affect</a>”. So the more a person experiences a positive affect, the more he or she is likely to retain memories, of which some could even last a lifetime.</p>

<p>For the study, the team looked at data from 991 adults who took part in a national study conducted three times between 1995 and 1996, 2004 and 2006, and 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p>Researchers then gauged the reports on a range of positive emotions the participants had experienced over the past 30 days. They also asked participants to take part in a memory test which consisted of recalling words immediately after a presentation and again 15 minutes later.</p>
<p>After successfully examining the association between positive affect and memory decline, while accounting for factors like age, gender, education, depression, negative affect, and extraversion, they found that individuals with higher levels of positive affect had a better memory retention over the course of almost a decade compared to those that had experienced lesser positive affect.</p>
<p>Positive affectivity has been tied to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">number of favourable health outcomes</a>, including lowering the levels of stress, minimizing severity of depression, promoting longevity and other physiological functioning. And this new finding adds to a burgeoning area of research on the role of positive affect in healthy aging.</p>
<p>The study entitled <strong>“</strong><span><strong>Positive Affect Is Associated With Less Memory Decline: Evidence From a 9-Year Longitudinal Study”</strong>&nbsp;</span>has been published in the journal <em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797620953883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psychological Science</a></em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><blockquote><p>This article was originally published on Mateusz's <a href="https://dev.to/mpodlasin/functional-programming-in-js-part-i-composition-currying-lodash-and-ramda-1ohb">dev.to profile</a>.</p><p>Mateusz says about himself: "I write in-depth articles about JavaScript, React and functional programming."</p></blockquote><p>In this series of articles, we will go through a soft introduction to functional programming in JavaScript.</p><p>Each article will be devoted to a different aspect of functional programming. After the theoretical introduction, we will see how those concepts are then used in actual, real world JavaScript libraries.</p><p>This mix of theory and practice will ensure that you get a deep understanding of all the concepts while being able to use them effortlessly in practice in your day to day work.</p><p>Please be aware that this series assumes that you already have some proficiency in writing code with arrays' methods such as <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>reduce</code>. If they still confuse you, let me know, and I will write an article explaining them in-depth.</p><p>Ready? Let's get started!</p><h2>Composition</h2><p>If I had to name in one word what this first article will focus on, it would be <em>composition</em> or <em>composability</em>.</p><p>More specifically, I mean here the art of composing your code from small, reusable functions, almost like composing a lego set from smaller pieces.</p><p>It turns out that a properly written functional code is very composable. What does it mean? It means that it is extremely easy to take a small piece of that code and reuse it in a completely different situation.</p><p>Take a look at this code, written in traditional style:</p><pre><code><span>let</span> result <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> i <span>&lt;</span> data<span>.</span><span>length</span><span>,</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> num <span>=</span> <span>parseInt</span><span>(</span>data<span>[</span>i<span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>num <span>&lt;</span> <span>5</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        result<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span>num<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>and now compare it to:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>stringToInt</span> <span>=</span> <span>str</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>parseInt</span><span>(</span>str<span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>lessThan</span> <span>=</span> <span>compareTo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span>

<span>const</span> result <span>=</span> data
    <span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span>stringToInt<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Those two snippets do the same thing. We first take the <code>data</code> array, which is filled with some strings. We then transform those strings into integers. And finally, we store only those integers that are strictly smaller than 5 in a new array. We keep that array under the <code>result</code> variable.</p><p>So if we got an <code>["1", "6", "3"]</code> array, we would return <code>[1, 3]</code> as a result.</p><p>Depending on which style you are more accustomed to, you will find one of the two above snippets more readable. I believe that the second one is more readable because - not taking into the account little helper functions that we defined - it reads almost like English:</p><p>Take <code>data</code>, <code>mapEach</code>, <code>stringToInt</code> and then <code>filter</code> only those values that are <code>lessThan(5)</code>.</p><p>However, if you are not used to functional style, this second snippet will seem awkward and needlessly convoluted. Are there any objective benefits of writing the code in that style?</p><p>Of course! And that benefit is exactly the composability. Note that we went out of our way to define even the simplest pieces of our code as functions. Thanks to that, we can now use those snippets in entirely new situations without ever writing the same code twice.</p><p>Of course, those reusable <code>stringToInt</code> and <code>lessThan</code> functions are extremely simple, to the point where it arguably is not worth reusing them like that. But keep in mind that this example only serves as a motivation for the whole approach.</p><p>In more complex applications, those functions would be getting more and more complicated. The approach of reusing the most amount of code possible and composing new code from previously written functions will have much more apparent benefits in a bigger codebase.</p><p>Note also that apart from the simplest possible reusability - simply using <code>stringToInt</code> and <code>lessThan</code> functions in different contexts - we also see examples of using higher-order array functions - <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>. It is key to note that they possess an immense power - they allow you to use functions defined for singular values (for example, strings) on whole arrays of those values (for instance, on arrays of strings).</p><p>This is the first moment when you can see the power of that approach. You wrote two functions - <code>stringToInt</code> and <code>lessThan</code> - that are not supposed to be used on arrays. And yet, by wrapping them in only a few more characters - <code>.map(stringToInt)</code>, <code>.filter(lessThan(5))</code> - you suddenly possess the power to use those functions on whole arrays of values.</p><p>This is precisely what we meant at the beginning. The functional approach allows you to use the same code in entirely different contexts - in fact, here, the same code is even used on completely different types of values! A function that was meant to work only on strings can now work on arrays of strings! That's pretty cool.</p><h2>Currying</h2><p>Perhaps you have already asked yourself - "wait, what is this weird definition of <code>lessThan</code> about?".</p><p>If I asked you to write a <code>lessThan</code> function, you would probably do it like that:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>lessThan</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>num<span>,</span> compareTo</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span></code></pre><p>And yet we did it like that:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>lessThan</span> <span>=</span> <span>compareTo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span></code></pre><p>Not only arguments are switched, but also the syntax of a function definition is different. Is this some new, exotic addition to the JavaScript standard?</p><p>In fact, no. What we did here is that we wrote a function that returns another function.</p><p>Function that we are returning is:</p><pre><code><span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span></code></pre><p>And then we wrap it in another function, that finally provides <code>compareTo</code> variable for it:</p><pre><code><span>compareTo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>This time we wrapped the returned function in parentheses for better readability.</p><p>Note that we used here the fact that in an arrow function, we can provide returned value directly, instead of the function body. If we wanted to write the body, we might rewrite the above example like so:</p><pre><code><span>compareTo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>In fact, this pattern doesn't really rely on ES6 arrow function syntax. Me might have as well written it in old school function syntax:</p><pre><code><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>compareTo</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>What ES6 arrow syntax does, however, is that it makes that monstrous code look much nicer:</p><pre><code><span>compareTo</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span></code></pre><p>That pattern is called currying.</p><p>If you take a function taking some number of parameters:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>someFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a<span>,</span> b<span>,</span> c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// some code here</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>you can "curry" it (or produce its "curried" version), which looks like that:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>someFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>c</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// some code here</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>In this case, the original function accepts three parameters.</p><p>After currying it, we get a function that accepts one parameter <code>a</code>, returns a function that takes one parameter <code>b</code>, then returns a function that accepts one parameter <code>c</code> and finally executes the original function's body.</p><p>Ok, we explained <em>how</em> that mechanism works, but we didn't explain why we even decided to write our functions like that.</p><p>Frankly, the answer is extremely simple. The only reason is so that we could later use the <code>lessThan</code> function like so:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Note that if we used our first definition of that function:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>lessThan</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>num<span>,</span> compareTo</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> num <span>&lt;</span> compareTo<span>;</span></code></pre><p>then applying it in the <code>filter</code> method wouldn't be nearly as nice. We would have to write that code like so:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>num</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>lessThan</span><span>(</span>num<span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>So again, you see that we wrote our function in a way that makes it compose nicely with methods such as <code>filter</code>.</p><p>It also composes nicely with a <code>map</code>. Writing code like this:</p><pre><code>numbers<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>would return an array of booleans saying if the number on a given place in the array is smaller than 5. For example, running that code on an array <code>[5, 1, 4]</code>, would return an array <code>[false, true, true]</code>.</p><p>So you can see that <code>lessThan</code> function composes now much nicer with other, higher-order functions.</p><p>On top of that, assume we noticed that we use <code>lessThan</code> very often with a number 5 specifically. Maybe that's a very important number, let's say a number of the servers we have in the company.</p><p>This number now appears in several places in our code. But having it hard-coded like that is a very bad practice. What if that number changes at some point, for example, to a 6? We would have to search for all those appearances of 5 and change them to 6 manually. This would be both too cumbersome and error-prone.</p><p>The first solution that comes to mind is to store that number in a variable, a constant with some semantic name that describes what this number means:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>NUMBER_OF_SERVERS</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Now we can use the constant instead of the number:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>NUMBER_OF_SERVERS</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>If that number changes (for example, our company buys more servers), we can update it in one place, where that constant is defined.</p><p>This is certainly nicer and very readable, but it's still a tiny bit cumbersome to import two distinct values (<code>lessThan</code> and <code>NUMBER_OF_SERVERS</code>) even though we always want to use them together.</p><p>However, the way we defined the <code>lessThan</code> function allows us to fix that. We can store the returned function in another variable!</p><pre><code><span>const</span> lessThanNumberOfServers <span>=</span> <span>lessThan</span><span>(</span><span>NUMBER_OF_SERVERS</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Now, whenever we want to use that function with that specific value, we can import it once and use it directly:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span>lessThanNumberOfServers<span>)</span></code></pre><p>Our function is more composable with other functions, but it also allows us to define new functions in a very easy manner.</p><p>Very often certain values in our functions are only some kind of configuration. Those values do not change very often. In fact, you will often find yourself hard-coding those values inside your functions:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>someFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span><span>...</span>someArguments</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>const</span> <span>SOME_VALUE_THAT_WILL_PROBABLY_NOT_CHANGE</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>

   <span>// some code here</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>It's sometimes a good idea to put such value as an argument of a curried function and simply create a new function, with this value already set to a value we expect to be the most common:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>someBiggerFunction</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>someValueThatWillProbablyNotChange</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span><span>...</span>someArguments</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// some code here</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>const</span> someFunction <span>=</span> <span>someBiggerFunction</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>This pattern is handy because it ultimately gives you the same result - a function with a value hard-coded inside. But at the same time, you get much bigger flexibility. When it turns out it is necessary to set that variable to some …</p></div></div></div>

  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>TorchScript is one of the most important parts of the Pytorch ecosystem, allowing portable, efficient and nearly seamless deployment. With just a few lines of <code>torch.jit</code> code and some simple model changes you can export an asset that runs anywhere <code>libtorch</code> does. It’s an important toolset to master if you want to run your models outside the lab at high efficiency.</p>
<p>Good <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html">introductory material</a> is already available for starting to work with <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html">TorchScript</a> including <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_export.html">execution in the C++ <code>libtorch</code> runtime</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_language_reference.html">reference material</a> is also provided. This article is a collection of topics going beyond the basics of your first export.</p>
<h2 id="tracing-vs-scripting">
  Tracing vs Scripting
  <a href="#tracing-vs-scripting">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Pytorch provides two methods for generating TorchScript from your model code — tracing and scripting — but which should you use? Let’s recap how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html"><strong>Tracing.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> you’ll provide your model and sample input as arguments. The input will be fed through the model as in regular inference and the executed operations will be traced and recorded into TorchScript. Logical structure will be frozen into the path taken during this sample execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.script.html"><strong>Scripting.</strong></a> When using <code>torch.jit.script</code> you’ll simply provide your model as an argument. TorchScript will be generated from the static inspection of the <code>nn.Module</code> contents (recursively).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not obvious from the tutorial documentation, but choosing which method to use is a fairly simple and fluid choice:</p>
<h3 id="use-scripting-by-default">
  Use Scripting by Default
  <a href="#use-scripting-by-default">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Because <code>torch.jit.script</code> captures both the operations and full conditional logic of your model, it’s a great place to start. If your model doesn’t need any <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_unsupported.html">unsupported Pytorch functionality</a> and has logic restricted to the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_builtin_functions.html#python-built-in-functions">supported subset of Python functions</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit_python_reference.html">syntax</a>, then <code>torch.jit.script</code> should be all you need.</p>
<p>One major advantage of scripting over tracing is that an export is likely to either fail for a well-defined reason — implying a clear code modification — or succeed without warnings.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Unlike Python, TorchScript is Statically Typed</strong></p>
<p>You will need to be consistent about container element datatypes, and be wary of implicit function signatures. A useful practice is to use type hints in method signatures.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite TorchScript’s ability to capture conditional logic it does not allow you to run arbitrary Python within <code>libtorch</code> — a popular misconception.</p>
<h3 id="use-tracing-if-you-must">
  Use Tracing if You Must
  <a href="#use-tracing-if-you-must">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There are a few special cases in which <code>torch.jit.trace</code> may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to modify the model code — because you do not have access or ownership — you may find scripting the model simply will not work because it uses unsupported Pytorch/Python functionality.</li>
<li>In pursuit of performance or to bake in architectural decisions the logic freezing behavior of tracing might be preferable — similar to inlining C/C++ code.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pay Close Attention to Tracer Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Due to how tracing can simplify model behavior, each warning should be fully understood and only then ignored (or fixed). Also, be sure to trace in eval mode if you are exporting a model for production inference!</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="use-both-together">
  Use Both Together
  <a href="#use-both-together">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Scripted and traced code can be freely mixed, and this is often a great choice. See the existing <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch.org</a> documentation for <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html#mixing-tracing-and-scripting">details</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html#mixing-scripting-and-tracing">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 id="device-pinning">
  Device Pinning
  <a href="#device-pinning">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you find yourself using <code>torch.jit.trace</code> on some code, you’ll have to actively deal with some of the gotchas or face performance and portability consequences. Besides addressing any warnings Pytorch emits, you’ll also need to keep an eye out for device pinning. Just like <code>torch.jit.trace</code> records and freezes conditional logic, it will also trace and make constant the values resulting from this logic — this can include device constants.</p>
<p>Using this sample code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we trace while executing on CPU or GPU we get this TorchScript (scroll to the right on mobile):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>
  <span>_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>ops</span><span>.</span><span>prim</span><span>.</span><span>NumToTensor</span><span>(</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
  <span>_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>_0</span><span>),</span> <span>dtype</span><span>=</span><span>None</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>(</span><span>"cpu"</span><span>),</span> <span>pin_memory</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see that <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> has been inserted as a constant into the generated TorchScript. If we try to get clever with this code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>arange</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>size</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>device</span><span>=</span><span>X</span><span>.</span><span>device</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Tracing will now result in TorchScript that is pinned to the tracing device. When traced on GPU, we see this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span>
    <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>_1</span></code></pre></div>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tensors Created During Tracing Will Have Their Device Pinned</strong></p>
<p>This can be a significant performance and portability problem.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="performance-and-portability">
  Performance and Portability
  <a href="#performance-and-portability">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If we later deserialize and run this TorchScript in <code>libtorch</code> the <code>arange</code> tensor will always be created on the device that is pinned — <code>torch.device("cpu")</code> or <code>torch.device("cuda:0")</code> in the examples above. If the rest of the model is running on a different device this can result in costly memory transfers and synchronization.</p>
<p>This device pinning issue extends to multi-GPU scenarios as well. If you have traced and exported a model on <code>cuda:0</code> and then run it on <code>cuda:1</code> you’ll see transfers and synchronization between the devices. Not good. Perhaps even worse, if such a model is run in an environment without any CUDA-capable device it will fail since <code>cuda:0</code> doesn’t exist.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Replace Tensors Created During Execution With Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Tensors created in the execution path while tracing will have their device pinned. Depending on model logic, these can often be turned into Parameters created during construction.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An example of the problem looks like this in Nsight Systems:</p>

<p>The same pattern holds for <code>tensor[indexes]</code> and <code>tensor.index_select(0, indexes)</code>. This device pinning carries the same performance and portability risks as noted above.</p>

<h2 id="direct-graph-modification">
  Direct Graph Modification
  <a href="#direct-graph-modification">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Once we’ve used <code>torch.jit.script</code> or <code>torch.jit.trace</code> to generate a ScriptModule or ScriptFunction we can use <code>.graph</code>, <code>.inlined_graph</code> or <code>.code</code> to understand exactly what TorchScript has been generated. Though it has an entirely undocumented interface it is possible (and fun) to access and modify the generated TorchScript AST directly via the <code>.graph</code> method.</p>
<p>The most useful parts of the API are defined in <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp">torch/csrc/jit/python/python_ir.cpp</a>. As you can see, all the basic functionality is present for finding and changing the graph nodes you want. If you change nodes or arguments and then persist the module your subsequent TorchScript load and inference will reflect your changes, though modules cannot be changed recursively in this way (<code>torch.jit.freeze</code> can be useful here).</p>
<p>An example of the kind of graph modification that is possible:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>undevice</span><span>(</span><span>tsc</span><span>):</span>
    <span># use ::to variant which does not hardcode device</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>to_node</span> <span>in</span> <span>tsc</span><span>.</span><span>graph</span><span>.</span><span>findAllNodes</span><span>(</span><span>'aten::to'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>layout</span><span>,</span> <span>device</span><span>,</span> <span>pin_mem</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>inputs</span><span>())</span>
        <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>removeAllInputs</span><span>()</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>dtype</span><span>,</span> <span>non_blocking</span><span>,</span> <span>copy</span><span>,</span> <span>mem_format</span><span>]:</span>
            <span>to_node</span><span>.</span><span>addInput</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>constant</span> <span>in</span> <span>tsc</span><span>.</span><span>graph</span><span>.</span><span>findAllNodes</span><span>(</span><span>'prim::Constant'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>hasUses</span><span>():</span>
            <span>constant</span><span>.</span><span>destroy</span><span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above code will modify a traced graph, changing <code>aten::to</code> to use an overload which doesn’t change memory location.</p>
<p>But what is this really useful for? As an undocumented API you’d be unwise to use this capability in a production pipeline unless you like maintenance coding. I would only recommend it for research, as in the above example which I used to understand and profile the transfer/synchronization behavior of tensor subscripting.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don’t Bother With Direct Graph Modification</strong></p>
<p>For legitimate production use-cases you can almost always find a way to modify your model code to generate the TorchScript you want.</p>

<p>You can get some <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline/#stage-3-hacked-deepstream-mdash-80-tensorrt-20-torchscript">awesome results with TensorRT</a> but exporting a model from Pytorch to TensorRT is far from a sure thing. The export path to ONNX and then to TensorRT can fail due to missing or incompatible operations at either step and this can be frustrating.</p>
<p>After the obligatory Google search, I’ve found a reasonable hail-mary approach is to rewrite your tensor processing code to avoid unsupported operators. I can’t give general advice for this but let me show you an example of how this can be possible: <code>repeat_interleave</code>.</p>

  <p>Michael,</p>
  
  <p>Thanks for your interest in L3-AI! We're excited to feature your presentation. </p>
  
  <p>Would you be able to condense your proposal into a 5 minute lightning talk?  If this sounds good to you, I'll schedule next steps [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually... I submitted to do a lightning talk, so no problem, right? I've <a href="https://codepunk.io/why-i-love-lightning-talks/">mentioned before</a> that too often people see lightning talks as a consolation price, but I use them to test out new ideas, and it requires a special set of skills to get those ideas across in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Unlike in the past where my focus was explicitly on the Microsoft Bot Framework, I had recently expanded to a greater analysis of frameworks like <a href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa</a> and <a href="https://www.botkit.ai/">Ben Brown's Botkit</a>. After conversations with Chris Mullins at Microsoft, I really started applying a more critical eye towards the frameworks I'd been using, but was taking for granted.</p>

<p>Specifically, I was unconvinced that the way frameworks were being built constituted an appropriate approach. We're not talking about programming-centric frameworks. Conversational software is about a conversation-first approach, and the frameworks for building conversational software should allow the programmer to program in a way that represents how a conversation flows. (Brown's Botkit does a good job of this with the names of its methods and classes.)</p>

<p>I decided to built a chatbot framework from scratch in order to explore these ideas and settled on conversation analysis as a theory to apply. This led to several presentations over the course of the Summer, including Rasa's L3-AI. I expanded on this presentation in latter virtual conferences, and being influenced by the pandemic, politics, and the overall despair of the state of affairs, this expanded presentation took quite an unexpected turn.</p>

<p>LinkedIn can be a valuable tool and a painful platform all in the same minute. The more active you become, the more noticed you are, and the more likely you'll start getting random InMail's and connection invites from people you don't know. If you're lucky recruiters will use the InMail feature where they have a limited number of cold requests. Mostly, though, they just send you a random connection request and put their message in the invite to try to avoid burning their InMails.</p>

<p>I have a general rule: If I don't know you and you send a connection request without a personal message, I ignore it outright. If it does have a personal message, I hope it's relevant.</p>

<p>When I received an invite from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-greenwald-108/">Brian Greenwald</a>, he at least followed the appropriate etiquette. The Vice President of Business Development for <a href="https://generateimpact.com/">Generate Impact</a>, Brian was a new addition to the unfolding story of Chiedo Labs—a local Harrisonburg development shop spawned from the machinations of James Madison University student Chiedo John. I was familiar Chiedo Labs from some local tech circles and was connected to Chiedo and a few employees through LinkedIn. Chiedo and I both spoke at Nation JS in Washington, DC the previous year and had exchanged a few emails.</p>

<p>Chiedo was always a faith-based person, while Chiedo Labs—although a good group of people—was fighting an uphill battle trying to distinguish itself in custom development where its a race to the bottom on client pricing. So it made sense when the company converted from Chiedo Labs to Generate Impact and began a concentrated effort towards focusing on helping non-profits.</p>

<p>But it wasn't long before Chiedo jumped ship to greener pastures at GitHub, while Brian and Mike Forster (Generate Impact president) were piloting the transformation of the company.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Michael! That’s awesome that you know Chiedo! He was one of my clients and [as] fortune would have it we ended up merging what I do with Generate Impact. [...] I would love to meet for coffee - seems like it will be a while unfortunately. We are hunkered down here in Earlysville. Would love to learn about what you are doing...maybe we can schedule a zoom call sometime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agreed.</p>

<p>I also didn't expect a Zoom call to be scheduled immediately for the following week. It smelled a little of a cold call, which I'm never receptive to. Still, I was familiar with the company and some of the team members, so at worst, I would fly into the meeting with little need to put a lid on my opinions or personality.</p>

<p>My conversation with Brian came just after the COVID-19 pandemic began shutting down much of the United States, and I had already begun reading articles about the reshaping of economic needs and drivers. What started as a discussion of engineering proficiency, DevOps, and business-oriented IT processes escalated into the public good side of non-profits, B-corps, and the fundamentally optimistic assumption that <em>something has to give</em>. Corporations cannot continue on an infinite growth curve, and the pandemic represented an unprecedented opportunity to hit reset on corporate values and strive for something more than the upwards extraction of wealth.</p>

<p>Having previously interviewed enterprise architect Bryan Betts—someone who has spend most of his career in public service—I remember my colleague asking him about a hypothetical situation of communicating to leadership the ROI of certain better processes and planning.</p>

  <p>Sometimes its not about the return on investment; Sometimes its just about doing the right thing, and there's value in that alone.</p>

<p>From Brian Greenwald's side, he had been working for quite some time on the concept of a benevolent business model—an economic and business planning model that focused on success through the lens of greater inclusiveness and understanding of externalities rather than pure financial extraction—a model that seeks sustainability and equitability over exponential growth. Brian and I connected enough on a philosophical level that he introduced me to Generate Impact president Mike Forster to further the discuss on the positive technological impact on local businesses and communities. What emerged was a vision of enabling public good through technology, but from the local-first, sustainability approach that has permeated environmental movements—an acknowledgement that a successful path forward in the new normal consisted of an interrelated approach combining people, processes, and technology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Benevolent Business Model is anchored in the principle that all human activity exists (or SHOULD exist) to fulfill benevolent human needs. By that principle, a business exists to first CONTRIBUTE to the community it exists in and is building as opposed to focusing on gathering and EXTRACTING as many resources as possible. In other words, profit becomes the enabler of a collective vision of well-being as opposed to the end goal itself.</p>
  
  <p>Of course, the irony of this approach, particularly in the world we are living in today, is that focusing on the benevolence of EVERY member of the business community is MORE likely to be a strategic advantage and thus lead to more success and profit than the traditional "business as an army going to battle" approach, where victory is possible, but in the long run the cost to society is high.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can't forget about the people.</p>

<p>Typically when we talk about economic sectors, the focus is generally on the public and private sectors, and most don't consider if there is anything else on the outer boundaries. But recent analyses by market-watchers like <a href="https://www.exponentialview.co/">Azeem Azar</a> have pointed out the ever-growing sector (and importance) of open source software and technology. We’re used to hearing about the public sector and the private sector, what has been continuing to gain stream is this idea of an "open" sector.</p>

<p>COVID-19 has shown us the value of open data, and how that sharing can speed up understanding and innovation. In fact, open source software, open data, crowd-sourcing solutions, and crowd-funding projects, combined with efforts like GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, and Ko-Fi are carving out a sector that isn’t quite public, but isn’t private either. It’s an open, more democratic sector for a society looking to advance common goals.</p>

<p>This open sector is more prevalent in the technology industry than anywhere else, and it feeds both the private and public sector, such as open source software enabling and enhancing companies in either or those sectors. In fact, it feels like we've come full circle back to the original hackers of the 70's and 80's—producing software in a left-libertarian form of mutualism.</p>

<p>But oftentimes, our technology accelerates faster than our morality, and we occasionally need to step back and reevaluate our positions. For example, there is a disconnect between the programmers and researchers working hard on facial recognition software for the advancement of the theories and technology, and the fundamentally immoral use of facial recognition software in racial profiling and identifying protesters.</p>

<p>If you're at all familiar with <a href="https://logicmag.io/">Logic Magazine</a>, you've read some of the more significant techno-societal ponderings that are invading Silicon Valley's philosophical outlook, such as Astra Taylor's take down of the "security" of capitalism in <a href="https://logicmag.io/security/the-insecurity-machine/"><em>The Insecurity Machine</em></a>, which shows how technology is applied not to create more security for individuals, but to enhance greater security for ownership.</p>

<p><img src="http://codepunk.io/content/images/2020/10/hcp-2.png" alt="Human-Centered Programming"></p>

<p>Human-centered programming is a way of thinking about software that is different from the traditional <em>programmers can do whatever they want because technology is agnostic</em> view. To this respect, programming and technology consist of three important components: code, culture, and conscience. These three components can best be viewed in the traditional triangle trope of related ideas. Like all other triangle diagrams, it implies an interconnectedness between elements.</p>

<p>Code enables culture and culture defines how we code, but without conscience, we won’t fully understand the impact of the code that we write or the negative directions that our culture …</p></div></div>

<p>Recently while working on my <a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/an-intel-mcs-48-based-dual-temperature-sensor/">MCS-48 temperature sensor</a> project I had to confront one of the largest challenges, which is to implement an option where changing a jumper displayed Fahrenheit instead of Celsius. The output from the DS18B10 temperature sensors is Celsius only, as it should be, so a conversion would need to be performed.</p>



<figure><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CodeCogsEqn.gif" alt=""><figcaption>A quick reminder of the conversion needed to be performed</figcaption></figure>



<p>In my case it’s +320 as I’m using fixed point arithmetic i.e. 15.3° = 153. This is a tough conversion to perform on an MCS-48 as a slew of different operations are required:</p>



<ul><li>16-bit negate (more about that below)</li><li>16-bit unsigned multiply</li><li>16-bit unsigned divide</li><li>16-bit add with wrap-around</li></ul>



<p>A tall order for a CPU which has just <em>one </em>math instruction: 8-bit add. To perform all of this, one must sling a long sequence of primitive instructions together. Since this is an assembly language only architecture, I couldn’t cheat by compiling it in C and pinching the resulting instructions as I have done for PIC16 in the past.</p>



<p><em>Edit: Since publishing this a cornucopia of different approaches to this problem have been proposed to me. I’m happy with implementation as it currently stands. It works, it makes very efficient use of program memory, the improved performance is not required, and the above math routines are re-used for other tasks in the project.</em></p>



<p>The best place to find such examples is in the MCS-48 assembly language manual:</p>



<figure><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual.jpg"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-800x638.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-800x638.jpg 800w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-300x239.jpg 300w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-150x120.jpg 150w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-768x612.jpg 768w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-1536x1224.jpg 1536w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/manual-2048x1633.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></figure>



<p>(A scan of it can be viewed <a href="http://www.nj7p.org/Manuals/PDFs/Intel/9800255D.pdf">here</a>). Everything I needed was in there, except how to divide. There is no mention whatsoever in that manual of how to perform any kind of division operation, <em>but</em>, tacked in the back of the 1980 edition MCS-48 handbook, I found this:</p>



<figure><a href="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv.png"><img src="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-623x800.png" alt="" srcset="http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-623x800.png 623w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-233x300.png 233w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-117x150.png 117w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-768x987.png 768w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv-1195x1536.png 1195w, http://techmattmillman.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/isisdiv.png 1263w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px"></a><figcaption>Woohoo! A working divide routine for MCS-48. It wouldn’t OCR, so I typed it up.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately that routine only has an 8-bit quotient, which isn’t much use for my application because it would overflow in most cases.</p>



<p>I was easily able to work around that with the following implementation (pseudo code):</p>



<pre><code>if (celsius &lt; 0)
{   // If negative, note it, and make it positive
    // so we can work with simpler unsigned routines below
    celsius = -celsius;
    is_negative = 1;
}

fahrenheit = multiply_16x8r16(celsius, 9);

// Divide by 50 so the result of divide_16x8r8 doesn't overflow
fahrenheit = divide_16x8r8(fahrenheit, 50, &amp;remainder);

// Multiply it back up
fahrenheit = multiply_16x8r16(fahrenheit, 10);

// Factor remainder
remainder = multiply_16x8r16(remainder, 10);

// Divide and add remainder
fahrenheit += divide_16x8r8(remainder, 50, NULL);

if (is_negative)
{   // Make it negative again, if it was previously
    is_negative = 1;
}

// Add 32. Requires a 16-bit add with wrap around to
// correctly handle negative temperatures
fahrenheit += 320</code></pre>



<p>While that does the job, it’s poo poo. What I really want is that complicated looking divide routine to have a 16-bit quotient, so I can do the division in a single operation. To help me understand it, I translated it to C code:</p>



<pre><code>uint8_t mcs48_divide(uint16_t dividend, uint8_t divisor, uint8_t *remainder)
{
    if ((dividend &gt;&gt; 8) &gt;= divisor)
        goto mcs48_div_exit; // Impossible. Result would
                             // overflow. Bail.

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) // One pass for each bit of result
    {
        uint8_t msb;
        uint8_t bit15_was_set = 0;

        if (dividend &amp; 0x8000)
            bit15_was_set = 1; // Note if this was set,

        dividend &lt;&lt;= 1; // Next bit

        msb = (dividend &gt;&gt; 8);
        if (msb &gt;= divisor || bit15_was_set)
        {
            // Subtract remainder from MSB,
            // preserve and increment quotient
            dividend = (((msb - divisor) &lt;&lt; 8) | (dividend &amp; 0xFF)) + 1;
        }
    }

mcs48_div_exit:
    *remainder = (dividend &gt;&gt; 8);
    return (dividend &amp; 0xFF);
}</code></pre>



<p>It’s immediately clear that it’s a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Divide-Binary-Numbers">binary division</a> implementation. What wasn’t immediately clear is how to make the change I wanted. I put the question to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64544654/can-anyone-figure-out-how-to-extend-this-software-divide-routine-to-have-a-16-bi/64549557#64549557">stack overflow</a>, and on the face of it, it looked like a dumb question, i.e. just double the integer type sizes, <em>stupid</em>. predictably I got punished with a bunch of down-votes.</p>



<p>Yes we can do that, but it’s not what I want to do to the assembly routine that I’m trying to modify, so perhaps I didn’t quite ask the question as well as I could have done. The answer provided sent me in the right direction, in that the working accumulator needs to be larger, 24-bits in my case, and the 16-bit shift needs to be a 24-bit.</p>



<pre><code>uint16_t mcs48_div16(uint16_t dividend, uint8_t divisor, uint8_t *remainder)
{
    uint32_t accumulator = dividend;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) // One pass for each bit of result
    {
        uint8_t msb;
        uint8_t bit24_was_set = 0;

        if (accumulator &amp; 0x800000)
            bit24_was_set = 1; // Note if this was set,
                               // can't check if after shift.

        accumulator &lt;&lt;= 1; // Next bit
        accumulator &amp;= 0xFFFFFF; // Simulate 24 bit type

        msb = (accumulator &gt;&gt; 16);
        if (msb &gt;= divisor || bit24_was_set)
        {
            // Subtract remainder from MSB,
            // preserve and increment quotient
            accumulator = (((msb - divisor) &lt;&lt; 16) | (accumulator &amp; 0xFFFF)) + 1;
        }
    }

mcs48_div_ext_exit:
    *remainder = (accumulator &gt;&gt; 16);
    return (accumulator &amp; 0xFFFF);
}</code></pre>



<p>Above is the pseudo code of my routine after the changes. In the final implementation registers A, R1 and R2 hold the 24-bit accumulator, so this doesn’t translate too well to C because there isn’t a 24-bit integer type.</p>



<p>The final changes to the routine can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/inaxeon/mcs48temp/compare/e006467..a531d32">here</a>.</p>



<p>Ah, that’s better.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The other day, I was watching Bryan Cantrill’s 2018 talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZ1pCpJUIM">Rust, and Other Interesting Things</a>, and he made an offhanded comment while discussing values of different programming languages and communities. He said, “If you get the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html">awk programming language manual</a>…you’ll read it in about two hours and then you’re done. That’s it. You know all of awk.”</p>

<p>Only two hours to learn an entire language?! …. Challenge accepted!</p>

<p>I had previously used snippets of awk here and there. Most of them were given to me by Stack Overflow answers when googling for niche data file manipulations. But, I did not know enough to successfully write an awk program from scratch. I definitely did not have a real grasp on the language nor its power. And, a couple of hours sounded like a relatively small time investment to learn what Bryan Cantrill said was a language he used three times a day.</p>

<p>It turns out it takes more than two hours to learn awk, and I am by no means an expert… yet (growth mindset!). But, I now know enough to write a little about the essentials. Here goes!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-awk-useful-for">What is awk useful for?</h3>

<p>Awk is useful for data file manipulation. Already, having used it for a few days only, I wish I had invested time in learning it earlier. My usual workflow when encountering a data file is to import it into Google Sheets and use their builtin functions. If those weren’t enough, I would write little code snippets to somewhat awk..wardly get the information I want. Awk is way more powerful than what I was doing before. Let’s take a look:</p>

<h3 id="running-awk-programs">Running awk programs</h3>

<p>If we’re going to learn awk, we need to know how to run an awk program. The syntax to run an awk program in a shell is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'awk_program_contents'</span> data-file-1 data-file-2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can also write a longer awk program to run instead of writing the awk code inline. We could write a file with awk codeand then pass inline to awk with <code>-f &lt;awk-program-filename&gt;</code></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-f</span> awk-program.awk data-file-1 data-file-2
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="awk-program-contents">awk program contents</h3>

<p>Well, what is an awk program? We know it is best used for simple data reformatting or manipulation. The way it does this is by performing different actions on different patterns within a data file. The basic syntax of an awk program depends on these pattern and actions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pattern <span>{</span> action <span>}</span>
pattern <span>{</span> action <span>}</span>
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can give as many <code>pattern { action }</code> pairs as we want. Each pair will be executed independently of the others. This means if a line matches more than one pattern, it will have more than one corresponding action. In the example above we use newlines to separate distinct pairs. Similar to bash, we can also use <code>;</code> to separate commands and put everything on one line: <code>pattern { action }; pattern { action }</code></p>

<h3 id="awk-with-data-files">awk with data files</h3>

<p>But, it turns out awk is much more useful (and fun!) with a data file. The UN has a few <a href="https://data.un.org/">publicly available datasets</a>. I picked <a href="https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_309_201906_Education.csv">this one</a> on education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels to delve into first.</p>

<p>Let’s start by using awk to get a sense of what the data looks like.  <code>NR</code> is a predefined variable which records the number of rows read in a file so far. We can use it to look at the first few lines of a program. In this case, our pattern will be <code>NR &lt;= 5</code>, and by not including an action, the implied action will be <code>print</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5'</span> education.csv
T07,<span>"Enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education levels"</span>,,,,,
Region/Country/Area,,Year,Series,Value,Footnotes,Source
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Students enrolled <span>in </span>primary education <span>(</span>thousands<span>)</span>,<span>"678,991.6070"</span>,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Gross enrollement ratio - Primary <span>(</span>male<span>)</span>,104.9360,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Gross enrollment ratio - Primary <span>(</span>female<span>)</span>,99.9214,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Okay, so looks like this is giving us a bit of information about our file. Notably:</p>
<ol>
  <li>There are two header rows: a title row, and a row telling us what the fields are</li>
  <li>The file is comma separated</li>
  <li>… except there are sometimes commas within double quoted strings: <code>"Total, all countries or areas"</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s address these one by one!</p>



<p>We can ignore the first two header rows by using our nifty <code>NR</code> moving forward. We can pattern match that <code>NR &gt; 2</code>. Note: awk is 1-indexed.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &gt; 2'</span> education.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="field-separators">Field Separators</h3>

<p>awk’s <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Default-Field-Splitting">default field separator</a> is a space. We can actually see this by printing the first field. To access the value of a field, we use <code>$&lt;field_index&gt;</code>. So <code>$1</code> is the first field, <code>$2</code> the second, and so on. <code>$0</code> refers to the entire row.</p>

<p>If we try this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $1 }'</span> education.csv
T07,<span>"Enrolment
Region/Country/Area,,Year,Series,Value,Footnotes,Source
1,"</span>Total,
1,<span>"Total,
1,"</span>Total,
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>we can confirm that we’re splitting on spaces. awk has the option to specify a different field separator with the <code>-F 'separator'</code> flag:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span> <span>','</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $1 }'</span> education.csv
T07
Region/Country/Area
1
1
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great! But…. we had commas embedded within strings with double quotes. Sure enough, if we print the second field (<code>$2</code>), we see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span> <span>','</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $2 }'</span> education.csv
<span>"Enrolment in primary

"</span>Total
<span>"Total
"</span>Total
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hmmm. What we want here is to split fields by <em>content</em>. Which awk does not have, but gawk (GNU awk) does: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Splitting-By-Content">FPAT</a>! From the gawk manual: “All properly written awk programs should work with gawk. So most of the time, we don’t distinguish between gawk and other awk implementations.”</p>

<p>Sounds like we can use gawk here instead then. Let’s try pattern matching. I’m not going to go into regex here, but the pattern we want, defined by <code>"[^,]*|\"[^\"]+\""</code> is anything that either starts with a non-comma character, or starts with a double quote, contains only non-quote characters, and ends with a double quote:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gawk <span>'BEGIN { FPAT = "[^,]*|\"[^\"]+\"" } NR &lt;= 5 { print $2 }'</span> education.csv
<span>"Enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education levels"</span>

<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I snuck a <code>BEGIN</code> in there without explaining it. Let’s go on a brief tangent…</p>

<h3 id="begin--tangent-">BEGIN { tangent }</h3>

<p>Beyond the pattern and actions, awk also has a concept of <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> blocks. The <code>BEGIN</code> is executed before any of the data is processed. It can be useful for declaring variables or printing text to appear at the beginning. Analogously, the <code>END</code> is executed after the data is processed. It can be useful for performing manipulations on aggregates of the data, like averaging a sum.</p>

<p>This means if we wanted to write a little “Hello, awk!” program, we could do it without even needing a data file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'BEGIN { print "Hello, awk!" }'</span>
Hello, <span>awk</span><span>!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="end--tangent-">END { tangent }</h3>

<p>…back to our example. In our case, we used a <code>BEGIN</code> block to declare the <code>FPAT</code> <em>before</em> reading our data file.</p>

<p>But, we’ve only looked at the first 5 lines. For all we know, the rest of the file could look completely different. Let’s use <code>NR</code> again to see some more of the file. First, let’s figure out how long the file is. We can use the <code>END</code> block here. After we’ve parsed the whole file, we can see what the value of <code>NR</code> is, and that’ll tell us how many lines it is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'END { print NR }'</span> education.csv
8630
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, so maybe if we print every 500 lines, we’ll get a sense of what data we’re looking at. We can set our pattern to be only if <code>NR</code> is a multiple of <code>500</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR % 500 == 0'</span> education.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… and I’m going to leave this blog post on a real cliff hanger. Mostly because it already feels too long! There’s <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/awk-part-2">a second post</a> about awk actually looking at the data and manipulating it to figure out which countries have stark differences in number of males and females that they educate.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-or-tlskimmed-far-enough-to-get-here-please-give-me-the-shorter-version">TL;DR or TL;Skimmed far enough to get here, please give me the shorter version:</h3>
<p>To rehash what we’ve learned about awk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>awk is run using <code>awk 'awk_program' data-file</code></li>
  <li>awk programs have the form <code>pattern { action }; pattern { action };</code></li>
  <li><code>BEGIN</code> blocks are executed before reading data files</li>
  <li><code>END</code> blocks are executed after reading data files</li>
  <li><code>NR</code> is a variable that tells us the number of rows read</li>
  <li><code>-F '&lt;separator&gt;'</code> is how we can define a field separator for a file</li>
  <li>Space is the default field separator</li>
  <li><code>FPAT="..."</code> is a way to use regex to define a pattern for each field</li>
  <li><code>FPAT</code> is only defined in gawk</li>
</ul>

<article>
    <p>I’ve just watched the talk «Nailing Your First Launch» (MicroConf Starter 2018) by Adam Wathan and I
took notes that I’d like to share and re-visit them in the future. Some of them are just text from his screens, some thoughts are mine.</p>
<p>But don’t let me steal the video from you by providing a digested summary.
In my humble opinion, the main idea of watching talks or reading something is to change your mind
model of seeing this topic.
Don’t hesitate and start watching the video before proceeding to notes.
The notes are here just to come back from time to time and re-call some especially useful highlights.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajrDxZRpP9M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajrDxZRpP9M</a></p>
<hr>

<h3 id="one-time-purchase-products-are-way-easier-to-sell">One-time purchase products are way easier to sell</h3>
<ul>
<li>Harder to convince people that for $9 dollars per month they’d have value.</li>
<li>But it’s a very frequent case when people buy $100 courses and don’t even watch them.</li>
<li>One-time payments are much easier to go away with.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="they-can-be-done">They can be “done”</h3>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to maintain them forever.</li>
<li>A course can be finished. A book can be finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="you-can-put-one-together-in-3-months-of-nights-and-weekends">You can put one together in 3 months of nights and weekends</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easier to plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="they-put-money-in-the-bank-fast-then-drop-off-opposite-to-saas">They put money in the bank fast then drop off (opposite to SAAS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>One-time projects do have a more clear cliff of death, but they produce more money than saas during
launch days.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="building-an-audience">Building an audience</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having a big audience can compensate for almost any mistake made in marketing/sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huge audience + bad sales plan produces way more profit than no audience + good sales plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce blog posts, tutorials, podcasts, screencasts, interview people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should be worth following (provide a value for your audience)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help people where they already are (Wes Bos)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specific tactics for tech guys: tweet your hacks (like some tricks with css) that save you time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="picking-the-right-idea">Picking the right idea</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have an idea
<ul>
<li>what are you already putting out there that peoeple seem excited about?</li>
<li>what are you excited about that you think others will get excited about?</li>
<li>what do people think you’re better at than they are?</li>
<li>what have you learned outside your community would benefit from?</li>
<li>what did you have to figure out yourself but was really helpful to learn?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test it
<ul>
<li>
<p>«First thing to do is to put a landing page and start emailing.»</p>
<p>It’s not a bad way, but it’s not the first thing that you should do.
Especially it doesn’t work if you have no audience. People wouldn’t trust you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Collect feedback from tweets, have a catalog of them. Can be used later for your landing/sales pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="define-the-product">Define the product</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan small, it will end up bigger than you think anyway
<ul>
<li>Don’t worry about size. A short book is still a book.</li>
<li>3 hours of a video course is plenty.</li>
<li>Actually, not everyone is looking for a full knowledge base on a specific topic and read
500 pages on that. Collection of great ideas (like tweets) on that specific topic works
too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, courses are easier to sell at higher prices because people expect products such as
books to be in a specific cost range, even if they understand that it brings a high value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="landing-page">Landing page</h3>
<p>The goal is to collect e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>Example of Adam’s landing page can be seen on 19:33 - 22:25</p>
<ul>
<li>Promise something in advance (sign up for free screencasts and a big discount)</li>
<li>You can put your catalog of feedback on your landing page to earn more trust.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pre-sell">Pre-sell</h3>
<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Best form of product validation</li>
<li>You’ll make more money</li>
<li>More motivation to finish</li>
<li>Can buy you the time to focus on the product</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Selling multiple tiers is trickier</li>
<li>Can’t easily change scope</li>
<li>Like taking on debt, can be extremely stressful. People paid you 50k$ and you have to return
it as the value in N months. (impostor syndrome?)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-your-email-list">Building Your Email List</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always tell your audience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Announce the announcement — «about to announce the next big project I’m working on; if you check
it out and are excited about it, I’d love any help spreading the word!»</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Share progress. Send an update every week or so.</li>
<li>Repurpose content (Take a chapter from a book, make it a blog post and share it)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-it-finished">Getting it finished</h3>
<p>A few strategies to finally finish it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make promises («this week I’m going to deliver a screencast»)</li>
<li>Email on a schedule</li>
<li>Reduce scope. (the project/book gets bigger and bigger, the best way to cross the finish line</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="figuring-pricing">Figuring pricing</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s hard to sell tiers during pre-sales.</li>
<li>Sell pre-orders with top tier price.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="single-tier">Single tier</h4>
<ul>

<p>I recently created a tool for a client to export some data from a Kafka topic and after waiting about 10 minutes for it to export, the program returned a rather bizarre error:</p>

<pre><code>kafka: error while consuming telemetry/0: kafka server: Message contents does not match its CRC.

</code></pre>

<p>Intuition gave me a bad feeling about that error, but I was not prepared for what was going to come next. I decide to look up the error quickly and the error indicated that the CRC calculated by the consumer was not matching the message header. Huh, what was going on here?</p>

<p>Before I dive into this article, it’s helpful to learn a little bit about the software that was being run when we started running into this problem. We had 3 VMs on an Azure cluster that were running FreeBSD. The producers were using <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/sarama">https://github.com/Shopify/sarama</a> and the consumers were using <a href="https://github.com/bsm/sarama-cluster">https://github.com/bsm/sarama-cluster</a></p>

<p>What’s also interesting is, no matter how many machines we might have had in the cluster (if they were all FreeBSD), we most likely would have experienced failure across the board. This wasn’t really great since the entire point of replicating the cluster across N machines was to prevent complete system failure. In this case, it really wouldn’t have helped us. A tear falls down my cheek for failed distributed programming promises.</p>

<p>A little bit after my export tool ran, I got a ping on Slack that one of the services that uses this Kafka topic was no longer working. I check the logs of that service, and sure enough, the same error:</p>

<pre><code>kafka: error while consuming topic/0: kafka server: Message contents does not match its CRC.

</code></pre>

<p>Because this was a live running service, my first thought was to use the power of Kafka to shift the offset by 1 for this particular consumer so we can skip this corrupt message and get everything running again quickly.</p>

<p><code>kafka-consumer-groups.sh</code> is a command line tool that let’s you do exactly this, except it doesn’t work on <code>kafka-0.10.2</code>. That was a little bit of a surprise to me, I assumed one of the coolest things about Kafka is that you can pick an offset to consume from. The libraries we were using also had no way to manually select an offset to start from.</p>

<p>Okay, crap, so I need to upgrade Kafka to shift the offsets. This is a good opportunity to get on <code>1.0.0</code> anyway and perhaps restarting the services will actually fix the problem. I update my Ansible scripts for <code>kafka 1.0.1</code> and start reading the upgrade guide for a live running environment: <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade">https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade</a>.</p>

<p>Great, we’re on <code>1.0.1</code>, but the problem still exists. I have the ability to move the offet over, so I shift the offset by 1.</p>

<pre><code>./kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --group "api-consumer-group" --topic "telemetry:0" --reset-offsets --shift-by 1 --execute
</code></pre>

<p>I restart the service and the error comes up again. Darn. So it’s not only one message that is corrupt, it’s a range, that’s not great. I decided to commit to this strategy because this service needed to be up and running for a live demo in the coming week.</p>

<p>So instead, my idea was to shift the offset by a larger number until I find a number that actually works. Once I find a number that works, I can do a manual binary search to find the exact offset where the corruption started and shift it by 1.</p>

<p>After doing a manual binary search, I have found that the corrupted records are between <code>23769420-23772231</code> inclusive and corrupted, so good messages begin at <code>23772232</code> so 2811 corrupted messages. I run <code>./kafka-consumer-groups.sh</code> again, but this time I specify the exact offset to start from instead of using <code>shift-by</code></p>

<p>I restart the service again, and it works! Great, let’s hope this monkey patch works until the live demo. Nope, the next day, the same message appears again.</p>

<p>At this point, I’ve had my fair share of complicated problems, and I have a deep gut instinct that it’s most likely not the code we’ve written because the problem started to appear on multiple other topics in the cluster and the problem was produced by multiple independent services.</p>

<p>Of course, the book Pragmatic Programmer still pops up in my head:</p>

<p><em>“select” Isn’t Broken</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I focus on starting from the application and then working outwards, I upgrade our libraries used in our code. I upgrade Sarama to <code>1.6.0</code> and I upgrade <code>sarama-cluster</code> to <code>master</code>. I run our deployment scripts and everything is running again.</p>

<p>I do the ridiculous offset binary-search trick again to shift everything and sure enough the issue comes up again with our Kafka libraries upgraded to the latest version. I decide to look at the logs of the broker themslelves and this is what I see;</p>

<pre><code>[2018-03-17 20:11:58,551] ERROR [ReplicaFetcher replicaId=1, leaderId=3, fetcherId=0] Error for partition telemetry-0 to broker 3:org.apache.kafka.common.errors.CorruptRecordException: This message has failed its CRC checksum, exceeds the valid size, or is otherwise corrupt. (kafka.server.ReplicaFetcherThread)
[2018-03-17 20:11:58,747] ERROR [ReplicaFetcher replicaId=1, leaderId=2, fetcherId=0] Error for partition topic-2 to broker 2:org.apache.kafka.common.errors.CorruptRecordException: This message has failed its CRC checksum, exceeds the valid size, or is otherwise corrupt. (kafka.server.ReplicaFetcherThread)
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at that error message, it appears that the replica thread inside of Kafka is running into exactly the same problem as our consumers. Uh oh, at this point I know it’s definitely not our application code, so much for that Pragmatic Programmer tip, gut instinct all the way!</p>

<p>There is a Kafka tool to let’s you see deeper into the health of your cluster <code>./kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --describe</code>. Here’s the output:</p>

<pre><code>Topic:telemetry PartitionCount:6 ReplicationFactor:3 Configs:
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 0 Leader: 2 Replicas: 2,1,3 Isr: 2
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 1 Leader: 3 Replicas: 3,2,1 Isr: 3
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 2 Leader: 1 Replicas: 1,3,2 Isr: 1
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 3 Leader: 2 Replicas: 2,3,1 Isr: 2
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 4 Leader: 3 Replicas: 3,1,2 Isr: 3
 Topic: telemetry Partition: 5 Leader: 1 Replicas: 1,2,3 Isr: 1
</code></pre>

<p>If you look at the <code>Isr</code> column, it stands for <code>In-Sync</code> replica. It appears that this cluster is not healthy because only the leader broker is in sync while all the other brokers cannot replicate that partition. Our goal here is to get that <code>Isr</code> column back to <code>1,2,3</code>.</p>

<p>So at this point, here are the options:</p>

<ul>
<li>- Hardware failure, such as disk failure, or network connectivity issues.</li>
<li>- The cluster is misbehaving because of resource allocation issues, perhaps it’s going OOM, or we’re out disk space.</li>
<li>- A bug with the Kafka version we were using</li>
<li>- An OpenJDK bug</li>
</ul>

<p>I decide to quickly look into our various servers to see if this is a resource allocation issue that is causing Kafka to misbehave. This was a red herring, one of the servers that was responsible for pushing to this topic actually filled its root partition and for a second I thought that might have been the issue, but that issue was fixed and the issue still remained.</p>

<p>The actual Kafka instances seemed to be fine, they were nowhere near capacity in terms of disk space, and the chances of having hardware failure across 3 machines was unlikely.</p>

<p>it gets a little confusing on what could be wrong and I start to realize that this is becoming a difficult problem and we have to get this live system working. I can’t just adjust things at random and hope that the problem is fixed. It’s time to dig deeper, it’s time to look at what Kafka is actually writing to disk.</p>

<h3 id="digging-deeper">Digging deeper</h3>

<p>Kafka writes the messages it receives into a log folder. The log folder contains a folder for each topic and partition combo. This is how it might look for this particular topic we’re having issues with:</p>

<p>The <code>.log</code> file is where the messages we push to Kafka are stored. We’re going to attempt to extract the offset that is corrupt to see what exactly is corrupt about it. If you’re curious on learning about the internals of Kafka, check out this article, it was a lot simpler than I thought: <a href="https://thehoard.blog/how-kafkas-storage-internals-work-3a29b02e026">https://thehoard.blog/how-kafkas-storage-internals-work-3a29b02e026</a></p>

<p>Kafka provides a tool, <code>kafka.tools.DumpLogSegments</code> that lets you dive into these log files and grab more details about individual records that are in the file. Hilariously enough, when I ran this tool, it bails right when it hits a corrupt message.</p>

                <p>Java <code>Thread</code> objects allow us to run our code in separate threads. When an application starts JVM creates the initial thread named <code>main</code>. The main method is run on the main thread. Inside the application we can create new threads to execute other tasks in parallel with the main thread.</p><p>Java uses native operating system threads. So one java thread is mapped by one OS thread.</p><h3 id="creating-threads">Creating Threads</h3><p>The constructor of the <code>Thread</code> class takes a <code>Runnable</code> object. Runnable interface has an abstract <code>run</code> method which is called by <code>Thread#start()</code> method. It object can be instantiated by a lambda, anonymous class or a class which implements Runnable method. </p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-29-at-20.03.52.png"></figure><p>Using lambdas are generally easier and more compact:</p><pre><code>Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
    // content of run command
});
thread.start();</code></pre><p>Thread lives as long as the its run hook method has not returned. The scheduler can suspend and run the Thread many times. For a thread to execute forever, it needs an infinite loop that prevents it from returning. </p><p><code>Join</code> method allows one thread to wait for the completion of another. This is a simple form of barrier synchronisation.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-29-at-20.19.19.png"></figure><h3 id="java-thread-types-user-and-daemon-threads">Java Thread Types: User and Daemon Threads</h3><p>When JVM start it contains a single User thread, named Main thread. The main difference between User and Daemon threads are what happens when they exit.</p><ul><li>A user thread continues its lifecycle even if the main thread exits.</li><li>However all Daemon threads terminates when all the user threads exits.</li><li>JVM itself exits when all the user threads has exited.</li></ul><p>Thread class contains boolean <code>daemon</code> field to specify whether the thread is daemon. It can be set at the time of creation by the constructor or by setter method.</p><pre><code>Thread thread = new Thread(getRunnable());
thread.setDaemon(true);
thread.start();</code></pre><p>By default daemon field is false, so most of the Threads that we generate is a User Thread. Threads copy the <code>isDaemon</code> status of the parent threat if it is not specified. Java uses Daemon thread in some places such as <code>ForkJoinPool</code> and <code>Timer</code>. To illustrate we can use the following example:</p><pre><code>public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
//        runDeamonThread();
        runUserThread();
        System.out.println(getCurrentThreadName() + " exits");
    }

    private static void runDeamonThread() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newWorkStealingPool(10);
        executorService.execute(getRunnable());
    }

    private static void runUserThread() {
        Thread thread = new Thread(getRunnable());
        thread.start();
    }

    private static Runnable getRunnable() {
        return () -&gt; {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 200; i++) {
                System.out.print(".");
                Thread.yield();
            }
            System.out.println(getCurrentThreadName() + " exits. isDeamon: " + isDaemon());
        };
    }

    private static boolean isDaemon() {
        return Thread.currentThread().isDaemon();
    }

    private static String getCurrentThreadName() {
        return Thread.currentThread().getName();
    }
}</code></pre><ul><li>When we invoke <code>runUserThread</code> method it show the following example output:</li></ul><pre><code>................................................
main exits
........................................................................................
Thread-0 exits. isDeamon: false</code></pre><ul><li>The second case is invoking the <code>runDeamonThread</code> which uses <code>ForkJoinPool</code> as an example of Daemon Threads. I could simply use <code>setDaemon(true)</code> method, but wanted to give an example usage. Output:</li></ul><pre><code>main exits</code></pre><p>So when the main method exits, all the user threads are terminated and JVM exits and kills all daemon threads, so that we did not even have a chance to see output from daemon threads.</p><h3 id="stopping-threads">Stopping Threads</h3><p>Compared to creating, stopping a thread is quite hard thing. Once thread starts running it diverges from the caller and it has it is own lifecycle anymore. It can either complete the task and exits or if it does a long running operation it can work forever. Java does not provides us a method (non-deprecated) to stop the thread voluntarily. </p><ol><li>A naive approach could be using a stop flag:</li></ol><pre><code>volatile boolean isStopped = false;

public void test() {
    new Thread(() -&gt; {
        while (!isStopped) {
            System.out.print(".");
        }
        System.out.println("Child Exits");
    }).start();

    try {
        Thread.sleep(100);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    isStopped = true;
    System.out.println("Main exits");
}</code></pre><p>Note that the flag is <code>volatile</code> in order to make its up-to-date value visible for both threads. However this approach fails if the thread is doing blocking operations such as <code>sleep</code>, <code>wait</code>, <code>join</code> or blocking I/O operations.</p><p>2. Another way to stop the tread is to use <code>interrupt()</code> method of the thread. </p><blockquote>An interrupt request to a thread is an indication that it should stop what it is doing and do something else. It is up to the programmer to decide exactly how a thread responds to an interrupt but it is very common for the tread to terminate.</blockquote><p>For the interrupt mechanism to work correctly, the interrupted thread must support its own interruption mechanism. There are 2 cases we can examine for interruption:</p><ul><li>Non Blocking and Long Running Tasks</li></ul><p>In this case calling the <code>thread.interrupt()</code> method will set the interrupt flag of the that thread but if the task itself does not check the status of the interrupted flag it will not have any impact. For example:</p><pre><code>public void test() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
        System.out.println("Child Starts");
        while (true) {
            System.out.print(".");
        }
    });

    thread.start();
    thread.interrupt();
    
    thread.join();
    System.out.println("Main exits");
}</code></pre><p>In order for the thread to catch the interrupt, it should iteratively check the status of the interrupt flag so that it can understand if there are any pending interruption request and handle the request accordingly. </p><p>So we can check the flag in our while loop in if it is true we can return or break the loop. In the lambda expression it is not possible to throw an exception but in appropriate places we can throw <code>InterruptedException</code> as well.</p><pre><code>public void test() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
        System.out.println("Child Starts");
        while (true) {
            if (Thread.interrupted()) {
                break;
            }
            System.out.print(".");
        }
        System.out.println("Child exits");
    });

    thread.start();
    thread.interrupt();

    thread.join();
    System.out.println("Main exits");
}</code></pre><p>Note the <code>Thread.interrupted()</code> method returns the value of the flag and clears it if it has been true. So if we want to keep the state of the Thread as interrupted for the upper level of stack, we can set it back with <code>Thread.currentThread().interrupt();</code> </p><ul><li>Blocking Tasks</li></ul><p>If a thread frequently calls the blocking methods such as <code>wait</code>, <code>join</code>, <code>sleep</code>, <code>blocking I/O</code> which are all run interruptively, these methods internally check if they have been interrupted and if so they automatically throw <code>InterruptedException</code>. This exception should be caught and handled in the appropriate context. The following example uses the interruption to break the loop in a blocking <code>sleep</code> operation:</p><pre><code>public void test() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {
        System.out.println("Child Starts");
        try {
            while (true) {
                Thread.sleep(10000);
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        System.out.println("Child Exits");
    });

    thread.start();
    thread.interrupt();

    thread.join();
    System.out.println("Main exits");
}</code></pre><p>There are patterns for dealing with Java <code>InterruptedException</code>:</p><ul><li>One approach is propagating the exception to the callers, so higher layer would be responsible.</li><li>Before re-throwing, we can do task specific clean up.</li><li>If it is not possible to re-throw, we can set the interrupted status to true again with <code>Thread.currentThread().interrupt()</code> to preserve the evidence if the higher layers want to check it.</li></ul><p>So as a conclusion if we want to implement cancellable tasks we need to periodically check the status of the interrupt status and handle the interruption in a way that thread will exit.</p><h3 id="thread-groups">Thread Groups</h3><p>In order to simplify thread management, multiple threads &nbsp;can be organised with <code>java.lang.ThreadGroup</code> objects that group related threads. Each Thread Group needs to have a parent group. In the hierarchy, there is the <code>Main</code> group which is the parent of the other groups or threads we create in the program. We can create <code>ThreadGroup</code> by calling its constructor with a parent group and/or name. To add the Threads in a group we need to specify the group in the Thread's constructor.</p><pre><code>public void test() {
    ThreadGroup tg1 = new ThreadGroup("Thread-group-1");
    ThreadGroup tg2 = new ThreadGroup(tg1, "Thread-group-2");

    Thread thread1 = new Thread(tg1,"thread-1");
    Thread thread2 = new Thread(tg2,"thread-2");
    Thread thread3 = new Thread(tg2,"thread-3");

    thread1.start();
    thread2.start();
    thread3.start();
    
    Thread[] threads = new Thread[tg2.activeCount()];
    tg2.enumerate(threads);

    Arrays.asList(threads).forEach(t -&gt; System.out.println(t.getName()));
    tg1.list();
}</code></pre><p>We can iterate over the threads by calling the <code>enumerate</code> method, which fills the given array with the thread references of the group.</p><p>We can implement a Thread Pool by making use of Thread Groups:</p><pre><code>public class ThreadPool {
    // Create a thread group field
    private final ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("ThreadPoolGroup");
    // Create a LinkedList field containing Runnable
    private final List&lt;Runnable&gt; tasks = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();

    public ThreadPool(int poolSize) {
   …</code></pre></div></div>

October 30, 2020 | https://antmedia.io/cmaf-is-available-in-ant-media-server-v2-2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://antmedia.io/cmaf-is-available-in-ant-media-server-v2-2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We’re happy to announce that Ant Media Server v2.2 is out with CMAF support. Before giving more highlights for the new version, just let us thank all you guys out there that make Ant Media Server become a worldwide product in 121 countries. It’s great to help lots of people around the world for their video streaming projects. After this introduction, let me give the highlights for the v2.2.</p>
<h2>Low Latency (CMAF) vs. Ultra Low Latency (WebRTC)</h2>
<p>Ant Media Server right now supports both LL(CMAF) and ULL(WebRTC). Here is the some basic information about these technologies. CMAF provides low latency(3-5 secs) in live streaming, on the other hand WebRTC provides Ultra Low Latency(0.5 secs) in live streaming. Then which one is good for your streaming project, CMAF or WebRTC?</p>
<h4>Which one to use?</h4>
<p>Both technologies have advantages and disadvantages. You can pick the correct one according to your use case.&nbsp; CMAF is good if there is no interactivity between broadcasters and viewers. It’s easier to scale with CMAF with CDNs.&nbsp; It’s not much affected by instant network fluctuations because latency is about 3-5 seconds. On the other hand,&nbsp; it’s good to use WebRTC if there is interactivity between broadcasters and viewers. You need to manage the edge WebRTC servers to scale.&nbsp; It’s affected by instant network fluctuations(jitter, congestion) because it’s about 0.5 secs latency.</p>
<div id="attachment_34297"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34297" src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chunked-encoding-slide-CMAF.png" alt="CMAF" width="626" height="347" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chunked-encoding-slide-CMAF.png 626w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chunked-encoding-slide-CMAF-300x166.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chunked-encoding-slide-CMAF-600x333.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" title="Adventure Continues: CMAF is available in Ant Media Server v2.2 1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-34297">CMAF</p></div><h4>How to use CMAF?</h4>
<p>Firstly, you need to enable it on your application’s configuration file. Let’s assume that you’ve already running Ant Media Server v.2.2 Enterprise on your server then we’re going to use WebRTCAppEE for CMAF streaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the following file with your favorite editor <pre>/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/WebRTCAppEE/WEB-INF/red5-web.properties</pre> </li>
<li>Enable DASH by adding following property to the file above <pre>settings.dashMuxingEnabled=true</pre> </li>
<li>Restart the Ant Media Server <pre>sudo service antmedia restart</pre> </li>
<li>Send WebRTC stream to Ant Media Server on WebRTC publisher page. Let’s assume your stream id is “stream1” <pre>https://YOUR_DOMAIN:5443/WebRTCAppEE</pre> </li>
<li>Play the stream with CMAF on the following url <pre>https://YOUR_DOMAIN:5443/WebRTCAppEE/play.html?id=stream1&amp;playOrder=dash</pre> </li>
</ul>
<p>Measure the latency. You’ll see something between 3-5 secs. Let us give further configuration parameters for DASH muxing.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>settings.dashSegDuration </em>: Duration of segments in DASH. Default value is 2</li>
<li><em>settings.dashFragmentDuration </em>: Duration of fragments. Default value is 0.5</li>
<li><em>settings.dashTargetLatency </em>: Target latency for measurement. Default value is 3.5.</li>
<li><em>settings.dashWindowSize </em>:&nbsp; DASH window size. Number of files in manifest. Default value is 5</li>
<li><em>settings.dashExtraWindowSize </em>: DASH extra window size. Number of segments kept outside of the manifest before removing from disk. Default value is 5</li>
<li><em>settings.deleteDASHFilesOnEnded </em>: Delete DASH files after streaming is ended.&nbsp; Default value is true</li>
</ul>
<h2>Kubernetes Support</h2>
<p>We’ve been getting requests for supporting Kubernetes(K8s) from our users for a while. So that we’ve decided to support Kubernetes in Ant Media Server. We’ve added extra parameters to start the server in the container.</p>
<div id="attachment_34272"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34272" src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kubernetes.png" alt="Adventure Continues: CMAF is available in Ant Media Server v2.2 1" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kubernetes.png 600w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kubernetes-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Adventure Continues: CMAF is available in Ant Media Server v2.2 2"></p><p id="caption-attachment-34272">Kubernetes is supported in Ant Media Server</p></div><p>Moreover, we’ve prepared the documentation for the Kubernetes. All kubernetes files(service, deployment) and dockerFile are available <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Ant-Media-Server-Kubernetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the documentation.</a> The critical thing for running Ant Media Server is that deployment uses hostNetwork which means that you can use one Ant Media Server pod in a node.</p>
<h2>Long live the new King: Java 11</h2>
<p>We don’t mean the “The king is dead” because Java 8 is still the most used Java version. On the other hand, for compatibility with tools and improvements in Java 11, we’ve migrated to Java 11 in Ant Media Server. In addition, we’ve monitored some performance improvements on Java 11. We plan to provide more performance metrics for this release later.&nbsp; All install scripts and docker files are updated to use Java 11.</p>
<div id="attachment_34273"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34273" src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/java_11.png" alt="Java 11 is supported in Ant Media Server" width="400" height="225" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/java_11.png 400w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/java_11-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" title="Adventure Continues: CMAF is available in Ant Media Server v2.2 3"></p><p id="caption-attachment-34273">Ant Media Server v2.2 is running in Java 11</p></div><h2>Apache Portable Runtime(APR) and HTTP/2</h2>
<p>We’ve updated Tomcat version to 8.5.58 and compiled native Apache Portable Runtime libraries for improving the performance. <span>Tomcat can use the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://apr.apache.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Apache Portable Runtime</a><span> to provide superior scalability, performance, and better integration with native server technologies.

<![CDATA[For Complex Applications, Rust Is as Productive as Kotlin]]>

October 30, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rust-as-productive-as-kotlin/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rust-as-productive-as-kotlin/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>In this article, we will compare one apple (IntelliJ Rust) to one orange (rust-analyzer) to reach general and sweeping conclusions.
Specifically, I want to present a case study supporting the following claim:</p>
<p>For complex applications, Rust is as productive as Kotlin.</p>
<p>For me, this is an unusual claim to argue: I always thought exactly the opposite, but I am not so sure now.
I came to Rust from C++.
I was of the opinion that this is a brilliant low-level language and always felt puzzled at people writing higher-level things in Rust.
Clearly, choosing Rust means taking a productivity hit, and using Kotlin, C# or Go just makes much more sense if you can afford GC.
My <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">list of Rust criticisms</a> starts with this objection.</p>
<p>What moved my position in the other direction was my experience as the lead developer of rust-analyzer and IntelliJ Rust.
Let me introduce the two projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust"><strong>IntelliJ Rust</strong></a> is the plugin for IntelliJ Platform, providing Rust support.
In effect, it is a Rust compiler front-end, written in Kotlin and making use of language-support features of the platform.
These features include lossless syntax trees, a parser generator, persistence and indexing infrastructure, among others.
Nonetheless, as programming languages differ lot, the bulk of logic for analyzing Rust is implemented in the plugin itself.
Presentational features like completion list come from the platform, but most of the language semantics is hand-written.
IntelliJ Rust also includes a bit of a Swing GUI.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer"><strong>rust-analyzer</strong></a> is an implementation of
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> for Rust.
It is a Rust compiler front-end written from scratch with an eye towards IDE support.
It makes heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">salsa</a> library for incremental computations.
Beyond the compiler itself, rust-analyzer includes code for managing long-lived multithreaded process of the language server itself.</p>
<p>The projects are essentially equivalent in scope — rust compiler front-ends suitable for IDEs.
The two biggest differences are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IntelliJ Rust is a plugin, so it can re-use code and design patterns of the surrounding platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rust-analyzer is the second system, so it leverages experience of IntelliJ Rust for a from-scratch design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The internal architecture of the two projects also differs a lot.
In terms of <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">Three Architectures</a>, IntelliJ Rust is map-reduce, and rust-analyzer is query-based.</p>
<p>Writing an IDE-ready compiler is a high-level task.
You don’t need to talk to the operating system directly.
There are some fancy data structures and concurrency here and there, but they are also high-level.
It’s not about implementing crazy lock-free schemes, it’s about maintaining application state and sanity in the multithreaded world.
The bulk of the compiler is symbolic manipulation, arguably best suited for lisp.
Picking a VM-based language for such task (for example, OCaml), doesn’t have any intrinsic downsides.</p>
<p>At the same time, the task is pretty complex and unique.
The ratio of “your code” vs “framework code” when implementing features is much higher than in a typical CRUD backend.</p>
<p>Now that the projects are introduced, lets take two roughly equivalent slices of history.</p>

<p>Both are about 2 years old, with 1-1.5 developers working full time and vibrant and thriving community of open-source contributors.
There are 52k lines of Kotlin and 66k lines of Rust.</p>
<p>Both delivered roughly equivalent feature sets at that time.
To be honest, I still don’t really believe this :)
rust-analyzer started from zero, it didn’t have a decade worth of Java classes to bootstrap from, and the productivity drop between Kotlin and Rust is supposed to be huge.
But it’s hard to argue with reality.
Instead, let me try to reflect on my experience building both, and to try to explain Rust’s surprising productivity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_learning_curve">Learning Curve</h2>
<div>
<p>It’s easy to characterize Kotlin’s learning curve — it is nearly zero.
I’ve started IntelliJ Rust without Kotlin experience and never felt that I need to specifically learn Kotlin.</p>
<p>When I switched to rust-analyzer, I was pretty experienced with Rust.
I would say that one definitely needs to deliberately learn Rust, it’s hard to pick it up on the go.
Ownership and aliasing control are novel concepts (even if you come from C++), and taking holistic approach to learning them pays off.
After the initial learning step the ride is generally smooth.</p>
<p>By the way, this is the perfect place to plug our Rust courses and tailor-made <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/">trainings</a> :-)
The next <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/#package-intro-training">introduction to Rust</a> is happening this December!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_modularity">Modularity</h2>
<div>
<p>This I think is the biggest factor.
Both projects are moderately large in terms of scope as well as in terms of amount of source code.
I believe that the only way to ship big things is to split them in independent-ish chunks and implement the chunks separately.</p>
<p>I also find most of the languages I am familiar with to be pretty horrible with respect to modularity.
More generally, I am amused with FP vs OO debate, as it seems that “why no one does modules right?” is a more salient issue.</p>
<p>Rust is one of the few languages which has first-class concept of libraries.
Rust code is organized on two levels:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>as a tree of inter-dependent modules inside a crate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and as a directed acyclic graph of crates</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Cyclic dependencies are allowed between the modules, but not between the crates.
Crates are units of reuse and privacy: only crate’s public API matters, and it is crystal clear what crate’s public API is.
Moreover, crates are anonymous, so you don’t get name conflicts and dependency hell when mixing several versions of the same crate in a single crate graph.</p>
<p>This makes it very easy to make two pieces of code <strong>not</strong> depend on each other (non-dependencies are the essence of modularity): just put them in separate crates.
During code review, only changes to Cargo.tomls need to be monitored carefully.</p>
<p>At the time of comparison, rust-analyzer is split into 23 internal crates, with a handful general-purposed ones released on crates.io.
In contrast, IntelliJ Rust is a single Kotlin module, where everything can depend on everything else.
Although internal organization of IntelliJ Rust is pretty clean, it’s not reflected in the file system layout and build system, and needs constant maintenance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_build_system">Build System</h2>
<div>
<p>Managing project’s build takes significant amount of times, and has multiplicative effect on everything else.</p>
<p>Rust’s build system, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a>, is very good.
It’s not perfect, but it is a breath of fresh air after Java’s <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>.</p>
<p>Cargo’s trick is that it doesn’t try to be a general purpose build system.
It can only build Rust projects, and it has rigid expectation about the project structure.
It’s impossible to opt out of the core assumptions.
Configuration is a static non-extensible TOML file.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gradle allows free-form project structure, and is configured via a Turing complete language.
I feel like I’ve spend more time learning Gradle than learning Rust!
Running <code>wc -w</code> gives 182_817 words for Rust book, and 280_506 for Gradle’s user guide.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cargo is just faster than Gradle in most cases.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest downside is that custom build logic is not expressible in Cargo.
Both projects needs substantial amount of logic beyond mere compilation to deliver the final result to the user.
For rust-analyzer, this is handled by hand-written Rust script, which works perfectly at this scale.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<div>
<p>Language-level support for libraries and top-notch build system/package manager allow for a thriving ecosystem.
rust-analyzer relies on third-party libraries much more than IntelliJ Rust.
Some parts of rust-analyzer are also published to crates.io for other projects to reuse.</p>
<p>Additionally, low-level nature of the Rust programming language often allows for “perfect” library interfaces.
Interfaces which exactly reflect the underlying problem, without imposing intermediate language-level abstractions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_basic_conveniences">Basic Conveniences</h2>
<div>
<p>I feel that Rust is significantly more productive when it comes to basic language nuts and bolts — structs, enums, functions, etc.
This is not specific to Rust — any ML-family language has them.
However, Rust is the first industrial language which wraps these features in a nice package, not constrained by backwards compatibility.
I want to list specific features which I think allow producing maintainable code faster in Rust</p>
<p><em>Emphasis on data over behavior</em>.
Aka, Rust is not an OOP language.
The core idea of OOP is that of dynamic dispatch — which code is invoked by a function call is decided at runtime (late binding).
This is a powerful pattern which allows for flexible and extensible system.
The problem is, extensibility is costly!
It’s better only to apply it in certain designated areas.
Designing for extensibility by default is not cost effective.
Rust puts static dispatch front and center: it is mostly clear whats going on by just reading the code, as it is independent of runtime types of the objects.</p>
<p>One small syntactic thing I enjoy about Rust is how it puts fields and methods into different blocks syntactically:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>first_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
  <span>last_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>full_name</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Being able to see at a glance all the fields makes understanding the code much simpler.
Fields convey much more information than methods.</p>
<p><em>Sum types</em>.
Rust’s humbly named enums are full algebraic data types.
This means that you can express the idea of disjoint union:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>),</span> <span>B</span><span>(</span><span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is hugely useful in day-to-day programming in the small, and some times during programming in the large as well.
To give one example, one of the core concepts for an IDE are references and definitions.
A definition a like <code>let foo = 92;</code> assigns a name to an entity which can be used down a line.
A reference like <code>foo + 90</code> <em>refers</em> to some definition.
When you ctrl-click on reference, you go to the definition.</p>

                                                  <div>
                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“We treated them for a month and the effect was quite amazing,” says Chen, explaining the drug was successful in reversing major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “We couldn’t tell the drug-treated disease models and the healthy models apart.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen, a Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher, is optimistic about the future of this research, however, there are many steps to be taken before this finding would lead to a clinical trial.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you are interested in finding out about clinical trials that are underway related to Alzheimer’s you can go to <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/research/participate/node/13200">Participate in Research</a>. There you’ll find a number of studies looking for participants including control subjects, people not living with a specific condition. </span></span></p>

                    </div><div><div> 
  
 <p><span><span>On October 25, a developer posted that the SM2 national secret algorithm was finally accepted by the Linux kernel community. </span><span>The author stated that the SM2 patch has been updated to version v7. This version of the patch was finally accepted by the community. It has been </span></span><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=Tianjia+Zhang"><span><span>merged into the 5.10-rc1 of the Linux mainline</span></span></a><span><span> . If nothing </span><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=Tianjia+Zhang"><span>else</span></a><span> , it will be officially released in the 5.10 kernel version.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>National Secret is the abbreviation of National Commercial Encryption. The National Encryption Administration Bureau formulates algorithm standards, and it also formulates a large number of product and interface specifications and application scenarios. </span><span>Since 2012, the State Cryptography Administration has successively published SM2/SM3/SM4 and other cryptographic algorithm standards and their application specifications in the form of the "People's Republic of China Password Industry Standards". </span><span>Among them, "SM" stands for "commercial secret", which is a cryptographic technology used for commercial use that does not involve state secrets.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>According to the author, the current Linux kernel has well supported the SM3 and SM4 algorithms, thanks to the widespread use of wireless LAN standards. </span><span>However, the SM2 algorithm and the national secret certificate have not been supported for a long time, and it is impossible to establish full-stack trust and integrity verification in the kernel based on the national secret. Therefore, it has become urgent to support this system in the kernel.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>It took 7 rounds for the kernel community to accept SM2. </span><span>The initial consideration was to migrate from openssl, but the openssl architecture and infrastructure code needed to be ported because of the huge workload. </span><span>After several rounds of discussion and testing, I found that the existing libgcrypt already has a complete elliptic curve basic algorithm, so I tried to implement SM2 in libgcrypt first, and finally the SM2 algorithm was accepted by the community as a sub-algorithm of ECC. </span><span>After that, SM2 was gradually accepted by the kernel community.</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>At present, libgcrypt has fully supported the national secret algorithm SM2/3/4, and these implementations will be officially released in the next version 1.9.0. </span><span>At the same time, as a user-mode tool for IMA integrity signatures, ima-evm-utils' support for national secrets has not fallen. </span><span>Click to view </span></span><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/ima-evm-utils/ci/ceecb28d3b5267c7d32c6e9401923c94f5786cfb/log/?path="><span><span>related submissions</span></span></a><span><span> .</span></span></p> 
 <p><span><span>Finally, the author also summarizes the known issues of SM2:</span></span></p> 
 <ul> 
  <li><span><span>To support national secret certificate verification, SM2 either does not compile, or it must be built-in compilation, and does not support compilation into modules. </span><span>Of course, SM2, as an asymmetric algorithm, only signs a hash or IMA verification based on national secrets, and there is no such limitation.</span></span></li> 
  <li><span><span>The IMA signature tool ima-evm-utils and the national secret algorithm used by the kernel to calculate the SM3 hash of the file do not add Za. This is a little difference from the specification.</span></span></li> 
 </ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>(Bloomberg) -- Carnival Fantasy was a ship famous for its outlandish dÃ©cor, all-night revelry and its sizeâ€”back when 2,000 was an incredible number of passengers. The â€œFun Shipâ€� vibe it introduced in 1990 came with such whimsical spaces as an Egyptian-themed piano bar, decorated with a fake sarcophagus, and a glitzy glass-topped atrium that was the hub of the social scene.</p><p>Today the Fantasy is attracting a whole different breed of booty-seeker. In July, the 30-year-old ship sailed to the Aegean Sea, wrapping its final voyageÂ&nbsp;in the shipbreaking capital of Aliaga, Turkey.</p><p>Its resting place there isÂ&nbsp;aÂ&nbsp;demolition yard where old cargo ships, tankers, research vesselsâ€”and now cruise ships retired during the Covid-19 pandemicâ€”get torn apart and broken into pieces. In this case, theyâ€™re not being broken in half to  get upgraded and stitched back together. Instead,Â&nbsp;circling the Fantasyâ€™s partially deconstructed innards are buyers from all sorts of industries, looking for rock bottom deals on everything from artwork and kitchenwares to electrical wires and stainless-steel sinks.</p><p>For the cruise company, itâ€™s an opportunity to recoup at least some value from an asset thatâ€™s currently acting as dead weight; while shipsâ€™ values  declineÂ&nbsp;with age, the Fantasy was originally built for about $225 million. And for the recycling companies that buy the vesselÂ&nbsp;for cash and take on the hazardous task of emptying all its valuables, itâ€™s a matter of a months-long salvage resale on steroids.</p><p>Cutting the Losses</p><p>Itâ€™s hard to gauge how exactly much money is made off of cruise ship recycling. Companies donâ€™t immediately disclose the sale prices of the vessels after relinquishing ownership, and the resale value of their most sought-after commodity, scrap steel, fluctuates in each global market on a daily basis.Â&nbsp;</p><p>But the business is booming.</p><p>Next to Carnival Fantasy in Aliaga are two otherÂ&nbsp;Fantasy-class ships built in the late 1990s. And next to them are two former Royal Caribbean vessels (scrapped by Royalâ€™s Spanish partner line Pullmantur Cruceros). The ships all had big fan bases, even as they aged. Fantasy and its sister ships started 2020 full of passengers bent on fun-in-the-sun activities in the Caribbean, Bahamas, and Mexican Riviera.</p><p>The ships would have left the fleet in coming years even in a healthy industry; the pandemic sped up the process, with owners of idled vesselsÂ&nbsp;hemorrhaging cashÂ&nbsp;and looking to cut their losses.</p><p>In its third quarter filing, Carnival Corporation said it planned to sell 18 â€œless efficientâ€� ships in 2020, resulting in a 12% reduction of its nine-brand fleet. â€œThose ships were giving us a bad drain,â€� Carnival CEO Arnold Donald said during a recent webinar with the Society of American Travel Writers.</p><p>Going, Going, Gone</p><p>Without much of a market for second-hand tonnage, the main worth of the ships is the steel that makes up the superstructure.</p><p>If, for instance, Carnival Fantasy has 15,000 tons of steel in its superstructure, the scrap may sell for upwards of $4.7 million based on current global market pricesâ€”though other factors also come into play, such as local prices and demand.</p><p>Along with the risk of these market fluctuations, the buyer also takes on the uncertainty of just how much metal can be salvaged. Pre-1990s ships tend to have more steel in their hulls and underwater plating, but those built in the â€™90s and after can bear lighter and stronger alloys.</p><p>Either way, steel and metal scraps will travel to a smelter to make rebar for construction projects around the world. Steel from some other dismantled ships can find its way to Turkeyâ€™s  large car manufacturing industry, where it might become parts for a Toyota orÂ&nbsp;a Ford.</p><p>Aluminum, copper, and stainless steel are also salvaged and resold, along with other valuable commodities that mostly remain in Turkey. The ripped out teak decks on Fantasy may end up in local shops, restaurants, and homes. Theater scenery and lighting may find its way into show productions. Even the tackiest artwork has some value, and can end up in restaurants throughout the country.</p><p>Buyers come to the yard for everything down to the bolts and nuts. Even if a used toilet sells for a fraction of the shelf price, multiply that amount by a few thousandâ€”given the number of cabins and public spaces on each shipâ€”and it can add up to a substantial sum.</p><p>According to Orbay Simsek, vice president of the Aliaga-based Simsekler Ship Recycling Company, there are even markets for kitchenware, closets, and blankets.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Basically anything and everything that can be sold, sells. Everything must go. Even the sarcophagus.</p><p>Eco-friendly Shipbreaking</p><p>Taking apart ships is a controversial topic, thanks to concerns over both human and environmental risks. Itâ€™s one of the most dangerous jobs in the world, according to Wouter Rozenveld, director of Sea2Cradle (SC2), an expert in green ship recycling who was hired by Carnival to oversee the safe dismantling of its ships. Each Carnival vessel may take up to nine months to break down, he says, and the blowtorch-based work comes with constant fire hazards.</p><p>Those hazards are amplified when the recyclable component pieces, like furniture, cabling, piping, and machinery inside each deck have to be carefully taken apart and separated says Ehud Bar-Lev, who overseesÂ&nbsp;assessment services at maritime specialist Lloydâ€™s Register.</p><p>The extra steps in disassembly also increase potential for hazardous waste spills, containing everything from oily residues to sludge, asbestos, and coolants in fridges.</p><p>To prevent those incidents, the Turkish shipbreaking yard undertakes its work in a concrete holding area that catches debris; in similar facilities throughout India and Bangladesh, the process may happen on the beach. Rather thanÂ&nbsp;letting toxic chemicals spew into the water, the Turkish yard collects the materials, has them cataloged by Sea2Cradle, and then hands them over toÂ&nbsp;the government-runÂ&nbsp;Ship Recycling Association of Turkey for proper disposal.</p><p>Carnival Corporation saw these precautions as a marketingÂ&nbsp;opportunity, making aÂ&nbsp;highly unusual move to publicize its efforts as â€œresponsible recycling.â€� But it was the shipbreaking yard, not Carnival, that saw the biggest windfall as a result:Â&nbsp;never before hasÂ&nbsp;AliagaÂ&nbsp;seen five mega cruise ships in its harbor.</p><p>There may be more coming in the months ahead.</p><p>â€œThe longer the pandemic rages on in the world, the more cruise ships will end up in scrapyards, and my guess is at an increasingly younger age,â€� says ManWo Ng, a maritime management professor at Virginiaâ€™s Old Dominion University. â€œEven if a vaccine becomes available, how many of us will be comfortable jumping right back on cruise ships?â€�</p><p>Â©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>]]>

October 29, 2020 | https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One piece of unattributed wisdom that's stuck with me is "don't take more than one technology bet". At <a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ladder</a>, our big bet is using <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Clojure</a> for fullstack app development. Ladder's used Clojure since day 1 in 2015, and we wouldn't want it any different! In particular, Clojure's Lisp heritage, focus on pure functions and immutable data structures, unified client-server support, and superior developer experience have helped us write higher quality code faster.</p>
<p><strong>Ladder is hiring! If you're interested, please check out our job description <a href="https://grnh.se/5cebfb331us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</strong></p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2>Pure functions and immutability</h2>
<p>One of the challenges with ordinary, imperative programming languages like Javascript or Python is the increasing complexity of state management. As your application grows, it becomes harder and harder to isolate where in the codebase specific changes to your application state occur. This is because with typical application architectures in those languages, any function can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">side effects</a> or modify incoming or global state. On the other hand, Clojure strongly emphasizes working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pure functions</a> (well, if you discount I/O...) and <a href="https://clojure.org/about/state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">immutable data structures</a>. A Clojure programmer must be explicit when defining and modifying mutable state - this helps minimize its usage and makes it easier to reason about.</p>
<p>Immutable data structures and pure functions also lend themselves well to concurrent programming. We rarely find ourselves worrying about locks and shared data in a multi-threaded environment, because our functions are rarely modifying shared state. And when we do, Clojure provides <code>atom</code>, a thread-safe wrapper around ordinary data structures. Behind the scenes, setting an <code>atom</code>'s value calls <code>compare-and-set!</code>. That means no fussing around with locks or mutexes and no worrying about your data changing before you modify it. With this one simple construct, Clojure removes 99% of our concurrency headaches.</p>
<h2>Clojure is a Lisp</h2>
<p>There are probably enough Lisp arguments on the Internet already - I'll defer to <a href="https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_lisp_is_a_good_thing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rich Hickey</a> (Clojure's creator) and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Graham</a> instead of adding another rehash. That said, Clojure provides some advantages over other Lisps like Common Lisp and Scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>CL only includes lists in its core language spec. Clojure introduces vectors, sets, and maps which makes reading and writing code so much less tedious. Of course Scheme has all of these except sets.</li>
<li>Clojure's core data structures are immutable which, as discussed above, makes reasoning about code, especially concurrent code, much easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clojure runs everywhere</h2>
<p>Clojure provides first class support for sharing code between platforms with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reader conditionals</a>. Most of our namespaces at Ladder take advantage of this and are shared across our client (Clojurescript) and server (Clojure). In fact, all of our client React code (aside from browser-specific API calls like clipboard, input handlers, etc) supports being run on the JVM. This lets us run what we call "full-stack tests" entirely within a Java process. For example, we can run full user flows like "user can accept a life insurance policy" and assert against both client and server state <strong>in the same test</strong>. The closest analogue without this superpower would be running a Selenium test against a running webserver, which introduces all sorts of potential flakiness. For more on full-stack tests, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijWBPYkRAQ&amp;t=346s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this talk</a> two of our engineers gave at Clojure West in 2017.</p>
<p>Clojure also provides easy <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals#_host_interop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">host interop</a> for each supported platform. This lets us leverage the full JVM (and Javascript) ecosystem. For example, we use popular Java libraries like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jetty</a>, <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">kafka-clients</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/tink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tink</a>, and more. On the frontend, we use React, and can easily include other Javascript libraries for analytics, error handling, and session replays.</p>
<h2>Developer experience</h2>
<p>When I’ve worked with Typescript and Python in the past, I was constantly waiting for my development server to reload. Clojure makes updating code on your local server as simple as reloading the updated namespace in your REPL. If you want, you can even <a href="https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">update remote, (hopefully) non-production webservers</a>! Being able to evaluate code in a REPL and have your running web server update in less than a second makes exploration and iteration on your actual backend so much faster. Instant feedback makes developers more playful and experimental. Ultimately, it helps them write better code faster.</p>
<p>It’s also super easy to run small chunks of code in the REPL. Ladder, like other Clojure shops, has a convention of documenting namespace usage with a <code>comment</code> block at the bottom. Developers can use the code within to learn the namespace’s API, run commonly used procedures, or test changes to the rest of the namespace - all without leaving their editor!</p>
<h2>Why not Clojure?</h2>
<p>While we're extremely satisfied with our choice of Clojure, we've had our fair share of headaches. First, Clojure processes take a long time to start up - especially as the size of the application grows. Our webserver at Ladder takes a full minute before it can accept web requests. This makes autoscaling in response to load more challenging - some of our load can spike in well under a minute, so we have to be consistently overprovisioned to handle it. Second, Clojure produces pretty big artifacts. This matters less on the backend, where our webserver JAR is over 1.5GB, but hurts us on the frontend. We still have work to do here, but our initial bundle is 7.2MB uncompressed (1.0MB gzipped)! If raw performance or bundle size is your primary concern, you might be better off choosing another language.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a small company, we have more ideas to try than we have bandwidth to implement. Using Clojure has helped our team be more iterative and more productive, so we can ship more experiments and projects than we would otherwise be able to. I feel super lucky that Ladder introduced me to Clojure - and I'm excited to see how Clojure and our use of it continues to evolve!</p>

                <h2>The Syllabaries</h2>
                <div><p>
                  The Japanese language, called 日本語（にほんご）[knee-hohn-go] is composed of 2 major syllabaries, <strong>Hiragana and Katakana.</strong> Made up of <strong>Consonant-Vowel pairs</strong> [ka, ga, ta, su, mu] as opposed to single letters that can be combined in variety, Hiragana and Katakana are two versions of the same collection, Katakana being used for <strong>foreign loan words</strong> since the reorganization of public education in 1962.</p><p>
                  In addition to Hiragana (the native script) and Katakana (reserved for foreign loan-words post-62), Japan imported symbolic glyphs from mainland Asia and they are referred to as 漢字（かんじ） kanji — letters of the Han Dynasty.
              </p></div>
                <p>
                  You can learn the Hiragana in the inside front cover of our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/guide">guide</a> that contains information on essential grammar, sentence structure, sound-effect language, and covers some of the more nuanced aspects of the language in plain English.</p>

          <div>
            <h4>Hiragana ひらがな</h4>
            <p>Warm and curvy, the ひらがな [hiragana] are used for native Japanese words and are the primary phonetic syllabary of Japanese.
            </p>
            <p>あ　い　う　え　お</p>

        <div>
          <h4>Katakana カタカナ</h4>
          <p>
            The カタカナ [katakana] are sharp and angular, and while letters to friends have been written entirely in Katakana (and Kanji), <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Masabumi_Hosono_titanic_diary.jpg">such as this beautiful letter recovered from the Titanic,</a> since 1962 the カタカナ [katakana] have been reserved for foreign loan-words such as "computer" コンピュータ [konpyuuta] and "glass" ガラス [garasu].  <br>カタカナ [katakana] have a one-to-one correlation with the ひらがな [hiragana] similar to how English has print and cursive.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Kanji 漢字（かんじ）</h4>
          <p>
           The 漢字（かんじ） [kanji] were imported lock, stock, and barrel from mainland Asia starting in the 5th century.  Fewer than 4% of them are pictographs, and over 90% of the kanji are "meaning and sound borrowers."

                <h2>Practice Listening + Identifying</h2>
                <p>
                  「聞き取れない」（ききとれない）[kiki-torenai] is the Japanese expression for "unable to get a clear ear grab" of a sound or a term when listening.  The audible morphemes of Japanese require plenty of exposure to be able to distinguish them easily, due in part to the clunkiness of the syllabaries, the ひらがな Hiragana and カタカナ Katakana.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Japanese Complete provides a <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/path/japanesecomplete.com/hiragana">ひらがな Hiragana listening challenge</a> for free to all; our カタカナ Katakana listening challenge is available to <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/purchase">premium subscribers</a>
              </p>
                <p>
                  The site <a href="https://supernative.tv/">SuperNative.tv</a> has an incredible cornucopia of film and television show clips that one can watch on replay with subtitles and fill-in-the-blank exercises to practice the ability to "ear catch" or "ear grab" the audible morphemes of Japanese.  We highly recommend this resource for new learners to get an "ear grip" of the common Japanese sounds and how they are actually pronounced.  Naturally, real-life speech and the way it is written down may not appear to match up perfectly until one has plenty of exposure.</p>

                <h2>Grammar: Particles</h2>
                <p>
                  Rather than relying on word sequence, Japanese relies on particles to partner with words in order to indicate the role of the word in the sentence.  Think of particles as dancing partners wearing brightly colored clothing who let you know the current occupation of their partner.  A subject dances with a pink-scarf wearing dancer.  A topic dances with a blue-scarf wearing dancer.  A destination of travel dances with a green-scarf wearing dancer.  When we look at the dancers, we can see clearly who they are dancing with, letting us know what the sentence means.  
              </p>
              <p>Particles are used to explain the <strong>who, what, when, where, and how</strong> of Japanese sentences and they are in <strong>post-fix position</strong>, meaning that they follow the words to which they snap.</p>
              <p>Mastery of particles is essential to having a native-level understanding of Japanese.  In fact, by exploring a frequency dictionary or the <a href="https://pj.ninjal.ac.jp/corpus_center/bccwj/en/">Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese,</a> one will find that <em>of the 37 most frequent words, 17 of them are particles (45%).</em></p>
                <p>
                  In Japanese Complete we teach particles using a method devised specifically for Japanese Complete and not available elsewhere: <strong>the bunsetsu jar</strong>.  Every jar (which contains a person, place, or thing) needs a lid (which contains a grammatical particle).</p>

                <h2>Kanji: Meanings</h2>
                <p>
                  Japan imported symbolic glyphs from mainland Asia and they are referred to as 漢字（かんじ） kanji — letters of the Han Dynasty and there are <a href="https://learnjapanesebest.wordpress.com/2019/12/11/the-four-types-of-kanji/">four types of kanji</a> where only 4% are simple pictographs and over 90% are "meaning-and-sound borrowers."
              </p>
              <p>In acquiring Japanese, modern learners often rely on methods inspired by <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921?pldnSite=1">Heisig's Remembering the Kanji,</a> a book written by James Heisig after he had arrived in Japan too late to take the introductory course; upon asking his friends what the hardest part of the language was, he was quickly informed that the Kanji are a most formidable adversary.  He took the spare time before the next semester started to try his best to conquer this formidable opponent, and in the process discovered that he could break the kanji down section-by-section, part-by-part, and develop clever mnemonic devices and imaginary scenes to remember their <strong>general meanings</strong> for the long-term.
              </p>
                <p>
                  Heisig only provides clear and concise mnemonics for the first hundred-or-so kanji in his series, which is quite deflating to the beginner, leaving much of the creative and mental work to the learner when they could be absorbing, rather than generating, content.  This is the reason that we have taken it upon ourselves at Japanese Complete to provide detailed mnemonic lessons for the kanji we teach.  You can see the most frequent 777 kanji on our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/777">777 kanji list.</a></p>

                <h2>Verbs: Meanings, Connotations</h2>
                <p>
                  Every Japanese sentence ends with a verb.  Our classification scheme in Japanese Complete comes from conversations with expert language teachers from University College London and Middlebury College, schools renowned for their East Asian studies and language departments.  While normal textbooks try to wedge Japanese grammar as a round peg into the square-hole shape of English, Japanese Complete strives to simplify the equation as much as possible while retaining all the fidelity and integrity of real Japanese.  Our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/reverse-engineer/">Reverse Engineering a Japanese Sentence</a> page details how our classification of verbs and nouns differs from common textbooks, and illustrates how they are more coherent with actual Japanese.
              </p>
              <p>In general, verbs are the missing piece of every Japanese sentence and we must wait until the end of the sentence or phrase to hear or read them.  This is what makes translation and interpretation notoriously difficult, for a translator needing a verb to connect two thoughts, nouns, or ideas, must allow the Japanese speaker to complete the phrase, adding a significant delay to the process, all-the-while needing to be able to perceive the beginning of the next phrase.  The latency effect in translating and interpreting Japanese makes this skill quite coveted in tourism, national and international diplomacy, and any role where interpretation in real-time is a must.
              </p>
                <p>
                By learning a large subset of verbs in their "plain-form" first, and then learning how to transform verbs into their variety of tenses and aspects, one builds a solid foundation for understanding written and oral Japanese.  <strong>It is wise to familiarize oneself with the great variety of tenses, active and passive constructions, and formality levels early on, so that they are not completely foreign when encountered later on in advanced studies.</strong>  In Japanese Complete, we teach politeness levels, active and passive tenses, and the variety of verbs early on so that learners have a solid foundation and are not surprised to find whole new constructions in years 3 or 4, but instead are immediately confronted with the variegated tones of the language and its inflexions.

<p>If Democrats win both the White House and the Senate (and maintain control of the House) you’ll see revived efforts to pick up the pieces of the Affordable Care Act and continue to transform the U.S. healthcare system. This transformation is likely to come at the expense of private healthcare companies' bottom lines.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Republicans maintaining control of the White House and/or Senate would likely result in a divided government, with no significant legislation on healthcare being passed.</p>

<p><span><strong>Cannabis</strong></span></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, most major cannabis stocks have a very low Trump Beta, meaning they are likely to perform well if Biden is elected.</p>

<p>Though Biden took a tough stance on federally controlled substances back in the 1980s and 1990s, he has recently embraced a platform of decriminalizing marijuana. Additionally, running mate Kamala Harris is known as an advocate for legalization. As a junior senator in California, she sponsored the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which the Democrat-controlled House Judiciary Committee passed last November. The bill hasn’t gotten anywhere yet, but many suppose that a democratic sweep this November could lead to marijuana legalization.</p>

<p>On the other hand, cannabis legislation has not been a priority under Trump, and there is no reason right now to believe that this will change during a second term.</p>

<p><span><strong>Large-cap Tech Companies</strong></span></p>
<p>Companies in the technology services and electronic technology sectors have an average Trump Beta of 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. This is primarily driven by the large-cap tech companies that dominate their industries, with Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Adobe all showing strong positive correlations with a Trump re-election.</p></div></div></td></tr></tbody></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2>Web Audio API</h2>
<p>I’ve been working on getting WebRTC video chat working here on the website for a few weeks now. I finally got to the point where both text, video chat, and screen sharing all work really well, but somewhere in the back of my mind I kept thinking about complaints about “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-waves/202007/why-zoom-fatigue-is-real-and-what-you-can-do-about-it">Zoom fatigue</a>” during the pandemic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zoom fatigue, Hall argues now, is real. “Zoom is exhausting and lonely because you have to be so much more attentive and so much more aware of what’s going on than you do on phone calls.” If you haven’t turned off your own camera, you are also watching yourself speak, which can be arousing and disconcerting. The blips, delays and cut off sentences also create confusion. Much more exploration needs to be done, but he says, “maybe this isn’t the solution to our problems that we thought it might have been.” Phone calls, by comparison, are less demanding. “You can be in your own space. You can take a walk, make dinner,” Hall says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s kind of an interesting thing to have on your mind while spending weeks writing/debugging/testing video chat code.</p>
<p>So I decided to add an audio-only mode. And if I was gonna do that, I had to show something cool in place of the video. So I figured I would try to add audio visualizations when one or both of the users didn’t have video on. Using the relatively recent<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a> seemed like the right way to go.</p>
<p>Here’s what I came up with:</p>
<div><video controls="" muted="" autoplay="" playsinline="" loop=""><source src="https://media.dwayne.xyz/blog/audio-visualization.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>Screen recording of the local audio visualization. I cycle through bar graph in light mode, bar graph in dark mode, sine wave in dark mode, then sine wave in light mode.</p></div>
<h2>Creating and hooking up an AnalyserNode</h2>
<p>To create audio visualizations, the first thing you’ll need is an <code>AnalyserNode</code>, which you can get from the <code>createAnalyser</code> method of a <code>BaseAudioContext</code>. You can get both of these things pretty easily<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> like this:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>const</span> audioContext <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>window</span>.AudioContext();
<span>2</span><span>const</span> analyser <span>=</span> audioContext.createAnalyser();
</pre><p>Next, create a <code>MediaStreamAudioSourceNode</code> from an existing data stream (I use either the local or remote data streams from either <code>getUserMedia</code> or from the ‘track’ event of <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> respectively) using <code>AudioContext.createMediaStreamSource</code>. Then you can connect that audio source to the analyser object like this:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>const</span> audioSource <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
<span>2</span>audioSource.connect(analyser);
</pre>
<h2>Using requestAnimationFrame</h2>
<p><code>window.requestAnimationFrame</code> is nice. Call it, passing in your drawing function, and then inside that function call <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> again. Get yourself a nice little recursive loop going that’s automatically timed properly by the browser.</p>
<p>In my situation, there will either be 0, 1, or 2 visualizations running, since either side can choose either video chat, audio-only (…except during screen sharing), or just text chat. So I have one loop that draws both. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>const</span> drawAudioVisualizations <span>=</span> () =&gt; {
<span>2</span>    audioCancel <span>=</span> <span>window</span>.requestAnimationFrame(drawAudioVisualizations);
<span>3</span>    localAudioVisualization.draw();
<span>4</span>    remoteAudioVisualization.draw();
<span>5</span>};
</pre><p>I created the class for those visualization objects, and they handle whether or not to draw. They each contain the analyser, source, and context objects for their visualization.</p>
<p>Then when I detect that loop doesn’t have to run anymore, I can cancel it using that <code>audioCancel</code> value:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>window</span>.cancelAnimationFrame(audioCancel);
<span>2</span>audioCancel <span>=</span> <span>0</span>;
</pre>
<h2>Configuring the Analyser</h2>
<p>Like in the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/voice-change-o-matic/blob/gh-pages/scripts/app.js">example you’ll see a lot</a> if you look at the MDN documentation for this stuff, I provide options for two audio visualizations: frequency bars and a sine wave. Here’s how I configure the analyser for each type:</p>
<pre><span> 1</span><span>switch</span> (<span>this</span>.type) {
<span> 2</span>    <span>case</span> <span>'frequencybars'</span><span>:</span>
<span> 3</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.minDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>90</span>;
<span> 4</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.maxDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>10</span>;
<span> 5</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.smoothingTimeConstant <span>=</span> <span>0.85</span>;
<span> 6</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.fftSize <span>=</span> <span>256</span>;
<span> 7</span>        <span>this</span>.bufferLength <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.analyser.frequencyBinCount;
<span> 8</span>        <span>this</span>.dataArray <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Uint8Array(<span>this</span>.bufferLength);
<span> 9</span>        <span>break</span>;
<span>10</span>    <span>default</span><span>:</span>
<span>11</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.minDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>90</span>;
<span>12</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.maxDecibels <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>10</span>;
<span>13</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.smoothingTimeConstant <span>=</span> <span>0.9</span>;
<span>14</span>        <span>this</span>.analyser.fftSize <span>=</span> <span>1024</span>;
<span>15</span>        <span>this</span>.bufferLength <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.analyser.fftSize;
<span>16</span>        <span>this</span>.dataArray <span>=</span> <span>new</span> Uint8Array(<span>this</span>.bufferLength);
<span>17</span>        <span>break</span>;
<span>18</span>}
</pre><div><p>I’ve adjusted these numbers a lot, and I’m gonna keep doing it. A note about <code>fftSize</code> and <code>frequencyBinCount</code>: <code>frequencyBinCount</code> is set right after you set <code>fftSize</code> and it’s usually just half the <code>fftSize</code> value. These values are about the amount of data you want to receive from the main analyser functions I’m about to talk about next. As you can see, they directly control the size of the data array that you’ll use to store the audio data on each draw call.
</p></div>
<h2>Using the Analyser</h2>
<p>On each draw call, depending on the type of visualization, call either <code>getByteFrequencyData</code> or <code>getByteTimeDomainData</code> with the array that was created above, and it’ll be filled with data. Then you run a simple loop over each element and start drawing. Here’s my sine wave code:</p>
<pre><span> 1</span><span>this</span>.analyser.getByteTimeDomainData(<span>this</span>.dataArray);
<span> 2</span><span>this</span>.ctx.lineWidth <span>=</span> <span>2</span>;
<span> 3</span><span>this</span>.ctx.strokeStyle <span>=</span> audioSecondaryStroke;
<span> 4</span>
<span> 5</span><span>this</span>.ctx.beginPath();
<span> 6</span>
<span> 7</span><span>let</span> v, y;
<span> 8</span><span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> <span>this</span>.bufferLength; i<span>++</span>) {
<span> 9</span>    v <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.dataArray[i] <span>/</span> <span>128.0</span>;
<span>10</span>    y <span>=</span> v <span>*</span> height <span>/</span> <span>2</span>;
<span>11</span>
<span>12</span>    <span>if</span> (i <span>===</span> <span>0</span>) {
<span>13</span>        <span>this</span>.ctx.moveTo(x, y);
<span>14</span>    } <span>else</span> {
<span>15</span>        <span>this</span>.ctx.lineTo(x, y);
<span>16</span>    }
<span>17</span>
<span>18</span>    x <span>+=</span> width <span>*</span> <span>1.0</span> <span>/</span> <span>this</span>.bufferLength;
<span>19</span>}
<span>20</span>
<span>21</span><span>this</span>.ctx.lineTo(width, height <span>/</span> <span>2</span>);
<span>22</span><span>this</span>.ctx.stroke();
</pre><div><p>The fill and stroke colors are dynamic based on the website color scheme.
</p></div>
<h2>Good ol' Safari</h2>
<p>So I did all of this stuff I just talked about, but for <strong>days</strong> I could <em>not</em> get this to work in Safari. Not because of errors or anything, but because both <code>getByteFrequencyData</code> and <code>getByteTimeDomainData</code> just filled the array with 0s every time. No matter what I did. I was able to get the audio data in Firefox just fine.</p>
<p>So at first, I figured it just didn’t work at all in Safari and I would just have to wait until Apple fixed it. But then I came across <a href="https://mdn.github.io/voice-change-o-matic/">this sample audio project</a> and noticed it worked just fine in Safari.</p>
<div><p>So I studied the code for an hour trying to understand what was different about my code and theirs. I made a lot of changes to my code to make it more like what they were doing. One of the big differences is that they’re connecting the audio source to different audio distortion nodes to actually change the audio. I just want to create a visualization so I wasn’t using any of those objects.
</p></div>
<h3>Audio Distortion Effects</h3>
<p>The <code>BaseAudioContext</code> has a few methods you can use to create audio distortion objects.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WaveShaperNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createWaveShaper</code> to create a non-linear distortion. You can use a custom function to change the audio data.</li>
<li><code>GainNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createGain</code> to control the overall gain (volume) of the audio.</li>
<li><code>BiquadFilterNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createBiquadFilter</code> to apply some common audio effects.</li>
<li><code>ConvolverNode</code>: Use <code>BaseAudioContext.createConvolver</code> to apply reverb effects to audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each one of these objects has a <code>connect</code> function where you pass another context, output, or filter. Each one has a certain number of inputs and outputs. Here’s an example from that sample project of connecting all of them:</p>
<pre><span>1</span>source <span>=</span> audioCtx.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
<span>2</span>source.connect(distortion);
<span>3</span>distortion.connect(biquadFilter);
<span>4</span>biquadFilter.connect(gainNode);
<span>5</span>convolver.connect(gainNode);
<span>6</span>gainNode.connect(analyser);
<span>7</span>analyser.connect(audioCtx.destination);
</pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: Don’t connect to your audio context <code>destination</code> if you’re just trying to create a visualization for a call. The user will hear themselves talking.</p>
<div><p>Anyway, I tried adding these things to my code to see if that would get it working in Safari, but I had no luck.
</p></div>
<h2>Figuring out the Safari issue</h2>
<p>I was starting to get <em>real</em> frustrated trying to figure this out. I was gonna let it go when I thought Safari was just broken (because it usually is), but since I knew it <em>could</em> work in Safari, I couldn’t leave it alone.</p>
<p>Eventually I downloaded the actual HTML and Javascript files from that sample and started removing shit from their code, running it locally and seeing if it worked. Which it did. So now I’m editing my own code, and <em>their code</em>, to get them to be pretty much the same. Which I did. And <strong>still</strong> theirs worked and mine didn’t.</p>
<p>Next I just started desperately logging every single object at different points in my code to figure out what the fuck was going on. Then I noticed something.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://media.dwayne.xyz/blog/audio-context-suspended.png" alt="Dev console showing the output of logging this.audioContext. The state attribute is shown as suspended"></p><p>Output of logging the audio context object.</p></div>
<p>The <code>state</code> is “suspended”? Why? I don’t know. I did the same log in the sample code (that I had downloaded and was running on my machine) and it was “running”.</p>
<p>This is the code that fixes it:</p>
<pre><span>1</span><span>this</span>.audioSource <span>=</span> <span>this</span>.audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(<span>this</span>.stream);
<span>2</span><span>this</span>.audioSource.connect(<span>this</span>.analyser);
<span>3</span><span>this</span>.audioContext.resume(); <span>// Why??????
</span></pre><div><p>Calling <code>resume</code> changes the state and then everything works. To this day I still don’t know why the sample code didn’t need that line.
</p></div>
<h2>Drawing the image and supporting light/dark modes</h2>
<p>Like everything else on my site, all of this must support different color schemes (and screen sizes, and mobile devices). That was surprisingly difficult when trying to draw an SVG on the canvas.</p>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a> for all my icons on the site. I wanted to use one of them for these visualizations. The FontAwesome files are all SVGs (which is great), but I didn’t know how to draw the image in different colors in Javascript. The way I decided to do this was to load the SVG file into a Javascript <code>Image</code> object, then draw that onto the canvas each draw call.</p>
<p>That worked, but it only drew it black even after changing the fill and stroke colors. So after some web searching I read about someone deciding to draw out an image on an offscreen canvas, reading all the image data, and …</p></div></div>

    <p>
  <strong>Vega-Lite</strong> is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.
</p>

<p><span>
  <span>
    Vega-Lite specifications describe visualizations as encoding mappings from data to <strong>properties of graphical marks</strong> (e.g., points or bars).
    The Vega-Lite compiler <strong>automatically produces visualization components</strong> including axes, legends, and scales.
    It determines default properties of these components based on a set of <strong>carefully designed rules</strong>.
    This approach allows Vega-Lite specifications to be concise for quick visualization authoring, while giving user control to override defaults and customize various parts of a visualization.
    As we also designed Vega-Lite to support data analysis, Vega-Lite supports both <strong>data transformations</strong> (e.g., aggregation, binning, filtering, sorting) and <strong>visual transformations</strong> (e.g., stacking and faceting).
    Moreover, Vega-Lite specifications can be <strong>composed</strong> into layered and multi-view displays, and made <strong>interactive with selections</strong>.

  </span>
</span></p>

<p>Compared to <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega">Vega</a>, Vega-Lite provides a more concise and convenient form to author common visualizations. As Vega-Lite can compile its specifications to Vega specifications, users may use Vega-Lite as the <em>primary</em> visualization tool and, if needed, transition to use the lower-level Vega for advanced use cases.</p>
