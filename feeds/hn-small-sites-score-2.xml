<h3 id="types-of-development-1">Types of Development #1</h3>
<p><em>Rage driven development</em></p>
<p>Where an existing application/process causes one to rage so hard you spend the next 6 weeks over-engineering a solution to solve a simple problem. Example Perl.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="types-of-development-2">Types of Development #2</h3>
<p><em>Test driven development</em></p>
<p>Where previous projects and death marches result in a violent reaction of over-correcting for past failures and everything must be tested dammit. Example includes any project where the goal is 100% test coverage.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="types-of-development-3">Types of Development #3</h3>
<p><em>README driven development</em></p>
<p>A markdown file is created and filled with a description of the perfect simple application. This remains relevant for the first 2.3 hours of development. Examples include any GNU tool replacement written in Go or Rust.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="types-of-development-4">Types of Development #4</h3>
<p><em>Resume driven development</em></p>
<p>Development driven by an intense desire by everyone involved to get a new job or promotion. Every technology choice is made as the ultimate resume padder. Examples include Kafka + Haskell Micro-services for ML IoT projects.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="types-of-development-5">Types of Development #5</h3>
<p><em>Sales Driven Development</em></p>
<p>Where you value potential customers more than existing customers. Usually caused by sales gaining commission on new sales but not existing contracts. Examples include almost all enterprise software with every check-box feature in the world.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="types-of-development-6">Types of Development #6</h3>
<p><em>Behavior Driven Development</em></p>
<p>Where you use real users to drive your development methodology and end up delivering a product that mostly works for about 3 people as everyone else had their voice drowned out. Examples include mobile apps tested by your Mum.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="types-of-development-7">Types of Development #7</h3>
<p><em>Contract Driven Development</em></p>
<p>You split into front-end and back-end teams who build ivory tower solutions and then blame each other for not conforming when the integration fails. Examples include most companies that adopt a micro-service architecture.</p>

<center>Vladimir Keleshev • 2020-10-13</center>


<p>LDM—or <em>load multiple</em>—is my favorite assembly instruction of the ARM instruction set. Here’s why.</p>
<p>First, let’s discuss what LDM does. An example:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r4, {r0, r1, r2, r3}</code></pre>
<p>Here, it takes a <em>base register</em> (in this case, <code>r4</code>) and a <em>register set</em> (in this case, <code>{r0, r1, r2, r3}</code>). It loads consecutive words from the address in the base register into the registers in the set. In this example, the effect could be described using the following C-like pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>r0 = r4[0];
r1 = r4[1];
r2 = r4[2];
r3 = r4[3];</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few assignments for a single instruction! And that’s why it’s called <em>load multiple</em>.</p>
<p>The set notation also allows for ranges. We can rewrite the previous example as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r4, {r0-r3}</code></pre>
<p>Any and all of the 16 ARM registers are allowed in the set. So, the following is legal:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0, {r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15}</code></pre>
<p>The register set is encoded as a 16-bit mask in a 32-bit instruction. Here’s a simplified encoding of the original example:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://keleshev.com/ldm-my-favorite-arm-instruction/ldm-encoding-arm.svg" alt=""><figcaption>Simplified encoding of the LDM instruction</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Such instruction is a perfect fit for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load%E2%80%93store_architecture">load-store architecture</a> like ARM, where the primary workflow is:</p>
<ul>
<li>load many values from memory into registers,</li>
<li>perform operations exclusively on registers,</li>
<li>store results back from registers into memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The opposite of LDM is STM—<em>store multiple</em>.</p>
<!---Since both of them operate on *sets* of registers (which are implemented as bit masks), you can't directly select the order in which the values are loaded or stored.
The set `{r0, r1, r2}` is the same as `{r2, r1, r0}`.
That's why-->
<h2 id="block-copy">Block copy</h2>
<p>With these two, you can copy large blocks of memory fast. You can copy eight words (or 32 bytes!) of memory in just two instructions:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0, {r4-r11}
stm r1, {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<p>LDM and STM also have auto-increment variants (denoted with “!”) where the base register is incremented by the number of words loaded/stored so that you can do the copying in a fast loop:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0!, {r4-r11}
stm r1!, {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<h2 id="implementing-stacks">Implementing stacks</h2>
<p>ARM’s POP instruction is simply an alias for LDM with a stack pointer (and auto-increment). The following two are exactly the same:</p>
<pre><code>ldm sp!, {r0-r3}
pop {r0-r3}</code></pre>
<p>And the PUSH instruction is an alias for an STM variant (STMDB).</p>
<p>You can push and pop large quantities to and from the stack in one go. And if you replace SP by another register you can implement efficient stacks in other regions of memory. For example, you can implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_stack">shadow stack</a> in the heap.</p>
<h2 id="saving-registers">Saving registers</h2>
<p>Are you hesitating to use the call-preserved registers because you need to save them, and you might as well use a stack slot anyway? Not any more, because you can save all call-preserved registers you want to use in one go:</p>
<pre><code>push {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<h2 id="prologue-and-epilogue">Prologue and epilogue</h2>
<p>On ARM, the first four arguments, the return address (LR) and the frame pointer (FP) are all passed in registers. That’s why it’s especially important to have efficient prologues and epilogues. Fortunately, you can save FP and LR in one go, using a fairly standard ARM prologue:</p>
<pre><code>push {fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>And then restore both and return (for the epilogue):</p>
<pre><code>pop {fp, lr}
bx lr</code></pre>
<p>Even better, you can restore both and return in one go!</p>
<pre><code>pop {fp, pc}</code></pre>
<p>This works by popping the return address value (LR) into the program counter register (PC), so you don’t need an explicit return!</p>
<p>This is good enough in itself, but you can—<em>at the same time</em>—spill some arguments onto the stack (for example, if their address is taken):</p>
<pre><code>push {r0-r3, fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>Or, you can save FP and LR and—<em>at the same time</em>—allocate some space on the stack:</p>
<pre><code>push {r0-r3, fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we push <code>r0-r3</code> not for their value but to advance the stack pointer by four words.</p>
<h2 id="arm64">ARM64</h2>
<p>I suspect it was a difficult trade-off, but when it was time to design the 64-bit version of the ARM instruction set, the decision was made to double the number of registers to 32. I remember reading a paper saying that this change improves the performance by about 6% across the board. With 32 registers it is no longer possible to encode a bitmask of all registers into a 32-bit long instruction. So, instead, ARM64 has LDP and STP: load pair and store pair, which are the spiritual successors of LDM and STM.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Despite writing JavaScript almost every working day for the past seven years, I have to admit I don’t actually pay that much attention to ES language announcements. Major features like <code>async/await</code> and <code>Proxies</code> are one thing, but every year there’s a steady stream of small, incremental improvements that go under the radar for me, as there’s always something bigger to learn.</p>
<p>So in this post, I’ve collected some modern JS features that didn’t get much airtime when they first came out. Some of these are just quality of life improvements, but others are genuinely handy and can save whole swathes of code. Here are a few you might have missed:</p>
<h2 id="ES2015"><a href="#ES2015" title="ES2015"></a>ES2015</h2><h3 id="Binary-and-octal-literals"><a href="#Binary-and-octal-literals" title="Binary and octal literals"></a>Binary and octal literals</h3><p>Binary manipulation isn’t something one has to do very often in JavaScript, but every so often a problem rolls around that just can’t be feasibly solved otherwise. You might be writing high perf code for lower power devices, squeezing bits into local storage, doing pixel RGB manipulation in the browser, or having to work on tightly packed binary data formats.</p>
<p>This can mean lots of work masking / merging binary numbers, which I’ve always felt is needlessly obscured  in decimal. Well, ES6 added a binary literal number format just for this purpose: <code>0b</code></p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>const</span> binaryZero = <span>0b0</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> binaryOne  = <span>0b1</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> binary255  = <span>0b11111111</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> binaryLong = <span>0b111101011101101</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>This makes binary flags really easy:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span>const</span> olives    = <span>0b0001</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> ham       = <span>0b0010</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> pineapple = <span>0b0100</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> artechoke = <span>0b1000</span>;</span><br><span></span><br><span><span>const</span> pizza_ham_pineapple = pineapple | ham;</span><br><span><span>const</span> pizza_four_seasons  = olives | ham | artechoke;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Likewise for octal numbers. These are a bit niche in the JS world, but they’re quite common in networking and certain file formats. You can now write an octal with the syntax <code>0o</code> .</p>
<h3 id="Number-isNaN"><a href="#Number-isNaN" title="Number.isNaN()"></a>Number.isNaN()</h3><p>Not to be confused with <code>window.isNaN()</code>, this is a new method with much more intuitive behaviour.</p>
<p>You see, the classic <code>isNaN</code> has some interesting quirks:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>isNaN</span>(<span>NaN</span>)              === <span>true</span></span><br><span><span>isNaN</span>(<span>null</span>)             === <span>false</span></span><br><span><span>isNaN</span>(<span>undefined</span>)        === <span>true</span></span><br><span><span>isNaN</span>({})               === <span>true</span></span><br><span><span>isNaN</span>(<span>'0/0'</span>)            === <span>true</span></span><br><span><span>isNaN</span>(<span>'hello'</span>)          === <span>true</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>What gives? Bar the first, none of those parameters are actually <code>NaN</code>. The problem, as usual, is everyone’s “favourite” JavaScript feature: type coercion. Arguments to <code>window.isNaN</code> are coerced to numbers via the <code>Number</code> function.</p>
<p>Well, the new <code>Number.isNaN()</code> static method solves all that. It returns, definitively, once and for all, the equality of the argument you give it and <code>NaN</code>. It is utterly unambiguous:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>Number</span>.isNaN(<span>NaN</span>)       === <span>true</span></span><br><span><span>Number</span>.isNaN(<span>null</span>)      === <span>false</span></span><br><span><span>Number</span>.isNaN(<span>undefined</span>) === <span>false</span></span><br><span><span>Number</span>.isNaN({})        === <span>false</span></span><br><span><span>Number</span>.isNaN(<span>'0/0'</span>)     === <span>false</span></span><br><span><span>Number</span>.isNaN(<span>'hello'</span>)   === <span>false</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><em>Signature:</em> <code>Number.isNaN : (value: any) =&gt; boolean</code></p>
<h2 id="ES2016"><a href="#ES2016" title="ES2016"></a>ES2016</h2><h3 id="Exponent-power-operator"><a href="#Exponent-power-operator" title="Exponent (power) operator"></a>Exponent (power) operator</h3><p>This crops up now and again, so it’s nice to have a literal syntax for powers:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>2</span>**<span>2</span> === <span>4</span></span><br><span><span>3</span>**<span>2</span> === <span>9</span></span><br><span><span>3</span>**<span>3</span> === <span>27</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>(It’s weird because I was <em>convinced</em> JavaScript already had this - I may have been thinking of Python)</p>
<h3 id="Array-prototype-includes"><a href="#Array-prototype-includes" title="Array.prototype.includes()"></a>Array.prototype.includes()</h3><p>This one was a little hard to miss, but if you’ve been spending the last three years writing <code>array.indexOf(x) !== -1</code>, rejoice in the new <code>includes</code> method:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>].includes(<span>2</span>)    === <span>true</span></span><br><span>[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>].includes(<span>true</span>) === <span>false</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><code>includes</code> uses the <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/#sec-samevaluezero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Same Value Zero Algorithm</a>, which is almost identical to the strict equality (<code>===</code>) check, except that it can handle <code>NaN</code> values. Like an equality check it will compare objects by reference rather than contents:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>const</span> object1 = {};</span><br><span><span>const</span> object2 = {};</span><br><span></span><br><span><span>const</span> array = [object1, <span>78</span>, <span>NaN</span>];</span><br><span></span><br><span>array.includes(object1) === <span>true</span></span><br><span>array.includes(object2) === <span>false</span></span><br><span>array.includes(<span>NaN</span>)     === <span>true</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><code>includes</code> can take a second parameter, <code>fromIndex</code>, which lets you provide an offset:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span>const</span> array = [<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>2</span>];</span><br><span></span><br><span>array.includes(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>) === <span>true</span></span><br><span>array.includes(<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>) === <span>false</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Handy.</p>
<p><em>Signature:</em> <code>Array.prototype.includes : (match: any, offset?: Int) =&gt; boolean</code></p>
<h2 id="ES2017"><a href="#ES2017" title="ES2017"></a>ES2017</h2><h3 id="Shared-Array-Buffers-amp-Atomics"><a href="#Shared-Array-Buffers-amp-Atomics" title="Shared Array Buffers &amp; Atomics"></a>Shared Array Buffers &amp; Atomics</h3><p>This is a great pair of features that may prove invaluable if you’re doing a lot of work with web workers. They allow you to directly share memory between processes, and set up locks to avoid race conditions.</p>
<p>They’re both quite major features with fairly complex APIs, so there isn’t space to give them an overview here, but take a look at this <a href="https://www.sitepen.com/blog/the-return-of-sharedarraybuffers-and-atomics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sitepen article</a> to learn more. Browser support is still spotty but should hopefully improve over the next couple of years.</p>
<h2 id="ES2018"><a href="#ES2018" title="ES2018"></a>ES2018</h2><h3 id="Regex-bonanza"><a href="#Regex-bonanza" title="Regex bonanza"></a>Regex bonanza</h3><p>ES2018 introduced a whole flurry of regular expression features:</p>
<h4 id="Lookbehind-matches-match-on-previous-chars"><a href="#Lookbehind-matches-match-on-previous-chars" title="Lookbehind matches (match on previous chars)"></a>Lookbehind matches (match on previous chars)</h4><p>In runtimes that support it, you can now write a regex that looks for characters <em>before</em> your match. For example, to find all numbers prepended by a dollar:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>const</span> regex = <span>/(?&lt;=\$)\d+/</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> text  = <span>'This cost $400'</span>;</span><br><span>text.match(regex) === [<span>'400'</span>]</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>The key is the new lookbehind group, evil twin to lookahead groups:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Look ahead:  (?=abc)</span><br><span>Look behind: (?&lt;=abc)</span><br><span></span><br><span>Look ahead negative:  (?!abc)</span><br><span>Look behind negative: (?&lt;!abc)</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Unfortunately there isn’t presently any way to transpile the new lookbehind syntax for older browsers, so you may be stuck to just using this on Node for the time being.</p>
<h4 id="You-can-name-capture-groups"><a href="#You-can-name-capture-groups" title="You can name capture groups"></a>You can name capture groups</h4><p>A really powerful feature of regex is the ability to pick out sub-matches and use them to do some simple parsing. But until recently we could only refer to sub-matches by number, e.g.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>const</span> getNameParts  = <span>/(\w+)\s+(\w+)/g</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> name          = <span>"Weyland Smithers"</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> subMatches    = getNameParts.exec(name);</span><br><span></span><br><span>subMatches[<span>1</span>]     === <span>'Weyland'</span></span><br><span>subMatches[<span>2</span>]     === <span>'Smithers'</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>But there’s now a syntax to assign these sub-matches (or capture groups) names, by putting <code>?&lt;title&gt;</code> at the beginning of the parens for each group you want to name:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>const</span> getNameParts  = <span>/(?&lt;first&gt;\w+)\s(?&lt;last&gt;\w+)/g</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> name          = <span>"Weyland Smithers"</span>;</span><br><span><span>const</span> subMatches    = getNameParts.exec(name);</span><br><span></span><br><span><span>const</span> {first, last} = subMatches.groups</span><br><span>first             === <span>'Weyland'</span></span><br><span>last              === <span>'Smithers'</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Unfortunately this is Chrome- and Node-only for the moment.</p>
<h4 id="Dots-can-now-match-newlines"><a href="#Dots-can-now-match-newlines" title="Dots can now match newlines"></a>Dots can now match newlines</h4><p>You just have to provide the <code>/s</code> flag, e.g. <code>/someRegex./s</code>, <code>/anotherRegex./sg</code>.</p>
<h2 id="ES2019"><a href="#ES2019" title="ES2019"></a>ES2019</h2><h3 id="Array-prototype-flat-amp-flatMap"><a href="#Array-prototype-flat-amp-flatMap" title="Array.prototype.flat() &amp; flatMap()"></a>Array.prototype.flat() &amp; flatMap()</h3><p>I was so pleased to see these on MDN.</p>
<p><code>flat()</code>, very simply, flattens a multi-dimensional array by a specified maximum <code>depth</code>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>const</span> multiDimensional = [</span><br><span>	[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>],</span><br><span>    [<span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>],</span><br><span>    [<span>7</span>,[<span>8</span>,<span>9</span>]]</span><br><span>];</span><br><span></span><br><span>multiDimensional.flat(<span>2</span>) === [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><code>flatMap</code> is essentially a <code>map</code> followed by a <code>flat</code> of depth 1. It’s handy when a mapping function returns an array but you don’t want the result to be a nested data structure:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>const</span> texts = [<span>"Hello,"</span>, <span>"today I"</span>, <span>"will"</span>, <span>"use FlatMap"</span>];</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>const</span> mapped = texts.map(<span><span>text</span> =&gt;</span> text.split(<span>' '</span>));</span><br><span>mapped === [<span>'Hello'</span>, [<span>'today'</span>, <span>'I'</span>], <span>'will'</span>, [<span>'use'</span>, <span>'FlatMap'</span>]];</span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>const</span> flatMapped = texts.flatMap(<span><span>text</span> =&gt;</span> text.split(<span>' '</span>));</span><br><span>flatMapped === [<span>'Hello'</span>, <span>'today'</span>, <span>'I'</span>, <span>'will'</span>, <span>'use'</span>, <span>'FlatMap'</span>];</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h3 id="Unbound-catches"><a href="#Unbound-catches" title="Unbound catches"></a>Unbound catches</h3><p>You can now write try/catch statements without binding the thrown error:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>try</span> {</span><br><span>  </span><br><span>} <span>catch</span> {</span><br><span>  </span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Incidentally, catches where you don’t care about the value of <code>e</code> are sometimes termed <em>Pokémon exception handling</em>. ‘Cos you gotta catch ‘em all!</p>
<h3 id="String-trim-methods"><a href="#String-trim-methods" title="String trim methods"></a>String trim methods</h3><p>Pretty minor but a nicety:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>const</span> padded         = <span>'          Hello world   '</span>;</span><br><span>padded.trimStart() === <span>'Hello world   '</span>;</span><br><span>padded.trimEnd()   === <span>'          Hello world'</span>;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2 id="Next-time…"><a href="#Next-time…" title="Next time…"></a>Next time…</h2><p>If you liked this post, <a href="https://twitter.com/jbreckmckye" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let me know</a> and I might find the time to write up something similar for TypeScript!</p>

October 14, 2020 | https://dangoodspeed.com/covid/total-cases-since-june | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dangoodspeed.com/covid/total-cases-since-june">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
The numbers are the total confirmed normalized* cases per million for each state since June. A '10,000' means 1% of the state's population has tested positive of COVID since June 1. June 1 was chosen as it was around that time that countries worldwide that had been sucker-punched months before had the opportunity to apply proven preventative measures. It also provided an opportunity to contrast the resulting data with states' political affiliations, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index" target="new">Cook Partisan Voting Index</a>. The results suggest a strong correlation between a state's political leanings and its ability to employ proven science to slow the spread of COVID. </p><hr>
<p>* "Normalization" means the abnormalities in the data were evened out. For example, if there were 10 days in a row of a few cases/deaths a day and then one day of 1000... that looks awful and frenetic on a chart like this, even when framed in a per-week display. In reality, that 1000 is just a backlog catch-up, so I normalized it by spreading the thousand over previous dates for a more even / more realistic data. It works similarly when the total number of cases/deaths drops one day. Likely a correction from a previous report, I just subtracted the difference over previous dates to numbers that are probably closer to reality.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3377">

<div>
<p>If you were born mid-90’s or earlier, you probably remember being bored. We used to talk to ourselves, play “make believe”, taking walks, listening to records, etc. We learned to entertain ourselves, imagine, and create.</p>
<p>Today, my children and children born into the age of the virtual world have not experienced boredom, at least not in the same way. In a sense, those who grew up in the 24-hour news cycle, with social media have never and will never experience being alone. They’ve rarely experience the <a href="https://austingwalters.com/the-last-free-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sense of freedom</a> that comes from thinking to oneself.</p>
<p>A personal concern, is that children’s personalities appear to develop in the absence of technology. They play with toys and make their world come to life. My two year old believes, with all his heart, that his toys are sentient. That our Roomba has feelings and needs to be “fed”. He’s learning reason, learning to manipulate the world, talking to us, and so much more.</p>
<h2>Tools of Gods</h2>
<p>Throughout all human history technology has been an extension of ourselves. Part of childhood is learning to use and create tools. However, today we don’t need to build tools. With phones, we have near infinite information, entertainment, and communication at our finger tips, we can connect to anyone or anything – instantly. Capture audio, video and picture with a tap. Search our memories with a voice command. Calculate any/all the math equations we can think of, etc. Our technology makes us ever more godlike.</p>
<p>To provide this godlike device to a child is irresponsible. Arguably, even in hands of adults, our devices do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The difference between adults and children, is that children need to <em>learn-to-learn</em>. It’s the most important thing a child can learn. How well a child <em>learns-to-learn </em>will shape their entire life, their potential is defined by how well they can learn. There are several important lessons in learning how to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to self-reflect</li>
<li>Nurturing curiosity</li>
<li>Defining ones goals</li>
<li>Indexing knowledge</li>
<li>Finding motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>There is probably more than goes into learning-to-learn, but that’s a good list for now.</p>
<p>For me, a defining moment was learning to sculpt my character in an effort to find motivation. I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to be. I defined myself and found the motivation I needed, with constant self-reflection to change. Without my time riding bikes, running, playing in the woods, soccer, walking alone, I wouldn’t be who I am today.</p>
<h2>Empathy is Derived from Self</h2>
<p>Having a godlike tool able solve most problems is a double edge sward. A phone is addictive by design. Mobile phones track us and companies learn everything about us, with that information being weaponized against us to maximize “screen time”. Is social media useful? Quite frankly, I’d argue no, social media has a net negative effect. Importantly, social media and games on your mobile device keep you constantly stimulated and often push others agenda(s)[<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>I question if most of the newer generations, born into their environment, have really learned to live in the physical world. Has the newer generation(s) learned to live with and identify themselves? Is there self-reflection and growth? Without an internal dialog, a lot of things break down: personality, autonomy, comfort with being alone, understanding alternative viewpoints… empathy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, [even more concerning] without an internal identity / dialog one doesn’t develop a “classic” ego. If a self-image is typically defined by an internal image and that internal image doesn’t develop, what guides us? Likes? Karma?</p>
<p>This would explain the rise in more extreme moral stances. Such as building a hierarchy based on gender, race, etc. Lack of empathy for others, at the same time garnering more karma, for karma is the value system people can hold themselves to. We no longer need to contemplate who we want to be, because we can receive instant feedback on our actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I suspect this optimizes for short-term gain, but long-term loss to society.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the start of the incredibly destructive cycle, where contemplating or a nuanced opinion is simply not acceptable, because others can’t relate.</p>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<blockquote><p>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.</p>
<p>– Robert A. Heinlein</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a firm believer that life is and should be tough. Growth comes from adaptation, confidence is derived from overcoming challenges. When life is tough, you have to create goals and blaze a trail to somewhere better. This is what it means to be “free”, free to have self-determination, which few embrace.</p>
<p>I wasn’t born to my current “class”. I would say, I was born “big-mac” rich, where you could buy a “big-mac” once a month without worrying about budget. My parents provided shelter, food and clothes, but I started mowing lawns at 12 and working a job by 14 to buy anything I needed beyond food and shelter. Yet today, (14 years &amp; a couple kids later), I’d call myself “iPhone” rich, I can buy something of equivalent cost monthly without worrying about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>My wife and I regularly create two and five year plans. These goals provide motivation. We can ask ourselves,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this activity help hit our five year objective?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is no, then it’s probably not worth doing it. We work hard, we reflect regularly and we try to improve; always iterating towards something better.</p>
<p>To have self-determination, people need to think for themselves. They need to contemplate what they want from life. They need to talk to themselves. Self-determination requires goals, it also requires grappling (or ignoring) others and importantly saying “no” and “yes” based on <em>objectives</em> not <em>desires</em>. In the end, this will make people happier.</p>
<p>It all starts with talking to ones-self, spending time alone and deciding what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<h2>A Bleak Outlook</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the god-like tools we’ve all grown accustom to (especially, when given to kids), seem to disrupt the ability to talk to one-self. In a sense, our phones, media, and general virtual world has taken all our time; this leaves us without time for self-reflection, self-thought, self-actualization. In this stunted world, the AI which manipulates our news replaces the ego we once had.</p>
<p>Complex discussions, real empathy, motivation — are going to be something most of us lose. I’m not sure if society is ready for what we created. It’s a mob of people who’ve never experienced real hardship, who’ve learned a social system designed by virtue signaling (aka trying to game the “karma” systems) and not really learning to live in the real world. Then again, these people will be shaping the real world, for better or worse.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                

<p>GitHub <a href="https://github.blog/2020-02-12-supercharge-your-command-line-experience-github-cli-is-now-in-beta/">just released</a>
their <code>gh</code> CLI, with initial support for issues and pull requests. While it’s
complimentary to <code>git</code>, <code>gh</code> squashes a bunch of otherwise confusing <code>checkout</code>
and <code>pull</code> commands and makes the interface much cleaner.</p>

<p>It’s a slick experience that I’m sure will continue to see growth, and at
some point <code>gh</code> commands will start making an appearance on GitHub docs and
eventually on the main site, for example in the “clone or download” tab on a
repo, the default could be <code>gh clone org/repo</code> instead of using <code>git</code> over
SSH.</p>

<p>As I was reading the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22313874">HN commentary</a>,
I stumbled upon a great question, “why doesn’t GitHub just use files in
a <code>git</code> repo to add issues, pull requests, etc.?” I shared these thoughts
in our group chat with the joke “embrace, extend, extinguish” added on,
a reference to the Justice Department’s description of mid 90’s Microsoft’s
strategy (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish#Examples">many examples</a>).
Given GitHub’s ownership, I was poking fun at what the future might hold,
as several others on the original thread did.</p>

<p>To be clear, I’m not calling the death of <code>git</code>, nor am I particularly mad
that people are building more user friendly tooling on top of it, but it did
get me thinking about building good products with defensible business models.
This post aims to condense those thoughts, as well as point out a few other
areas this seems to be happening in.</p>

<h2 id="embrace-extend-extinguish">Embrace + extend = extinguish?</h2>

<p>As discussed in <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19XXKTibLyNNZdK1TsC3offY67-pTPwMDBp6FLaKCue8/edit#slide=id.g6169143110_0_118">week 3</a>
of <a href="https://mikemcdonald.co/pm-course">my PM course</a>, companies with good business models usually have
certain advantages: the founders are best in class, their products are 10x better
(or cheaper), they have a distribution network that lowers their customer acquisition
costs, or they’ve built up moats that keep competition at bay. Embrace, extend,
extinguish is one of the easiest moat building techniques companies to implement.
Here’s how I’d go about building a company with a good moat.</p>

<p>First off, you need a protocol that is mature enough to have significant usage,
but also crufty enough that features can’t be easily added to it. It also needs
to provide backwards compatibility so legacy users aren’t left behind.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>git</code> (version control)</li>
<li><code>smtp</code> (email)</li>
<li><code>sms</code> (text messaging)</li>
<li><code>sftp</code> (file transfer)</li>
<li><code>rss</code> (content aggregation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, you need a layer of abstraction to cover the implementation, that you can
also run your proprietary API alongside. Email and SMS clients have done this
forever, though they typically don’t deviate too heavily from what’s provided
in the standard. I say typically, because the truly great ones do.</p>

<p>Once your product has sufficiently abstracted the underlying protocol, people
slowly forget how the original worked, where the warts are, etc. and become
increasingly reliant on the higher level of abstraction and backwards
incompatible new functionality.</p>

<p>In the case of <code>gh</code>, once they have commands that take the 80% of <code>git</code> actions
that involve multiple commands that nobody remembers, and wraps them in more
relatable GitHub termed actions, people will forget the ancient ways.</p>

<p>This lays the groundwork for the final step: replacing the legacy protocol with
your new one, and eventually removing it altogether. Once your tool has subsumed
all that functionality, there’s no reason to keep the old one around. You don’t
even need to consciously extinguish anything: your users effectively did that
work for you.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-just-microsoft">More than just Microsoft</h2>

<p>Examples of this are happening all over right now, and it’s not just large
tech companies (though, most of the examples of it working only happen at
certain scale).</p>

<h3 id="imessage-the-goat">iMessage: the 🐐 GOAT 🐐</h3>

<p>As we reach the top of the S-curve of cell phone adoption, Apple has switched
to accessories (e.g. AirPods) as well as services. Apple TV is an obvious
play as is Apple Arcade, but so is the less obvious “Sign in with Apple.”
The fact that it is <em>required</em> to be included when an app includes a
NASCAR login screen is a move I’m surprised hasn’t been challenged. Once
you sign in with Apple on one website or app, it becomes basically impossible
to use the same account on a non-Apple device, because no Android app is even
able to support signing in with Apple. These services all work to keep users
buying Apple devices, as they only work on Apple hardware, and each add a new
layer to the moat around that core business. And of all of them, iMessage is
the best example, in part due to strong social pressure and network effects.</p>

<p>Google has tried to fend this off with RCS (its own extension of SMS, sort
of backed by the telecom industry), but while that brings certain Android
devices up to feature parity (“darker blue bubbles”, read receipts,
typing indicators, etc.), it doesn’t solve the fact that non-iMessage folks
will always be green bubbles in iMessage.</p>

<p>FaceTime is another great example. Remember in 2010 when Steve Jobs (pour
one out) promised it would become an industry standard?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, FaceTime is based on a lot of open standards — H.264 video, AAC audio,
  and a bunch of alphabet soup acronyms — and we’re going to take it all the way.
  We’re going to the standards bodies starting tomorrow, and we’re going to
  make FaceTime an open industry standard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, here we are a decade later, and I can’t use FaceTime on the machine
I’m writing this blog post on. And I’m not surprised: the deep integration
and walled garden of the Apple ecosystem keep selling hardware, and at the
end of the day, as much as Apple wants to be a software (or now, a services)
company, it’s still in the phone business.</p>

<h3 id="spotify-the-home-of-podcasting">Spotify: the home of podcasting</h3>

<p>Podcasts are typically distributed via RSS feed to podcast clients, which are
able to aggregate supply, provide the listener with useful functionality beyond
playing, and also handle ad injection, etc.</p>

<p>Spotify, providing a client as well as an owner of several podcast groups,
is able to aggregate both supply and demand, while adding additional
functionality (e.g. better demographic information for ad targeting).</p>

<p><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/will-spotify-ruin-podcasting">The worry here</a>
is that Spotify gains control of the ecosystem and forks from that standard (or
the standard is otherwise rendered useless), and lots the hallmark diversity of
the podcast ecosystem is lost.</p>

<h3 id="superhuman-coining-the-term-luxury-software">Superhuman: coining the term “luxury software”</h3>

<p>Superhuman is the iMessage to Gmail’s Android (though it actually uses Gmail’s
APIs under the hood!). While Superhuman currently lags Gmail (and many email
clients) in features (for example, formatting is very difficult/non-existent:
try monospace fonts!), but they’ve critically added the blue bubble to Gmail’s
green: <code>Sent from Superhuman</code> below the fold.</p>

<p>Users on Superhuman also have a “user since 201X” in their contact card, and it’s
only a matter of time before they start adding Superhuman-to-Superhuman only
functionality (e.g. reaction emoji to email threads or realtime chat). In effect,
Superhuman becomes the online equivalent of <a href="https://www.thebatterysf.com/">The Battery</a>,
and those not present on the tool get left out of the real world dealflow.</p>

<p>That’s a powerful enough incentive to keep paying $30/month, especially since Bloomberg
charges just over $2000/month for the finance equivalent (chat, meaning access
to the network, being a huge component of the worth). I won’t write any more about
Bloomberg, but if you’re interested I highly recommend <a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-its-hard-to-kill-the-bloomberg-terminal-61073482e496">“You Can’t Kill the Bloomberg Terminal”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="replacing-moats-full-of-money">Replacing moats full of money</h2>

<p>The past several years have seen startups use cash as the moat: e-scooters, food
delivery, mattresses (and almost every other DTC vertical). All of these
are commodity goods, with zero defensibility: the motto was, “the best defense is
a pension funded offense.”</p>

<p>Given the high profile dumpster fires that have come out of that and lackluster IPO
performance of the ones that made it that far, I hope we’ll see more startups picking
defensible positions and having moats grounded in high quality experiences and engineering
choices that result in faster, better, or cheaper products.</p>

<p>As always, I’m interested to hear your thoughts, and if you know of any
other good examples of this, especially among early stage startups, definitely
<a href="mailto:hello@mikemcdonald.co">reach out</a> and let me know!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
I’ve been reading about Eric Yuan, founder of Zoom.
</p>
<p>
Yuan migrated to the USA from China in the 80s. He had heard Bill Gates speak about the internet and he wanted to be a part of the digital revolution. 
</p>
<p>
So he applied for his visa. He was rejected. He applied again. Rejected again.
</p>
<p>
9 tries. It took Eric Yuan 9 tries to finally get his visa for the USA.
</p>
<p>
Once in the USA, he started working at the video conferencing software company WebEx. 
</p>
<p>
He worked there for a decade and rose up the ranks to become the VP of Engineering. 
</p>
<p>
Under Yuan’s leadership, WebEx grew to more than 750 engineers and had an annual revenue of around $1B (and was later acquired by Cisco). Safe to say the company was doing well. 
</p>
<p>
But there was a problem. 
</p>
<p>
The video conferencing software <em>sucked</em>. 
</p>
<p>
Yuan would meet with customers and they would be unhappy. They’d complain about video and audio lag. Connectivity issues. All sorts of stuff. 
</p>
<p>
In Yuan’s own words:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Before I left Cisco I spent a lot of time talking to WebEx customers and every time I talked to them I felt very embarrassed because I did not see a single happy customer, and I tried to understand why that was.
    <span>Eric Yuan</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
So in 2011, Yuan left. He decided to start his own company with the mission of building the best video conferencing software in the world. 
</p>
<p>
After he left, 40 of the 800 engineers he worked with immediately joined him at Zoom. 
</p>
<p>
And according to <a href="https://twitter.com/dscheinm/status/1300544031458553859">this tweet</a>, almost all of the others sent in resumes to work with him. He had something like 1000 job inquiries within a week of announcing his leaving.
</p>
<p>
Talk about engineering loyalty. 
</p>
<p>
Today Zoom is valued at more than $40 billion. The pandemic may have accelerated the company’s growth but make no mistake: this was an overnight success 9 years in the making. 
</p>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>
I think the part that stands out the most to me is that Yuan actually had the courage to leave Cisco and go on to start Zoom. 
</p>
<p>
There is often great inertia that prevents us from leaving jobs we’re unhappy with. 
</p>
<p>
In Yuan’s case, he had by all measures a very successful career ever since he immigrated to the US. Most people in his shoes wouldn’t even bother resigning from a comfortable VP of Engineering position. 
</p>
<p>
So he could have settled and just resigned himself to the fact that maybe video conferencing software was supposed to be like this. After all, there was very little competition in the market. 
</p>
<p>
But he didn’t. He chose discomfort and hundreds of other engineers believed in him. 
</p>
<p>
Keep moving forward and don’t settle. You might be surprised at how many people follow you. 
</p>

<p>Choosing, prioritizing, measuring, and optimizing different channels is a major part of any marketing/growth job.</p>



<p><strong>But there is no such thing as the perfect channel that would work for every company and in every situation.</strong></p>



<p>Once in a while, a new channel might emerge and it might perform better than everything else for certain companies for a period of time. But most of the time there are trade-offs to consider.</p>



<p>In this post, I’m sharing a simple visual guide to selecting the most promising starting channels for testing and understanding their inherent trade-offs.</p>



<h2>Predictability vs. Cost Trade-off</h2>



<p>The performance of some channels is easier to predict before you invest any time or effort. It’s also easier to forecast how they are going to perform in the future. Generally — but not always — these channels tend to cost more as companies are usually willing to pay extra for certainty.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Predictability-vs-cost.png" alt="Predictability vs. cost coordinate system." width="631" height="563" srcset="https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Predictability-vs-cost.png 841w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Predictability-vs-cost-403x360.png 403w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Predictability-vs-cost-560x500.png 560w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Predictability-vs-cost-768x686.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px"></figure>



<h2>Targeting Precision and Consumer/SMB/Enterprise Focus</h2>



<p>One of the most important considerations is how precisely you need to target your prospective customers.</p>



<p>Sometimes you <a type="URL" id="https://max2c.com/how-to-find-your-ideal-customers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://max2c.com/how-to-find-your-ideal-customers/" target="_blank">know exactly who your ideal customers are.</a> For example, your product might solve specific problems that only engineering leaders at large healthcare companies face. Or your product might only appeal to teenagers who are into punk rock. </p>



<p>And at other times you’re selling something that’s more like peanut butter. Almost anyone can try it. Well, expect people with peanut allergy…</p>



<p>The second consideration is whether you’re in a B2C or a B2B business. And if you’re in a B2B business, it’s to distinguish between channels that are more likely to work for the SMB segment and channels that are more likely to work for the enterprise segments.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Targeting-and-size.png" alt="Targeting plus B2C/B2B and company size coordinate system." width="654" height="582" srcset="https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Targeting-and-size.png 872w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Targeting-and-size-405x360.png 405w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Targeting-and-size-562x500.png 562w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Targeting-and-size-768x683.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px"></figure></div>



<h2>Customer Intent and&nbsp;Consumer/SMB/Enterprise Focus</h2>



<p>Another important consideration is how aware your prospective customers are about your product category and how actively they are searching for solutions.</p>



<p>For example, a finance manager might actively look for an accounting software solution. Or a suburban parent might look for pizza delivery. These are well-established categories.</p>



<p>However, if you work at an innovative company, you might find yourself with a novel product or product category that customers don’t know they need. In this case, you usually need to educate them about the existence of your product type and what it can do for them.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Intent-and-size-4.png" alt="Customer intent/awareness plus B2C/B2B and company size coordinate system." width="688" height="581" srcset="https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Intent-and-size-4.png 917w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Intent-and-size-4-426x360.png 426w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Intent-and-size-4-592x500.png 592w, https://max2c.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Intent-and-size-4-768x649.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px"></figure>



<h2>Additional Axes to Consider</h2>



<p>I’ll stop here for now, but here are some additional dimensions to consider:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Scalability</strong>. Even if you can make this channel work, how big can it get?</li><li><strong>Measurability and attribution</strong>. How measurable is this channel, how easy is it to attribute new users, customer leads, and revenue to it?</li><li><strong>Product channel fit</strong>. Is this a channel where the type of product you’re making is typically researched or sold?</li><li><strong>Audience channel fit</strong>. Is this where your audience already is?</li></ul>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>After forming a hypothesis about which channels are likely to work well in your situation, <a href="https://max2c.com/key-growth-metrics-clv-ltv-and-cac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">define success metrics</a>, and run a series of experiments. </p>



<h2><strong>Disclaimers</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>These are just general guidelines. </strong>Each company is unique. Each product is unique. One could easily come up with many exceptions, “refuting” the location of each channel on these maps. The goal is to outline the general patterns in broad strokes and provide a starting place for people who might not know where to start.</li><li><strong>There is no perfect “mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive” framework for marketing/growth channels.</strong> They’ll overlap no matter how you slice and dice them. There’s also debate on whether some of these channels should be considered even channels or strategies that reinforce multiple channels. For instance, content can be used across multiple channels — from social and SEO to even outbound sales.</li><li><strong>In reality, each of these bubbles can be both wider and taller. </strong>But that would make for a messy chart. For example, take podcasts or PR. You can make them more or less targeted depending on specific tactics and partners you choose. For example, if anyone can be your customer, you might partner with podcasts that cover a wide range of topics and whose subscribers include a wide range of demographics. But if you are targeting a very specific decision-maker at a specific company, you might sponsor a niche podcast. It’s the same with PR. That being said, these channels will still on average allow for less targeting than SEM ads, LinkedIn ads or outbound emails.</li></ul>



<p>I hope you found these coordinate system charts helpful. Please feel free to share with your colleagues or friends and let me know if you have feedback!</p>

<p>In 2001, Trevor Jim (AT&amp;T Research) and Greg Morrisett (Cornell) launched
a joint project to develop a safe dialect of the C programming language,
an outgrowth of earlier work on
<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/talc/">Typed Assembly Language</a>.
After five years of hard work and some published
<a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Papers/">papers</a>,
the team (including Dan Grossman, Michael Hicks, Nik Swamy, and
<a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/People/">others</a>)
released <a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/">Cyclone 1.0</a>.
And then the developers moved on to other things.</p>

<p>Few have heard of Cyclone and almost no one has used it.
And yet, when you throw the right rock into a receptive pond,
waves of influence ripple outwards.
Cyclone was a large, well-fashioned stone; the ripples of its zeitgeist,
as well as the notable innovations it distilled and pioneered,
continue to spread in fascinating ways.</p>

<p>Before telling this story, here is my warning:
Innovation and influence is a complicated social process.
Nothing new happens in a vacuum.
Thousands of people throw interesting rocks into the pond every year,
influenced by rocks tossed earlier.
No single post can do justice to all these chaotic ripples.</p>

<p>To keep this story coherent and digestible, I focus on certain themes:
progress in the evolution of
static safety and the application of linearity to memory management and concurrence,
as manifested in a few chosen mainstream (“imperative”) programming languages.
This means tons of relevant and important detail about influential academic languages
and research will receive insufficient attention.
Don’t let my editorial shortcomings mislead you into a simplistic understanding of cause and effect.
Instead, be curious, explore the historical record,
and appreciate the contributions of so many pioneers.</p>

<h2 id="cyclone">Cyclone</h2>

<p>At the end of the 20th century, systems software was usually built
using C (or pre-“modern” C++).
Because their semantics closely mirror the way CPUs are used,
these languages produce lean, high-performance systems.
The price one pays for this efficiency is the risk of safety bugs,
such as buffer overflows,
making our critical systems vulnerable to malicious actors.</p>

<p>The goal of the Cyclone team was
to build a C-compatible language that was at least as fast and lean,
but much, much safer. Their notion of safety was radical for its time:
unsafe programs should be hard to write, impossible to compile,
and panic when safety violations are encountered at runtime.</p>

<p>Vulnerabilities targeted for extinction included: buffer overflow,
null pointer de-referencing, use-after-free, dangling pointers, double free,
format string attacks, uninitialized variable use, unsafe casts,
indefinite returns, cross-scope gotos, and undiscriminated unions.</p>

<p>The primary weapon of choice for improving safety (and versatility)
came from strengthening C’s notoriously
weak type systems through the skillful application of
prior art from ML, Haskell, and published research, particularly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Algebraic data types</strong>. Although C supports product types
with <code>struct</code>, use of <code>union</code> for sum types can be unsafe. Instead,
Cyclone introduces fixed-size <a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Tagged%20Unions/">tagged unions</a>,
variable-sized <a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Datatypes/">datatypes</a>,
and <a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Pattern%20Matching/">pattern matching</a>.
Cyclone also supports tuples, enabling functions to return multiple values.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Quantified types</strong>. Cyclone supports
<a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Cyclone%20for%20C%20Programmers/#PolymorphicFunctions">parametric polymorphism</a>
(generics) on functions and types.
Despite being constrained to word-sized types and unable to monomorphize,
this feature is sufficient for supporting type-generic boxed collections.
Cyclone also supports abstract,
<a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Existential%20types/">existential types</a>,
with similar limitations.
Similar to traits, these allow use of method-like functions across
differently-implemented concrete types.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Region-based memory management</strong>.
Cyclone was heavily inspired by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management#Region_inference">Tofte and Talpin</a>’s
seminal work on regional inference in the mid-1990s. As implemented in
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220606837_A_Retrospective_on_Region-Based_Memory_Management">ML Kit</a>
(with Birkedal and others),
whole program inference made it possible to replace the use of
garbage-collected (GC) memory with faster, scope-nested memory regions (arenas).
Related work by Aiken applied arenas and ref-counted memory management to C.
The Cyclone team improved on these techniques,
replacing cross-functional inference with explicit
<a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Memory%20Management%20Via%20Regions/">region</a> annotations.
Importantly, they enriched this scheme to
support an unheard-of variety of safe, automatic memory management strategies:
arena regions (including first-class arenas), reference-counted,
tracing GC (via Boehm), and something they call the
<em>unique</em> region.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Linear/affine types</strong>. Cyclone’s
<a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Pointers%20with%20Restricted%20Aliasing/#UniquePointers"><em>unique</em> region</a>
is a useful application of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_logic">linear logic</a>
work from the late 1980s by Girard, refined later by Wadler and then Walker.
By guaranteeing that allocated memory will only ever have
one owner (reference), we get safe, deterministic memory management
without run-time GC bookkeeping costs. Reference-counted memory management
is also more efficient when built using linear logic.
That said, linear logic (and regions) adds complexity to a language in terms
of move semantics and quantified types, challenges the Cyclone team
had to work through.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Cyclone%20for%20C%20Programmers/#Pointers">Pointers</a>
required the most work to make them safe:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Null pointers</strong>.
Cyclone addressed Tony Hoare’s so-called “billion dollar mistake” by offering a choice.
You may define pointers as non-nullable (e.g., <code>int @x</code>) and use them freely and safely.
Or, if you do need a nullable pointer, the compiler will not let you de-reference it
until you demonstrate first that it is not null.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Fat and bounded pointers</strong>.
To protect against buffer overflows, Cyclone offers “fat” pointers (<code>char ?</code>),
which bake in accurate bounds data next to the pointer.
Pointer arithmetic is allowed, but any attempt to
access elements outside the bounds triggers a runtime error.
Bounded pointers offer similar capability in a somewhat different way.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Memory-safe pointers</strong>.
To ensure pointers can only access valid, live data,
a pointer type can be annotated with the region its object acquired memory from.
This annotation ensures that the object
is freed only when the last usable pointer to that object expires.
Using data flow analysis, pointers to stack allocated data are also kept safe.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Polymorphic pointers</strong>.
With so many type annotations on pointers, type safety could
force us to duplicate code (or use generics) for every possible
pointer variation being passed to functions.
Cyclone overcame this usability challenge by supporting
<a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Pointer%20Subtyping/">polymorphic pointer types</a>,
which accommodate a wide variety of pointer types safely.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>More could be said about Cyclone’s safety extensions
(e.g., <a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Cyclone%20for%20C%20Programmers/#Exceptions">exception handling</a> and
<a href="https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Definite%20Assignment/">definite assignment</a>),
but I think you get the point.
The Cyclone team was diligent and thorough about hunting down
and mitigating safety vulnerabilities.
They even worked through a static type strategy for
making <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~djg/papers/cycthreads.pdf">multi-threading safe</a>,
using thread locks and thread-local data.</p>

<p>Remarkably, all these safety and versatility improvements were designed to preserve
as much backward compatibility with C as possible.
For understandable reasons, they wanted to make the path to safety
as painless as possible for existing C programmers.
Their papers show helpful examples where C code was ported to Cyclone,
showing benchmark results that illustrate that safety need not
incur a steep performance penalty.</p>

<h2 id="c-ownership-and-aliasing">C++, Ownership and Aliasing</h2>

<p>Before going forward in time, I want to contrast Cyclone’s
safe memory management journey with that of C++.
C++’s memory management rests on two key features available before 1990:
templates (more versatile and complex than typical generics) and
Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII).
Using RAII, a program can acquire and use some resource local to a block,
and expect the compiler to automatically
destroy that resource at the end of that block.
However, RAII does not work with objects dynamically allocated using <code>new</code>.</p>

<p>To address the potential for leaks due to forgotten <code>delete</code>s,
the 1997 standard introduced <code>auto_ptr</code>, the first “smart” pointer.
This template-defined feature acts like a pointer, while still
empowering RAII to ensure automatic deletion of the owned object.
Even better, <code>auto_ptr</code> was linear-like<sup>1</sup>:
Only one variable owned the pointed-at resource.
Assignment would transfer ownership.</p>

<p>However, <code>auto_ptr</code> had a fatal design flaw, limiting its usefulness.
In 2002, inspired by Andrew Koenig from Bell Labs, Howard Hinnant authored
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2002/n1377.htm#move_ptr%20Example">“A proposal to add move semantics to C++”</a>.
A key motivation was performance:
copying a pointer non-destructively is far cheaper than any sort of deep copy.
The standards process resulted with <code>unique_ptr</code> replacing <code>auto_ptr</code>
in 2005’s technical report (TR1) and ultimately C++11.
The same standard also introduced <code>shared_ptr</code>, a ref-counted smart pointer,
based on practices dating back to the late 1990s.</p>

<p>Thus, by 2006, divergent influences had resulted in both Cyclone and C++
supporting the same two forms of automatic memory management:
single owner (linear) and reference counted.
That said, Cyclone’s region-based memory management was more
versatile (as it also supported arenas and tracing GC) and far safer.</p>

<p>When it came to rigorous memory safety, the Cyclone team had a deeper well of academic research
and prior practice to leverage.
Besides the influences I mentioned earlier, they drew on
alias types (Smith and Walker, 2000, as implemented in Typed Assembly Language),
Objective C’s use of reference counting,
as well as the influential <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/2/234356-separation-logic/fulltext">separation logic</a>
(Reynolds, O’Hearn, Pym, 2000-2002).
As Greg Morrisett says: “Cyclone’s contribution was to find a common framework to put a bunch of different things in.”</p>

<p>The handling of “borrowed” references illustrates the safety gap
between Cyclone and C++.
Using <code>get()</code> on a C++ smart pointers returns a aliased pointer.
Since C++ does no tracking to ensure pointer aliases are always safe to use,
it is problematically easy to use a pointer after the object it points to has been freed.</p>

<p>Cyclone also has a way to create a polymorphic pointer borrowed from any region-based pointer.
In contrast to C++, Cyclone carefully tracks the scope lifetime of every
borrowed pointer, often implicitly. Sophisticated compile-time analysis of
region lifetimes (including …</p></div></div>

<p>“AI is the new electricity.” At least, that’s what <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng">Andrew Ng</a> suggested at this year’s <a href="https://remars.amazon.com/">Amazon re:MARS</a> conference. In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2nGxw8sKYU">keynote address</a>, Ng discussed the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) — its steady march into industry after industry; the unrelenting presence of AI breakthroughs, technologies, or fears in the headlines each day; the tremendous amount of investment, both from established enterprises seeking to modernize (see: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/19/sony-ai/">Sony</a>, a couple of weeks ago) as well as from venture investors parachuting into the market riding a wave of AI-focused founders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“AI is the next big transformation,” Ng insists, and we’re watching the transformation unfold.</p>



<p>While AI may be the new electricity (and as a Data Scientist at <a href="http://comet.ml/">Comet</a>, I don’t need much convincing), significant challenges remain for the field to realize this potential.<strong> In this blog post, I’m going to talk about why data scientists and teams can’t rely on the tools and processes that software engineering teams have been using for the last 20 years for machine learning</strong> <strong>(ML).&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The reliance on the tools and processes of software engineering makes sense – data science and software engineering are both disciplines whose principal tool is<em> code</em>. Yet <em>what is being done</em> in data science teams is radically different from what is being done in software engineering teams. An inspection of the core differences between the two disciplines is a helpful exercise in clarifying how we should think about structuring our tools and processes for doing AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Comet, we believe the adoption of tools and processes designed specifically for AI will help practitioners unlock and enable the type of revolutionary transformation Ng is speaking about.</p>



<h2>Different Disciplines, Different Processes</h2>



<p>Software engineering is a discipline whose aim is, considered broadly, the design and implementation of programs that a computer can execute to perform a defined function. Assuming the input to a software program is within the expected (or constrained) range of inputs, its behavior is knowable. In a <a href="https://leon.bottou.org/talks/2challenges">talk</a> at ICML in 2015, Leon Bottou formulated this well: in software engineering an algorithm or program can be proven <em>correct</em>, in the sense that given particular assumptions about the input, certain properties will be true when the algorithm or program terminates.</p>

<p>

The provable correctness of software programs has shaped the tools and processes we have built for doing software engineering. Consider one corollary characteristic of software programming that follows from provable correctness: if a program is provably correct for some input values, then the program contains sub-programs that are also provably correct for those input values. This is why engineering processes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_agile_framework">Agile</a> are, broadly speaking, successful and productive for software teams. Breaking apart these projects into sub-tasks works. Most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">scrum</a> implementations also include sub-tasking as well.</p>

</figure>

<p>We see a lot of data science teams using workflow processes that are identical or broadly similar to these software methodologies. Unfortunately, they don’t work very well. The reason? The provable correctness of software engineering does not extend to AI and machine learning. In (supervised) machine learning, the only guarantee we have about a model we’ve built is that if the training set is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">iid</a> (independent and identically distributed) sample from some distribution, then performance on another iid sample from the same distribution will be <em>close</em> to the performance on the training set. Because uncertainty is an intrinsic property of machine learning, sub-tasking can lead to unforeseeable downstream effects.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Why is uncertainty intrinsic to machine learning?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Part of the answer lies in the fact that the problems that are both (a) interesting to us and (b) amenable to machine learning solutions (self-driving cars, object recognition, labeling images, and generative language models, to name a few) do not have a clear reproducible mathematical or programmatic specification. In place of specifications, machine learning systems feed in lots of data in order to detect patterns and generate predictions. Put another way, the <em>purpose of machine learning is to create a statistical proxy that can serve as a specification for one of these tasks</em>. We hope our collected data is a representative subsample of the real-world distribution, but in practice we cannot know exactly how well this condition is met. Finally, the algorithms and model architectures we use are complex, sufficiently complex that we cannot always break them apart into sub-models to understand precisely what is happening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From this description, obstacles to the <em>knowability</em> of machine learning systems should be somewhat obvious. Inherent to the types of problems amenable to machine learning is a lack of a clear mathematical specification. The statistical proxy we use in the absence of a specification is accumulating lots of environmental data we <em>hope</em> is iid and representative. And the models we use to extract patterns from this collected data are sufficiently complex that we cannot reliably break them apart and understand precisely how they work. My colleague at Comet, Dhruv Nair, has written a three-part series on uncertainty in machine learning (here’s a link to <a href="https://www.comet.ml/blog/?p=662">Part I</a>) if you’d like to dig deeper into this topic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consider, then, the implications for something like the Agile methodology used on a machine learning project. We cannot possibly hope to break machine learning tasks into <em>sub-tasks</em>, tackled as part of some larger sprint and then pieced together like legos into a whole product, platform, or feature, because we cannot reliably predict how the sub-models, or the model itself, will function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ng discussed this topic at re:MARS as well. He revealed how his team adopted a workflow system designed specifically for ML: <strong>1 day sprints</strong>, structured as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build models and write code each day</li>
<li>Set up training and run experiments overnight</li>
<li>Analyze results in the morning and…</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>

<p>Ng’s 1 day sprints methodology reflects something crucial to understanding and designing teams that practice machine learning: it is an inherently <strong>experimental science</strong>. Because the systems being built lack a clear specification, because data collection is an imperfect science, and because machine learning models are incredibly complex, <em>experimentation is necessary</em>. Rather than structuring team processes around a multi-week sprint, it is usually more fruitful to test out many different architectures, feature engineering choices, and optimization methods rapidly until a rough image of what is working and what isn’t starts to emerge. 1 day sprints allow teams to move quickly, test many hypotheses in a short amount of time, and begin building intuition and knowledge around a modeling task.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Tools for ML: Experiment Management&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Let’s say you adopt Andrew Ng’s 1 day sprints methodology or something similar (<em>and you should</em>). You’re setting new hyperparameters, tweaking your feature selections, and running experiments each night. What tool are you using to keep track of these decisions for each model training? How are you comparing experiments to see how different configurations are working? How are you sharing experiments with co-workers? Can your manager or co-worker reliably reproduce an experiment you ran yesterday?</p>

<p>In addition to processes, the tools you use to do machine learning matter as well. At Comet, our mission is to help companies extract business value from machine learning by providing a tool that does this for you. Most of the data science teams we speak to are stuck using a combination of git, emails, and (believe it or not) spreadsheets to record all of the artifacts around each experiment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

Consider a modeling task where you’re keeping track of 20 hyperparameters, 10 metrics, dozens of architectures and feature engineering techniques, all while iterating quickly and running dozens of models a day. It can become incredibly tedious to manually track all of these artifacts. Building a good ML model can oftentimes resemble tuning a radio with 50 knobs. If you don’t keep track of all of the configurations you’ve tried, the combinatorial complexity of finding the signal in your modeling space can become cumbersome.</p>

<p><span>We’ve built Comet based on these needs (and what we wanted when we were working on data science and machine learning ourselves, at Google, IBM, and as part of research groups at Columbia University and Yale University). Every time you train a model, there should be </span><em>something</em><span> to capture all of the artifacts of your experiment and save them in some central ledger where you can look up, compare, and filter through all of your (or your team’s) work. Comet was built to provide this function to practitioners of machine learning.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Measuring workflow efficiency is a <a href="https://gravityflow.io/articles/measure-workflow-automations-roi/">notoriously difficult</a> thing to do, but on average our users report&nbsp;<em>20-30% time savings by using Comet</em> (note: Comet is free for individuals and researchers – <a href="https://www.comet.ml/pricing?opensignup=true&amp;utm_source=Software%20Eng%20vs%20ML&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Software%20Eng%20vs%20ML%20Blog%20Post">you can sign-up here</a>). This doesn’t take into account unique insights and knowledge that arise from having access to a visual understanding of your hyperparameter space, real-time metric tracking, team-wide collaboration and experiment comparison. Access to this knowledge enables time savings as well as, and perhaps more importantly, the ability to <em>build better models</em>.</p>

<h2><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h2>

<p>It is tempting to ignore questions about ML tools and processes altogether.

<h2>The Problem</h2>



<p>I have been working on an application that, at it’s heart, stores a large amount of data that is organized primarily through the use of a foreign key and a timestamp field. The table’s own primary key is UUID based, combining the foreign key with a UUID for the individual record itself, and it has a single primary data field that utilizes a JSONB type since it can receive arbitrary data. The table sees frequent, regular inserts, and periodic deletions, with old data being thinned out over time, but for each foreign key, there may be tens of thousands of records distributed amongst hundreds of thousands, or millions of other records for other foreign keys.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Column</th><th data-align="center">Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>id</td><td data-align="center">uuid</td></tr><tr><td>server_id</td><td data-align="center">uuid</td></tr><tr><td>data</td><td data-align="center">jsonb</td></tr><tr><td>created_at</td><td data-align="center">timestamp(6) without time zone</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Basic Table Schema</figcaption></figure>



<p>This was all very simple, but when the time came to start writing the code that generates data graphs from this table, I encountered a puzzle.</p>



<p>How does one ensure that the API doesn’t return too much data? Too many data points just means sending more data than the user probably needs, and it results in the graphing tool having to work with more data than it wants for quick, responsive performance, as well.</p>



<p>And how does one, efficiently, find that data without running a query take takes a burdensome amount of time? In our case, the data is being returned to a React based front end by an API, and snappy application performance hinges on snappy API performance.</p>



<h2>THe first solution</h2>



<p>Early in the history of the application, I arrived at a solution. If I had a maximum cap on the number of data points to query, such as 500, I could query the total count of records which matched my query, and then a little integer division would give me an interval to use when querying.</p>



<p>Counting the data points is simple. It looks something like this:</p>


<pre title="">sql = &lt;&lt;-ESQL
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  telemetries
WHERE
  server_id = $1
  AND created_at BETWEEN $2 AND $3
  AND data ? 'load_avg'
ESQL

count = 0_64
DBH.using_connection do |conn|
  count = conn.query_one(sql, uuid, start_date, end_date, as: {Int64})
end
</pre>


<p>Once the count of records is determined, an interval can be calculated which will be used to query the sample of records.</p>



<p>i.e. if there are 5000 data points, and I want to sample 500 of them, then I need to query every 10th record. It looks something like this to find that interval:</p>


<pre title="">row_modulo = count // limit
row_modulo = 1 if row_modulo == 0
</pre>


<p>Once one has an interval, there is a technique that can be used with Postgresql to select records on that interval. The <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-window.html" target="_blank">row_number()</a></code> is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/tutorial-window.html" target="_blank">window function</a> that assigns a sequential number to each row in a result set. Once each record has a monotonically increasing sequential number assigned to it, that number can be used in a <code>WHERE</code> clause.</p>


<pre title="">SELECT
  stuff,
  ROW_NUMBER()
    OVER (ORDER BY created_at ASC)
    AS row
FROM
  mytable
WHERE
  row % 10 = 0
</pre>


<p>This example would <code>select</code>, for every 10th record from <code>mytable</code>, the <code>stuff</code> field. </p>



<p>In the context of full, working code, assembling that query looked like this:</p>


<pre title="">sql = &lt;&lt;-ESQL
SELECT
  t.*
FROM (
  SELECT
    data,
    created_at,
    row_number()
      OVER (ORDER BY created_at ASC)
      AS row
  FROM
    telemetries
  WHERE
    server_id = $1
    AND created_at BETWEEN $2 AND $3
    AND data ? 'load_avg'
) 
AS t
WHERE
  t.row %#{row_modulo} = 0
ESQL
</pre>


<p>This worked! It’s a viable general technique when you want to select every nth record from some result set, and you want to make the database do the work instead of your application. It’s also almost always faster and less resource intensive to do data management like this inside the database than it is to pull all of the data into your application and make it responsible for sorting through the data and pruning unneeded rows.</p>



<h2>A Wrinkle: Counting Isn’t Cheap!</h2>



<p>There are a couple of performance problems with this approach that become apparent when the table starts significantly growing.</p>



<p>First, pulling a <code>count</code> is not cheap. MySQL maintains a global record count for tables as part of it’s MyISAM data format. PostgreSQL, however, uses something called a multi-version concurrency control strategy with its tables, which essentially means that different views of a database may see different sets of rows. Thus there is no one single, simple count of records for it to fall back on. Thus, when you count records in a table in PostgreSQL, the database is required to actually walk through the data and count all of the visible records.</p>



<p>This is a relatively intense, and thus slow process.</p>



<p>If you simply want an estimate of the number of total rows in a  table, there is a way to get that very cheaply:</p>


<pre title="">SELECT
  reltuples::bigint
    AS estimated_count
FROM
  pg_class
WHERE
  relname = 'mytable'
</pre>


<div><p>This doesn’t work when you want to count only a subset of records, though, and this value is only an estimate. It is the estimate that the query planner uses, so it should generally always be within about 10% of the real value, but it is unlikely to ever match exactly unless the table size changes only rarely.</p><p>There are other counting strategies, but they all have tradeoffs or inherent inaccuracies, so for this use case, there is no getting around paying that up-front time and resource cost just to get a count of records to use when calculating the query interval that is needed.</p></div>



<p>The second expensive part of this technique is the use of <code>row_number()</code> in combination with a modulo (%) in the <code>WHERE</code> clause. This means that the database must traverse every possible record when running the query in order to figure out which ones satisfy the <code>WHERE</code> clause. So if there are 150000 records, but one only wants 500 of them, all 150000 will still be scanned.</p>



<p>These factors combine to make this approach brutally, unusably slow for queries that are intended to be ran ad hoc, and quickly, as part of an API driving a UI.</p>


<pre title="">                                                                      QUERY PLAN                                                                      
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Subquery Scan on t  (cost=105.19..2583.85 rows=1 width=387) (actual time=418.318..26002.490 rows=545 loops=1)
   Filter: ((t."row" % '49'::bigint) = 0)
   Rows Removed by Filter: 26198
   -&gt;  WindowAgg  (cost=105.19..2582.55 rows=87 width=387) (actual time=210.259..25995.686 rows=26743 loops=1)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Heap Scan on telemetries  (cost=105.19..2581.46 rows=87 width=379) (actual time=210.248..25959.166 rows=26743 loops=1)
               Recheck Cond: (data ? 'load_avg'::text)
               Filter: (server_id = 'a0dcc312-0623-af60-4dc0-238301cc9bf8'::uuid)
               Rows Removed by Filter: 178886
               Heap Blocks: exact=39489
               -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on telemetries_data_idx  (cost=0.00..105.17 rows=689 width=0) (actual time=101.188..101.188 rows=205629 loops=1)
                     Index Cond: (data ? 'load_avg'::text)
 Planning Time: 1.860 ms
 Execution Time: 26006.389 ms

</pre>


<p>This is a real example of a query on a real database using the prior technique, and this example had the advantage that the index that it uses (a <code>BTREE</code> index across the data field, since in production we are limiting results to fields that have one specific type of data) was already warm and cached in the database’s working set when I ran this example, so this result was a best case for this technique, on this database. If that index were not available, or were not used, it would have been even slower given that this index filter rejected almost 180,000 rows. That’s too slow to be triggered directly via an API request, as the user will be waiting a half-minute for data to even begin to show up in their browser.</p>



<h2>There has to be a better way</h2>



<p>It turns out that Postgresql offers a high performance option to sample a random set of data in a table. There is a <code><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TABLESAMPLE</a></code> clause that can be placed in the <code>FROM</code> section of a query that will sample a subset of a table.</p>


<pre title="">SELECT
  data
FROM
  mytable
  TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM(5)
</pre>


<p>This would return a roughly random set of about 5% of <code>mytable</code>‘s rows. If one wants a specific number of rows, there is an extension that can provide that, <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/tsm-system-rows.html" target="_blank">tsm_system_rows</a></code>.</p>


<pre title="">SELECT
  data
FROM
  mytable
  TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM_ROWS(500)
</pre>


<p>This would return a random-ish set of 500 rows from the table. A <code>WHERE</code> clause can be used in a query that uses <code>TABLESAMPLE</code> in order to select only the rows of interest, but the <code>TABLESAMPLE</code> is applied before the <code>WHERE</code> clause, which makes this method unsuitable for my use case. As an example:</p>


<pre title="">SELECT
  data,
  created_at
FROM
  telemetries
  TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM_ROWS(500)
WHERE
  server_id = $1
</pre>


<p>This would first select 500 random rows from the entire data set, and would then try to find records from that set which matched the <code>WHERE</code> clause. This would probably result in the query only returning a very small, and fairly unpredictable number of rows of data that is actually wanted. Also, because the records are random, there is no guarantee that they are evenly distributed through the data set. This might be fine if the data is being queried for statistical reasons, but it isn’t ideal when pulling data for graphs.</p>



<p>So while TABLESAMPLE can be a very fast way to select a random set of records over an entire table, it doesn’t work when we want a set of rows that is evenly distributed through the data set, but is only for a segment of the table’s total data, and for which we want to have some predictable control over the number of rows selected.</p>



<h2>Other Meanderings</h2>



<p>There are other solutions available when the problem to be solved is the random selection of table rows, but none of them are particularly useful for the selection of N or close-to N evenly distributed data points, and there is limited inspiration that can be found from them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Consider the code review. It's part of many people's daily development practice.
Easily available code review tooling has allowed us to review code far more
often, and has helped us improve and maintain the quality of our software.</p> <p>But it could be so much better.</p> <h2 id="a-typical-review-based-development-process"><a href="#a-typical-review-based-development-process">#</a> A typical review-based development process</h2> <p>Consider a typical code review workflow.</p> <ol><li>The author of a change submits a patch.</li> <li>A reviewer makes some comments about the change. A discussion ensues,
concluding in a few additional changes being made to the patch.</li> <li>In parallel, a CI system builds and tests the change, and puts a green
checkmark next to the patch for everybody to see.</li> <li>The reviewer observes that CI passed, and that all problems were resolved to
their satisfaction.</li> <li>Someone applies the patch to the main codebase.</li></ol> <p>This is implemented in many forms, but is often mail based (like the Linux
kernel) or web based (like Github). Everything here is assuming some git-based
workflow.</p> <h2 id="what-have-we-wrought"><a href="#what-have-we-wrought">#</a> What have we wrought?</h2> <p>Having gone through all of this, what do you end up with?</p> <ul><li>A high quality update to the codebase</li> <li>A merge commit bearing the name of the person who applied the patch</li> <li>If you care enough (we do), digital signatures on all the source and merge
commits.</li></ul> <p>But it's missing quite a lot.</p> <ul><li>The code review correspondence is sitting over in another system. Perhaps it's
a mailing list archive, or perhaps it's a database run by a SaaS tool vendor.
Regardless, it's not directly represented in your history, and it's not
signed.</li> <li>The test results and artifacts are elsewhere as well, perhaps in a different
system.</li> <li>In order to find these things, you have to know where to look. The merge
commit does not actually reference everything that went in to it.</li></ul> <h2 id="a-merge-commit-is-an-attestation"><a href="#a-merge-commit-is-an-attestation">#</a> A merge commit is an attestation</h2> <p>A signed merge commit should be a statement to the world: "I certify this change
is a good one." What's currently missing from that is any notion of how you knew
it was a good change. All the information generated as part of the review
process should be treated as information contributing to the merge. In git
terms, it's all relevant content, and should have an impact on the merge
commit's SHA.</p> <p>For code review, the messages (the correspondence of the review) and context of
the discussion (the part of the code they are talking about and which revision)
should be preserved in the same way as code changes. All comments in the code
review should be signed by their authors.</p> <p>The same principles can be applied to tests as well, but with more moving parts.
The definitions of the tests and the test results are all content, of the same
class as review comments. They should be signed in some way, with a key that is
accessible to the CI infrastructure. A more thorough setup might consider the
content hash of the toolchain used to build the software as content as well, or
perhaps even a hash of the entire CI system image.</p> <p>All of this information should be visible as part of the merge commit, allowing
the merger to say "THIS is how I know the change was good", and to apply their
digital signature to that evidence.</p> <h2 id="a-straw-man-technical-approach"><a href="#a-straw-man-technical-approach">#</a> A straw-man technical approach</h2> <p>This idea is currently little more than that: an idea. But I have a simple
approach that is fairly sound, and has some legs.</p> <p>Consider the requirements laid out above: it is clear that some of the artifacts
we want in the history of a merge commit really don't belong in regular source
control. Or at least not in source-control proper. But there's no reason they
couldn't live in a different git repository.</p> <p>A simple, general way to implement this could be to introduce a standard way to
talk about cross-repository links as a commit message footer. It should contain
the SHA of the commit on the other end, ensuring the content-dependency. It
should also contain a tag describing what kind of content is found on the other
end -- is it test evidence, a review, or something else entirely?</p> <p>The scheme is fairly generic. It also paves the way for a simple verification
tool, which can walk the dependencies, check signatures, and perhaps check that
required tags are present based on pre-configured rules.</p> <h2 id="certified-development"><a href="#certified-development">#</a> Certified Development</h2> <p>With a system like this, you can audit the history of a Git repository to see if
a particular development process was followed. All the required information is
available in the commit log. This compares very well with typical
documentation-based approaches, which amount to nothing more than a piece of
paper saying that the process was followed.</p> <p>It is also clearly much better than typical workflow-based process enforcers in
terms of the resulting artifact. At the end of development, you have a git
repository that fully represents everything that went into the code. This is
where the information belongs, not in a third party database.</p> <p>This technique can scale beyond direct implementation development, and into
requirements management and design processes as well. If you can manage your
requirements and design documents in the same way as source code (and you REALLY
should, if you aren't already), then you can track revisions to those documents
in the same fully traceable and verifiable way. A verification procedure can
check that you have performed any required design updates that may have been
required by a requirements change; this kind of process is required by
functional safety standards.</p> <h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary">#</a> Summary</h2> <p>By bringing your requirements, designs, code, tests, and reviews into Git's
content addressable storage system, you get many benefits:</p> <ul><li>Full revision control of all documents, with digitally signed change tracking</li> <li>A uniform, traceable, and signed review process</li> <li>A canonical record of all changes to your software along with everything that
went into them</li> <li>The ability to mechanically verify that required processes were followed along
the way</li></ul> <p>This is a vision, really, a description of what could be. I hope that it spurs
some thinking about your own development process, or perhaps even helps a future
tool-maker to consider their goals a little bit differently.</p></div></div>]]>

		<h2>What we learned working from home during the pandemic</h2>
<p><span>Welcome to those who have come to this post. For starters, I am going to tell you a little about the place where I’m working. We are an <a href="https://uruit.com/">Uruguayan company</a> based in Uruguay and Colombia that’s dedicated to software development (mobile and web) and user-centered design. Currently, we have more than 90 employees from different countries.</span></p>
<p><span>In this post I want to share with you <strong>how my team known as People Care (aka HR), faced the pandemic.</strong> Also, how we’ve supported other UruITers (that’s what we call our colleagues) in adapting to the changes that it has brought about, both the logistical ones and cultural ones. As a team, we’ve been working hand in hand with all of our employees who are in both countries. I myself am in Uruguay, although only physically really, because there’s a level of warmth that makes us feel so close to Colombia that only physical distance separates us.</span></p>
<h4>Getting ready for the storm</h4>
<p><span>As a software company, we were prepared and already had the necessary conditions for <a href="https://uruit.com/blog/tips-for-working-remotely/">working remotely</a> during the pandemic, which was an advantage. For some UruITers, remote work was not a novelty either. <strong>“Work From Home” has been part of our company policy for years, so we already had remote work best practices.</strong> In the People Care team, we found ourselves with the challenge of digitizing every one of our processes to the max. We had to start rethinking strategies and new ways of working that would keep us all highly connected, since our people are the ones who deliver the quality behind everything we do.</span></p>
<p><span>After five months of having changed our way of working, it seems like now is a good opportunity to share with you</span><b><i> how </i></b><span>we have</span> <span>been addressing this transition, despite all of the uncertainty and not knowing when it will end. In this post, <strong>I’ll cover the problems we faced, our approach for tackling them, and some challenges</strong> that we as a leadership team have overcome in order to keep the focus on the business, our people, and results. We invite you to learn about our improvement process, our transformation and lessons learned.</span></p>
<h3><span>Going Remote</span></h3>
<p><span>At the time of crisis, we had to reinvent ourselves which was a challenge felt by every team inside UruIT. Since March 16th, 2020, we’ve all been working remotely from our homes. At that moment of general concern, the question for us as a People Care team was “Where do we start?” That’s how we decided to start with the most important thing: The UruITers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Our focus was on keeping the spaces and moments for integration, well-being, and communication alive.</strong> However, we shifted to the digital level, unlike the face-to-face instances that we frequently have. In the presence of chaos, we saw the importance of stopping and reviewing our tasks that we had been working on to understand and think about what was happening and thus, define a course of action.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s what we did and recommend for getting started with remote work:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://uruit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-1-min-1024x576.png" alt="remote work best practices" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://uruit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-1-min-1024x576.png 1024w, https://uruit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-1-min-300x169.png 300w, https://uruit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-1-min-768x432.png 768w, https://uruit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-1-min-1536x864.png 1536w, https://uruit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-1-min-750x422.png 750w, https://uruit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-1-min-1140x641.png 1140w, https://uruit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-1-min.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<h4><span>Provide Support for your Team</span></h4>
<p><span>From the beginning, we focused on having one-on-one talks to gain insights on how the situation was going. Although many were used to working remotely, we had to accept the fact that it was now mandatory to work this way.</span></p>
<p><span>Considering that it was a very sudden change, the goal of these talks was mainly to know the emotional state of each person (if there were experiencing episodes of stress, anxiety or fear; to know how their family was, with whom they were living during the pandemic or if they were alone; identify in general terms who needed support). We also tried to find out how they were working. In addition, <strong>we wanted to know if they had any difficulty that prevented them from carrying out their work effectively</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Know Your Priorities</span></h4>
<p><span>After talking with all the UruITers, we decided to provide support and follow up with those we observed who needed it, as a way of conveying a sense of calm. These talks were the catalyst to develop and organize actions in the shortest amount of time possible. We started with the urgent:</span></p>
<h4><span>Solutions for connectivity and computer issues:</span></h4>
<p><span>We worked together with IT so that people could work without any issues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Provision of office items: </span></h4>
<p><span>From the UruIT offices, we organized the logistics to send people what they needed. That way, they could work more comfortably using their monitors and desk chairs, for example.</span></p>
<h4><span>Time management and breaks: </span></h4>
<p><span>We found ourselves packed with multiple daily meetings. To cope with them, we looked for alternatives in virtual rooms and other tools. We also tried to encourage the proper use of communication channels (chat and meetings). <strong>Many encountered the difficulty of managing time and knowing when to finish working</strong> since they did not have to move from one place to another. In addition to monitoring the situation through talks, we developed activities to try to help improve peoples’ daily routines.</span></p>
<h4><span>Peace of mind in the face of job uncertainty: </span></h4>
<p><span>For a while, and even today, all one would hear about in the media was the expected negative effect on the economy of the pandemic and its impact on the job market. In order to mitigate stress and give our employees some reassurance, <strong>we shared weekly updates about how our projects were coming along and disclosed any information to remain transparent</strong> while establishing some things we could do in the short term.</span></p>
<h4><span>Support for new employees: </span></h4>
<p><span>Just days prior to the pandemic, we newly hired people who moved from Cuba. As if all of the changes that come with moving to a new country were not enough, add a pandemic to the mix! We tried to remain especially close to them and give added support.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>After tackling the most pressing, immediate issues, we established priorities</strong> for the next fundamental areas to work on: communication, integration activities, and latest company news in terms of new projects, new hires, team activities and general well-being.</span></p>
<h3><span>Communication Is Key</span></h3>
<p><span>Communication and information management became a fundamental aspect due to the distance and the changing external environment. For that, we created common spaces where we could interact and report the news week by week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, <strong>we came up with Friday </strong></span><strong>brunches</strong><span><strong> which quickly became a classic</strong>. These weekly virtual brunches became a space where we could not only keep up to date with UruIT information, but also engage in activities to generate interaction between the UruITers who are working in Uruguay and Colombia. It became the perfect occasion as it takes place during Uruguay’s lunchtime and Colombia’s morning.</span></p>
<p><span>Besides brunch, we maintained the use of our internal tools to keep in touch and continued the one-on-one talks.</span></p>
<h4>Create a Community</h4>
<p><span>Integration was an aspect of our company culture that we already had been working on. Even though we keep in touch daily, before the pandemic, we tried to generate moments where we could connect face to face; laid-back spaces where we could interact and get to know people. This was something we didn’t want to lose with the fully remote work situation. <strong>One of our goals for this year was to work on the integration of both countries</strong>, since we felt that there was a certain disconnect between the UruITers in Uruguay and Colombia. Before the pandemic, we did not have it stipulated how we were going to achieve that. This situation forced us to work faster and to brainstorm ideas with the help of other teams.</span></p>
<h3><span>Have Fun Moments Remotely</span></h3>
<p><span>It seemed important to us to maintain continuity regarding the fun moments and celebrations that took place every month, even more so if they were cherished by the team. For this reason, our usual weekly shared breakfasts never stopped. <strong>We decided to send to everyone’s house a surprise box and a message to enjoy the moment with the family</strong>, who also became part of our work routines. We also continued with the birthday celebrations and other special dates such as Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, and Children’s Day (yes, we celebrate kids as well in South America!).</span></p>
<h3><span>Schedule Formal and Informal Talks</span></h3>
<p><span>Other activities also emerged, such as </span><b>internal talks</b><span>. We encouraged UruITers who wanted to share a topic of interest to make a presentation. Knowledge management has a lot of value for people; it could be in the knowledge itself, as a space to share information, or the way in which they have solved some problems in their projects or common interests. It’s been an experience to get to know each other within the different teams. We appreciate the diversity of all of our work.</span></p>
<p><span>We began to see that communication, support and moderation were key. UruITers suggested they wanted to connect with others, so we created </span><b>informal chats</b><span>; a casual meeting to talk with our peers and share our personal experiences. Small groups of people with common interests emerged based on trivial subjects. These instances have helped us to generate closeness and get to know the people with whom we work better.</span></p>
<h3><span>Enjoy the ride</span></h3>
<p><span>Another activity that amused us were our </span><b>Tik Tok challenges</b><span>, in which different teams put together a video to share with everyone and challenged other colleagues to do the same. We shared these on a weekly basis and picked a winner by vote. People joined in with great enthusiasm and openness! As the videos were published, different teams got challenged, trying to bring personal moments back to the work environment.</span></p>
<h3>Focus on Well-Being and Mental Health</h3>
<p><span>Any process of change takes time; it may also agitate and destabilize us. We noticed that issues related to self-care emerged in the majority of the cases. Difficulties to adapt to staying home —either with our family or alone— eating disorders, fatigue, stress, and other issues appeared. These findings gave us the input to propose some activities.</span></p>
<p><span>We began to observe that if we took the lead on some ideas of actions to take, then the adaptation process would be easier. For this, <strong>we developed moments for relaxation and self-care in general to disconnect from daily work and the screens.</strong> This enabled people to have a moment to recharge. In …</span></p></div></div>

<p>LDM—or <em>load multiple</em>—is my favorite assembly instruction of the ARM instruction set. Here’s why.</p>
<p>First, let’s discuss what LDM does. An example:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r4, {r0, r1, r2, r3}</code></pre>
<p>Here, it takes a <em>base register</em> (in this case, <code>r4</code>) and a <em>register set</em> (in this case, <code>{r0, r1, r2, r3}</code>). It loads consecutive words from the address in the base register into the registers in the set. In this example, the effect could be described using the following C-like pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>r0 = r4[0];
r1 = r4[1];
r2 = r4[2];
r3 = r4[3];</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few assignments for a single instruction! And that’s why it’s called <em>load multiple</em>.</p>
<p>The set notation also allows for ranges. We can rewrite the previous example as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r4, {r0-r3}</code></pre>
<p>Any and all of the 16 ARM registers are allowed in the set. So, the following is legal:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0, {r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15}</code></pre>
<p>The register set is encoded as a 16-bit mask in a 32-bit instruction. Here’s a simplified encoding of the original example:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://keleshev.com/ldm-my-favorite-arm-instruction/ldm-encoding-arm.svg" alt=""><figcaption>Simplified encoding of the LDM instruction</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Such instruction is a perfect fit for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load%E2%80%93store_architecture">load-store architecture</a> like ARM, where the primary workflow is:</p>
<ul>
<li>load many values from memory into registers,</li>
<li>perform operations exclusively on registers,</li>
<li>store results back from registers into memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The opposite of LDM is STM—<em>store multiple</em>.</p>
<!---Since both of them operate on *sets* of registers (which are implemented as bit masks), you can't directly select the order in which the values are loaded or stored.
The set `{r0, r1, r2}` is the same as `{r2, r1, r0}`.
That's why-->
<h2 id="block-copy">Block copy</h2>
<p>With these two, you can copy large blocks of memory fast. You can copy eight words (or 32 bytes!) of memory in just two instructions:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0, {r4-r11}
stm r1, {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<p>LDM and STM also have auto-increment variants (denoted with “!”) where the base register is incremented by the number of words loaded/stored so that you can do the copying in a fast loop:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0!, {r4-r11}
stm r1!, {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<h2 id="implementing-stacks">Implementing stacks</h2>
<p>ARM’s POP instruction is simply an alias for LDM with a stack pointer (and auto-increment). The following two are exactly the same:</p>
<pre><code>ldm sp!, {r0-r3}
pop {r0-r3}</code></pre>
<p>And the PUSH instruction is an alias for an STM variant (STMDB).</p>
<p>You can push and pop large quantities to and from the stack in one go. And if you replace SP by another register you can implement efficient stacks in other regions of memory. For example, you can implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_stack">shadow stack</a> in the heap.</p>
<h2 id="saving-registers">Saving registers</h2>
<p>Are you hesitating to use the call-preserved registers because you need to save them, and you might as well use a stack slot anyway? Not any more, because you can save all call-preserved registers you want to use in one go:</p>
<pre><code>push {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<h2 id="prologue-and-epilogue">Prologue and epilogue</h2>
<p>On ARM, the first four arguments, the return address (LR) and the frame pointer (FP) are all passed in registers. That’s why it’s especially important to have efficient prologues and epilogues. Fortunately, you can save FP and LR in one go, using a fairly standard ARM prologue:</p>
<pre><code>push {fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>And then restore both and return (for the epilogue):</p>
<pre><code>pop {fp, lr}
bx lr</code></pre>
<p>Even better, you can restore both and return in one go!</p>
<pre><code>pop {fp, pc}</code></pre>
<p>This works by popping the return address value (LR) into the program counter register (PC), so you don’t need an explicit return!</p>
<p>This is good enough in itself, but you can—<em>at the same time</em>—spill some arguments onto the stack (for example, if their address is taken):</p>
<pre><code>push {r0-r3, fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>Or, you can save FP and LR and—<em>at the same time</em>—allocate some space on the stack:</p>
<pre><code>push {r0-r3, fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we push <code>r0-r3</code> not for their value but to advance the stack pointer by four words.</p>
<h2 id="arm64">ARM64</h2>
<p>I suspect it was a difficult trade-off, but when it was time to design the 64-bit version of the ARM instruction set, the decision was made to double the number of registers to 32. I remember reading a paper saying that this change improves the performance by about 6% across the board. With 32 registers it is no longer possible to encode a bitmask of all registers into a 32-bit long instruction. So, instead, ARM64 has LDP and STP: load pair and store pair, which are the spiritual successors of LDM and STM.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>We write so many functions in our programs that they become second nature before we know it. Like ants in a colony, they are numerous beyond imagination and they come together to form some surprisingly complex systems.</p><p>It begs the question: how do we write good functions? It can seem trivial: they’re just like ants after-all. But there is leverage in the answer: the right decisions multiply throughout your codebase and bubble up into great design.</p><p>I think there are about three key ideas you can employ to craft good functions. I wanted to share them with you.</p><p>Let’s start with an example. We have an app, and we want to export some data in a JSON format. Here’s what a function for that could look like:</p><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>exportFile</span><span>() { </span>
<span>  </span><span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>);</span>
<span>  </span><span>try</span><span> {</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getData</span><span>(); </span><span>// [Data, Data, Data]</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>exportableData</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>toExportableData</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>); </span><span>// ExportableData</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>jsonStr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>JSON</span><span>.stringify</span><span>(</span><span>exportableData</span><span>); </span><span>// '{"data": {...</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fileURL</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>saveFile</span><span>(</span><span>"export.json"</span><span>, </span><span>jsonStr</span><span>); </span><span>// https://foo.com/export.json</span>
<span>    </span><span>setFileURL</span><span>(</span><span>fileURL</span><span>);</span>
<span>  } </span><span>finally</span><span> {</span>
<span>    </span><span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Seems straight forward: To export as JSON, we first get our data. Now, this data may have some sensitive info, so we clean that up and transform into something exportable; ExportableData. Once we have that, we get a string representation, save the file, and badabing, badaboom, we’re done. </p><p>Okay, we’ve got something working well.</p><p>But life moves on and our program needs to evolve. Instead of just exporting JSON, we need to do more: <strong>we also need to export a CSV file</strong>. </p><p>How do we do that?</p><p>The first thing we notice, is that exporting a CSV is very similar to exporting JSON. Can we abstract <code>exportFile</code>?</p><p>One thing we can do, is to introduce a new flag: something like <code>exportFile(/*isCSV=*/ true)</code> </p><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>exportFile</span><span>(</span><span>isCSV</span><span>) { </span>
<span>  </span><span>...</span>
<span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>fileURL</span>
<span>  </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>isCSV</span><span>) { </span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>csvStr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>toCSVStr</span><span>(</span><span>exportableData</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>fileURL</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>saveFile</span><span>(</span><span>"export.csv"</span><span>, </span><span>csvStr</span><span>);</span>
<span>  } </span><span>else</span><span> { </span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>jsonStr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>JSON</span><span>.stringify</span><span>(</span><span>exportableData</span><span>);</span>
<span>    </span><span>fileURL</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>saveFile</span><span>(</span><span>"export.json"</span><span>, </span><span>jsonStr</span><span>);</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>  </span><span>...</span></code></pre><p>By introducing this flag, we can conditionally produce a different <code>fileURL</code>: one for CSV and one for JSON. With that we see the first concept for abstraction: configuration. You pass some configuration, and you leave it to your function to figure what to do. </p><p>So, is it a good idea? </p><h2 id="the-key-advantage-is-that-our-logic-is-centralized">The key <em>advantage</em> is that our logic is centralized.</h2><p>With configuration, the caller is limited in what they can do: they can only provide flags. All the true logic stays inside <code>exportFile</code>. This means that callers of the function can’t go crazy and do something unsupported. And that could give us some peace of mind.</p><h2 id="the-key-disadvantage-is-thatour-logic-is-centralized">The key <em>disadvantage</em> is that…our logic is centralized.</h2><p>This will work, but let’s think about it. First, notice that in order to understand <code>exportFile</code> now, we need to understand both the CSV and JSON case. Imagine if someone opens up <code>exportFile</code> to figure out what it does:  if they <em>only</em> cared about JSON, they now have to understand more logic than they needed. Anyone who changes the logic for CSV, may also end up breaking JSON. <strong><code>exportFile</code></strong> <strong>has become</strong> <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" target="_blank"><strong>complected</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Notice also, that because the caller of this function can <em>only</em> provide flags, their hands are tied for use-cases that you didn’t support. This was supposed to give you peace of mind, but it certainly can frustrate callers. imagine if they wanted to support XML, what could they do? They’d have to edit <code>exportFile</code> to support this case. (God forbid they edit it to be something like <code>exportFile(isCSV, isXML)</code> — now you have invariant conditions on your hands). By being so specific, you’ve chosen to make your function less abstract — this of course means that it is less powerful.  <strong><code>exportFile</code></strong> <strong>has become hard to extend</strong></p><h2 id="for-better-or-worse-configuration-gives-the-caller-the-least-amount-of-power">For better or worse, configuration gives the caller the least amount of power</h2><p>If you imagine a sort power spectrum, where the caller has the least power on the left, and most power on the right, configuration would be on the left. You control what the caller does so tightly that it gives your certainty, but makes your function more complex and less useful. </p><p>Say you wanted to address the problems, and move to the right of this spectrum, what could you do? </p><p>Well, if you look at what we wrote, we can notice that the only part that is <em>really</em> different, is the bit about taking <code>exportData</code>, and creating a <code>fileURL</code>. </p><pre><code><span>...</span>
<span>const</span><span> </span><span>exportableData</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>toExportableData</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>); </span><span>// ExportableData</span>
<span>...</span><span> </span><span>// *This can be different! Somehow we need to get a fileURL* </span>
<span>setFileURL</span><span>(</span><span>fileURL</span><span>);</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre><p>So one thing we can do is this: instead of providing a flag, we can provide a function: </p><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>exportFile</span><span>(</span><span>exportableDataToFileURL</span><span>) { </span>
<span>  </span><span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>);</span>
<span>  </span><span>try</span><span> {</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getData</span><span>(); </span><span>// [Data, Data, Data]</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>exportableData</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>toExportableData</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>); </span><span>// ExportableData</span>
<span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fileURL</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>exportableDataToFileURL</span><span>(</span><span>exportableData</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>setFileURL</span><span>(</span><span>fileURL</span><span>);</span>
<span>  } </span><span>finally</span><span> {</span>
<span>    </span><span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Now, for JSON, we can write </p><pre><code><span>exportFile</span><span>((</span><span>exportableData</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>

Now if someone looks under the hood at <code>exportFile</code>, they won’t see unrelated code about csv. If they wanted to extend to XML, they can simply provide a different function. We’ve given the caller much more power</p><h2 id="the-key-disadvantage-is-that-it-can-be-either-too-powerful-or-not-powerful-enough">The key <em>disadvantage</em> is that it can be either too powerful or not powerful enough</h2><p>We’ve abstracted further, but there is a price there. The first is, that we <em>think</em> we know that what we <em>really</em> need to pass outwards is <code>exportableData</code>, and what we need to return is a <code>fileURL</code>. What if we were wrong? For example, some may need a slightly different data format — instead of <code>exportableData</code> they need <code>someOtherKindOfExportableData</code>. By the time we figured that out, it’s possible that there are numerous new usages of <code>exportFile</code>, which we’ll have to support as we evolve this function.</p><p>One way we could have prevented this, is to have stuck with configuration. This way, anyone who wanted to support something would have to funnel through this function, which would give us time to think about what the best abstraction was. </p><p>Another way, would have been if this function was abstracted even further, so callers could have easily supported <code>someOtherKindOfExportableData</code>.</p><h2 id="inversion-lies-in-the-middle-of-the-power-spectrum">Inversion lies in the middle of the power spectrum</h2><p>Inversion is more powerful than configuration, but it’s not the most powerful method. This can be a great choice, but you risk either being too powerful and exposing errors, or not being powerful enough and restricting callers. </p><p>We know the less powerful option: configuration. What would the most powerful one look like?</p><p>The next thing we may notice, is that our <code>exportFile</code> function is actually built up some building blocks that could be useful for a bunch of different things. For example, many functions may want a loading state, or just need to get <code>exportableData</code>, etc. We could create those building blocks:</p><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>exportJSONFile</span><span>() { </span>
<span>  </span><span>withLoading</span><span>(() </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>saveJSONFile</span><span>(</span><span>getExportableData</span><span>()))</span>
<span>}</span>
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<span>function</span><span> </span><span>exportCSVFile</span><span>() { </span>
<span>  </span><span>withLoading</span><span>(() </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>saveCSVFile</span><span>(</span><span>getExportableData</span><span>()))</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><h2 id="the-key-advantage-is-that-the-user-gets-the-most-power">The key advantage is that the user gets the most power</h2><p>The building blocks that we just built, can be used in a myriad of ways. The user can support CSV, XML, can use <code>isLoading</code> with some other function, and choose to provide a different kind of <code>exportableData</code>.  We’ve provided a lot of power for the user.</p><h2 id="the-key-disadvantage-is-that-you-are-the-most-vulnerable-to-mistakes">The key disadvantage is that you are the most vulnerable to mistakes</h2><p>The disadvantage though, like in the case of inversion, is that we open ourselves up to a lot of mistakes. What if <code>isLoading</code> was really meant for files, and other things should have been using a different flag? What if people start using <code>saveJSONFile</code>, and pass data that wasn’t really an export? These are all cases that we have implicitly allowed with our abstractions. </p><p>There’s a further problem: notice that with our first example of <code>exportFile</code>, you the code was more concrete: you could see what was actually happening. When code is more abstract, it’s a bit harder to reason about what is <em>actually</em> happening. Now, it can be worth it for the power gains, but if you optimized prematurely, you’re just paying this price for nothing. An example of this unnecessary price is <code>saveJSONFile</code> and <code>saveCSVFile</code> — if we had <a href="http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html" target="_blank">inlined</a> those, the overall composition would still be abstract but more understandable. These are the kind of things to watch out for as you abstract at this level.</p><h2 id="composition-is-at-the-end-of-the-spectrum">Composition is at the end of the spectrum</h2><p>And with that, we see that composition gives us the most power, but gives us the most opportunities to shoot ourselves in the foot. Boy can it be worth it though. </p><p>It’s funny to notice that with each option, the pro <em>is</em> the con. So how do we pick? I think one heuristic you can use is this: pick the most powerful option you can limited by your confidence. For example, if you have a light understanding of the problem, stay on the lower side of the abstraction spectrum. As you understand more (say, time to introduce XML) you can evolve to the powerful side of the spectrum. When you’re <em>very</em> confident, and you can see good use-cases for your building blocks, lean to the most powerful side of the spectrum. </p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Alex Reichert, Julien Odent for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="banner"> <div> <div> <div>  <h4>14 Oct 2020</h4> <p> <i></i> Reading time ~11 minutes </p><!-- /.entry-reading-time --> </div> <p>What do you get when you combine a bunch of software developers with a perceived impending disaster? In one case, we got guns, and lots of them! The weirdest thing is how normal it all seemed.</p> <!--more-->  <p><em>(With apologies to “The Simpsons”)</em></p> <p>It was the dawn of Y2k. Compaq paid $9 billion to acquire Digital Equipment Corporation. Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two students at Stanford University. And a small New Hampshire software startup was helping hotels take reservations beyond Dec 31, 1999.</p> <p>I was a software development contractor at that company.</p> <p>If you did not live through it, Y2k was a big deal to a lot of people, particularly software developers. We knew the folly of using two digits to represent a year. It was a holdover from the days when computer RAM was expensive and preserving every possible byte was important.</p> <p>Sure, Unix (and early Linuxes?) had the notion of a timestamp value, which was implemented as the number of milliseconds since the epoch (i.e., since Jan 1, 1970). Software written to compute dates using this value were more robust, but there were still lots of databases that stored dates in separate columns (day, month, and 2-digit year).</p> <p>What happens when you add two days to <code>{day: 30, month: 12, year: 99}</code>? You end up with <code>{day: 1, month: 1, year: 00}</code>. It should be <code>year: 100</code>, but if you are only storing two digits, then only the right-two digits are preserved. This is a problem if your software assumes that your reservation check-out date has to be after your check-in date. Our main customers were local hotels, and they were unable to accept reservations for the turn of the century/millennium celebration that was barely a year and a half away.</p> <p>There were other consequences, from inconvenient: not being able to renew a driver’s license because your new expiration date would be 95 years earlier, to amusing: a 104-year-old woman being sent a registration notice for Kindergarten.</p> <p>Though in retrospect it was not much of a crisis, it certainly did not feel that way at the time. There were plenty of plausible scenarios that could not be reliably refuted. Two of the ones we clung to were that the outdated computers that run the nations air traffic control systems would somehow fail at midnight when the systems suddenly decided it was 1900. What would happen? Another was that the computer controllers in the power grid would shut off when they did some match and concluded that they had not been serviced or inspected in the past 90-plus years.</p> <p>For the remainder of this story, pretend you do not know how it turned out, and try to imagine how you might feel if you worked for a company where your coworkers were convinced that much of civilization could stop and collapse right after 11:59 PM on December 31, 1999.</p>  <p>As I said, I worked for a small company mostly working with local hotels to help them collect reservations. Our solution was comically simple. Year 2000 was a leap year, so its calendar lined up perfectly with the calendar from 1972 (the calender tends to repeat every 28 years). The solution was to set all of the computers’ clocks back 28 years, but patch their UI systems to quietly add those 28 years back. A human operator had no problem thinking that January 2, 00 was after December 31, 99. Thus, we had a workable, if odd, solution.</p>  <p>As important as we thought our jobs were, I honestly cannot remember much of the code we delivered. What I remember most was the culture of the company itself.</p> <p>Almost everyone at the company was well versed in survival. They knew lots and lots about living without electricity, alternative heat sources, hunting and fishing, food storage, and weapons.</p> <p>It was serious business for many of my colleagues, and they were eager to share their knowledge and expertise.</p> <p>I recall the first day I was brought into the “inner circle,” as it were. One of my coworkers invited me over to his desk to show me his personal handgun of choice. He kept it locked in the bottom drawer of his desk, but showed me where to find the key “in case of an emergency.” He was not clear on what such an emergency might be.</p> <p>At that point in my life, I think I had only held and fired a gun a couple of times in my life, at a professional shooting range, so was not too keen on grabbing his under any circumstances. I told him this, and asked who else knew he kept a gun in his desk.</p> <p>His reply shocked me. He said that it was probably OK, as just about everyone else in the office was armed all the time. As it turned out, I was one of maybe half a dozen employees who <em>did not</em> have a firearm of some sort in my desk or on my person.</p> <p>Not only were weapons not prohibited at the office, they seemed to be actively encouraged.</p>  <p>Once I had been introduced to the open secret, I started to be invited to go target shooting. Having only fired a gun a few times, and only at indoor firing ranges, I decided to tag along as a spectator. We would often visit a local outdoor range that was only a few minutes down the road. Other times we would simply venture into the woods behind the office. Apparently New Hampshire law permits this, as long as you maintain a safe distance from residences and public roads.</p> <p>This turned out to be a pretty regular event, and one sanctioned by the owners of the company.</p>  <p>What struck me as most surprising is how normal it all seemed to be. The fact that there were more firearms in the office than people (many people had more than one) did not seem to be unusual.</p> <p>Seeing a gun was no more odd than seeing a knife in the kitchen. They were tools to be used when needed. Safety was stressed over all.</p> <p>My coworkers were definitely enthusiasts and took care to ensure safe storage and handling of all firearms on the premises.</p>  <p>One morning I arrived at work to find a group of people gathered around another coworker’s desk. He was excitedly unpacking a large, and long, cardboard box. Inside was his latest purchase: a .50 caliber military sniper rifle from McMillan Firearms. After everyone finished “oohing” and “ahhing” over it, he invited anyone interested to join him at the outdoor range at lunch time.</p> <p><img src="https://walkingriver.com/assets/img/TAC50A1JPG.JPG" alt="McMillan Sniper Rifle"></p> <p>This was something I could not pass up.</p> <p>When we arrived, he announced that the ammunition for the rifle was expensive, about $3 per round. Some of the rounds were “tracer rounds,” which makes the shot visible to the naked eye, even during the day. I am not sure why a military sniper would want to use those, but the effect on the firing range was pretty cool.</p> <p>As you can imagine, the appearance of a real military-grade rifle at the range caused quite a stir. That particular range is frequented by local and state police, and we quickly drew a crowd. Many of the police in attendance were impressed, and some asked if they could fire it. If you have ever been around an exotic car, that is what it was like.</p>  <p>On December 7, 98 (yes, that was intentional), the company announced that it was out of money. Apparently despite the fear being generated throughout the world, it was not enough to keep us in business. Our firm shut its doors that Friday, more than a year before the non-event that was Y2k.</p>  <p>The company closing is not the end of the story, however. Shortly after Christmas I got a call from my manager, asking for my assistance. He needed help moving some of the office equipment from our former building into a new, smaller space, one town over. He said in exchange for my help, I could take a desk and a chair. They were pretty sturdy, and I needed a desk, so I agreed.</p> <p>We met at the office, loaded a bunch of furniture into his minivan, drove it to the new site, and unloaded and assembled it in the new place. I think we worked for about two or three hours.</p> <p>I know what you are probably thinking. I had just helped him steal a bunch of office equipment. Maybe. Maybe not. I honestly do not know.</p> <p>A few days later I got a call from another former coworker, asking me to meet him in Manchester for lunch. He gave me the address, and I met him there the next day.</p> <p>He said as an added “thank you,” from my former manager, he was going to take me to the indoor range and shoot his fully-automatic rifle. That sounded like fun, so I agreed.</p> <p><img src="https://walkingriver.com/assets/img/Glock-23.jpg" alt="Glock 23"></p> <p>He brought a Glock 23, as memory serves. It is a semi-automatic .40 caliber pistol. I rented some eye and ear protective gear, bought some paper targets and a box of ammunition, and he showed me how to load and fire it. The Glock has a heavy trigger pull, that is it requires a great deal of force to pull the trigger, and thus is one of the few pistols without a safety switch. It is a double-action firearm, meaning there is no reason to “cock” the gun before firing. We went through the box of ammunition and compared our targets. He was a much better shot than I.</p> <p><img src="https://walkingriver.com/assets/img/hkmp5.jpg" alt="H&amp;K MP5"></p> <p>As promised, he also brought his personally-owned H&amp;K MP5. It has three modes of operation: semiautomatic, one round per trigger pull; burst, three rounds per trigger pull; and continuous fire, where it would continue firing rounds until you let go of the trigger or ran out of ammunition.</p> <p>In my admittedly uneducated opinion, the MP5 is far better example of an “assault rifle” than the oft-maligned AR-15. First, the MP5 I fired was fully-automatic, whereas the AR-15 is semiautomatic.</p> <p>Second, it has a much shorter barrel and would be far superior in close quarters, or during an assault, if you will.</p> <p>As I said, my opinions were formed from this single experience. I cannot claim any further expertise.</p> <p>Firing the MP5 was not at all what I expected. I had envisioned what you see in the movies: holding the rifle near my waist or chest and emptying the entire 100-round magazine in one pull. Nope. Throughout my time firing it, I kept the stock pulled tightly against my right shoulder, as I sighted down the barrel towards my target.</p> <p>My patient instructor informed me that even with a fully-automatic rifle, you will almost never want to use it in that mode. He kept it in semi-auto mode most of …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In the digital agency world, strategy is a powerful concept that consumes so many of our conversations around process, design, and technology choices. </p>



<p><br>It carries a lot of weight when you get it right, and even more when you get it wrong. I’ve found that a light-handed approach to leading digital strategy sessions can alleviate this pressure. With an open mindset, our team can develop better ideas and solutions for our clients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was recently preparing for a work trip to tackle the strategy on a client’s project that was still not 100% clear to me. We’d had initial discussions with the team, but I still wasn’t sure exactly what we were going to build. This was nerve-racking for a few reasons:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>How can you deliver what you don’t understand?</li><li>What if you can’t navigate a clear answer before your departing flight home?</li><li>What if you fail?</li></ol>



<p>My approach to resolving
this ambiguity was to intentionally not write an agenda for the meeting. I know
what you’re thinking: why would you prepare to fail, which is concern number
three on your list, and then write about it? Stick with me. Ambiguous
conversations are valuable because sometimes the best agenda is an “agenda to
listen.” Our role in this room is simply to absorb information by asking questions
about our client’s business strategy, needs and goals. It can feel awkward and
there are silences, but it’s my belief that the quietness is powerful, because
it’s where the mental wheels turn and breakthrough ideas are born.</p>



<p>A few hours into our client’s strategy session, it was clear that we’d hit a stale point. Everyone’s energy seemed to be fleeting and the whiteboard was scribbled with notes. The tired looks on our faces expressed the shared concern of how we were supposed to transform this soup of information into a viable digital presence. This … now this is where it’s time to turn an agenda of listening into an agenda of action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our team needed a break to recharge, the creative went on a walk, our client went back to work, and I sat in an empty conference room staring at the brilliance that laid within my pages of notes and in the thousands of thoughts floating above my head. There were quotes, diagrams, paragraphs of content, and that whole whiteboard to consider. Perplexed by the sheer amount of material in front of me, I immersed myself before starting over fresh. The task was complex, and I wanted to ensure we displayed the information in a digestible format that also captured what the project is all about. </p>



<p>I took a picture of our whiteboard and erased it all, wiping it clean. I drew four vertical lines to create five sections: who, what, why, how and who. Those five things that we were taught when we were learning how to create sentences way back in English class. But these elementary parameters gave me the mental space I needed to evolve my thinking, and the strategy began to flow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took only an hour to
categorize all the thoughts that had accumulated throughout the morning. When the
team came back and we went through each section and pulled out the highlights,
content and statement, we became united around the same vision. The strategy
came alive, sparked by simplicity. This isn’t to tell you all that I’m a
strategic wizard because what mattered in that moment was the ability to step
back from complexity and seek straightforward answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to Culture Foundry’s strategy approach is being confident in what we know and transparent about what we don’t. Listening to a client tell their story and establishing a collaborative space will guide you in exciting directions that you never imagined.&nbsp;</p>

Let’s say d1 and d4 are conflicting mitigation measures, we can choose either d1 or d4:</p></div><div><figure><p><img width="165" height="39" src="https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-4.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></figure></div><div><p>We can consider also three or more conflicting decisions, if d1, d2, and d4 are incompatible and we can choose only one of them, we can simply add the following constraint:</p></div><div><figure><p><img width="237" height="39" src="https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></figure></div><div><p>We can keep adding constraints in order to model complex interaction between the decision, etc. If we have incompatible constraints, it may be possible that there is no solution to the optimization problem.</p></div><div><p>Mixed Integer Programming with branch-and-Cut</p></div><div><div><p>Integer programming is a subset of discreet optimization, that seeks to optimize an objective function subject to constraints. The LP format is a human-friendly modeling format. In practice, though other formats are more adequate for large-scale problems.</p><p>The basic constructs are really simple and can be translated directly from the mathematical formulation of the problem. The first section specifies the objective function to optimize and whether it’s a maximization or minimization problem. The second section specifies the constraints, an LP file may contain an arbitrary number of them. Finally, the last section specifies the type of the variable.</p><p>Once that the problem was formulated in LP format we can simply feed the file to a MIP optimizer and voilà we have an optimal solution. One such an optimizer is CBC: standing for Coin-or branch and cut, CBC is an open-source mixed-integer linear programming solver written in C++.</p><p>For a budget of <strong>150</strong></p></div></div><div><p>Maximize<br> \ The objective function<br> obj&nbsp; :&nbsp; 420&nbsp; d1 +&nbsp; 160&nbsp; d2&nbsp; +&nbsp; 4&nbsp; d3&nbsp; +&nbsp; 135&nbsp; d4&nbsp; +&nbsp; 4&nbsp; d5&nbsp; +&nbsp; 210&nbsp; d6<br> Subject To<br> c0&nbsp; :&nbsp; 90&nbsp; d1&nbsp; +&nbsp; 80&nbsp; d2&nbsp; +&nbsp; 30&nbsp; d3&nbsp; +&nbsp; 45&nbsp; d4&nbsp; +&nbsp; 4&nbsp; d5&nbsp; +&nbsp; 50&nbsp; d6&nbsp; &lt;=&nbsp; 150<br> Binary<br> d1&nbsp; d2&nbsp; d3&nbsp; d4&nbsp; d5&nbsp; d6<br> End</p></div><div><p>CBC provides a stand-alone executable that can be called directly from the command line to optimize the problem.</p></div><div><figure><p><img width="427" height="36" src="https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.jpg 427w, https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-300x25.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px"></p></figure></div><div><p>After waiting for some milliseconds the problem was solved.</p></div><div><figure><p><img width="502" height="152" src="https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot_20201011_013017.png" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot_20201011_013017.png 502w, https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot_20201011_013017-300x91.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px"></p></figure></div><div><figure><p><img width="407" height="130" src="https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot_20201011_013049.png" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot_20201011_013049.png 407w, https://www.vneuron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot_20201011_013049-300x96.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px"></p></figure></div><div><p>The optimal strategy consists of mitigating <strong>risks 1, 5, and 6</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/radiclewebsite/e0e03eb5-9431-4da3-b2a3-182803bf8773_BrandonGell+Headshot.jpg" alt=""></p><p><em>“COVID-19 has changed the landscape dramatically for the insurance industry. If most purchases continue to be made online, and the insurance and warranty industry is run by incumbents, then the industry is going to halve in size.”</em></p><p>Brandon Gell, 26, is the co-founder of Clyde, an insurtech startup that offers point-of-sale product warranties. Brandon is an extremely young founder in an age-old industry, having started Clyde at the age of 22. He saw a glaring problem with product warranties and he went out to solve it. Now, Clyde has $14m in the bank, recently raising a Series A from Spark Capital in May.&nbsp;</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic is pushing shoppers online, and Clyde has the system in place to help those consumers better protect their purchases. For an industry known for operating slowly, Clyde is a nimble startup ready to take on the demand.&nbsp;</p><p>In this interview:</p><ul><li>How seeing and solving one problem can lead to massive returns and industry influence</li><li>How perfectionism can kill an MVP and startup before it begins</li><li>The importance of an established market for new products and delivery systems</li><li>The effect of the pandemic on the insurance industry and commerce at large</li><li>Clyde’s philosophy on cultural differences between employees</li><li>The importance of research before a launch</li><li>Speed and creativity being the defining factor for success in a new era</li></ul><p><strong>What is Clyde?</strong></p><p>Today, Clyde is an extended warranty platform and fully-licensed insurance administrator that partners with top insurance companies to provide product warranties. Being an administrator, we adjudicate and resolve claims, and own the customer experience. We work with merchants to sell contracts to their end consumers by fully leveraging our platform. We’re also a full suite of technical products for integrating merchants and customers and tools for claims and adjudications. We’re backed by a number of highly-rated insurance companies such as Asurion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How would you describe your product suite?</strong></p><p>On the insurance side, we have two top-level products. One is our platform, and the other is insurance products in every single category. We have some of the strongest pricing in the industry thanks to our partnerships. We administrate our insurance products. On the product side, it’s really a suite of four different tools to serve different users.</p><p>The first user is us, Clyde. We have an internal tool for onboarding and integrating merchants in a scalable fashion. One incumbent who I won’t name takes an average of 3-6 months and tens of thousands of dollars to get a partner live. This product’s goal is to help us launch new businesses every single day. This tool also manages our operations and optimizes our business.</p><p>The second user is the merchant. We have a product that helps them manage their program. It contains analytics, controls, and customer success tools. We can also enable our merchants to be the point of contact for claims if they want. For example, we’re running a program with Barnes and Noble, where they use our API to adjudicate, but they’re the point of contact for the customer.&nbsp;</p><p>The third user is the end customer. They interact with one product before they buy a contract. This is basically a piece of javascript that lives on the merchant’s website, responsible for a lot of different functions. It performs very well for opening contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>The final product is the one customers interact with once they’ve bought a contract. They use it to manage their contract, make claims, and get their claim adjudicated and resolved.</p><p><strong>How did Clyde get started?</strong></p><p>I come from a design background. I studied architecture at Middlebury College in Vermont. Ultimately, I wanted to study industrial design, but they didn’t have that, and architecture was the closest thing they offered. That also led me down the road of product and graphic design, which I gravitated toward. I graduated but didn’t want to be an architect, because I thought that was too much of a pigeonhole. I knew I wanted to build stuff, but I didn’t know what. I built a house, I renovated a school bus, and I built an app, but I wasn’t sure what I wanted to specialize in. So I became a Venture For America Fellow for a time, back when Andrew Yang was still a part of it.&nbsp;</p><p>From there I moved to Columbus, Ohio, to work for a small startup of 4 people. There I learned a ton about organizational leadership, focus, and the balance between a product-focused approach and a sales-focused approach. I learned a lot about what <em>not</em> to do in business as well. About six months into the startup, it became part of my job to figure out how to sell the startup’s product. I learned a ton about e-commerce, Shopify, Stripe, and Affirm. I had great experiences with all three of them. Then I tried to find a partnership with an insurance company so that I could offer insurance on the product as an upsell.&nbsp;</p><p>As a merchant, I had so much difficulty partnering with insurance companies. At first, I couldn’t find anyone to work with, even though I called and emailed anyone I could find. I searched all over LinkedIn for anyone at an insurance company with “sales” in their title and couldn’t get a conversation started. I finally got in with a small, local insurance company and was appalled at the quality of their product and customer support. The final straw came when I saw that it was going to push my operational burden through the roof just to integrate with them. They had an awkward system in place to integrate with new merchants. I didn’t even know if it was going to work. This experience was the seed that led to the founding of Clyde.</p><p>When we launched, we set out to solve one problem: Let’s enable merchants to have the best-performing program they possibly can. Our original mission was to help merchants work with insurance companies, regardless of the scale of the merchant. We were the first company to work with electric scooters. Boosted Boards partnered with us when one of their products launched, and we went to every insurance company and found one willing to take that risk. We had signed non-exclusive agreements with basically every insurance company administrator in the industry.&nbsp; With these agreements, we could shop around and find an insurance administrator that would take Boosted Boards on. Since then, we’ve consolidated our partners and expanded our toolset to solve problems for insurance administrators and end customers as well. Now, we don’t generally need any outside administrators for new products.</p><p>Part of the reason we expanded into customer experience was so that we could make sure the merchants had the best possible experience with us. When we set merchants up with insurance administrators, and the end customers had a bad experience with the administrator, the merchants would get upset with us. So in order to scale, we started to expand in order to own the full customer experience and make more merchants happy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Was there ever a moment when it all clicked and you knew you had the conviction to solve it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I was 22. I started noodling around with this idea to help merchants have the best experience with insurance administrators. For three months, I went to the same cafe for a few hours every day after work. I just went online, reading, and researching business plans. I had no idea what I was doing. I built a website for basically no reason. I talked to a ton of people to validate whether this idea could work, and see if those conversations could even lead to early customers. After three months, I was basically nowhere.</p><p>Then I went to Bonnaroo with ten friends. I bought a canopy tent from Walmart and the person checking me out asked if I wanted to buy a SquareTrade plan for it for $5, and I said sure. Without even thinking about it, I threw away the receipt for the contract as I walked out. I realized that the experience for Walmart and for me could be a lot better, and that was when I saw the opportunity.</p><p><strong>What did you learn in the first six months and how did it influence where Clyde is now?</strong></p><p>We were really fortunate in that the model was already built for us, to a degree. We had a concept that we knew was going to work. There were a ton of successful incumbents when we began, and it told us that product insurance works. We didn’t need to validate that. We just needed to develop a better way to get it into the customer’s hands. For us, we built a product that could be scalable from day one and then focused on who we went after. We haven’t had to tweak our product very much from the beginning.</p><p>What we learned about the most was how to scale, and how to sell. We were really lucky in one sense to not have to worry much about product development because of the established market. We learned far more about sales, how to turn one customer into ten customers, things like that.</p><p><strong>What would you tell 22-year-old Brandon?</strong></p><p>Your product doesn’t have to be perfect before your first launch. You’re better off getting it into people’s hands and getting feedback in order to improve. Sort of like “selling ahead of yourself.” We have four founders, all of whom are very product-focused people. We all want to sell something amazing. I would tell myself to take what I thought my MVP should be, cut it in half, and go with that at first.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How does it feel to be a young founder in an older, established industry?</strong></p><p>Last year I was named a top insurtech CEO and got invited to a photoshoot, and all of the other CEOs there were at least 20 years older than me. That felt surreal. I recently got chosen to be a speaker at Insurtech Connect on “Insurance in the Age of Ecommerce,” and was again by far the youngest person they filmed. I felt that. On a day-to-day basis, I don’t feel it as much because I’m not generally interacting with other founders in insurtech. But feeling so young has led me to surround myself with people who have more experience and expertise than I do. I want to hire people who have way more expertise than I do and learn from them.</p><p><strong>Speaking of surrounding yourself with the right people, who …</strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

        <blockquote><p>The truth is, most software systems don’t have automated tests for everything. What should we prioritize?</p></blockquote>
<p>You’re shipping a major update today! You have butterflies. Will it work? How can you make sure it does?</p>
<p>When we talk about this question, the answer “100% test coverage” comes up fairly frequently. No doubt, test coverage makes a huge difference. But it’s not always feasible, or even sufficient.</p>
<p>Maybe we inherited an existing application that was built without tests, and its critical functions require an update that cannot wait for us to backfill all the tests.</p>
<p>Maybe our software is written in a framework or under a deadline that makes 100% test coverage untenable.</p>
<p>Or maybe our application includes risks from which&nbsp; automated tests don’t protect us. Automated unit tests do little to warn us about low availability, or unique elements of the production environment, or system states that we didn’t anticipate when we wrote the code.</p>
<p>Maybe these caveat cases shouldn’t exist, but they do. Few software systems have <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/cultivating-the-right-mindset-for-successful-test-automation/">automated tests for everything</a>.</p>
<p>So what should we prioritize to make sure our system works, and how should we make sure it works? We need a system to identify and evaluate the risks we’re facing. It needs the right combination of practicality and thoroughness, and it should help us decide which parts of the system to prioritize in a software verification effort.</p>
<h3>Let’s look at an example</h3>
<p>Suppose you work for WalletPal, a website that helps people manage their expenses and receipts. The original application stores people’s receipt data in a relational database. Here’s a very high-level diagram of how it works:</p>
<center><a href="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/troy_Picture1.png" data-lity=""><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/troy_Picture1.png" alt="Assessing risk"></a></center><p>WalletPal wants to migrate the receipt data into a document database inside a new application. Then, the frontend on the original application will fetch the migrated data via an <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-is-api-testing/">HTTP API</a> instead of from its own database.</p>
<p>Here’s a diagram demonstrating the two different means by which the WalletPal interface would get data: the old way (local database), and the new way (HTTP API):</p>
<center><a href="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture2.png" data-lity=""><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture2.png" alt="Assessing risk"></a></center><p>Ultimately, you want a full cutover, so the frontend uses <em>only</em> the API and <em>not </em>the local relational database. At this point, the local database will be removed.</p>
<p>You’re in charge of rewriting that data layer and performing the cutover. The <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-challenges-of-testing-guis/">frontend itself</a> should not change.</p>
<p>How do you verify that this fairly large refactor works without messing up the application or its data?</p>
<h3>Make a risk profile</h3>
<p>A <em>risk profile</em> allows us to view and categorize the different risks in our system. We can document, quantify, and aggregate this data, but for many systems, I find it helpful to start with a handy diagram.</p>
<p>Let’s go through the diagram and ask the question:<em> What could go wrong here?</em></p>
<center><a href="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture3.png" data-lity=""><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture3.png" alt="Assessing risk"></a></center><p>For each major component (the rectangles) and each point where they communicate (the arrows), how could the system’s core functionality be disrupted? We think about each piece, and we write down what might go wrong at that point. In my example, I annotated a few of the risks for this system.</p>
<p>For this application, we have several <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/3-lessons-from-big-software-failures/">potential failures</a> at different levels of abstraction. For example, the system depends on an API, and that server could crash. Or the response could have a different structure than our client application expects. Maybe we’ll store so many receipts that we run out of memory! Or maybe something could go wrong with the import from the original database to the new one.</p>
<p>How do we prioritize our focus over all these myriad possibilities?</p>
<p>For each thing that could go wrong, answer three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would the outcome be catastrophic if this went wrong?</li>
<li>Is this likely to go wrong?</li>
<li>If this goes wrong, is it likely to sneak through QA and deployment?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these three questions checks for a <em>risk amplifier,</em> a condition that makes the consequences higher if <em>this</em> thing goes wrong. Let’s label the risk amplifiers on our diagram:</p>
<center><a href="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture4.png" data-lity=""><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture4.png" alt="Assessing risk"></a></center><p>Three risks really stick out: risks that are likely, or that are catastrophic, or that might go uncaught.</p>
<h3>Plan to prevent or mitigate those risks</h3>
<p>First, the API of our view might not match up with the structure of our data objects. This is relatively likely to happen. Certainly, it happens often on user interfaces: one piece of data has a field that’s null, and the application design and development did not account for that field being null. This happens so often that programming languages developed in the last ten years, like Swift and Kotlin, incorporate entire language design elements to avoid the dreaded Null Pointer Exception. This is something to watch out for. Either thoughtful language choice or thoughtful automated testing can help ensure that this doesn’t break in production.</p>
<p>Second, we have two interchangeable classes that might have inconsistent APIs. Unless the two classes are bound by an interface, it would be relatively easy for them to get out of step. In addition to the “likely” label, this risk also gets the “catastrophic” label because the system’s <em>core purpose</em> is to fetch and update receipts. If this goes wrong, the system cannot fulfill its core purpose. So we want to use a programming language with interface binding, or maybe an abstract class. If we can’t do either of those things, we could write a long, gnarly unit test that uses reflection to check these two classes’ APIs. Would it be pretty? Probably not, but it would protect us from a relatively likely and relatively problematic failure.</p>
<p>Third, we are migrating data between two databases. This is the kind of thing that rarely goes right on the first try, so we should expect an issue to occur. And once again, we apply the “catastrophic” label because poor data integrity affects Walletpal’s core functionality. But there’s a third, insidious risk amplifier here: the risk that an issue goes <em>uncaught</em>. Development teams tend to overlook this risk amplifier, but it can be <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54423988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the costliest one of all</a>.</p>
<h3>Here’s how a data issue might go uncaught</h3>
<p>What if that server serves data that <em>looks</em> kind of valid but is, in fact, inaccurate?</p>
<center><a href="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture5.png" data-lity=""><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture5.png" alt="Assessing risk"></a></center><p>
Check out this JSON representing a receipt. Everything on there is a perfectly valid ingredient, including the <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/maps/best-places-paczki-in-chicago-fat-tuesday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strawberry-flavored Polish pastry</a> listed on the fourth line. But there’s a special character in the name of that pastry.</p>
<center><a href="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture6.png" data-lity=""><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture6.png" alt="Assessing risk"></a></center><p>
Suppose that we send this receipt over to the server with the new database, but the parser cannot recognize that special character. Suppose, also, that the parser handles this by cutting off the string and only committing the part that parsed successfully.</p>
<p>In that case, when our purchaser looks at their receipt served from the new database, they might see something like this:</p>
<center><a href="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture7.png" data-lity=""><img src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Troy_Picture7.png" alt="Assessing risk"></a></center><p>
The new server’s version of this receipt only shows the portion of the items that appeared on the receipt before the weird character. It still looks like a receipt, but it’s missing items. <em>That</em> could go uncaught unless QA is looking <em>very</em> closely. This kind of data snafu is an excellent candidate for generative tests that help us identify edge cases and fallbacks.</p>
<h3>Think worst-case scenario</h3>
<p>Automated testing can help us make sure that we ship stable software without feature regressions. But what if we’re shipping under circumstances that do not loan themselves to 100% test coverage? And what if we’re dealing with <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/automated-functional-testing-101/">potential failures that automated tests do not adequately address</a>?</p>
<p>A risk mitigation approach requires more nuance than, “Write a test for each line of code and you should be fine.” Instead, examine the system as a whole and develop a holistic understanding of its risks.</p>
<p>First, we identify things that could go wrong in our system, both within components and at the seams. Next, we label them with three risk amplifiers: Would they prevent the application from doing its core function, are they likely to happen, or could they go uncaught after deployment?</p>
<p>Finally, make a plan to mitigate the largest risks and communicate those risks to the rest of the team (perhaps over pączkis). Mitigation tactics might include language choices, test harnesses, quality assurance, or other tactics that suit the situation.</p>
<p>This risk-focused perspective, over time, makes it easier for you and your teammates to spot and preemptively address the problems that could become headaches later.</p>

October 14, 2020 | https://ctoomey.com/writing/read-only-mode-for-better-rails-downtime/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ctoomey.com/writing/read-only-mode-for-better-rails-downtime/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  <p>Recently I was looking to upgrade the Postgres version on an application I’ve
been working on. This would require a small amount of downtime, likely about 10
minutes.</p>

<p>The default solution I’d reach for in these cases would be to go into Heroku’s
maintenance mode, which serves an HTML maintenance page with a <code>503 Service
Unavailable</code> status code. This works but makes the application entirely
unusable during the upgrade, and I was hoping to find a better solution. In this
particular case, I also wanted to be able to provide JSON responses as the
application mainly provides an API for a mobile app.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.bikeshed.fm/262">exploring a handful of half-baked options</a>, I settled on using a
read-only connection to the database to still allow reads but prevent any
writes from occurring. While using the read-only connection, the Postgres adapter
will raise an error any time we attempt to change data in the database, but we
can easily rescue this specific error and convert it to a user-facing notice. I
felt a bit odd using exceptions as the core of this workflow, but in the end, it
worked out really well, so I wanted to share the specifics.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that this solution is particularly well suited to this
specific application, which only provides an API and has very read-heavy usage,
but I imagine it could be extended to work with other styles of app as well.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-rails-to-use-the-read-only-connection">Configuring Rails to Use the Read-Only Connection</h2>

<p>If present, Rails will use the connection string in a <code>DATABASE_URL</code> env var to
connect to the database. Following the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#connection-preference">Connection Preference</a> notes in the
Rails guides, I realized that I could make this <code>DATABASE_URL</code> usage explicit
and allow for a temporary override. To do this, I added an explicit <code>url</code>
property for the production environment with desired connection preference:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># config/database.yml</span>

<span>production</span><span>:</span>
  <span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>:</span> <span>*default</span>
  <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>&lt;%= ENV["DATABASE_URL_READ_ONLY"] || ENV["DATABASE_URL"] %&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With this in place, I can enable the read-only mode simply by setting the
<code>DATABASE_URL_READ_ONLY</code> env var:</p>

<div><pre><code>heroku config:set <span>\</span>
  <span>DATABASE_URL_READ_ONLY</span><span>=</span><span>'postgres://read_only_user:abc123...'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--remote</span> production
</code></pre></div>
<p>Likewise, to disable the read-only mode, I can use:</p>

<div><pre><code>heroku config:unset DATABASE_URL_READ_ONLY <span>--remote</span> production
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Note</em>: I was able to use <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql-credentials#managing-permissions">Heroku’s Postgres Credentials</a> interface to create
the read-only user, but if you’re not working with Heroku you should be able to
use <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/160817">these instructions</a> to create your read-only user.</p>

<h2 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h2>

<p>With other approaches I considered I found that I had to close off multiple
different potential ways to issue writes to the database, but the read-only
connection worked well to cut everything off in one change. That said, it
was only half the solution, as I certainly didn’t want the errors making it to
users.</p>

<p>Thankfully it was relatively straightforward to provide a centralized <code>rescue</code>
that would allow me to handle all the errors. First, I created a module using
Rails’s <code>ActiveSupport::Concern</code> functionality:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># app/controllers/concerns/read_only_controller_support.rb</span>
<span>module</span> <span>ReadOnlyControllerSupport</span>
  <span>extend</span> <span>ActiveSupport</span><span>::</span><span>Concern</span>

  <span>included</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>ENV</span><span>[</span><span>"DATABASE_URL_READ_ONLY"</span><span>].</span><span>present?</span>
      <span>rescue_from</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>StatementInvalid</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>error</span><span>|</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>message</span><span>.</span><span>match?</span><span>(</span><span>/PG::InsufficientPrivilege/i</span><span>)</span>
          <span>render</span><span>(</span>
            <span>status: :service_unavailable</span><span>,</span>
            <span>json: </span><span>{</span>
              <span>info: </span><span>"The app is currently in read-only maintenance mode. Please try again later."</span><span>,</span>
            <span>},</span>
          <span>)</span>
        <span>else</span>
          <span>raise</span> <span>error</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When included, this module will use Rails’s <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Rescuable/ClassMethods.html#method-i-rescue_from"><code>rescue_from</code></a> method to capture
potentially relevant errors, and then we do a quick check within that block
to make sure we’re only capturing the relevant errors.</p>

<p>Note, the <code>rescue_from</code> logic is only enabled when the <code>DATABASE_URL_READ_ONLY</code>
is set, so we’re able to reuse the existence of that variable as a way to scope
this behavior.</p>

<p>I was then able to include that module in any relevant base controller:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># app/controllers/application_controller.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ApplicationController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActionController</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
  <span>include</span> <span>ReadOnlyControllerSupport</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># app/controllers/api/base_controller.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Api</span><span>::</span><span>BaseController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActionController</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
  <span>include</span> <span>ReadOnlyControllerSupport</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="non-api-error-handling">Non-API Error Handling</h2>

<p>My initial use case for this read-only mode only needed to support API requests,
but I could imagine extending it to HTML and form-based interfaces.</p>

<p>The first thing I would consider would be adding a sitewide banner that stated
that we were in a read-only maintenance mode to alert users to the current
status.</p>

<p>With that in place, I think we could extend the error handling in the
<code>ReadOnlyControllerSupport</code> module to redirect the user back and display a
relevant message:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>rescue_from</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>StatementInvalid</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>error</span><span>|</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>error</span><span>.</span><span>message</span><span>.</span><span>match?</span><span>(</span><span>/PG::InsufficientPrivilege/i</span><span>)</span>
    <span>respond_to</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>format</span><span>|</span>
      <span>format</span><span>.</span><span>json</span> <span>do</span>
        <span># JSON erorr message as shown above</span>
      <span>end</span>

      <span>format</span><span>.</span><span>html</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>redirect_back</span><span>(</span>
          <span>fallback_location: </span><span>root_path</span><span>,</span>
          <span>alert: </span><span>"The app is currently in read-only maintenance mode. Please try again later."</span><span>,</span>
        <span>)</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>error</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="scheduler-and-background-jobs">Scheduler and Background Jobs</h2>

<p>One additional consideration here would be around background jobs and scheduler
processes. For background jobs things are relatively straightforward – we just
need to scale our worker pool down to zero for the read-only period.</p>

<p>Scheduler processes are a little trickier as I didn’t have a mechanism for
globally enabling or disabling them. With that in mind, I think the ideal
solution would be to only ever have scheduler processes enqueue jobs but not
actually do any work beyond that.</p>

<h2 id="migrations">Migrations</h2>

<p>The final sticking point we ran into was migrations. We have a <code>release</code> command
defined in our <code>Procfile</code> that was configured to run <code>rake db:migrate</code>.
Unfortunately, it turns out that even if no migrations run, Rails will still
attempt to write to the <code>ar_internal_metadata</code> table as part of the <code>db:migrate</code>
command, and Heroku will run the release command any time we change an env. In
my initial attempt, Heroku failed when I attempted to set the
<code>DATABASE_URL_READ_ONLY</code> as the associated release command hit the read-only
error when running <code>rake db:migrate</code>.</p>

<p>To work around this I wrote a small script that first checks if there
are any migrations that need to be run, and only if there are, then runs <code>rake
db:migrate</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>set</span> <span>-e</span>

<span>if </span>bin/rails db:migrate:status | <span>grep</span> <span>'^\s\+down\s'</span><span>;</span> <span>then
  </span>bin/rails db:migrate
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This script was added to the repo as <code>bin/migrate-if-needed</code>, and then we
replaced our call to <code>rake db:migrate</code> with <code>bin/migrate-if-needed</code></p>

<h2 id="update-oct-14-2020">Update (Oct 14, 2020)</h2>

<p>After sharing this post, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24780033">a commenter on Hacker News</a> pointed out <a href="https://github.com/discourse/rails_failover">the
rails_failover gem</a> that their team at Discourse maintains. It seems to offer
similar functionality, but in a more robust and fully thought out way. Looks
like a great option to implement this sort of system.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3><strong>Background</strong></h3><div><p>On June 11, 2020, an AI research and deployment company OpenAI – founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others – announced its revolutionary language model, GPT-3. The news quickly created buzz in tech circles with demo videos of early GPT-3 prototypes going viral on Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News.</p><p>Not everyone can access the GPT-3 API, though – at least just yet. To keep improving the model and its safety in a controlled setting, OpenAI has introduced a waitlist where people can apply for early access. According to an <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-gpt-3-everything-business-needs-to-know-about-openais-breakthrough-ai-language-program/" target="_blank">article by ZDNet</a> in late August, OpenAI had already <em>"gotten tens of thousands of applications for API access to date"</em>, and was being <em>"judicious about access as they learn just what these models can do in the real world"</em>.</p><p>4 months after its initial launch, the API remains in private beta – however, OpenAI continues to selectively invite people into its beta program.<br>‍</p></div><h3><strong>1. Application form</strong></h3><figure id="w-node-7d0e1d186a9a-1c6bbce1"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/5f8707f1519d0f0d73631cde_Screenshot%202020-10-12%20at%2016.13.29.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><br>The first thing was to send an application on OpenAI's official <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1Lfc7WtPLRk2ppXhPjcYY-A4sk30" target="_blank">API Waitlist form</a>. The form is fairly simple and basically only asks about your intended use case:</p><blockquote><em>Provide a brief description of the way that you or your organization might want to use the API (or if you're not sure, describe your current product or service). Where applicable, please include any initial thoughts you have around potential benefits or risks from your use case, or any other information that you'd like us to know.</em></blockquote><p><br>The point about benefits and risks is important. With 10 000s of people on the waitlist, which use cases would you prioritize if you were in OpenAI's shoes?</p><p><br>While we don't know the exact answer, our best guess is those that have the potential to either:</p><ol role="list"><li>Become significant in size (and thereby, a relevant revenue source for OpenAI)</li><li>Make a positive impact on society (instead of producing e.g. hateful, political or racist content), or</li><li>Benefit the development of the API in some way (in terms of e.g. safety or accuracy)</li></ol><p><br>Regarding the length of the answer, ours was roughly 200 words. Answer the questions thoroughly while keeping it concise.<br>‍</p><h3><strong>2. Outreach</strong></h3><p>We soon realized that the application itself was not going to do the job. Since we wanted to move fast, waiting for months to get our hands on the API was out of the question, and we started looking for ways to speed up the process.</p><p>First, we found plenty of Tweets like these:</p><figure id="w-node-07c444930544-1c6bbce1"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6fde4c74a4afd8fb269414/5f870825d07ffb27ff6ca27a_Screenshot%202020-10-12%20at%2013.28.43.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><div><p>Apparently, there was a chance to get access by emailing Greg Brockman (OpenAI CTO). So we did that (a couple of times actually). We also emailed others in the organization, however, we don't necessarily recommend doing so; a much better use of your time is to target only one person with a crystal clear and well-thought-out proposition.</p><p>If you decide to go with this approach, you might want to consider mentioning:</p></div><ul role="list"><li>Why the idea is important to you and how people can benefit from it</li><li>How OpenAI can benefit from it</li><li>Your background with links to your profiles and/or portfolio<br>‍</li></ul><h3><strong>3. Stand out</strong></h3><p>For us, the key to obtaining access was eventually to do something special and get noticed by the folks at OpenAI.

                <!--?xml encoding="UTF-8" ?--><p>We’re excited to announce that starting next week, Zoom’s end-to-end encryption (E2EE) offering will be available as a technical preview, which means we’re proactively soliciting feedback from users for the first 30 days. Zoom users – free and paid – around the world can host up to 200 participants in an E2EE meeting on Zoom, providing increased privacy and security for your Zoom sessions.</p>



<p>We <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-acquires-keybase-and-announces-goal-of-developing-the-most-broadly-used-enterprise-end-to-end-encryption-offering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in May</a> our plans to build an end-to-end-encrypted meeting option into our platform, on top of Zoom’s already strong encryption and advanced security features. We’re pleased to roll out Phase 1 of 4 of our E2EE offering, which provides robust protections to help prevent the interception of decryption keys that could be used to monitor meeting content.</p>



<h2>About E2EE</h2>



<p>To be clear, Zoom’s E2EE uses the same powerful GCM encryption you get now in a Zoom meeting. The only difference is where those encryption keys live.</p>



<p>In typical meetings, Zoom’s cloud generates encryption keys and distributes them to meeting participants using Zoom apps as they join. With Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting’s host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to distribute these keys to the other meeting participants. Zoom’s servers become oblivious relays and never see the encryption keys required to decrypt the meeting contents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“End-to-end encryption is another stride toward making Zoom the most secure communications platform in the world,” said Zoom CEO Eric S. Yuan. “This phase of our E2EE offering provides the same security as existing end-to-end-encrypted messaging platforms, but with the video quality and scale that has made Zoom the communications solution of choice for hundreds of millions of people and the world’s largest enterprises.”</p>



<p>Zoom’s E2EE will be available as a technical preview next week. To use it, customers must enable E2EE meetings at the account level and opt-in to E2EE on a per-meeting basis.</p>



<figure><img alt="" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/t2TiiQUVghal7h8dVHrvTZL-14BVFCJELb7TtGg81kjh3EDA62hSNF-_vDucMMyjmLeyYhgGTQwBd214jVKbj4gfjq9o3wwshEo35R9XiijNxcbwl-I6kZzcrcshTDQ4XSo4UcDs"></figure><h2>FAQs</h2>



<p><strong>How does Zoom provide end-to-end encryption?</strong></p>



<p>Zoom’s E2EE offering uses public key cryptography. In short, the keys for each Zoom meeting are generated by participants’ machines, not by Zoom’s servers. Encrypted data relayed through Zoom’s servers is indecipherable by Zoom, since Zoom’s servers do not have the necessary decryption key. This key management strategy is similar to that used by most end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms today.</p>



<p><strong>How do I turn on E2EE?</strong></p>



<p>Hosts can enable the setting for E2EE at the account, group, and user level and can be locked at the account or group level. All participants must have the setting enabled to join an E2EE meeting. In Phase 1, all meeting participants must join from the Zoom desktop client, mobile app, or Zoom Rooms.</p>



<p><strong>When would I use E2EE?</strong></p>



<p>E2EE is best for when you want enhanced privacy and data protection for your meetings, and is an extra layer to mitigate risk and protect sensitive meeting content. While E2EE provides added security, some Zoom functionality is limited in this first E2EE version (more on that below). Individual Zoom users should determine whether they need these features before enabling this version of E2EE in their meetings.</p>



<p><strong>Do I have access to all the features of a regular Zoom meeting?</strong></p>



<p>Not right now. Enabling this version of Zoom’s E2EE in your meetings disables certain features, including join before host, cloud recording, streaming, live transcription, Breakout Rooms, polling, 1:1 private chat, and meeting reactions.</p>



<p><strong>Do free Zoom users have access to end-to-end encryption?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. Free and paid Zoom accounts joining from Zoom’s desktop client or mobile app, or from a Zoom Room, can host or join an E2EE meeting.</p>



<p><strong>How is this different from Zoom’s enhanced GCM encryption?</strong></p>



<p>Zoom meetings and webinars by default use AES 256-bit GCM encryption for audio, video, and application sharing (i.e., screen sharing, whiteboarding) in transit between Zoom applications, clients, and connectors. In a meeting without E2EE enabled, audio and video content flowing between users’ Zoom apps is not decrypted until it reaches the recipients’ devices. However, the encryption keys for each meeting are generated and managed by Zoom’s servers. In a meeting with E2EE enabled, nobody except each participant – not even Zoom’s servers – has access to the encryption keys being used to encrypt the meeting.</p>



<p><strong>How do I verify that my meeting is using end-to-end-encryption?</strong></p>



<p>Participants can look for a green shield logo in the upper left corner of their meeting screen with a padlock in the middle to indicate their meeting is using E2EE. It looks similar to our GCM encryption symbol, but the checkmark is replaced with a lock.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" alt="" width="325" height="324" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/z-Qf8a0hn5w7dX4q7GAQjGc4iNM_b45r45Um6g7iai7jV9xtmHmcl8WI26vkdAtGfLZrzZTdrszHO6kpgAKspf8rGJ7XcSYrM6asib4EgPyEwFwQkOWmPQuwYI-WplnUflaStT3T"></figure><p>Participants will also see the meeting leader’s security code that they can use to verify the secure connection. The host can read this code out loud, and all participants can check that their clients display the same code.</p>



<figure><img alt="" data-src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Mox0nHn2hmBZqje0OSqXI46iBlhD0YmFzqG0Cv04IIDhUgN76uvL2WCP9NPhZNtKcBV0QMGugkdsUxaeVjgTjnhMrF_DGZBxW7slPIPDYGDUrqYVEiSHFgu-pLAtyYJYgAJ0fJJQ"></figure><p><strong>How will you continue to provide a safe and secure platform?</strong></p>



<p>Zoom’s top priority is the trust and safety of our users, and our implementation of E2EE will allow us to continue to enhance safety on our platform. Free/Basic users seeking access to E2EE will participate in a one-time verification process that will prompt the user for additional pieces of information, such as verifying a phone number via text message. Many leading companies perform similar steps to reduce the mass creation of abusive accounts. We are confident that by implementing risk-based authentication, in combination with our current mix of tools — including our work with human rights and children’s safety organizations and our users’ ability to lock down a meeting, report abuse, and a myriad of other features made available as part of our security icon — we can continue to enhance the safety of our users.</p>



<p><strong>What is the rest of the timeline for E2EE?</strong></p>



<p>We plan to roll out better identity management and E2EE SSO integration as part of Phase 2, which is tentatively roadmapped for 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the shrieking hysterical shitshow that was the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, everybody knew that the Amy Coney Barret hearings would be contentious, given the perceived stakes.<span id="more-1221"></span></p>
<p>An initial attempt was made to paint Coney’s adoption of black children from Haiti as somehow colonial or a thinly veiled attempt to cover her inherent racism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Some White colonizers “adopted” Black children. They “civilized” these “savage” children in the “superior” ways of White people, while using them as props in their lifelong pictures of denial, while cutting the biological parents of these children out of the picture of humanity. <a href="https://t.co/XBE9rRnoqq">https://t.co/XBE9rRnoqq</a></p>
<p>— Ibram X. Kendi (@DrIbram) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrIbram/status/1309916696296198146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That was quickly aborted when pretty well everybody (including me, an adoptive father of a black child) found that indefensible and beyond unhinged.</p>
<p>Now a new front has been opened against the nominee. This time it’s her use of the word “preference” when she indicated that she would exercise jurisprudence without judging sexual preference.</p>
<p>Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) called her use of it “offensive and outdated”, before asking Coney if she’d ever sexually assaulted anyone.</p>
<p>Bluecheck Twitter immediately seized the baton, decreeing in true 1984-style that using the phrase “sexual preference” was offensive, has always been offensive and shall evermore be, offensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">i’m fucking exhausted <a href="https://t.co/gjmsQtgBFh">pic.twitter.com/gjmsQtgBFh</a></p>

<p>On it’s own, this would be just another tiresome episode of the Woke Social Order on a mission to be offended, trying to head off what they see as a disastrous outcome for the replacement of the late great Ruth Bader Ginsburg (who, tangentially, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/26/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-kavanaugh-gorsuch/index.html">described Brett Kavanaugh as “very decent and very smart”</a> after he joined SCOTUS. Oh, and she also used the term “sexual preference” in 2017, btw).</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who Mazie Hirono called “our champion” on Monday, used the term “sexual preference” in 2017. Hirono jumped on Amy Coney Barrett for saying it Tuesday, calling it “offensive and outdated.” <a href="https://t.co/8bHIQTSVFk">pic.twitter.com/8bHIQTSVFk</a> <a href="https://t.co/JlcRA35g59">https://t.co/JlcRA35g59</a></p>

<p>But it has been pointed out that the venerable institution that documents the literal meaning of words, Merriam Webster, quickly modified the definition of “preference”, to include:</p>
<div id="dictionary-entry-1">
<div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><span><span>5 </span></span><strong><span>offensive</span></strong>,&nbsp;<span>see usage paragraph below&nbsp;</span><span><span><strong>:&nbsp;</strong><span>ORIENTATION</span>&nbsp;<span>sense 2b </span><span>sexual&nbsp;<span>preference:</span></span></span></span></p>
<div>
<h4>Usage of&nbsp;<span>Preference</span></h4>
<p>The term&nbsp;<em>preference</em>&nbsp;as used to refer to sexual orientation is <strong>widely considered</strong> offensive in its implied suggestion that a person can choose who they are sexually or romantically attracted to</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>This negative connotation was not there before Hirono’s remarks.</h3>
<p>“Widely considered” my ass. Literally nobody <em>in the world </em>thought this yesterday morning. Seriously. Twitter is alight with countless examples of Leftist mavens using the exact phrase which offended exactly zero people, anywhere, until now (Meanwhile, I imagine woke bluechecks are frantically scrubbing their timelines of “sexual preferences” as you read this).</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As recently as last month, Webster’s Dictionary included a definition of “preference” as “orientation” or “sexual preference.” TODAY they changed it and added the word “offensive.”</p>
<p>Insane – I just checked through Wayback Machine and it’s real.</p>
<p>(via <a href="https://twitter.com/thorsvensonn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ThorSvensonn</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/chadfelixg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@chadfelixg</a>) <a href="https://t.co/oOq1SNtCP2">pic.twitter.com/oOq1SNtCP2</a></p>

<p>Merriam Webster’s page for “preference” shows that it was updated on October 13, 2020, which would have been immediately after all this&nbsp; broke loose.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://axisofeasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/preference-1024x320.png" alt="" width="1024" height="320"></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/UdMbi">Screengrabs</a> via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200928131548/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/preference">Waybackmachine</a> and <a href="http://archive.is/UdMbi">archive.is</a> show that there was no offensive meaning in the word definition prior to this manufactured outrage.</p>
<h3><strong>Why this is important</strong></h3>
<p>Because&nbsp; it portends that words will no longer mean what is defined in an ostensibly impartial, objective dictionary. <em>They now mean what politically über-correct social justice warriors say they mean.</em> And if that’s the case, <em>it also means that nobody can ever take issue or dissent from the Woke Social Order’s belief system without being, “by definition”, morally reprobate and wrong headed.</em></p>
<p>When I imagine “the word committee”, or whoever it is at Webster’s who decide what goes into the dictionary or when to change the meaning of a word, I always pictured a musty boardroom lined with books and a bunch of stodgy, learned academics slumped over the table, adorned with cobwebs … and every 10 or 20 years some clerk comes in with a list of word additions or meaning modifications and one of them just lifts up a rubber stamper that says “NO” and wordlessly hammers it down, sending the hapless intern on their way.</p>
<p>I guess I was wrong, and what it really must be now is some energized, hipster cultural Marxists cobbling new words and meanings off of Twitter and fashioning them to suit the far-left outrage du jour. Maybe we should be <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/contact-us">contacting the staff at MW</a> and asking them about the review and vetting process that has them arbitrarily changing the meaning of words in their dictionary based on a twitchunt.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2 id="000004">00:00:04</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.</p><p>Today we’re going to talk about a deceptively simple topic: clock synchronization. I think there’s nothing like trying to write computer programs to manipulate time to convince you that time is an incredibly complicated thing, and it’s complicated in like 16 different ways, from time zones to leap seconds to all sorts of other crazy things, but one of the really interesting corners of this world is how do you get all of the clocks on your big computer network to roughly agree with each other? In other words, clock synchronization.</p><p>So we’re going to talk about that with Chris Perl, who’s a sysadmin, who’s worked at Jane Street since 2012. Chris is better than anyone I have ever worked with, at diving into the horrible details of complex systems and understanding how they work and how they can be made to work better, and he’s done a lot of work here, specifically on clock synchronization, and has, in the course of that, redone our entire system for doing clock synchronization, so he’s had an opportunity to really learn a lot about the topic. Chris, to get started, can you give us just a quick overview of how computer clocks work in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="000115">00:01:15</h2>

<p>So, I guess the rough gist is something like you have some oscillator, a little crystal effectively that’s inside the computer that is oscillating at some frequency, and that’s driving an interrupt that the operating system is going to handle in some level – there’s probably lots of details here that I’m just skipping over – but that’s driving an interrupt that’s going happen in the operating system. And the operating system is using that to derive its notion of time, and so if you have a really high-quality oscillator, and those timer interrupts happen at the right rate so that you’re tracking real-time that might just happen, and if your oscillator’s very good, and very stable you could actually just be pretty close to the correct time just by virtue of that. But the truth is that most computers come with fairly bad oscillators and they change their frequencies for various reasons like heat, so if you are using your computer to compile the Linux kernel or something like that, that could change the heat profile, change the frequency of the oscillator, and actually change how well you’re doing of keeping real time.</p>

<h2 id="000205">00:02:05</h2>

<p>When we naively think of clock synchronization as people, we think of it as like, “I’m going to go set my clock”. I’m going to look at what time it is and adjust my clock to match whatever real-time is, but you’re actually talking about a different thing here. You’re talking not just about setting what the right time is right now but keeping that time correct, essentially keeping the rate at which time is going forward in sync.</p>

<h2 id="000224">00:02:24</h2>

<p>Correct. You’d love it if you could get like a really, really high-quality oscillator for super cheap in all your computers and then you wouldn’t need a lot of adjustment to get them to keep the correct time, but that would be really expensive. You can buy such things, they just cost a lot of money.</p>

<h2 id="000237">00:02:37</h2>

<p>So, you say that heat and various other things that are going on in the computer will cause this rate at which time is appearing to march forward inside of your computer to drift around. How accurate are these? Can give me a kind of numerical sense of how far these things drift away?</p>

<h2 id="000253">00:02:53</h2>

<p>The stuff that we run, we capture some of these statistics, we see machines that have a frequency correction applied to them of, say, 50 parts per million, which is like microseconds per second, so that works out to roughly a couple seconds per day, is how you would wind up drifting off. But I’m sure that if you had a super old desktop under your desk, that you stole from your parents or something and you were trying to rebuild into a Linux box, you might have worse numbers than that. Like a sort of relatively current generation server from a well-known vendor, you’re talking somewhere around 50 to 100 microseconds per second that they can sort of walk-off out of alignment.</p>

<h2 id="000327">00:03:27</h2>

<p>Okay, so clock synchronization is the process of trying to get all of those clocks that you have across your whole data center and across multiple data centers to be in sync with each other. Is that the right way of thinking about it?</p>

<h2 id="000339">00:03:39</h2>

<p>I think so. “In sync”, is an interesting sort of thing to say, right? You kind of would like that if you were able to instantaneously ask two random servers on your network, what time it was at the same exact point in time, if you could somehow magically do that, that they would agree to some relatively small margin of error, and I think that that’s kind of what we mean by clock synchronization. That if you could somehow magically freeze time and go ask every single computer on your network, “Hey. What time do you think it is?” that they would all roughly agree to within some error bound that you can define.</p>

<h2 id="000413">00:04:13</h2>

<p>Right. And this basic model actually assumes that there is a well-defined notion of what it means to be instantaneously at the same time, which isn’t exactly true because of relativity and stuff like that, but we’re going to mostly ignore that. So, I guess one property that you’re highlighting here is having the clocks agree with each other, and that’s part of it, but there’s another piece, right, which is having the clocks agree with some external reference. There’s some notion of like, what does the world think the time is? So, where does that external reference come from?</p>

<h2 id="000435">00:04:35</h2>

<div><p>I’m not an expert on this stuff, but I’ll give you the sort of 10,000-foot view. You have various physics laboratories all over the world, like NPL in the UK, and other places across the world. They all have measurements of what they think time is, using things like hydrogen masers and sort of very accurate atomic methods. They contribute all of that stuff to a single source who kind of averages it, or does some sort of weighting, to come up with what the correct time is, and then you kind of magic that over to the Air Force, who then sends it up to the GPS constellation. And GPS has a mechanism for getting time from the GPS satellites down to GPS receivers, and so if you’re a person who runs a computer network and you’re interested in synchronizing your clocks to a relatively high degree of accuracy with something like UTC, which is effectively Greenwich Mean Time, it is just sort of the current time without time zones applied. </p><p>If you’re interested in doing that, what you can do is you can just go out to a vendor and you can buy a thing called a GPS appliance, which can hook up to a little antenna that goes onto the roof. It can receive this signal from the GPS constellation and basically gives you out time, and the accuracy there is something like maybe 100 nanoseconds or so. So you’ve got the sort of atomic measurements being fed up to a GPS constellation, down to GPS receivers that you, as an operator of a computer network, can buy.</p></div>

<h2 id="000557">00:05:57</h2>

<p>And for the purposes of this conversation, we’re going to treat those GPS receivers as the received wisdom as to what time it is, and our job is to figure out how, inside of a computer network, you make all of the different devices agree with each other and agree with that external reference.</p>

<h2 id="000611">00:06:11</h2>

<p>Correct.</p>

<h2 id="000612">00:06:12</h2>

<p>Why is it important? What does having synchronized clocks help you do?</p>

<h2 id="000622">00:06:22</h2>

<p>If you put yourself in the shoes of a financial regulatory authority, and you have all these different participants out there doing stuff with computer systems, and something weird happens, and you’d like to come up with a total ordering of events of what led to this crazy thing – or what led to this good thing, who knows – but you want to have a total ordering of events. If people don’t have good clock synchronization, to some external source, you can’t compare the timestamp from participant A to the timestamp from participant B, so if you were to decree everybody must have time that is within some error bound, you know if these timestamps are within that error bound, well, then I can’t be sure about the ordering, but if they’re farther away than that then I can be sure about the ordering. I can know which one came first and which one came second, and that can be very useful.</p>

<h2 id="000655">00:06:55</h2>

<p>So that’s the motivation that’s very specific to our industry, but don’t people in other industries care a lot about clock synchronization, too? I would have thought that there are other reasons that would drive you to want to synchronize the machines on the network.</p>

<h2 id="000706">00:07:06</h2>

<p>Oh, sure. There’s lots of different things. I mean, just like a general sysadmin topic, a lot of times you want to gather logs from all the systems on your computer network, and you want to analyze them for various reasons. Maybe it’s because you’re concerned about intruders. Or maybe it’s because you’re just trying to understand the way things are functioning, and if your clocks aren’t synchronized it’s very hard to kind of understand things that might have happened on system B and how they relate to system A because the two timestamps are just not – you just can’t compare them if they’re not synchronized.</p>

<h2 id="000733">00:07:33</h2>

<p>And I suppose there are also some distributed systems, algorithmic reasons to want clocks. Certainly, some kinds of distributed algorithms end up using clocks as ways of breaking ties between systems, and so that requires at least some reasonable level of synchronization.</p>

<h2 id="000745">00:07:45</h2>

<p>For sure. There’s also other network protocols that are widely used that require clock synchronization, but much less precise levels of clock synchronization. Kerberos is a widely used authentication protocol, and that requires that the clocks be synchronized to within five minutes, and the idea there is to thwart replay attacks, and stuff like that, making …</p></div></div>

<figure><blockquote><p>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.</p><cite>Parkinson’s Law</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The more I think about it, the more I’m convinced that Parkinson’s Law runs the world. </p>



<p>There are lots of fun corollaries here, such as:</p>



<blockquote><p>Work <em>complicates </em>to fill the available time.</p><cite>Parkinson’s Law, but spicier</cite></blockquote>



<p>The work doesn’t just expand, it <em>complicates</em>. And remember that work doesn’t complicate itself, humans have to do that. We are our own worst enemy, as usual.</p>



<blockquote><p>If you wait until the last minute, it only takes a minute to do.</p><cite>Stock–Sanford corollary</cite></blockquote>



<p>Said every student ever, amirite?</p>



<blockquote><p>In ten hours a day you have time to fall twice as far behind your commitments as in five hours a day</p><cite>Asimov corollary</cite></blockquote>



<p>That one reminds me of the quote <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/29/if-you-want-a-task-done-quickly-ask-a-busy-person-to-do-it/">“If you want a task done quickly, ask a busy person to do&nbsp;it.”</a></p>



<p>And as with all good things, Parkinson’s Law applies to computers:</p>



<blockquote><p>Data expands to fill the space available for storage.</p><cite>Peter Jansen</cite></blockquote>



<p>But my favorite is this one:</p>



<blockquote><p>Work <em>contracts</em> to fit in the time we give it.</p><cite>Horstman’s corollary</cite></blockquote>



<p>The book <em>Critical Chain</em> by Eliyahu Goldratt says we should estimate with 50% certainty instead of 90+%. Say there’s a 50% chance you can get something done in 1 week, and a 90% chance you can get it done in 2 weeks. Go with the 1 week estimate. That’ll prevent the work from expanding to fill the 2 weeks. </p>



<p>Goldratt calls it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_syndrome">Student Syndrome</a>. Students wait until the last minute because that triggers a feeling of urgency. They need that urgency to find the motivation to work on it.</p>



<p>When we estimate with 90% certainty, we’re expecting to finish early. But we never do, because of Parkinson’s Law/Student Syndrome. So the buffer we add onto each task gets eaten up, meaning the project doesn’t have any wiggle room. Then all it takes is a delay on a single task to push back the entire critical path, and the project is late.</p>



<p>Estimating with 50% certainty should fix that, according to Goldratt. Instead of adding a buffer to each task, combine all those per-task buffers and shove them at the end of the project. That way delays in tasks don’t push back the project, and Parkinson’s Law can help us instead of strangle us.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/16/estimates-vs-appetites/">Estimates vs. appetites</a> chapter from the book <em>Shape Up</em> is a neato burrito implementation of this. They say how much time a feature is worth to them (i.e., their “appetite”). The feature expands or contracts to fit that time.</p>



<p>Then there’s Scrum, where Sprints are an answer to Parkinson’s Law. Each Sprint is a deadline, even if we call it a “forecast.” It’s a line in the sand that’s missing from Kanban’s focus on cycle time over velocity. That’s  part of why Scrum has been so successful.</p>



<p>Think about the world through the lens of Parkinson’s Law. It’s everywhere. </p>

The Idea</h2><p>Think of a market of one and ask yourself:</p><blockquote><strong>What’s a tool or idea that I’ve always wanted for myself?</strong></blockquote><p>The reason you think of yourself is that you’re accessible. You know your likes, dislikes and pain points on the daily. Secondly, the chances that there are people in the world similar to you is fairly high. Therefore, whatever you build is likely to find at a home or interest with least one other person.</p><p>Solving a real world problem (at any size) gives you something more ‘shippable’, which demonstrates an ability to take:</p><blockquote>Idea &nbsp;→ Design → Product → Launch</blockquote><p>Your initial idea doesn’t need to be grandiose, but it should be something that you personally think is interesting to use.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If you’re having trouble deciding, just pick the platform you have a phone for and the tools to build on.</p><h3 id="4-managing-the-process">4. Managing the Process</h3><p>Creating a plan to manage your project can make an idea more concrete. Adding process makes the building phase more deliberate and thoughtful with deadlines to discipline yourself to.</p><p>Additionally, planning out a few features, and having a system around it, enables you to pick up where you left off in the road map.</p><p><strong>Context penalties </strong>are the price you pay to get “back into the zone” after stopping a task and coming back to it at a later time. These penalties are<strong> </strong>huge costs in software development, but can be mitigated with a plan or road map.</p><p>Finally, planning improves your accountability and awareness to keep yourself on track — which translates well to leading teams be it technical, design or product teams.</p><h3 id="4-1-planning-and-features">4.1 Planning and Features</h3><p>The system can be as simple or complex as you’d like, for example, just using GitHub Issues to track features and bugs. Below is two examples of projects:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1280/0*WNP1cxDngpvUtxjt."></figure><p>Even creating two simple tags: Feature or Bug, and writing down the features you want to build before building, can save a lot of headaches.</p><h3 id="4-2-setting-deadlines">4.2 Setting Deadlines</h3><p>Setting deadlines for the project is critical. Without a deadline you can keep putting off releasing to the world. The project will never be “quite good enough” and there’s always “one more thing to add”. Better yet, you can “forget about the project” to work on something else without a goal in mind.</p><p>Deadlines keep you accountable, and increase the pressure for you to learn and build. By formalizing a deadline, you can prioritize or de-prioritize features, versions and bug fixes in order to hit the release. You’re deadline will be arbitrary, don’t worry. Just get a reasonable date sometime in the future and let that be your goal.</p><p>Try to work in deadlines somewhere between 1 to 3 months to ship and publish a minimum build!</p><h3 id="4-3-setting-criteria">4.3 Setting Criteria</h3><p>Make a set of criteria under which you would be <em>minimally satisfied</em> with the the product you produce and will release under.</p><p>This could be a set of features, or a special feature milestone, under which a application will be considered a “release candidate”.</p><p>Example,</p><blockquote>Once we implement the database upgrade, and new profile design, we can launch</blockquote><p>It’s critical to set a finite number of criteria and not to let things keep creeping in (also known as "scope creep"). Otherwise you’ll delay release, testing, or worse, create potential upgrade and usability conflicts.</p><p>GitHub milestones are useful for this activity. </p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1280/0*i3MNuLAPL97NJ-Pn."></figure><p><strong>How many features should I put in a milestone?</strong></p><p>5–20 depending on complexity</p><h3 id="5-pre-and-post-releasing-your-product">5. Pre and Post Releasing Your Product</h3><blockquote><strong>Releasing </strong>is it publication of a project or product to a general audience freely</blockquote><p>Before release understand how applications are released on the web versus mobile.</p><p>Web applications have a different protocols for deploying, releasing, and marketing compared to mobile apps. For example, web apps lack dedicated distribution channels (e.g. no "Web app store"), or rigorous standards to enforce. This offers flexibility but &nbsp;complication.</p><p>Mobile applications, on the other hand, have &nbsp;straight forward distribution channels such as the Apple App Store or Google Play store. This creates simplicity but &nbsp;rigidity in the process.</p><h3 id="5-1-releasing-full-stack-web-apps">5.1 Releasing Full Stack Web Apps</h3><p>A consideration of releasing a web app is your infrastructure or hosting platform. Before services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), companies would purchase their own servers or lease physical space from data centers.</p><p>However, today, services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" rel="noopener">AWS</a>, <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=4acbf255c7e7" rel="noopener">Digital Ocean</a>, <a href="http://heroku.com/" rel="noopener">Heroku</a>, <a href="http://firebase.google.com/" rel="noopener">Firebase</a> and others, act as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Backend as a Service (BaaS) platforms. These services offer computing resources on a cost per utilization (time, api calls, requests) basis. Such offerings have simplified developers workflow by enabling them to scale up or down the resources (CPU, time, memory) needed on a regular basis. It’s a great exercise to go through deploying on any of these platforms.</p><h3 id="5-2-releasing-mobile-apps">5.2 Releasing Mobile Apps</h3><p>Mobile applications are unique in that the distribution is handled entirely by the parent company who owns the operating system. Both distribution paths provide you the opportunity to see analytics, installs and update your applications accordingly.</p><h3 id="5-2-1-ios">5.2.1 iOS</h3><p>For iOS your distribution will need to sign up for Apple’s Developer program. You’ll need to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/" rel="noopener">sign up as an Apple Developer </a>which costs about $99/year. You will have to endure a set of quality assurance tests to ensure your app meets Apple's quality standards. </p><h3 id="5-2-2-android">5.2.2 Android</h3><p>For Android based applications you will need to get access to the Google Play Developer Console. You will need to <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/console/" rel="noopener">sign up as a Google Developer</a> which <strong>costs about $25 one time fee</strong>. </p><h3 id="5-2-3-paying-developer-costs">5.2.3 Paying Developer Costs</h3><p>Some individuals often complain and opt not to create "unnecessary" expenses for side projects when asked to host on cloud resources, or sign up to a developer program to build their project. </p><p>This is cautioned against. Just like planning makes a project feel “real”, so too does adding expenses. For two reasons: first, by adding expenses you create something at stake. Second, any of the costs (if you can afford them), are investments in the greater product you are working towards: yourself.</p><h3 id="5-3-post-release">5.3 Post Release</h3><p>After &nbsp;releasing your application, you can get some feedback or users to test it, by submitting to a variety of websites.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

            <h2><strong>The history of the Ivy Lee Method</strong></h2>
          </p>
          <p>In the beginning of the 20th century, Ivy Ledbetter Lee was not only one of the most influential pioneers in public relations in America, but he was also a successful businessman. He consulted for huge industrial corporations, such as Standard Oil, owned by the Rockefeller family.<br></p>
          <p>In 1918, Charles Schwab was one of the wealthiest people in the world. He owned the Bethlehem Steel Corporation (the largest shipbuilding company and the second largest by steel production in the USA). In order to boost the productivity of his team, he invited Ivy Lee over for a consultation.<br></p>
          <p>“Show me a way to do more,” Schwab asked Lee. <br>“Give me 15 minutes alone with each of your top managers,” Lee replied.<br></p>
          <p>Lee sat down with each of the top managers and explained his method within 15 minutes, just as he promised. Schwab asked how much he owed Lee for his services.<br></p>
          <p>“Nothing at all. But when you see the results in three months, write me a check for whatever you feel it’s worth to you,” Lee replied. <br></p>
          <p>Three months later, Schwab was so satisfied with the productivity of this simple method and with the overall progress in his business that he wrote Ivy Lee a cheque for <strong>$25,000</strong> (the equivalent of $400,000 today).<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
	An elderly Dutch woman has become the first known person to die from catching <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/world/coronavirus-outbreak-intl-hnk" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> twice, according to experts, raising serious questions about how long immunity and antibodies can last.</p>
<p>
	The woman, 89, suffered from a rare type of bone marrow cancer called Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Her immune system was compromised due to the cell-depleting therapy she received, the researchers at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands wrote in a <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ciaa1538.pdf" target="_blank">paper accepted for publication in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases</a>.</p>
<p>
	However, the researchers said her natural immune response could still have been "sufficient" to fight-off COVID-19, as the type of treatment she received for cancer "does not necessarily result in life threatening disease."</p>
<p>
	The patient was initially admitted into hospital earlier this year with a severe cough and fever, testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>
	She was discharged five days later when "besides some persisting fatigue her symptoms subsided completely," according to the report.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank"><strong>Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	But two days into chemotherapy treatment -- 59 days after the start of the first COVID-19 episode -- the woman developed fever, cough and difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>
	She once again tested positive for coronavirus, and no antibodies were detected in her blood system when tested on days four and six. Her condition deteriorated on day eight.</p>
<p>
	Two weeks later, the woman died.</p>
<p>
	The woman was not tested between infections, so researchers have no confirmed negative tests. However, upon examining the samples from both cases they found the genetic makeup of the two viruses to be different.</p>
<p>
	They therefore concluded that "it is likely that the second episode was a reinfection rather than prolonged shedding."</p>
<p>
	This is the first time someone is reported to have died from a second spell of coronavirus. However there have been some reported cases of reinfection worldwide, most recently a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30764-7/fulltext" target="_blank">25-year-old resident of Washoe County</a> in Nevada in the United States.</p>
<p>
	The man is the first in the U.S. documented to have been re-infected. According to researchers in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, a medical journal, he tested positive for COVID-19 in April and again in June, showing symptoms in both cases such as sore throat, cough, headache, nausea, and diarrhea.</p>
<p>
	The man had no underlying health conditions but similarly to the Dutch woman, suffered a more severe episode the second time.</p>
<p>
	Unlike the Dutch woman however, the man developed a measurable antibody response after the second episode. Researchers could not conclude how long the man was immune, or if he ever was.</p>
<p>
	In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, researchers said: "Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in at least four individuals worldwide. Thus, previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 does not necessarily translate to guaranteed total immunity.</p>
<p>
	"The implications of reinfections could be relevant for vaccine development and application. From a public health perspective, all individualsâ€”whether previously diagnosed or notâ€”must take identical precautions to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2. Further work is needed to assess immune reactions in vitro after reinfection."</p>
<p>
	A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/24/health/covid-19-reinfection-hong-kong-study/index.html" target="_blank">33-year-old man living in Hong Kong</a> was the first person reported to have caught the virus twice.</p>
<p>
	He became re-infected 4.5 months after contracting the virus initially, and showed no symptoms the second time round.</p>
<p>
	In the report of the Dutch woman's case, researchers said COVID-19 reinfections are expected to occur once antibodies decrease and immunity wanes.</p>

	</div>
	<h2>Decode</h2>
	

	<h2><abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr></h2>
	<h3>How does this work?</h3>
	<p>The letters of your tweet are replaced with similar looking letters (Unicode homoglyphs) that are used to hide your hidden message. Hiding messages in messages is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">Steganography</a>.</p>
	<h3>Hidden messages? But that will mean people on Twitter can be duplicitous and two-faced!</h3>
	<p>I know, groundbreaking stuff.</p>
	<h3>So this is encryption?</h3>
	<p>Not really, because anyone who knows to look for your message can find it. It's more like writing <tt>&lt;!-- hidden comments --&gt;</tt>.</p>
	<h3>I can use this for any text?</h3>
	<p>Sort of. If nothing corrupts the text it will work, and it should work on Twitter and in emails. Facebook will probably corrupt the text however.</p>
	<h3>I can't write some characters into the hidden message</h3>
	<p>Your hidden message may only contain these characters: <span id="valid_hidden_message_characters"></span> (<span></span>-bit charset). This is done so that we can store longer hidden messages.</p>
	<p>If you want more text then perhaps include a lowercase url (e.g. from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">tinyurl.com</a>)</p>
	<h3>My tweet doesn't work / it's corrupt</h3>
	<p>If you can't decode your message check that you copied it correctly from the start to the end, and that you didn't copy any extra characters.</p>
	<p>Next, if entire tweet is still corrupt then you can try manually recovering it. I know this is annoying but there are technical reasons why this is the case <a href="#" id="techyreasoning" data-reasoning=". With only 140 chars there's no space for error-correction, and even a parity-bit would just identify corruption -- it wouldn't help people recover it, so I don't consider the overhead of error correction/parity to be appropriate. I understand this debatable however so please feel free to fork the code and make your changes. Anyway, getting back to recovering that text...">(for techy reasoning - click here)</a>.</p>

	<p>To attempt to recover the tweet first try adding spaces at the beginning of the tweet. This will help realign the <span></span>-bit boundary. If the tweet is only corrupt in the middle then try adding spaces to that area of the tweet. Good luck!</p>
	<h3>Do you make anything useful?</h3>
	<p>Arguably, yes.</p>
	<p>I make <a href="https://github.com/springload/react-patterns">React Patterns</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holloway/xml-zero.js">HTML/XML utilities</a>, and <a href="http://holloway.co.nz/docvert">Docvert (Office to XML)</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
            <p>Container security is a broad problem space and there are many low hanging fruits one can harvest to mitigate risks. A good starting point is to follow some rules when writing Dockerfiles.</p>

<p>I’ve compiled a list of common security issues and how to avoid them. For every issue I’ve also written an <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">Open Policy Agent</a> (OPA) rule ready to be used to statically analyze your Dockerfiles with <a href="https://conftest.dev/">conftest</a>. You can’t shift more left than this!</p>

<p>You can find the <code>.rego</code> rule set in <a href="https://github.com/gbrindisi/dockerfile-security">this repository</a>. I appreciate feedback and contributions.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-store-secrets-in-environment-variables">Do not store secrets in environment variables</h2>

<p>Secrets distribution is a hairy problem and it’s easy to do it wrong. For containerized  applications one can surface them either from the filesystem by mounting volumes or more handily through  environment variables.</p>

<p>Using <code>ENV</code> to store secrets is bad practice because Dockerfiles are usually distributed with the application, so there is no difference from hard coding secrets in code.</p>

<p>How to detect it:</p>

<pre><code>secrets_env = [
    "passwd",
    "password",
    "pass",
 #  "pwd", can't use this one   
    "secret",
    "key",
    "access",
    "api_key",
    "apikey",
    "token",
    "tkn"
]

deny[msg] {    
    input[i].Cmd == "env"
    val := input[i].Value
    contains(lower(val[_]), secrets_env[_])
    msg = sprintf("Line %d: Potential secret in ENV key found: %s", [i, val])
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="only-use-trusted-base-images">Only use trusted base images</h2>

<p>Supply chain attacks for containerized application will also come from the hierarchy of layers used to build the container itself.</p>

<p>The main culprit is obviously the base image used. Untrusted base images are a high risk and whenever possible should be avoided.</p>

<p>Docker provides a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/">set of official base images</a> for most used operating systems and apps. By using them, we minimize risk of compromise by leveraging some sort of shared responsibility with Docker itself.</p>

<p>How to detect it:</p>

<pre><code>deny[msg] {
    input[i].Cmd == "from"
    val := split(input[i].Value[0], "/")
    count(val) &gt; 1
    msg = sprintf("Line %d: use a trusted base image", [i])
}
</code></pre>

<p>This rule is tuned towards DockerHub’s official images. It’s very dumb since I’m only detecting the absence of a namespace.</p>

<p>The definition of trust depends on your context: change this rule accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-use-latest-tag-for-base-image">Do not use ‘latest’ tag for base image</h2>

<p>Pinning the version of your base images will give you some peace of mind with regards to the predictability of the containers you are building.</p>

<p>If you rely on latest you might silently inherit updated packages that in the best worst case might impact your application reliability, in the worst worst case might introduce a vulnerability.</p>

<p>How to detect it:</p>

<pre><code>deny[msg] {
    input[i].Cmd == "from"
    val := split(input[i].Value[0], ":")
    contains(lower(val[1]), "latest"])
    msg = sprintf("Line %d: do not use 'latest' tag for base images", [i])
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="avoid-curl-bashing">Avoid curl bashing</h2>

<p>Pulling stuff from internet and piping it into a shell is as bad as it could be. Unfortunately it’s a widespread solution to streamline installations of software.</p>

<pre><code>wget https://cloudberry.engineering/absolutely-trustworthy.sh | sh
</code></pre>

<p>The risk is the same framed for supply chain attacks and it <strong>boils down to trust</strong>. If you really have to curl bash, do it right:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a trusted source</li>
<li>use a secure connection</li>
<li>verify the authenticity and integrity of what you download</li>
</ul>

<p>How to detect it:</p>

<pre><code>deny[msg] {
    input[i].Cmd == "run"
    val := concat(" ", input[i].Value)
    matches := regex.find_n("(curl|wget)[^|^&gt;]*[|&gt;]", lower(val), -1)
    count(matches) &gt; 0
    msg = sprintf("Line %d: Avoid curl bashing", [i])
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="do-not-upgrade-your-system-packages">Do not upgrade your system packages</h2>

<p>This might be a bit of a stretch but the reasoning is the following: you want to pin the version of your software dependencies, if you do <code>apt-get upgrade</code> you will effectively upgrade them all to the latest version.</p>

<p>If you do upgrade <strong>and</strong> you are using the <code>latest</code> tag for the base image, you amplify the unpredictability of your dependencies tree.</p>

<p>What you want to do is to pin the base image version and just <code>apt/apk update</code>.</p>

<p>How to detect it:</p>

<pre><code>upgrade_commands = [
    "apk upgrade",
    "apt-get upgrade",
    "dist-upgrade",
]

deny[msg] {
    input[i].Cmd == "run"
    val := concat(" ", input[i].Value)
    contains(val, upgrade_commands[_])
    msg = sprintf(“Line: %d: Do not upgrade your system packages", [i])
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="do-not-use-add-if-possible">Do not use ADD if possible</h2>

<p>One little feature of the <code>ADD</code> command is that you can point it to a remote url and it will fetch the content at building time:</p>

<pre><code>ADD https://cloudberry.engineering/absolutely-trust-me.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>Ironically the official docs suggest to use curl bashing instead.</p>

<p>From a security perspective the same advice applies: don’t.
Get whatever content you need before, verify it and then <code>COPY</code>. But if you really have to, <strong>use trusted sources over secure connections</strong>.</p>

<p>Note: if you have a fancy build system that dynamically generate Dockerfiles, then <code>ADD</code> is effectively a sink asking to be exploited.</p>

<p>How to detect it:</p>

<pre><code>deny[msg] {
    input[i].Cmd == "add"
    msg = sprintf("Line %d: Use COPY instead of ADD", [i])
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="do-not-root">Do not root</h2>

<p>Root in a container is the same root as on the host machine, but restricted by the docker daemon configuration. No matter the limitations, if an actor breaks out of the container he will still be able to find a way to get full access to the host.</p>

<p>Of course this is not ideal and your threat model can’t ignore the risk posed by running as root.</p>

<p>As such is best to always specify a user:</p>

<pre><code>USER hopefullynotroot
</code></pre>

<p>Note that explicitly setting a user in the Dockerfile is just one layer of defence and won’t solve the whole <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-root-inside-and-outside-container">running as root problem</a>.</p>

<p>Instead one can — and <em>should</em> — adopt a defence in depth approach and mitigate further across the whole stack: strictly configure the docker daemon or use a rootless container solution, restrict the runtime configuration (prohibit <code>--privileged</code> if possible, etc), and so on.</p>

<p>How to detect it:</p>

<pre><code>any_user {
    input[i].Cmd == "user"
 }

deny[msg] {
    not any_user
    msg = "Do not run as root, use USER instead"
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="do-not-sudo">Do not sudo</h2>

<p>As a corollary to <code>do not root</code>, you shall not sudo either.</p>

<p>Even if you run as a user make sure the user is not in the <code>sudoers</code> club.</p>

<pre><code>deny[msg] {
    input[i].Cmd == "run"
    val := concat(" ", input[i].Value)
    contains(lower(val), "sudo")
    msg = sprintf("Line %d: Do not use 'sudo' command", [i])
}
</code></pre>

<![CDATA[The Unspoken Hard Bits of Bootstrapping a SaaS Product to Life]]>

We’ve all read the tales of founders wrestling for years to find <a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/product-market-appetite">product market fit</a>, of co-founders squabbling over equity, of the CEO riddled by anxiety as he drains his infant daughter’s college fund to keep his start-up afloat for another month.</p><p>Cautionary tales? Sure. But while these circumstances may be relatively common, ultimately they gain notoriety in the tech media simply because they are alarmist and clickbait.&nbsp;</p><p>As I approach year four as a founder of a bootstrapped SaaS start-up, I can’t help but reflect on the hardships that I’ve encountered myself. As I have, I’ve had an overwhelming feeling—the majority of challenges that I’ve faced are by no means unique to me, but <em>nobody is talking about them</em>. This article is about surfacing those common entrepreneurial challenges that are gasping for some air.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1602180654131_6032"><div><p>I’d go so far as to say most entrepreneurial challenges that we hear being bemoaned are a direct result of your chosen path being incompatible with your business idea or life circumstances. When these items are in harmony, entrepreneurship becomes vastly easier.</p><p>If you’re building SpaceX, your idea dictates that you go the VC route—it’s too big, too ambitious, and too capital intensive to bootstrap such a company into existence. This is an extreme example, but this is the lens through which we should be assessing our start-up ideas as we decide how to fund them.</p><p>Generally speaking, “smaller” products are better suited to bootstrapping. Building a slack notification tool? Great! You can probably launch something like this in less than a month, give the project the opportunity to gain some traction, then make the decision to proceed or not from there. You’d be crazy <em>not</em> to bootstrap such a company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But if you’re building a bigger and more ambitious piece of software you need to look closely at the reality that it could take years to bring something of value to fruition. Can you afford a year without a paycheck? How about three years, or five?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth noting that this isn’t solely a financial decision or one of product scope, but also one that will impact your day-to-day life potentially for years to come. Did you recently sign a mortgage? Do you plan on having kids? The stresses that come with entrepreneurship and how you choose to fund your business will have trickle down effects on all aspects of your life.</p><p>The question is not do you prefer bootstrapping or venture capital. The question is which path is most compatible with the product you’re building… and your life.&nbsp;</p><p>Bringing this full circle to Outseta, in many ways Outseta is not an idea compatible with the idea of bootstrapping. Outseta is a very large and ambitious project that we’re executing on with a small team—it’s really three or four different software products rather than one. We knew this going in and openly talked about how it would take years for us to truly be able to deliver on our value proposition and start to grow revenue in a meaningful way. It took us two years to deliver a sellable product, and four years in now we’re just starting to scale.&nbsp;</p><p>But we had one major advantage—the idea that we chose to build was not one that needed “validating”—the categories of software that we offer (CRM, billing, email marketing, etc) have staying power and have been validated long ago. This gave us confidence that we could play the long game and allowed us to design all aspects of our business and lives so that we could survive long enough to see Outseta blossom into what it’s become today.&nbsp;</p><p>We didn’t choose an easy route, but we’re now finding that Outseta is massively defensible because very few teams would commit 4+ years just to bring an idea to life. You could do it much more quickly with venture capital, sure, but you’d never be able to serve the audience that we do at our price point.&nbsp;</p><h2>The “Doldrums” of SaaS</h2><p>One of the most common and least talked about hardships of bootstrapping a SaaS start-up is what I’ve started describing as “the doldrums of SaaS.” This occurs when your start-up hits an inflection point in sign-ups and support requests scale up dramatically to the extent that they all but take over your ability to focus on other aspects of your business, from marketing to building new features.</p><p>Ironically enough, this stage in a bootstrapped start-up’s growth initially became apparent to me because of one of our competitors. We started getting dozens of sign-ups from founders all singing the same tune.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I was using CompetitorX—I loved their product initially, but they’re unresponsive and haven’t released any new features in months.”</em></p><p>Then earlier this spring, we went through a similar stage. On the back of a new partnership with <a href="https://www.outseta.com/webflow">Webflow</a>, all of a sudden the number of sign-ups for Outseta scaled up dramatically—and in tandem with that growth came an influx of support tickets from new users learning the platform.</p><p>My summer was spent focused almost entirely on technical support, while my time spent marketing Outseta fell off a cliff. Likewise, my Co-founders were pushing fixes and helping out with new Outseta implementations cutting into their ability to roll out new features.</p><p>Ultimately this is a stage in a bootstrapped start-up’s growth that doesn’t get much lip service because there’s little benefit to speaking about increased support levels and decreased capacity for building new features. But that’s unfortunate because this is a “good problem” that nearly every scaling company will encounter—yet there’s very little advice out there on how to best handle this stage of the entrepreneurial journey.</p><p>If you’re a VC backed company, it’s an easy problem to fix—throw some money at hiring additional support capacity, because you have the ability to run your company at a loss. But for a bootstrapper this stage can feel like your legs are stuck in quicksand.</p><p>I don’t have a solution here, aside from taking some degree of solace in the thought that time spent helping customers is the most single important thing that you can do to build your business. And rather than hiring support capacity, using your engineering resources to solve underlying issues that result in increased support requests will always pay off in the long run.</p><h2>The psychological toll of not feeling like you’re “all-in”</h2><p>It’s well documented that many entrepreneurs feel extreme levels of stress, anxiety, worry, and even depression—which most often is tied to financial instability and the regular peaks and valleys of building a company. But for me personally—and I suspect many others—one of the strongest psychological tolls I’ve felt is stress that comes from feeling like I’m not yet able to be “all-in” on my start-up.</p><p>Make no mistake about it—since the day we started Outseta, I’ve undoubtedly been “all-in.” I’ve rearranged almost all aspects of my life over four years in support of bringing this company into existence. But as part of our strategy to <a href="https://www.outseta.com/posts/marketing-strategies-for-bootstrappers">bootstrap the business</a>, our entire team began working on Outseta in a part-time capacity while consulting or working on other projects to pay the bills. We’ve gradually ramped up the time we’ve each invested in the business as our growth has permitted, as most bootstrappers do.</p><p>For me personally, this meant that for years, literally, there was always this nagging feeling that I could be doing more. I could be doing more or doing better for Outseta, and I could be doing more in terms of the other projects I was working on as well. For me, that feeling has been tough. It feels really good to be able to say that you unequivocally, without question, are giving something your all. But most bootstrappers have to wait quite a long period of time until their business can truly support every last scrap of their attention at work. That’s a long period of time to wait to shed that nagging feeling!</p><h2>SaaS <em>is</em> a torture chamber</h2><p>The wonders of SaaS as a business model are well known—the stability and predictability of recurring revenue, products that can scale to thousands of users, high valuations—the whole nine yards. But the fact of the matter is that for bootstrapped founders, SaaS <em>is</em> a torture chamber and a game of delayed gratification.</p><p>Don’t misunderstand me and immediately suppose that there’s some sort of self-inflicted pain behind this comment—I’m the biggest proponent of work/life balance and generally the principles outlined in Jason Fried and DHH’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Be-Crazy-Work/dp/0062874780"><em>It Doesn’t Have To Be Crazy At Work</em></a> that you’ll ever find. This is solely a matter of the business model.</p><p>When you’re bootstrapping, you’re going to start off without a paycheck. Most of us work towards a point where the revenue of the business can eventually start to pay us something, then we scale up our own compensation until it reaches some semblance of a normal salary. The problem with SaaS and bootstrapping is you are hugely incentivized not to pay yourself—every dollar that you pay yourself is money that isn’t being reinvested in the growth of your business, so you’re intentionally slowing down your own growth.</p><p>Of course there are human, real world circumstances to consider and your own financial and emotional needs directly correlate to your ability to work on your business successfully. But the hard reality is the longer you can delay your own gratification, the greater your advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>I asked my Co-founder, Dimitris, to speak to his experience of the long, slow ramp of death that’s so prevalent in SaaS. Dimitris Co-founded <a href="https://www.buildium.com/">Buildium</a> back in 2004.</p><p>“It took us 2.5 years to get to 50 customers,” says Dimitris. “Then it took us another year to get to 400 customers, and a year after that we reached 1,000 customers. When we had 400 customers we made a conscious decision to defer paying ourselves more than a token $1,000 per month salary and instead hired our first two full-time …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-d45110a832bd034f2882"><div><h2>National security in the age of artificial intelligence</h2><p>“Our primary interest is in a stronger West.” </p><p>-Alex Karp, Palantir Technologies CEO</p><p>Palantir has all the attributes of the evil corporation from a blockbuster movie. An eccentric founder, a supposedly cult-like following, secret dealings with companies and governments, and diabolical sounding plans of world domination. Ok, maybe not the world domination part, but they aren't afraid of being vocal on geopolitical issues.</p><p>Palantir's IPO has brought them back into the news cycle and along with them, the debate on privacy. The discussion about what a tech company should or should not do with their data is nothing new. What makes Palantir interesting is their rejection and criticism of fellow Silicon Valley tech giants and their stance on geopolitics.</p><p>Palantir's S-1 filing to the SEC to become a publicly-traded company begins with a letter from CEO Alex Karp. Rather than simply describing Palantir Karp outlines sweeping ideas on privacy, national security, government, and, in his view, the moral failings of big tech.</p><h2>National security crystal ball</h2><p>In 2004, the fledgling Palantir was another Stanford graduate tech startup co-founded by Peter Thiel. But Palantir had a very different proposition, how can data be used to stop terrorism while preserving civil liberties? The uniquely right-winged Silicon Valley VC Thiel enlisted the help of his Alex Karp who Thiel also knew from Stanford. The two formed an odd friendship and would often have lively debates while at Stanford with conservative Thiel taking one side and progressive  Karp on the other. Thiel approached Karp about running Palantir, and he agreed. After prolonged difficultly securing funding, Palantir, named after the seeing stones of Tolkien mythology, found success in the CIA's venture capital arm In-Q-Tel.</p><p>Palantir's approach is to enable the integration of existing customer data making all of it accessible under one system. Then they layer on data analytics and machine learning making it easy for intelligence analysts to look for connections and patterns across time and space. They do this all while ensuring that users only see the information they are allowed to see and logging everything they do, leaving a permanent record in case of an audit or miss-use of data. Of course, Palantir's safeguards and logs to prevent unauthorized access to information are only relevant if the customer implements them.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601825577659_7635"><div><p>After success stopping terrorists and finding IEDs, Palantir ventured into the commercial space, doing fraud investigations, failure mode analysis, and manufacturing. Today they do business in a few dozen different industries. Once integrated with a customer, they boast of increasing the ability of workers to interpret data, draw connections, and make conclusions that would be difficult or impossible with legacy systems. Karp likens their systems as giving all workers the data analysis powers of someone with a Ph.D. in mathematics or computer science.</p><h2>Free 30-day trial to fight terrorism</h2><p>Palantir employs a tiered customer acquisition model that seems unusual at first. Palantir breaks down its customers into three stages, Acquire, Expand, and Scale. Acquire stage customers are "short-term pilot deployments of software," and typically lose money for Palantir. There's no guarantee of moving an Acquire customer forward to the Expand stage.  Palantir's theory is that if a customer can see the long-term benefits of their software with no initial risk, they'll be willing to commit to Palantir and increasingly expensive contracts. Sound familiar? It's the same strategy your favorite monthly subscription uses to get you on board before increasing the price and adding new features.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601825577659_12806"><p>As customers move to the Expand and Scale phases, Palantir's revenue and margins expand as well. Customers in the Scale phase need less involvement from Palantir, reducing costs. This transition can take years. If Palantir's estimate that most customers eventually move on to the Scale phase is correct, the sheer number of firms doing business with them at one stage or another foreshadows a boon in revenue within a few years.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601825577659_16045"><div><h2>"We have chosen sides."</h2><p>Now back to that letter. Karp writes (emphasis mine),</p><blockquote><p><em>Our company was founded in Silicon Valley. But we seem to share fewer and fewer of the technology sector’s values and commitments.</em></p><p><em>From the start, we have repeatedly turned down opportunities to sell, collect, or mine data. Other technology companies, including some of the largest in the world, have built their entire businesses on doing just that.</em></p><p><strong><em>Software projects with our nation’s defense and intelligence agencies, whose missions are to keep us safe, have become controversial, while companies built on advertising dollars are commonplace. For many consumer internet companies, our thoughts and inclinations, behaviors and browsing habits, are the product for sale. The slogans and marketing of many of the Valley’s largest technology firms attempt to obscure this simple fact.</em></strong></p><p><em>The world’s largest consumer internet companies have never had greater access to the most intimate aspects of our lives. </em><strong><em>And the advance of their technologies has outpaced the development of the forms of political control that are capable of governing their use.</em></strong></p><p><em>The bargain between the public and the technology sector has for the most part been consensual, in that the value of the products and services available seemed to outweigh the invasions of privacy that enabled their rise.</em></p><p><em>Americans will remain tolerant of the idiosyncrasies and excesses of the Valley only to the extent that technology companies are building something substantial that serves the public interest. The corporate form itself — that is, the privilege to engage in private enterprise — is a product of the state and would not exist without it.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ironically, one of the companies most frequently cited as a modern-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">Panopticon</a> is sharply critical of the data practices of fellow Silicon Valley tech giants. We've come to understand that if a tech company is offering its service for free, it's the user data, not the service that's the product. Palantir in contrast doesn't so much collect data as it enables its customers to use the data they have more effectively. Of course, making it easier to process data can also encourage organizations to collect more of it, and ultimately, Palantir won't control what its customers do with the tools they build. So how much responsibility for this surveillance capability falls on Palantir and how much on the governments it works for?</p><p>Karp's argument is that it's the responsibility of the court, legislators, and voters to decide how software should be used and that Palantir will operate according to the laws and regulations that result from that debate. This is in opposition to the current operations of companies like Google where Google decides when and how to cooperate with governments, turning down the Pentagon's Project Maven contract while opening an artificial intelligence lab inside China on the premise of building technology which benefits the entire world. Peter Thiel was sharply critical of this practice in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/opinion/peter-thiel-google.html">New York Times Op-ed</a> in 2019, ending his opinion by saying, "by now we should understand that the real point of talking about what’s good for the world is to evade responsibility for the good of the country."</p><p>Traditionally, public companies like Google and now Palantir are answerable only to shareholders and the laws of the countries in which they operate. They take actions that prioritize the business and create value for shareholders. However, this isn't the case for conventional defense companies like those building tanks, missiles, and other weapons. They have much more stringent controls on exports and foreign business deals. Karp and Thiel maintain the development of A.I. systems should be viewed in this respect,  tools for analysis, surveillance, and weapons, rather purely civilian technologies. It's hard not to see the logic in this argument when AIs are starting to outperform humans in simulated conflicts like <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a33765952/ai-vs-human-fighter-pilot-simulated-dogfight-results/">dogfighting F-16s.</a> A country with advanced A.I. capability can put that technology to use however they choose, particularly in countries with a high level of government entanglement in industry such as China.</p><p>Whatever your position on surveillance, A.I., and government regulation, what does seem clear is the lack of a conclusive public discourse on the topic. Big tech data practices make headlines every once in a while such as with the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook scandal, or Project Maven then they are forgotten without any meaningful decisions. This lack of regulation is something the tech industry is all too happy about. When tech CEOs are hauled before Congress to testify on their business practices, it's clear that lawmakers lack a fundamental understanding of the technology, business practices, and issues for which they have the responsibility to regulate.</p><p>I'm not sure about Palantir, but I agree with Karp that voters, courts, and lawmakers need to take a serious look at these issues and their implications. If the people don't decide, companies will.</p></div></div></div>]]>

October 14, 2020 | https://sklivvz.com/posts/consider-using-simple-models-instead | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sklivvz.com/posts/consider-using-simple-models-instead">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://imgur.com/vtdpk9t.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I want to share with you the pattern which I use very often to build classes in my web applications. It is different and relatively more straightforward in comparison to most enterprise patterns. I don't claim it's suitable for anyone but me -- I write web applications. It works exceptionally well for the cases I encounter, unlike the repository pattern, which is excellent if you have vast amounts of business logic, or command/query separation, which is very suitable for desktop-like experiences.</p>
<p>There are two guiding principles beyond it, which I find applicable generally:
simplicity, or the art of maximizing the work <em>not</em> done;
cohesion, keeping related code together to decrease the cognitive cost of coding.</p>
<p>First of all, remember that I build web applications. For me, a backend server either serves APIs or web pages and in most cases, the main business logic is a straight SQL query or a cache lookup.</p>
<p>I usually adopt an MVC pattern with ViewModels -- not the MVVM two-way binding monstrosity, ViewModels only serve as transport to get the data to the views. This is the main control flow for a typical request.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/560MwDF.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For most pages, business logic falls into two categories, either validation or simple database operations. The former is best implemented through a filter, middleware, or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">aspect-oriented</a> language feature. This makes it testable. The latter runs on the database and can only be tested through an integration test. </p>
<p>As a side note, you might think that an ORM makes it possible to test these operations locally, and you would be wrong, I'm sorry to report. You would be validating the ORM and not the actual query that -- generated or not -- is what runs. In other words, you would be exercising a mock and no business logic. The sad fact is that databases (or caches) run a large part of the actual business logic for most web pages!</p>
<p>In other words, what you actually want to test is, in large part, locked away in a SQL query. This is why the repository pattern, or similar ways of decoupling "business logic" from "database calls" is not very useful in simple cases: the database calls <em>are</em> the business logic.</p>
<p>In these simple -- yet very pervasive -- cases, I use the following pattern. Start with a simple DTO:</p>
<pre><code>public class Widget
{
    public int? Id { get; private set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string PartNumber { get; set; }
    // ... other properties here
}
</code></pre>
<p>I kept the class mutable. This is because I plan to make this record updateable, and frankly, immutability gets in the way of keeping that as simple as possible. Only <code>Id</code> is kept immutable for reasons we'll see below.</p>
<p>Let's implement a simple CRUD, starting with getting a list of widgets.</p>
<pre><code>public class Widget
{
    // ... properties here
    public static List&lt;Widget&gt; All()
    {
        using (var conn = Common.GetConn())
        {
            return conn.Query&lt;Widget&gt;("Select * From Widgets");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it's a straight <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper">Dapper</a> query in a static method, right next to the properties that Dapper maps to. This is quite arguably the <em>simplest possible way</em> to get this data out of the database and into a class list. As such, it's my go-to coding solution, until an actual real, non-theoretical necessity emerges to do differently.</p>
<p>Single reads are implemented similarly.</p>
<pre><code>public class Widget
{
    // ... properties and other methods here
    public static Widget GetById(int id)
    {
        using (var conn = Common.GetConn())
        {
            return conn.QuerySingleOrDefault&lt;Widget&gt;("Select * From Widgets Where Id = @Id", id);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>What about commands, i.e., Creates, Updates, and Deletes? Deletes are also static and take an <code>id</code> parameter -- generally, no one wants to pull a whole object out of the database just to delete it and if you do happen to have an instance already handy, passing the id is easy enough.</p>
<p>Creates and updates I usually merge into a single Save method. If a class has the <code>Id</code> property set, then we assume an update; if it is unset, then it is a new object to be inserted. Of course, the developer end-user cannot set the <code>Id</code> because of its private accessor, but Dapper can. Only classes that come from the actual database have an <code>Id</code> that will be used in the update.</p>
<p>This needs not to be a static method (although a static variant is always possible).</p>
<pre><code>public class Widget
{
    // ... properties and other methods here
    public void Save()
    {
        var sql = "";
        if (Id.HasValue())
            sql = "Update Widgets Set Name = @Name, PartNumber = @PartNumber /* other sets here */ Where Id = @Id; Select @Id";
        else
            sql = "Insert Into Widgets (Name, PartNumber /* etc */) Values (@Name, @PartNumber /* etc */); Select ScopeIdentity()";

        using (var conn = Common.GetConn())
        {
            this.Id = conn.QuerySingle&lt;int&gt;(sql, this);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is the pattern. Further commands are likely to be implemented as property manipulation, followed by a <code>Save</code> call. Other queries depend on the size of the table in question, and they can be either custom SQL queries or perhaps LinqToObjects if the results of <code>All()</code> are cached in memory.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I've shown a simple way to implement Models as simple, self-contained entities that are perfectly adequate in large part of the use cases of web applications. I do not claim this way is the "one true way," but it works for me, and as any abstraction, please do not consider it a panacea.</p>
<p>Hopefully, whether you agree or less with me, you will spend some time reflecting on whether you really need that fat ORM-based, dependency-injected, data-mapped solution next time you write a simple model class.</p>

<h3>清流みはらし駅<span>（平成31年3月19日開業）</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://nishikigawa.com/img_3624/"><img src="http://nishikigawa.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3624-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="http://nishikigawa.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3624-scaled.jpg 2560w, http://nishikigawa.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3624-768x576.jpg 768w, http://nishikigawa.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3624-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http://nishikigawa.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3624-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a></p>
<h4>「秘境駅」ならではの旅をお楽しみいただけます</h4>
<p>清流みはらし駅は、南桑駅と根笠駅の間にあり、国道など道路から自動車、自転車、徒歩でたどりつける道が存在せず、イベント列車にご乗車されたお客様しか訪れることのできない、全国的にも珍しい「秘境駅」となります。<br>
平成５年３月開業の「守内かさ神駅」以来、<strong>約26年ぶり</strong>に開業した錦川清流線の新駅です。<br>
臨時列車のみが停車する駅として、平成31年４月以降より「清流みはらし列車」などのイベント列車を設定しています。</p>
<p>また、眺望の開けた「<strong>絶景ポイント</strong>」にあり、眼下にある錦川の透明感、山側の滝をはじめ、新緑、ホタル、紅葉、渡り鳥、雪景色などの自然を、四季折々一年通して楽しむことができます。<br>
普段の定期列車ではゆっくりお楽しみいただくことのできないさまざまな風景を、駅に降りたつことで、展望スペースから十分にご満喫いただくことができます。<br>
是非、日ごろの喧騒から離れて「<strong>秘境駅</strong>」ならではの旅をお楽しみください。</p>

<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>

<p>This package provides encoder/decoder implementation for DEC SIXEL graphics, and
some converter programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saitoha/libsixel/data/data/libsixel-1.png" alt="img2sixel"></p>

<p>SIXEL is one of image formats for printer and terminal imaging introduced by
Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC).
Its data scheme is represented as a terminal-friendly escape sequence.
So if you want to view a SIXEL image file, all you have to do is “cat” it to your terminal.</p>

<h2 id="sixel-animation">SIXEL Animation</h2>

<p><code>img2sixel(1)</code> can decode GIF animation.</p>

<h3 id="improved-compression">Improved compression</h3>

<p>Former sixel encoders(such as <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppmtosixel.html">ppmtosixel</a>) are mainly designed for dot-matrix printers.
They minimize the amount of printer-head movement distance.
But nowadays this method did not represent the best performance for displaying sixel data on terminal emulators.
SIXEL data for terminals were found in 80’s Usenet, but the technology of how to create them seems to be lost.
<a href="http://nanno.dip.jp/softlib/man/rlogin/sixel.tar.gz">kmiya’s sixel</a> introduces the encoding method which is re-designed
for terminal emulators to optimize the overhead of transporting SIXEL with keeping compatibility with former SIXEL terminal.
Now libsixel and ImageMagick’s sixel coder follow it.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/arakiken">@arakiken</a>, known as the maintainer of mlterm, describes about the way to generate high quality SIXEL, which is adopted by libsixel
(<a href="http://mlterm.sourceforge.net/libsixel.pdf">http://mlterm.sourceforge.net/libsixel.pdf</a>, in Japanese).</p>

<h3 id="high-quality-quantization">High quality quantization</h3>

<p><code>img2sixel(1)</code> supports color image quantization. It works well even if few number of colors are allowed.</p>

            <p>
    Posted on October 14, 2020
    
        by wjwh
    
</p>

<p>Of late I’ve been enjoying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FhTu3aGM60&amp;list=PLB00JHoTw1TeX82Qw8hoFLRJI89Us_jMw">this video series</a> about the reconstruction of the Tally Ho, a 100+ year old wooden sailing yacht that was in very poor condition and needed an almost complete rebuild. Throughout the series it comes up again and again how wooden boat design emphasizes maintainability: every part of a boat can (and is expected to) be easily replaced during periodic maintenance. Planking, masts and even keels may seem quite central to the construction, but in reality they are sacrificial. All these elements are to be replaced as necessary so that the whole may survive. Doing this properly requires not just time and resources but also people with the required experience and a lot of attention is given to maintaining the ‘human infrastructure’ that makes maintenance possible. In this, there is a lot to be learned for the software world.</p>
<p>It seems like every few weeks there is another horror story about some giant legacy software system lurking untouched for decades in the bowels of a giant corporation, finally about to collapse under its own weight while everyone who could rescue it has long since passed away from old age. Whether it’s a <a href="https://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/feature/Outdated-technology-A-channel-partner-challenge">big bank</a>, the <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/06/why-the-va-couldnt-keep-up-with-it">Veterans Association</a> over in the US or a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-42803118">national healthcare organisation</a>, big old software systems keep working until they suddenly don’t and require massive effort to bring back up.</p>
<p>A common thread in all these IT failures is that a complex system was set up decades ago and because it “works”, it has been left mostly alone since initial construction. This lack of maintenance then inevitably leads to failure down the road.</p>
<h2 id="well-maintained-and-maintainable">Well-maintained and maintainable</h2>
<p>In the context of software, the concept of software being well maintained and maintainable are often confused. I propose the following definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>well maintained</em> program is a program that has been kept up to date with its operating environment. This means for example that it is up to date with security patches, does not rely on deprecated libraries or external APIs, etc.</li>
<li>The <em>maintainability</em> of a program is the ease with which a program can be kept in such a state. This is a very wide definition and it depends a lot on the surrounding organisation. A program may be very maintainable for a certain team but much less so for another team, depending on the relative experience and knowledge of the team members. There are also practices, like writing documentation and maintaining proper separation of concerns, that can aid in keeping a program maintainable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically a maintainable program will also be kept well maintained, though it is not a guarantuee. Since maintainability depends a lot on the team, it is usually a very good idea to keep working on a program so that knowledge of its working remains fresh.</p>
<h2 id="to-maintain-or-not-to-maintain">To maintain or not to maintain</h2>
<p>There is an obvious moment where building for maintainability will not pay off: for programs with a sufficiently low remaining lifespan, additional maintenance is going to cost more than the benefits you get from an up-to-date program. Of course, it is extremely hard to accurately determine the remaining lifespan of a program as evideced by all the “temporary” solutions running in production today. There is a huge and enduring underestimation of how long any given program will remain needed.</p>
<p>A second reason not to maintain a software system is because it is perceived to be “working”, leading to the often heard phrase of “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it”. This is a recipe for disaster, since with the passage of time all the original developers will eventually move on and the project will be left almost unmaintainable. Ironically, the less problems any given program displays the higher the chance of it failing catastrophically in the future and the less anyone will be able to do anything about it. To prevent this knowledge gap, documentation is only a partial answer. All serious programs I have seen require extensive domain knowledge from the programmer to understand them. The only way to gain this domain knowledge is experience, hopefully accompanied by advice and pointers from someone who is already an expert.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In the context of any long-lived asset, “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” really means “don’t start fixing it until it breaks”. For software this is more insidious, since cultural norms about maintenance of physical assets have been fairly well established. <em>Of course</em> you have to maintain your bridge/house/factory machines, otherwise they break. Even when these are left to deteriorate, the declining state is often clearly visible. On the other hand, software keeps “working” for quite a while until it suddenly doesn’t. In reality its state has actually been deteriorating for a while, but that is often not visible from the “outside”. When it finally breaks for real, not only is there a lot of deferred maintenance to catch up on, but the original team will have long since moved on. The only way around this seems to constantly keep up low-level work on the project, so that knowledge of the internals never gets lost. Making this work in short-term driven companies and/or underfunded open source project is left as an exercise for the reader. :)</p>

<p>A large property map hangs in the mayor's office, right next to a display cabinet full of memorabilia accumulated over a long term in office. The coat of arms of the town of Grünheide on the map has faded, as has the writing: "Net settlement area of 300 hectares," it reads, if you look hard enough.</p>


<div>
<p>Arne Christiani's predecessor hung up the poster 20 years ago, back when BMW wanted to build a car manufacturing plant on the site, but then chose the city of Leipzig instead. "When I was first elected mayor in 2003, I left the map up," says Christiani. The pine forest on the edge of the town has remained his field of dreams for almost 17 years.</p><p>During that time, Grünheide has grown steadily, but its population has also aged. It's a place that's beautiful for people who appreciate peace and quiet, but not one that’s particularly tempting for the younger generation. Each year, Christiani has apologized to locals on International Volunteer Day for the fact that it had once again not been possible to attract high-quality industrial jobs to the area.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>For some time now, though, two new maps have been hanging above the old one, with the parcel of land colored red. Christiani's dream could finally be coming true, with Tesla hoping to build electric cars on the site.</p><h3><strong>Dreams Threatened, Dreams Come True</strong></h3><p>If you leave Town Hall and walk a good 800 meters through a pine forest to the edge of the village, you reach a lake called Peetzsee. Christiani had been in office for two years when Johannes Curth and his family came to fulfil their dream here, swapping a rental apartment in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood for a home of their own, surrounded by forests and lakes.</p>
</div>

<p>The Curths bought a plot of land just a few meters from the shore of the lake back when prices were still reasonable. They built a house with large windows and surrounded by a good-sized yard, in which stand two magnificent old trees in it.</p>

<p>But now that Mayor Christiani's dream is coming true, Curth sees his own dream threatened. "We moved here because of the peace and quiet and the nature," he says. "What will happen if Tesla starts building cars here?" He fears for the quality of the water and air. And he worries about the extra traffic and what will happen to this sleepy community of 8,755 people when Tesla moves in.</p>

<div>
<p>Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind the carmaker, is an uncompromising man whose ideas jump back and forth between California, Mars and Grünheide. The head of the world's largest electric car manufacturer builds rockets that ferry people into space and dreams of building a hyperloop tunnel for passenger transport. He is adored by his followers because, as an entrepreneur, he refuses to accept any limits.</p><h3><strong>Breathtaking Speed</strong></h3><p>Almost as a byproduct, Musk is now also changing not only the provincial state of Brandenburg, where he’s setting up his factory, but also Germany. The project just outside of Berlin is becoming symbolic for industrial policy in times of climate change. Whereas German companies tend to moan and dig in their heels when the government sets overly ambitious climate targets, as they did last week when the new European Union climate goals were announced, Tesla brings both together: sustainable manufacturing and speed. Breathtaking speed.</p>

<p>Musk's Gigafactory will be built in a region where most structures tend to be single-family homes, if there are any at all. In the first stage of development, 12,000 people will work around the clock in three shifts. Once the factory is complete, more than 40,000 people could produce a good 2 million Tesla vehicles here. "Please work at Tesla Giga Berlin! It's going to be a ton of fun," Musk recently tweeted in German.</p><p>For quite some time, German car executives and politicians tended to make fun of Musk, notorious as he was for his outrageous personality on Twitter. When he outlined his visions at a 2014 lunch with Peter Altmaier - who was chief of staff of Angela Merkel's Chancellery at the time but is now economics minister – and raved about the advantages of electric propulsion, saying it could be used in all means of transportation except for rockets flying into space, Altmaier still thought he sounded a bit unhinged. "At the time," says Altmaier, "nobody thought this technology would be so successful." At least the German competition didn't.</p><p>As recently as 2018, when the California-based company was having troubles with the serial production of its Model 3, Volkswagen considered becoming a strategic investor in Tesla to teach Musk how to do mass production. But reality has long since overtaken that idea: Tesla is now worth five times as much as Volkswagen on the stock exchange.</p><p>The days when the billionaire had to ask politicians for an appointment are over. When he came to Germany in early September to visit his construction site, the reception he received was that of a pop star. Fans shared the latest movement data of his private jet and puzzled where he might pop up next. Leading politicians cleared their calendars at short notice.</p><p>This week, the Musk party is set to continue, and his name will once again appear in newspapers around the world. He has slated this Tuesday as "Battery Day,” when he plans to announce the progress Tesla has made in battery technology in addition to identifying the site of at least one new battery plant. There are many indications, including interviews with Musk, that Grünheide may be chosen as the site. If it is, giant tree-felling machines would again show up to wait for authorization to clear another 60 hectares (nearly 150 acres) of forest.</p><p>It would send an unmistakable message. Because one day later, on Wednesday, hearings are set to begin in the nearby town of Erkner on the 406 complaints against the factory that have been filed by environmental associations and residents. Construction, though, has already been underway for months, with Tesla deciding to move ahead at its own risk with preliminary permits.</p><h3><strong>Faster and Better</strong></h3><p>A recent visit to the construction site in Grünheide provided a glimpse of the degree to which Tesla's mantra has been internalized at Tesla, a mantra by which speed counts most. Evan Horetsky, who heads the roughly 100-member Tesla team in Grünheide, showed a number of interested journalists around the construction site.</p><p>The slim man in his mid-30s with a shaved head and carefully trimmed beard is one of the troubleshooters on Musk's team. He helped out with the Tesla factory in California before going to Reno, Nevada, to lead the creation of the company's first Gigafactory. That had hardly been finished by the time construction in Shanghai began. He says that he and his people have gotten "faster and better" each time. Now, Horetsky is moving things along in Brandenburg.</p><p>Just last fall, the site was covered with tall pine trees. Now, though, they have been replaced by dozens of white concrete pillars protruding from the levelled ground. In the rear section, the shell of the paint shop has been erected. "We gained experience during the construction of the first buildings that we could directly apply in the further development of the design," the American says. "It enabled us to save a couple of days."</p>

<p>The fact that final permission to build the factory has not yet been granted and that skeptical citizens must first be heard doesn't bother Horetsky. He says he takes their fears seriously. He notes that similarly complicated requirements had to be fulfilled when building the factory in Shanghai. "The difference to Germany is that here, the people who are directly affected can have their say," says Horetsky. "And who has more of a right to air their views than they do?"</p><p>It is, essentially, the concrete realization of what had been an abstract discussion. What price is society prepared to pay for the future? And are Germans capable of keeping up with the necessary pace?</p><p>The Gigafactory is set to be built in record time, with the first Y model electric SUVs slated for shipping as early as summer 2021. Plans call for 500,000 electric cars to be produced annually by the end of the first construction stage, a pace the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has described as "breakneck."</p><p>And all this is taking place in Germany, a country where the length of approval procedures has almost doubled in the last 10 years. And in the state of Brandenburg, where construction of the Berlin-Brandenburg Airport (BER) has been marred by endless construction problems and is finally set to open its doors, fully nine years behind schedule.</p><h3><strong>Not Even Corona Has Slowed the Project</strong></h3><p>It sounded almost like a joke initially: An American high-tech car company with a volatile boss meets German environmental law, citizen participation and German bureaucracy. Now, though, it looks as though electric cars could start rolling off the assembly line in Grünheide even faster than they did in centrally steered China. And not even the coronavirus has thus far managed to slow down the project.</p><p>Somehow, the clichés didn't hold true. Tesla may be a tenacious, demanding company, but it also takes criticism seriously and tries to address it. In contrast to German companies, Musk uses every possibility that planning law avails him to accelerate construction, but he does so at his own risk. At the same time, the Brandenburg government has shown itself to be a skilful negotiator in the fight for the project. Since the contract was awarded, a task force of employees from the participating authorities has met weekly with Tesla representatives to discuss progress on the project.</p><p>Axel Vogel was one of the founding members of the Green Party in 1980.

What started as a collection of off-the-shelf components, has now gained a new identity thanks to Sega’s engineering.</p><hr><h2 id="models-and-variants">Models and variants</h2><p>I was a bit confused at first while reading about the different models that Sega ended up shipping, so here is a summary of the main models discussed to avoid further confusions:</p><ul><li><strong>Sega Mark III</strong>: The first console featuring this architecture, only released in Japan.</li><li><strong>Sega Master System</strong> (Europe and America): A rebranded Mark III with a new case, a BIOS ROM chip and a different cartridge slot.</li><li><strong>Sega Master System</strong> (Japan): An European/American Master system with the Mark III’s cartridge slot, a new FM chip and a jack port for ‘3D glasses’. However, it lacks the <code>RESET</code> button.</li></ul><p>From now one I’ll use the term ‘Master System’ or ‘SMS’ to refer to all of these, except when talking about exclusive features from a particular model.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Sega decided on a fully-fledged <strong>Zilog Z80</strong> CPU running at <strong>~3.58 MHz</strong>. A popular choice by other machines like the ZX Spectrum and the Amstrad CPC. The Z80 has an instruction set compatible with the Intel 8080 but expanded with lots of more instructions.</p><p>The motherboard picture at the start of the article shows a NEC D780C-1 CPU, that’s just SEGA second-sourcing the chip to different manufacturers, other revisions even included the chip manufactured by Zilog. But for this article, it doesn’t matter who fabricated the CPU, as the internal features remain the same.</p><h4 id="memory-available">Memory available</h4><p>The Z80 has a 16-bit address bus, so the CPU can find up to 64 KB worth of memory. In the memory map you’ll find <strong>8 KB of RAM</strong> for general purpose use, this is mirrored in another 8 KB block. Finally, <strong>up to 48 KB of game ROM</strong> are mapped as well.</p><h4 id="accessing-the-rest-of-the-components">Accessing the rest of the components</h4><p>As you can read from the previous paragraph, only main RAM and some cartridge ROM is found on the address space, so how can the program access other components? Well, unlike Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nes/">Famicom/NES</a>, not all the hardware of the Master System is mapped using memory locations. Instead, some peripherals are found on the <strong>I/O space</strong>.</p><p>This is because the Z80 family contains an interesting feature called <strong>I/O ports</strong> which enables the CPU to communicate with other hardware without running out of memory addresses. For this, there’s a separate address space for ‘I/O devices’ called <strong>ports</strong> and both share the same data and address bus. The difference, however, is that ports are read and written using <code>IN</code> and <code>OUT</code> instructions, respectively - as opposed to the traditional load/store instruction (<code>LD</code>).</p><p>When an <code>IN</code> or <code>OUT</code> instruction is executed, the Z80 sets up the address lines pointing to the peripheral (which could be, for instance, a keyboard), flags its <code>IORQ</code> pin indicating that an I/O request has been initiated and also flags the <code>RD</code> pin or the <code>WR</code> pin whether it’s an <code>IN</code> or <code>OUT</code> instruction, respectively. The addressed peripheral must manually check for the address bus and the I/O pins and perform the required operation. In the case of an <code>IN</code> instruction, the CPU will store the received value on a pre-defined register.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/mastersystem/addressing.e186afc9821090e7011a73663fff377720381c6427d70dfc0cdfe0c03921953e.png"><picture>

Thus, it had to fit everything in the memory map.</p><h4 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h4><p>The architecture of this console is very similar to its predecessor, the <strong>Sega SG-1000</strong>, so the Master System managed to gain backwards compatibility with the SG-1000. Although, this only applies to the Japanese variant since the others contain a different cartridge slot.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>The drawings on the screen are produced by a proprietary chip called <strong>Video Display Processor</strong> or ‘VDP’. Internally, it has the same design of the Texas instrument TMS9918 (used in the SG-1000), but enhanced with more features which we will discuss in the following sections.</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/mastersystem/vdp.2930ab05e2b147c948d5134eeb66a701849c0a047bd649abd3cfd4b84d7cde21.png"><picture>

If you look at the motherboard picture again, you’ll notice that both RAM and VRAM chips are roughly the same, except that VRAM uses the chip model ending in ‘20’ which has lower latency.</p><p>In the case of the Master System, VRAM houses everything the VDP will require for rendering (except Colour RAM). The CPU fills VRAM by writing on VDP’s registers, which will in turn forward the values to VRAM. Since the VDP is accessed using I/O ports, the CPU must use <code>IN</code> and <code>OUT</code> instructions.</p><h4 id="constructing-the-frame">Constructing the frame</h4><p>The VDP renders frames with a resolution of <strong>up to 256x192 pixels</strong>, further revision added support for 256x224 px and 256x240 px, however, to maintain compatibility with all models, developers held on to the standard resolution. This chip has the same <em>modus operandi</em> of Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nes/#constructing-the-frame">PPU</a>, in other words, graphics are rendered on-the-spot.</p><p>On the other side, the VDP has four different modes of operation which will alter the characteristics of the frame (colour depth and resolution):</p><ul><li><strong>Mode 0 to III</strong>: Inherited from the TMS9918 found on the SG-1000. Included for backwards compatibility, although any SMS game can use them.</li><li><strong>Mode IV</strong>: Native mode of the Master System, which enables access to all the state-of-the-art features of the VDP. For the analysis, we’ll focus on this one!</li></ul><p>Now let’s see how a frame is drawn step by step, for this, I’ll borrow <em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em>’s assets. Also, to make explanations easier, I’m going to focus on the standard memory layout that Sega suggest for organising the graphics content (just remember that the VDP is very flexible with this, so games are allowed to optimise it).</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-tiles-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-tiles">Tiles</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-background-layer-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-background-layer">Background Layer</a></li><li id="tab-2-3-sprite-layer-link"><a href="#tab-2-3-sprite-layer">Sprite Layer</a></li><li id="tab-2-4-result-link"><a href="#tab-2-4-result">Result</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-tiles"><h4>Tiles</h4><p>Mode IV is based on the <strong>tile system</strong>. To recall <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nes/#tab-2-1-tiles">previous explanations</a> about tile engines, tiles are just <strong>8x8 pixel bitmaps</strong> which the renderer fetches to draw the game’s graphics. In the case of the VDP, the frame is composed of two planes, the background layer and the sprite layer.</p><p>Inside VRAM, there’s an area dedicated for tiles called <strong>Character generator</strong> (Sega calls ‘Characters’ to tiles) and it’s set to be <strong>14 KB long</strong>. Each tile occupies 32 bytes, so we can store up to 448 tiles.</p><p>There are 64 pixels defined on every tile, the VDP rules that each pixel must weight 4 bits, that means that up to <strong>16 colours can be chosen</strong>. Those bits reference a single entry on <strong>Colour RAM</strong> or ‘CRAM’. That area is found inside the VDP and stores the colour palettes. Colour palette systems help reduce the size of tiles in memory and allows programmers to alternate its colours without storing multiple copies.</p><p>Colour RAM stores <strong>two palettes of 16 colours each</strong>. Each entry is 6-bit wide and each 2-bit set defines one colour from the RGB model. This means that there are 64 colours available to choose from.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-background-layer"><h4>Background Layer</h4><p>The background layer is a large plane where static tiles are drawn. To place something here, there’s another area on VRAM called <strong>Screen map</strong> that takes 1.75 KB.</p><p>This enables to build a layer of 896 tiles (32x28 tiles), but if we do the math we’ll see that this layer is larger than the display resolution of this console. The reality is, only 768 tiles (32x24 tiles) are visible, so the visible area is manually selected at the programmer’s will. Hence, by slowly alternating the X and Y coordinates of the selected area, a <strong>scrolling effect</strong> is accomplished.</p><p>Each entry of the map is 2 bytes wide (as wide as the VDP data-bus) and contains the address of the tile in the Character generator and the following attributes:</p><ul><li><strong>Horizontal and Vertical flip</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>priority bit</strong> (whether to draw some or all the tile in front of sprites).</li><li>The <strong>colour palette</strong> used.</li></ul><p>Curiously enough, there are 3 unused bits in the entry which the game can use for other purposes (i.e. extra flags to assist the game engine).</p></div><div id="tab-2-3-sprite-layer"><h4>Sprite Layer</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/mastersystem/sonic/sprites.707537651fd6e5ce0ebcca7c4192748e4389797ebbcff4c1ddb4939cb8271e44.png"><picture>

The VDP can raster <strong>up to 64 sprites</strong> using a single tile (8x8 px) or two tiles stacked vertically (8x16 px).</p><p>The <strong>Sprite Attribute Table</strong> is a 256-byte area in VRAM that contains an array of all the sprites defined, its entries are similar to the background layer, except each sprite contain two additional values representing the X/Y coordinates.</p><p>The VDP is limited to <strong>up to eight sprites per horizontal scan-line</strong>. Also, if two sprites overlap, the last one in the list will be the one displayed.</p></div><div id="tab-2-4-result"><h4>Result</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/mastersystem/sonic/result.f37a1b0bb0f463acd33bdd04cc53b65c0504e26615bbe9a20f29533217601437.png"><picture>

The rendering process is done scan-line by scan-line, so the VDP doesn’t really know how the frame is going too look, that’s only seen by the user when the picture is constructed on the TV.</p><p>If you look at the example image, you may notice the frame has a vertical column at the left side. This is because the screen map is only tall enough to provide vertical scrolling without producing artefacts, <strong>but not wide enough for horizontal scrolling</strong>. So, the VDP can <strong>mask</strong> the left-most side with an 8 px column to protect the image from showing intermediate tiles.</p><p>To update the graphics for the next frame without breaking the image currently being displayed, the VDP sends two types of <strong>interrupts</strong> to the CPU. One which notifies that the CRT TV has finished beaming a chosen number of scan-lines (called <strong>horizontal interrupt</strong>) and another when the CRT finished drawing the last scan-line (called <strong>vertical interrupt</strong>) indicating the frame is finished. During those events, the CRT’s beam is re-allocating to draw the next scan-line (<strong>blanking interval</strong>), so any alteration of the VDP’s state won’t tear the image down. Horizontal blanking has a shorter time-frame than vertical blanking, yet it still allows to change, let’s say, the colour palette. This still can achieve some effects.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="secrets-and-limitation">Secrets and limitation</h4><p>At first glance, the VDP may seem like another chip with minimal functionality that we now take for …</p></div></div></div>

The numbers are the total confirmed normalized* cases per million for each state since June. A '10,000' means 1% of the state's population has tested positive of COVID since June 1. June 1 was chosen as it was around that time that countries worldwide that had been sucker-punched months before had the opportunity to apply proven preventative measures. It also provided an opportunity to contrast the resulting data with states' political affiliations, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index" target="new">Cook Partisan Voting Index</a>. The results suggest a strong correlation between a state's political leanings and its ability to employ proven science to slow the spread of COVID. </p><hr>
<p>* "Normalization" means the abnormalities in the data were evened out. For example, if there were 10 days in a row of a few cases/deaths a day and then one day of 1000... that looks awful and frenetic on a chart like this, even when framed in a per-week display. In reality, that 1000 is just a backlog catch-up, so I normalized it by spreading the thousand over previous dates for a more even / more realistic data. It works similarly when the total number of cases/deaths drops one day. Likely a correction from a previous report, I just subtracted the difference over previous dates to numbers that are probably closer to reality.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Writing is one of the most salient skills in professional life of individuals, especially for people in academia. In <a href="https://buomsoo-kim.github.io/learning/2020/03/27/How-to-speak.md/">his talk on speaking</a>, Professor Patrick Wilson mentioned that the ability to properly write is the second most important success factor in life (Of course, the most important one he mentioned is speaking). In this inspiring talk, Larry McEnerney, Director of the University of Chicago’s Writing Program, delineates <em>the Craft of Writing Effectively</em> in a provocative, yet engaging manner.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/vtIzMaLkCaM">YouTube Link</a> to the lecture video</li>
  <li><a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/5/7046/files/2014/10/UnivChic_WritingProg-1grt232.pdf">PDF file</a> of the handout used in the lecture (provided for the Ohio State University)</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.warrior-scholar.org/larry-mcenerney">Lawrence McEnerney</a> is the Director of Writing Programs at the University of Chicago. Besides teaching students how to write and speak, he serves as Resident Master and consulted numerous clients such as universities, institues, and businesses on effective communication.</p>

<p>Below is the summarization of his talk on the craft of writing.</p>



<p>This is the gist of this talk.
Do not think of <em>rules</em> when writing. <em>Think about readers</em> if you are an expert caring about the value of your writing.</p>



<h2 id="horizontal-process-of-writing-interferes-vertical-process-of-reading">Horizontal process of writing interferes vertical process of reading</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Horizontal process of writing: In most cases, writers use the writing process to help themselves think and make sense of the world.</li>
  <li>Vertical process of reading: Readers use the text to change the way they think about the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, the writing process interferes with the reading process of readers.</p>

<h2 id="when-readers-are-interfered">When readers are interfered,</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They slow down or re-read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, they misunderstand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, they are aggravated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, they are done with Reading.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="teachers-do-not-stop-reading-because-they-are-paid-to-care-about-you">Teachers do not stop reading because they are paid to care about you</h2>

<p>They are paid to read and grade your text, not to change the way they see the world.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://buomsoo-kim.github.io/data/images/2020-03-30/2.PNG" width="500px">
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the world beyond school, people are not paid to care about you. They read because the material has <strong>VALUE</strong> to them.</p>



<h2 id="common-desiderata-of-professional-text">Common desiderata of professional text</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Clear</li>

<br/>
October 14, 2020 | https://blog.ueber.io/post/list-of-side-projects/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.ueber.io/post/list-of-side-projects/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been a year since we started to build side projects regularly. We planned to launch ten projects in 12 months. Let’s look at what we’ve got now. All projects are in chronological order.</p>
<h3 id="1-alldocs">#1 <a href="https://alldocs.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alldocs</a></h3>
<p>We’ve never talked about that one, but it has been our first project. Alldocs is an online text converter that takes any text file and converts it to any text format.</p>
<p>Sure, there are many online converters already, but they all look like they want to steal my data. We wanted to make something looking more professional. We’re still working on it from time to time and hope to improve the search engine ranking. Currently, it has 1.500 page views/month, and the number grows slowly.</p>
<p>By the way, the code is public: <a href="https://github.com/ueberdosis/alldocs.app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">github.com/ueberdosis/alldocs.app</a></p>
<h3 id="2-mouseless">#2 <a href="https://mouseless.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mouseless</a></h3>
<p>Mouseless is a beautiful app to learn and look up keyboard shortcuts on your Mac, and it is our most significant success in many regards.</p>
<p>It has been sold more than 1,600 times and has more than $30,000 in revenue. It’s also part of the fantastic SetApp catalog.</p>
<p>We’re still maintaining it and publish an update from time to time.</p>
<p>And even this one is open source: <a href="https://github.com/ueberdosis/mouseless" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">github.com/ueberdosis/mouseless</a></p>
<h3 id="3-floatie">#3 <a href="https://floatie.app/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Floatie</a></h3>
<p>With Floatie, we’ve built a platform to publish metrics for our projects, including page views, tracked time, sales, revenue, and many more.</p>
<p>Around 20k people looked up our numbers, but only about 100 others showed interest in publishing their numbers on our platform. The project is on hold now.</p>
<h3 id="4-untitled-blogging-platform-killed">#4 Untitled Blogging Platform (killed)</h3>
<p>Yeah, that was a stupid one. We started to build our blogging platform and had a few ideas to grow it but were too afraid to try it. There are just too many blogging platforms out there. We’ve renamed and moved it to different domains a few times, and here is one fun fact: The blog you’re reading doesn’t use the platform, but its design.</p>
<h3 id="5-glyphfinder">#5 <a href="https://glyphfinder.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Glyphfinder</a></h3>
<p>After the success of Mouseless, we felt confident to try another macOS app and even wanted to bring it to Windows this time.</p>
<p>Long story short, less than 5 % of purchases were Windows users, but the development, testing, publishing, and support for the app was a tremendous time killer. We will probably never develop a Windows app again.</p>
<p>We still maintain the macOS version, release an update now and then, and love to use it ourselves.</p>
<p>Dig through the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/ueberdosis/glyphfinder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">github.com/ueberdosis/glyphfinder</a></p>
<h3 id="6-fokus-paused">#6 Fokus (paused)</h3>
<p>We answered hundreds of support emails for our products and thought about building a lean support platform. We had a few ideas for it, designed the interface, and then stopped.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of development work, with many competitors, and we aren’t confident that our ideas are unique enough.</p>
<p>So that one is still on hold. I like the name, though. Maybe, we’ll start to work on it again someday, perhaps not.</p>
<h3 id="7-frontend-news-killed">#7 Frontend News (killed)</h3>
<p>After feeling stuck for a while, I’ve built Frontend News, which aggregated news from hundreds of blogs. I tried to make that very open but received only a little feedback, so I decided to kill it after a few days.</p>
<p>Also, that experiment showed me that I don’t want to work too public. It feels stressful to write about every tiny step and is demotivating when there’s not enough feedback. I prefer to work on something until I’m (mostly) happy and share it then.</p>
<h3 id="8-mattermd-paused">#8 <a href="https://matter.md/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">matter.md</a> (paused)</h3>
<p>This project had a few names and took a few directions already. It started as an online text editor. Then we merged it with the untitled blogging platform, made it a macOS app, and tried to move it to the web again. None of that really worked, so <a href="https://blog.ueber.io/post/stopping-a-project/">we paused it in the end</a>.</p>
<h3 id="9-tiptap">#9 <a href="https://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tiptap</a></h3>
<p>tiptap is a text editor we built a while ago, and <a href="https://blog.ueber.io/post/our-plan-for-tiptap-2/">we have big plans for version 2</a>.</p>
<p>We have no idea how to make money with it, but with millions of downloads, it’s the most successful project we’ve ever built. We enjoy working on it, so we follow that and see what it’ll bring us later.</p>
<h3 id="10-skara">#10 <a href="https://skara.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Skara</a></h3>
<p>Skara is a slick knowledge base for teams. It’s still in private beta and we will keep it like that for a while, but plan to invite new users on a regular basis soon.</p>
<p>This one is a little different though. We already started Skara a few years back, but as an endeavour separated from überdosis. It felt wrong, so it became officially a part of überdosis just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Oh, and there is also #11, but we’re not ready to talk about that one. :​-​) We learned a lot on our way, but I’ll keep that for a different post. If you have any questions about that, <a href="https://twitter.com/hanspagel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">share it on Twitter</a> and I’ll answer them in one of the next posts.</p>

<![CDATA[Visidata 2.0]]>

October 14, 2020 | https://www.visidata.org/blog/2020/v2.0/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.visidata.org/blog/2020/v2.0/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="body">
        
<p>This is a major milestone. After almost 2 years of development, version 2.0 of VisiData is finally released. It's got several major improvements, a bunch of new loaders, and tons of new features and quality of life improvements. And, most importantly, an API specification for plugins.</p>
<h2>1. Licensing Changes</h2>
<p>[tl;dr: no more MIT vdtui; GPL3 for everything]</p>
<p>Previously, there was a core vdtui single-file library that I licensed as MIT, as I thought it might be a platform for a variety of apps like VisiData. Approximately no one showed interest in that though, and it became unwieldy to maintain, so over the course of developing VisiData 2.0, the vdtui library was thoroughly dismantled. It's now just the visidata module as a whole, which I'm releasing under GPL3. The last released version of vdtui.py under MIT was 1.5.2 if anyone wants to use that.</p>
<h2>2. Plugin API</h2>
<p>[tl;dr: "2.0" has a stable documented API; expect a growing ecosystem of plugins for a wide variety of use cases.]</p>
<p>To be honest, this is what held off the 2.0 release for so long. I knew I wanted to go through every function and decide whether I wanted to include it in the 2.0 API to be supported for the rest of the 2.x lifecycle, which might be years. (We don't intend to strictly adhere to "semver", but it's still important to try to maintain backwards compatibility within a major version number.) So now, we have an API spec with over 200 functions, which will be of interest if you want to customize VisiData, or create a plugin for it, or just to know more about its internal components.</p>
<p>Take a look at the actual API, at <a href="https://visidata.org/docs/api">visidata.org/docs/api</a>. It still needs a bit more polish, but the meat and bones are there.</p>
<h2>3. Undo and Redo</h2>
<p>This is a "game changer" according to @jsvine.</p>
<p>Undo and redo, along with the new <code>guard-sheet</code> command, make it much easier to rely on VisiData for data cleaning and data entry.</p>
<p>If you upgrade to 2.0 and learn nothing else about it, your life will be better for knowing Shift+U (undo) and Shift+R (redo).</p>
<h2>4. Deferred modifications</h2>
<p>[tl;dr: if you add/edit/delete rows on a few specific sheets, the changes won't take place right away; you'll have to press z Ctrl+S]</p>
<p>Certain sheets which know how to incrementally update their source--notably, the DirSheet and SqliteSheet--<strong>defer</strong> changes made to them, requiring an explicit save/commit step with commit-sheet (z Ctrl+S).</p>
<p>These changes are colorized on the screen and can be saved as data (or not saved, in the case of deletes) with save-sheet (Ctrl+S), even if they haven't been committed back to the original source with commit-sheet.</p>
<p>This means vd can work quite naturally as an interactive file manager, or as a sqlite database editor. I've been using it to manage my mp3 collection and my personal contacts database, which was a tsv file until I wanted to add a multiline "notes" field, so I saved it as a .json file and used that for a few months, and now I've been using it in an sqlite database. Of course they all look the same in VisiData so I can go back and forth without any friction.</p>
<h2>5. Split Window</h2>
<p>Press Shift+Z to split the terminal window into a top panel and bottom panel.</p>
<p>One panel contains the current/top sheet, the other panel contains the sheet "under" the top sheet. Press Tab or Ctrl+^ to go between them.</p>
<p>The fancy chooser (now the default for choosing aggregators or jointypes) uses this split window, and I have many other ideas for it as well.</p>
<p>It may not seem like much now, but I predict that this becomes a sleeper hit.</p>
<p>[previously blogged at: <a href="https://visidata.org/blog/2020/splitwin">visidata.org/blog/2020/splitwin</a>)]</p>
<h2>6. So many other features</h2>
<p>Here's curated list of highlights, the ones that seemed like people would be interested to know about:</p>
<ul>
<li>more visibility for long values, with "v" to toggle multi-line rows and and z+hjkl to adjust cell offset</li>
<li>[iota] the "i" family of commands to add an increment column</li>
<li>[unfurl] zM, which does row-wise expansion of iterables in a column (very useful with nested data)</li>
<li>[join] add "merge" jointype</li>
<li>[numeric binning] ranged binning for numeric columns</li>
<li>[cli] custom options parsing allows for per-sheet options</li>
<li>[cli] pipe and redirect to stdout; use as an interactive chooser</li>
<li>[input] Ctrl+Y paste from cell clipboard and other improvements</li>
<li>Alt+ as new keyboard layer for user keybindings</li>
</ul>
<p>And, as with every release, there are a bunch of new loaders, including MIME, recutils, vcard, imap, mysql, pdf, npy/npz, and more! See the new <a href="https://visidata.org/formats">/formats</a> page for a full list of supported formats, in tidy tabular form.</p>
<p>Then if you still haven't seen enough, you can see the <a href="https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/stable/CHANGELOG.md#v2.0">CHANGELOG</a> for the complete list of bugfixes and changes.</p>
<p>Okay, that about wraps it up for this release. If anything I've written about here sounds interesting and you'd like me to cover it first, or more in-depth, let me know! Send me <a href="https://www.visidata.org/blog/2020/v2.0/vd@saul.pw">an email</a>, or <a href="https://www.visidata.org/blog/2020/v2.0/twitter.com/VisiData">tweet @VisiData</a>, or <a href="https://www.visidata.org/blog/2020/v2.0/github.com/saulpw/visidata/issues">open a github issue</a>, or chat with us on Freenode #visidata; however you want to get in touch, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Some software engineering articles don’t seem to age. For example, the 1986 article “A rational design process: How and why to fake it” <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940">[doi]</a><a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/education/SE-Intro/fakeit.pdf">[pdf]</a>.</p><p>Back then, software engineering was looking for a so-called rational design process, i.e., a software development process that, if followed rigorously, would lead to the highest quality software with the lowest cost. Nowadays, that process is often called “waterfall” and is almost used synonymously with “bad software design”, having been replaced with processes like “agile”, “scrum”, “kanban” or “lean”. In essence, the waterfall model argues for a few different phases: requirements gathering, high-level system design, low-level module design, implementation and documentation. Each phase finishes with an artefact (documentation or code), that once produced is set in stone.</p><blockquote><p>We will never find a process that allows us to design software
in a perfectly rational way. The good news is that we can fake it. We can present our system to others
as if we had been rational designers and it pays to pretend do so during development and maintenance.</p></blockquote><p>The cited paper makes the case that requirements are vague and volatile, hence the final software will not have followed a rational design process, no matter how hard one tries. Instead, the paper argues to fake a rational design process, by producing said artefacts, as if a rational design process had been followed. In essence, the artefacts are updated to reflect the latest decision, for example, the requirements document is updated if during implementation a new requirement is discovered.</p><p>It is interesting to note how well the article has aged. Since its publication, <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> development methods have long argued from the engineering side to implement as little as is needed for delivering value to the customer. A bit later, the business side joined. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_thinking">Lean thinking</a> has explicitly acknowledged that one discovers the market’s needs by building a product. “Build measure learn” is the new mantra. In a way, the project passes iteratively through the rational design process, but each phase is performed only for as much as is needed to learn something new from the market.</p><p>Another way to see lean thinking is to reduce Work-In-Progress (WIP). A requirement document with many unfulfilled requirements is a WIP. An architecture document with many unimplemented modules is a WIP.</p><p>However, while lean thinking puts a lot of focus on minimizing WIP, it puts less focus on faking a rational design process: Reading patched documentation or code with many <a href="http://wordaligned.org/articles/todo">TODOs</a> raises the bar for newcomers, both customers and engineers. It is best for them to get a snapshot of documentation and code, as if everything was “done”.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. government is investing US$481 million in startup Cue Health Inc. to expand manufacturing of its rapid, point-of-care COVID-19 test, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>As part of the deal, Cue Health plans to ramp up production from several thousands of tests daily to about 100,000 of the assays each day by March. The vast majority of that production will go to the government, which is acquiring about 6 million of the single-use tests and 30,000 associated instruments.</p>

<p>Cue Healthâ€™s test got emergency clearance in June. It detects the virusâ€™s genetic material with a test cartridge about the size of an Airpod case and reader that allow results on-site in about 25 minutes, read using a smartphone app. That makes for fast answers that are about as reliable as tests sent out to a lab, said Brett Giroir, an assistant health secretary leading the administrationâ€™s testing efforts.</p>

<p>â€œThis is really an important niche to fill,â€� said Giroir, who went on to note that Cue Healthâ€™s test was used as part of the National Basketball Associationâ€™s screening strategy. â€œSo if itâ€™s good enough for LeBron, we want to democratize it and make sure itâ€™s available to the American people.â€�</p>

<p>The move is aimed at getting the right tests to the right person at the right time, rather than expanding how many tests the U.S. can do, Giroir said.</p>

<p>The Tuesday announcement follows previous investments by the government into manufacturing capacity at fellow rapid test manufacturers Becton Dickinson and Co and Quidel Corp. Investments have also been made to manufacture swabs, used to collect patient test samples, in the face of widespread shortages earlier in the pandemic.</p>

<p>â€œCompanies need money up front, particularly small companies,â€� Giroir said. â€œThis is not Abbott or BD.â€�</p>

<p>Cue Healthâ€™s COVID-19 test came out of a 2018 collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority on an influenza test intended for a potential flu pandemic. The company adapted the platform earlier this year to meet the current public-health crisis.</p>

<p>The assay is able to detect genetic markers of the virus and is easy-to-use because the company has â€œdone all the integration work, so itâ€™s quite sophisticated internally, like an iPhone is,â€� said Cue Health Chief Executive Officer Ayub Khattak. â€œWeâ€™ve had limited supply and thereâ€™s been a lot of demand for it.â€�</p>

<p><strong>Spot Tests</strong></p>

<p>Exactly where the Cue Health tests are deployed by the government will depend on where outbreaks are occurring, Giroir said. They will be used in settings where confirming test results on the spot is especially valuable, he said.</p>

<p>Giroir gave nursing homes as an example. The U.S. investment in Cue comes on the heels of concerns raised anew this month about COVID-19 antigen screenings, another kind of rapid test, producing false positives.</p>

<p>The Cue Health test could be used confirm a positive result produced by an antigen screening, though â€œnot every nursing home is going to get this,â€� Giroir said. Rules about government acquisitions prevented officials from discussing it with partners like nursing home groups prior to the announcement, according to Giroir.</p>

<p>â€œThis is not to replace antigen tests. This is a layer on top of antigen tests,â€� he said.</p>

<p>Are you the CEO of a software development agency? Then this article is for you.<br>In your current business model, you’re most likely selling knowledge and time for money. Your developers build what the client wants during the duration of the contract.</p>



<div><p>But what does your client do once you’re out? Do they have internal developers that can take on the workload? If they haven’t had any developers on staff before, can they hire developers themselves? <br>Will the new developers be able to take over your work fast enough? </p><p>Let’s explore how you can adapt your business model to cover these what-if’s. Additionally, let’s look at how you can set yourself apart from other Software Development Agencies.</p></div>



<p>Let’s assume a CEO of a brand-new startup plans to leverage web technologies as part of the business model, they need a partner who will help them to build IT competencies in the organization. They decide to hire someone to help with this process. <br>Let’s explore what IT competencies entail in this context.</p>



<h2>What are IT competencies?&nbsp;</h2>



<ul><li>Building and managing software in-house to support the business.</li><li>Initial maintenance of web application infrastructure.</li><li>Understanding the tech stack and how it relates to business goals.</li><li>Making technical decisions based on business requirements.</li><li>Hiring new IT professionals for the team.</li></ul>







<p>Usually, you would come in to help with writing new code and potentially operating it as well. Yet, you’re not involved in team-building or long-term maintenance. Your client would need to acquire this knowledge elsewhere and integrate it with your work. </p>



<p>But what if you would deliver on all these bullet points? The advantage for your client is clear: They get a holistic experience without any rough edges.</p>



<h2>How does it look like if you would offer a full-service contract?</h2>



<p>In the classic model of offering programming services, you focus solely on the code and when to deliver it.<br>We widen our scope from code to processes, hiring and delivery. You need to understand your client’s business model in-depth, before any developer starts to write a single line of code.</p>



<p>You deliver an initial proof of concept (PoC) implementation that helps everybody to get a first impression of the final version. The PoC is important for potential investor meetings but also for gathering feedback from early users.<br>The first major release deadline is coming closer and closer, and besides writing code you also work on processes that define how they specify features and deliver software.</p>



<p>Right after the initial release of the first publicly accessible version, the next phase starts. All developers on the team are external and it’s time to hire the first internal software developers. They will eventually take over development and operations. Therefore, you help with the entire hiring process, including job ads and interviews.<br></p>



<p>Your goal is to establish <a href="https://21-lessons.com/software-development-as-core-competency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">software development as a core competency</a> within your client’s company. They need to build this competency to maintain the tech stack, but also to keep growing their business. </p>



<h2>Restructure your Business Model</h2>



<p>Let’s start thinking beyond the standard terms of just writing code and expand your offerings to implement digital business models from start to finish. <br>Focus on a niche, a particular type of business. How can you support businesses in the niche best?&nbsp;<br>What services <em>around</em> classic programming jobs can you offer your clients? </p>



<p>Now we’re talking about an entirely different business model. Before, you wrote code in specific programming languages. Now, you build digital companies. </p>



<div><p>This pivot requires work on your company. As a result, you need to build the knowledge and skill to support this new process. That might mean hiring new team members, or training your existing team in new disciplines.</p><p><em>Other agencies might compete on the number of supported programming languages, whereas your business model focuses on your client’s overall success.</em></p></div>

October 13, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/10/13/how-to-hire-developers-6-tips-from-someone-you-probably-shouldnt-listen-to/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/10/13/how-to-hire-developers-6-tips-from-someone-you-probably-shouldnt-listen-to/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>So you want to hire a developer? Or maybe you just want to know what is going through the heads of employers like myself. Either way, let’s dive right into what <em>I think</em> are best practices for hiring programmers. I’ve found my opinions to be quite controversial, but I do put them into practice in my own career and at <a href="https://app.qvault.io/">Qvault</a>. When you inevitably disagree with some of my points, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" rel="noopener">@ me</a>.</p>



<p>The following process assumes essentially no HR to help (which I think is probably a good thing), and definitely no recruiters. I only have experience hiring direct to small(ish) companies.</p>



<h2>#1 – Throw Away Resumes With &gt;2 Pages</h2>



<p>Like really. When I post a job I get <strong>so</strong> many candidates. I need a way to quickly filter out some bad apples. I don’t have time to read about your high-school lifeguarding job.</p>



<p>Ideally, all resumes would be exactly <em>1 page</em>. If you have hundreds of applicants perhaps try filtering down to the single pagers.</p>



<p>Inb4, “but I have so much relevant experience, it doesn’t fit on one page”. Yes it does. No one gives a flying fart about the project you worked on 10 years ago and 6 companies ago. Boil it down to your MOST INTERESTING projects and MOST RELEVANT experience. It can fit on one page.</p>



<h2>#2 – Simplify the Process</h2>



<p>There is nothing worse as a candidate than sitting through 3 different 2 hour-long interviews only to find they didn’t get the job. Conversely, it also sucks as an employer to sit through several long interviews and have the candidate take another opportunity.</p>



<p>My process is fairly simple:</p>



<ol><li>Does the application look good? Great, go to step 2.</li><li>~20-minute zoom phone screen. This is not an interview. Just answering questions about the company and learning about the candidate’s situation. If there are no red flags, go to step 3.</li><li>~90-minute (preferably in-person) interview. This is it. Learn everything you need to know in less than 90 minutes. If you can’t do that, you are a bad interviewer and need more practice.</li></ol>



<h2>#3 – Take One of the First Good Candidates</h2>



<p>If you are a manager like me, then you spend ~80% of your time “coding” (doing technical work) and ~20% of your time “managing” (whatever the hell that means). Algorithmically, we all know that to find the greatest number in a list we need to check <strong>all</strong> the numbers. That’s O(n).</p>



<p>In reality, I don’t have time to “check” (interview) all the candidates to find the best one. I usually try to at least interview 3 or 4 candidates before making an offer, and sometimes many more if I don’t find anyone quickly.</p>



<p>I’ve found there are diminishing returns on your time spent trying to find a candidate after the first few good interviews.</p>



<p>Y Axis: Probability of finding a good candidate</p>



<p>X Axis: Number of candidates interviewed</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="831" height="480" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-7.24.24-AM-e1602595625480.png" alt="Log(x)+4" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-7.24.24-AM-e1602595625480.png 831w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-7.24.24-AM-e1602595625480-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-7.24.24-AM-e1602595625480-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-13-at-7.24.24-AM-e1602595625480-150x87.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px" title="Screen Shot 2020 10 13 at 7.24.24 AM e1602595625480"></figure></div>



<h2>#4 – Whiteboarding</h2>



<p>Somehow whiteboarding has become a naughty word when talking about interviewing. I hear dumb-ass statements like, “who cares if I can whiteboard if I know how to code?”</p>



<p>No one cares. White-boarding is just a convenient way to ignore dumb things that we can all google (like syntax) and focus on shit that matters (algorithms, data structures, architectural prowess, understanding of frameworks/concepts etc)</p>



<p>I don’t ask React developers to build binary trees. I don’t ask candidates for the data team to talk about Redux vs React Context. Keep the questions <em>applicable</em>, and don’t be afraid to use a goddamn whiteboard.</p>



<h2>#5 – Homework</h2>



<p>Fuck coding homework. It’s a waste of time for several reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Anyone can “dress up” a small project and google great solutions</li><li>It frustrates candidates, especially the good ones</li></ul>



<p>Think of coding homework as the opposite of application review. Application review weeds out bad candidates. Coding homework will often weed out the <em>good</em> ones.</p>



<p>Look at your candidate’s Github, Gitlab, whatever. Have them send links to projects they’ve worked on. Look at their commit histories. They’ve likely written thousands of lines of code you can get access to.</p>



<h3>A Homework Caveat</h3>



<p>Homework can make sense for candidates that have effectively no experience (very junior developers) for several reasons:</p>



<ul><li>They don’t mind doing some extra work to land a job, so you won’t weed out the good ones.</li><li>They don’t have much open-source code to share</li><li>Junior devs learn FAST. A project from 3 months ago likely won’t accurately reflect where they are at today.</li></ul>



<h2># 6 – Compensation</h2>



<p>If the candidate expects 80k, offer 85k. If they expect 110k, offer 120k. Why? It’s better to have the candidate <em>on your team</em>. If you get into hardcore negotiations then they start to see you as the enemy. Everything will go smoother and you will have a more effective relationship if you are on the same team from day 1.</p>

October 13, 2020 | https://www.a8b.io/posts/principles.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.a8b.io/posts/principles.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <div><p><span>Before writing anything on this blog I wanted to share some principles that I have been (more or less) using in life and that may subsequently be referred to within this blog. While these may seem obvious upon reading, it’s the careful application of these that I consider important and not simply the knowledge of them.</span></p><h2 id="h.rrkyjx250el6"><span>Whatever you do, do it in depth</span></h2><p><span>Whatever you do, you should do it in depth. This also implies you must pick what you do carefully. You may not be well suited (due to your natural interests or current capabilities) to do everything. Once you pick something you should do your best to learn, explore, immerse yourself, and make an outsized impact in that area. This tends to be a natural desire if you pick something that you fundamentally care about.</span></p><p><span>One reason for thinking this at the organizational level is that many economies of scale are “</span><span>winners take all”</span><span>. If you truly believe in what you’re doing you usually desire to scale what you’re doing up to the largest possible impact. But in a winner take all economy the best X will likely have some 80% of the market share and the remaining 20% will be split across its competitors. Most businesses that scale well are providing </span><span>platforms</span><span>&nbsp;that connect services, businesses, or people to one another (rather than offering the services or content itself), rather than provide services directly. Think Uber as a platform that connects drivers to passengers compared to a localized taxi company. Network effects usually compound the advantages that any one platform has over another (in Uber’s case say due to the number of drivers and riders) and therefore it pays exponentially to be the best. When dealing with things that can scale very large like this, focusing on the one thing that you can be the best at will yield better results than focusing on many things, even if you are competent at those many things. Even when dealing with things which don’t scale, it pays to be top of mind to a consumer in </span><span>some</span><span>&nbsp;category, rather than 2nd in many.</span></p><p><span>At the individual level, once you start working on a particular project you gather a lot of context. As you leave that project you lose the context. Context switching can be very costly and is one reason why you want to focus on one thing at a time in depth. Once you have that context and the time set aside to work on that thing, the marginal cost of improving the process you’re going through is smaller compared to if you set that improvement aside to come back to later. And the benefits of such process improvements are usually much larger than just the scope of your current project or work. When you dig deep into a project you notice more of those potential improvements and gain an understanding of the domain you are operating in that is itself a compounding investment for the future. In addition, going in-depth on a project can foster a sense of ownership and craftsmanship, especially if you care deeply about what you're doing. That craftsmanship can be a source of enjoyment and motivation in and of itself.</span></p><p><span>From a learning perspective going in-depth means doing your best to understand the fundamental concepts of what you’re learning so that your time is a compounding investment. Gaining an intuition is usually a more important outcome than memorizing some surface-level facts.</span></p><p><span>All time</span><span>&nbsp;is not equal. In many things, a linear increase in quality time you spend on a particular thing can have an exponential benefit as you make improvements that span to other people, teams, organizations, or yourself in the future. Choosing the projects where your time can be leveraged to produce outsized gains, and then pushing a lot of time into those projects is an effective strategy.</span></p><h3 id="h.i7uebstxgrut"><span>Pitfalls</span></h3><p><span>At the personal level, t</span><span>he idea of going in-depth on one particular thing can also be interpreted as hyperfocus. That can lead to tunnel vision and your inability to synthesize information across projects and areas which is critical for creativity. Hyper specialization can lead to the </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect">Einstellung effect</a></span><span>, colloquially if you have a hammer, everything is a nail. It is important to recognize that to solve a problem you must sometimes focus away from it, and look to different, wide-ranging areas for inspiration. Focusing on </span><span>solving </span><span>the problem is not the same as focusing on the problem. Furthermore going in-depth to solve a problem may mean going through a </span><span>wide and broad</span><span>&nbsp;range of things for inspiration.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, the idea of going in-depth on a project could be superficially interpreted as spending more time on something is automatically better. However, the activities you do during that time are important.</span></p><p><span>At the end of the day, the effective use of your time is up to you. Principles are guidelines and are meant to be followed to the spirit, and not to letter if you understand why you’re doing what you’re doing.</span></p><h3 id="h.xwrzbm9sxo70"><span>Parallel Ideas</span></h3><ul><li><span>“</span><span>Do less, then obsess” from Great at Work</span></li><li><span>Great by Choice talks about </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amundsen's_South_Pole_expedition">Amundsen</a></span><span>&nbsp;and</span><span>&nbsp;Scott’s race to the south pole, and how Amundsen focused on a solid plan and mastering a single means of transport (dog sledding) whereas Scott diversified and did not go as in-depth into various facets of the planning, relying on systemic redundancies that ultimately failed</span></li><li><span>Do something that you can be the best in the world at, part of “the hedgehog concept” from Good to Great</span></li><li><span>The idea of building a “Monopoly” from Zero to One</span></li><li><span>Edison (biography by Edmund Morris) exhibited the idea of going in-depth, trying thousands of variants of lightbulb filaments, thousands of plants as sources of rubber, and so on to solve various problems</span></li><li><span>Steve Jobs (biography by Walter Isaacson) was someone who went in-depth on almost everything he did. Refer to Creative Selection by Ken Kocienda to see stories of how he dove into every detail of the iPhone</span></li><li><span>The idea of niche specialization from The Passion Economy by Adam Davidson</span></li><li><span>Less is More from the book Range</span></li></ul><h2 id="h.ynhpcfmpn7vc"><span>Stick to things</span></h2><p><span>Stick to things. This means that you should be careful about what you pick to work on. This is especially pertinent when also following the first principle, whatever you do, do it in depth. Value is only realized when you finish whatever you’re working on. Most projects don’t deliver incremental value (e.g. a half published book is not valuable to anyone but yourself). Therefore either work on incremental value projects or stick to the projects you work on.</span></p><p><span>I tend to suffer from </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis paralysis</a></span><span>, or a form of it, where I frequently switch projects and priorities only to find myself looking back and realizing I have not finished many of them. In general, you learn more from a project you finished (and that sucks) than from one you didn’t. It’s also generally better to do something that is only partly useful than nothing at all.</span></p><h3 id="h.cw7ck34s3e0g"><span>Pitfalls</span></h3><p><span>By contrast, knowing when to give up is a difficult thing. Not everything should be pursued indefinitely or under all conditions. It may make a lot of sense for a startup to pivot at any given moment, though doing so with care and forethought. As for most things, what counts is the intention and reason. Giving up to work on another thing due to a minute change in priorities, being more excited about another thing in the short term, self-doubting, being unsure about the outcome, or even just being more excited about the idea of things than doing them are all invalid reasons to give up on something. Having a rational reason to give up may be valid, but beware the distinction between rational reasons and a rationalization. Also, keep in mind that what you’re working on should be worth the time spent. If it’s not worth 10 years then it is likely not worth 10 minutes of your time.</span></p><p><span>Another thing to be aware of is the distinction between sticking to something and falling into a habit. Just because you’ve always done something a certain way doesn’t mean that you </span><span>need</span><span>&nbsp;to continue doing that to stick to it, that’s not the kind of tenacity I’m talking about. It’s very difficult to evaluate your life objectively, and people tend to evaluate potential outcomes relative to their current positions and tend to value losing certain things more than gaining others. For example, quitting a well-paid job to pursue an independent business idea with no guarantee of funding or success can be very difficult since the idea of losing the job is overvalued due to loss aversion and the idea of doing something new and risky could be undervalued due to the probabilistic nature of the outcome and the comfort of not changing. Reframing your decisions in more absolute terms can be a way to deal with loss aversion and stagnation.</span></p><h3 id="h.z3oqxh5lfkc7"><span>Parallel Ideas</span></h3><ul><li><span>Grit (from the book Grit by Angela Duckworth)</span></li><li><span>Edison (see biography by Edmund Morris) was a great example of someone willing to spend decades on a specific area of problems. He is also </span><span>attributed </span><span>to saying success is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration</span></li><li><span>John Keats finished the 4000 line poem Endymion, even though he hated it around ¾ of the way through, as it was a test he had set to himself of his abilities and creativity. He did this poem as an exercise in tenacity</span></li><li><span>Paul Graham and others who talk about startups frequently highlight the necessity of persistence in face of the numerous challenges</span></li><li><span>The book range talks about the potential pitfall of having too much grit, and that similarly “The important trick…is staying attuned to whether switching is simply a failure of perseverance or astute recognition that better matches are available.”</span></li><li><span>Beware of false fails from Loonshots by Safi Bakhal</span></li></ul><h2 id="h.rx6hv71f9k9h"><span>Produce more and consume less</span></h2><p><span>Produce more and consume less is a reminder that consumption for consumption's sake does not produce anything meaningful. It can feel very productive to go read ten books, but on the other hand, you can also learn a lot of things that stick while creating value. A project in the hand is worth at least a dozen in the bush. Choose something worthy, stick to it, and learn from doing.</span></p><h3 id="h.6s6d3x1rbbh7"><span>Pitfalls</span></h3><p><span>This doesn’t mean don’t rely on the wisdom of others. Just that …</span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="str-vOKpYe5nW" data-connect-field="content"><p>When I was younger, most of my time spent writing code, with 5 hours of sleep a day. I often read about productivity hacks, hope to squeeze a little more works. But nothing really works.</p><p>Having an unhealthy lifestyle drained my energy. In the past year, even if I wanted to, I can't do it anymore. I need more breaks, more sleep, and more time away from the projects.</p><p>Turn out, it was for the better.</p><p>Most personal productivity hacks are to kick-start some unused parts of our energy. But when you have already drained them out, there is no more energy to kick-start. You're just working too much.</p><p>My change of habit helps me feel much better.</p><p>Almost every day, I sleep 7:30+ hours, often have a noon nap for a productive afternoon. I started to eat on time, 3 meals a day. For the last year, I exercise after work, at least 5 times a week, 30 mins each.</p><p>In case you're drained out, and looking for productivity hacks. Maybe you don't need one. Maybe all you need is to take care of yourself better.&nbsp;</p><p>Sleep more, eat more, be healthier</p></div></div>]]>
