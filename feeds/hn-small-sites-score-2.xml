        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Like many people across the world, I’m using my quarantine effectively: by catching up on all the video games I wasn’t able to play while traveling. The game at the top of my list? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2018_video_game)">Spider-Man</a>, which was widely recognized as one of the top games of 2018. The game is features an open-world, which means you can travel around the game map as you see fit. And since Spider-Man, canonically, lives in real-life New York City, this means you’ll spend hours webbing around an incredibly detailed version of the city that never sleeps.</p>

<p>If you’ve spent any appreciable amount of time in New York, the in-game world will immediately feel familiar. The developers nailed the look and feel of the city. I found myself using real-world landmarks to orient myself as I slinged (slunged?) across Manhattan. The game leans into this realism—it even includes a challenge where you can take photos of in-game landmarks. While some are unique to the Marvel universe, like Avengers Tower and Uncle Ben’s grave, many exist in the real world and are faithfully reproduced within the game: Williamsburg/Brooklyn/Manhattan/Queensboro Bridges all make an appearance, as does Grand Central, Madison Square Garden, Saint Patrick’s Cathedral, Columbus Circle, the High Line and many more points of reference. As you’re swinging through the city, you’re treated to great views of Manhattan’s skyline, anchored by the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and Freedom Tower. Except, it’s <em>not</em> the Freedom Tower, despite being located in the exact same location as its real-life counterpart. Why are equally famous buildings like the Empire State Building accurately depicted, but the Freedom Tower isn’t?</p>

<p>Here’s what the “Freedom Tower” looks like in the game:
<img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/spiderman-1wtc.png" alt="In-Game 1WTC">
<em>(credit to Polygon because I was too lazy to get this off my PS4 myself)</em></p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the in-game design looks to be based on Libeskind’s original design for Freedom Tower (an interesting recap of the changes can be found <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/daniel-libeskinds-world-trade-center-change-of-heart">here</a>), lending further credence to the theory that this building is supposed to be 1WTC.</p>

<p>My curiosity was further piqued when I learned that the <em>real</em> One World Trade Center was actually in the game during a demo at E3 in June of 2018, less than 4 months before the final game was set to be released to the public!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/1wtc_e3.png" alt="Real-life 1WTC in Spider-Man demo from E3 2018"></p>

<p>This deadline is even closer than it appears at first glance as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#RTM">“gold master”</a> is finalized weeks before release date so manufacturers have time to make and distribute the game to retailers. This change must have been implemented at the 11th hour.</p>

<p>And even after swapping the model out, they featured the building prominently on the home screen in the released version of the video game!
<img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/spiderman-start.png" alt="Start screen">
<em>(<a href="https://www.noobfeed.com/features/1119/marvel-s-spider-man-how-do-you-access-new-game-plus-and-ultimate-difficulty">credit</a>)</em></p>

<p>So <em>why</em> isn’t the real-life 1 WTC featured? At this point, we can eliminate time and budget constraints because we know the model already existed and was implemented before launch. We know that the designers thought this building was important as it’s the first thing you notice when starting the game.</p>

<p>I wish to briefly introduce <strong>Buccini’s razor</strong>—if something fun disappears unexpectedly, the cause is litigation (real or imagined).</p>

<p>It turns out that just like an author can copyright their book and a musician can copyright a song, an architect can copyright a building. Sure enough, here’s the copyright record for One World Trade Center:
<img src="https://www.stevenbuccini.com/assets/spiderman/copyright_record.png" alt="Record from [copyright.gov](https://www.copyright.gov/); can't deeplink the record but you can find it yourself by using the document record seen above"></p>

<p>At this point, I had a strong feeling copyright law was the reason for the change. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpidermanPS4/comments/9grnr8/freedom_tower/">internet</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpidermanPS4/comments/9d3paw/the_real_reason_for_the_redesigned_freedom_tower/">seems</a> <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/191635-marvels-spider-man/76988485">to</a> <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/one-world-trade-center-has-been-removed-from-spider-man-ps4.1465315/">agree</a>.</p>

<p>As luck<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> would have it, there was <a href="https://www.nexsenpruet.com/professionals/jeff-reichard">an expert in architectural copyright</a> right around the corner from my house here in Greensboro! Jeffrey was kind enough to spend a few minutes of his time thinking about this not-at-all-important question.</p>

<p>First, Jeffrey noted that <em>copyrights expire</em>. Just as music and books can pass into the public domain for anyone to replicate freely, you can also build an exact replica of the Empire State Building here in the United States if you so choose. Generally, any building constructed after December 1, 1990 is covered by the <a href="https://www.djc.com/news/ae/11151054.html">Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act</a>. This would explain why older structures are replicated faithfully but the Freedom Tower is not.</p>

<p>However, this doesn’t tell the full story. As Jeffrey noted, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/120">17 U.S. Code § 120(a)</a> “provides an exception related to pictorial representations of of buildings that are visible from a public place. Therefore, I am not sure exactly why they changed it in the video game.”</p>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle lies at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo5A_fuDgtk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2666">end of the credits</a>, where the creators of the game specifically thank the owners of certain famous buildings in New York, including the Empire State Building. I found this curious as the Empire State Building should be doubly safe: it was constructed long before 1990 so it is not covered under copyright law, and it is visible from a public place so it should be exempt from any potential copyrights. But look closer. You’ll see that they are acknowledging the <em>trademark</em> holders, NOT the <em>copyright</em> holders.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.photosecrets.com/buildings-copyright-and-trademarks">As this page</a> helpfully explains, applying a trademark to the building limits how the building’s image can be used in the sale of goods and services (like video games)! The credits hint that the video game creators obtained limited licenses to use the trademark, i.e. the distinctive design and appearance of the building, for certain buildings such as the Flatiron Building.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Therefore, the most likely answer is that the distinctive shape of 1 World Trade Center is either trademarked (although I could not find it within USPTO databases) or is so recognizable that it is easily defensible via a common law trademark and the game developers were unable to secure a license to use the trademark before their deadline.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzuHo80U2M">Sony just announced</a> an expansion to the Spider-Man video game, so perhaps the additional time and the demonstrated popularity of the first installment will help resolve this issue for the upcoming title.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          


<p>In this blogpost, we show how libFuzzer, the LLVM fuzz testing library part, can be employed with rev.ng in order to perform coverage-guided blackbox fuzzing of executable binaries.
We also show that our approach is fast, semantic-preserving and simply requires to implement the <a href="https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/tutorial/libFuzzerTutorial.md#hello-world-fuzzer">harness function</a>, as occurs for programs with source code available.</p>
<p>Note that this work is based on the rev.ng lifter, the open-source component at the core of the decompiler we're building.
The <a href="https://github.com/revng/revng">publicly available</a> version is a bit outdated, but we are in the process of pushing out new versions on a more regular basis.
<a href="https://twitter.com/_revng">Stay</a> <a href="https://rev.ng/newsletter.html">tuned</a>.</p>

          
          
            <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Fuzzing is a widespread technique for discovering software security vulnerabilities, where randomly mutated inputs are fed to a target program. It underwent a breakthrough around 2014, with the introduction of <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">AFL</a> and it has been gaining popularity steadly ever since.
Its success is in large part due to its effectiveness in identifying <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl#bugs">real world security vulnerabilities</a>. What makes it innovative is its <em>coverage-based</em> fuzzing approach, which prioritizes inputs that lead to traverse previously unexplored execution paths.
This coverage information is used to drive the fuzzing strategy, and the greater the coverage, the higher the chances of finding bugs. To collect coverage information, the input program is instrumented at compile-time. Then, at run-time, new inputs are continuously generated through a feedback-mechanism.</p>
<p>Other state-of-the-art coverage-guided fuzz testing frameworks include <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libFuzzer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/honggfuzz">Honggfuzz</a>.</p>
<p>While whitebox (source-available) fuzzing is a relatively consolidated research area, assessing the security of closed-source software is still largely an open challenge. Existing works primarily resort to <em>dynamic binary translation</em> which injects the instrumentation dynamically. Main examples comprise <a href="https://github.com/mirrorer/afl/blob/master/qemu_mode/README.qemu">AFL QEMU user-mode</a> and <a href="https://project.inria.fr/FranceJapanICST/files/2019/04/19-Kyoto-Fuzzing_Binaries_using_Dynamic_Instrumentation.pdf">Honggfuzz combined with QBDI</a>. This process is straightforward, but comes with a significant runtime overhead and, consequently, a reduced effectiveness.</p>
<p>Additionally, running a whole program can be sometimes very hard - if feasible at all.
For instance, booting a firmware image is not always manageable. In such situations, fuzzing only delimited portions of code might be a winning strategy.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>rev.ng features a static binary translator, that, given a Linux program compiled for architecture <em>A</em> (e.g., AArch64) can produce an equivalent program for another architecture <em>B</em> (e.g., x86-64), or even for the same architecture <em>A</em>. The input binary code is converted into a higher-level intermediate representation, LLVM IR, which makes it suitable for performing a wide range of analyses and transformations. We have been able to translate and properly execute programs of significant size and complexity such as <code>perl</code> and <code>gcc</code>.</p>
<p>Now, the intuition is that we can leverage the static binary translator to inject the necessary instrumentation to perform coverage-guided fuzzing.
This approach is purely <em>ahead-of-time</em>, since both the translation happens and the instrumentation take place offline.
This results in significantly reducing the run-time overhead.</p>
<p>More specifically, libFuzzer - which is usually employed in presence of the source code - can be combined with the recompilable LLVM IR module produced by rev.ng. The output is a standalone binary that keeps feeding new inputs to the translated program.</p>
<p>When fuzzing <em>less</em>, the terminal pager, we obtained the following results:</p>

<p>Compared with AFL in QEMU-mode, we got speedups ranging from 20× to 40×.
Check out <a href="https://rev.ng/downloads/iccst-18-paper.pdf">our previous paper</a> for a more detailed rundown on performance.</p>
<p>As a result, our approach supports <strong>in-memory coverage-guided fuzzing</strong> of individual functions even when the source code is not available.
Since, by design, one can fuzz, for instance, an ARM binary after translating it to x86-64, it is architecture-independent as well.
Moreover we can test distinct portions of code separately, without executing the whole program. This is particularly beneficial, for instance, for self-contained libraries and embedded firmwares.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the fuzzing process. At the last stage of our optimization passes, the fuzzing framework produces, among other things, a C header declaring all the collected functions for the user.
After creating the harness function, the compiler driver is called to build the fuzzer binary.</p>
<p><img alt="overview" src="https://rev.ng/blog/fuzzing/overview.svg"></p>
<h2>The fuzzing process</h2>
<p>Briefly, our fuzzing framework aims to:</p>
<ol>
<li>preserve functional correctness and achieve good performance;</li>
<li>enable fuzzing of individual functions;</li>
<li>enable hooking of functions;</li>
<li>reuse existing sanitizers.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this stage, these goals are achieved by implementing three LLVM passes that run over the recompilable unit of LLVM IR: an instrumentation pass (<em>PatchReturn</em>), a pass that generates helper stubs and C headers for every lifted function (<em>WrapperGen</em>), and a pass for function hooking when needed (<em>FuncHook</em>).</p>
<h3>Functional correctness and performance</h3>
<p>Two major challenges typical in static binary translation are preserving both semantics correctness and performance of the original program. To have both, we adopt a two-fold approach, which consists in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collecting all the basic blocks of the original program in a single LLVM function (known as <code>root</code>). While not extremely fast and prone to less optimizations, this guarantees functional correctness.</li>
<li>Identifying the start and end addresses of every function and isolating their code into distinct LLVM functions (so called <em>isolated functions</em>). This allows for more aggressive optimizations, but may be subject to inaccuracies in the CFG-recovering phase.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>root</code> function is intended to start the execution and migrate it to the appropriate isolated function, where it will stay for most of the time.
A caveat though: since function boundaries detection and data code separation boil down to be an undecidable problem, we need a way to continue flawlessly with the execution if, for instance, an unexpected jump target is met in an isolated function. 
Without such a mechanism, semantic correctness would not be guaranteed. To address this issue, we let the code run at full speed while inside an isolated function, and fall back to <code>root</code> only if an unforeseen jump, e.g., a misidentified return instruction, is encountered.</p>
<p>As a comparison, see how the <code>root</code> function and the isolated <code>main</code> (known as <em>revng translated block</em>) respectively look like in the LLVM IR:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>define</span> <span>void</span> <span>@root</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span>dispatcher:</span>
    <span>%1</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span> <span>i64</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span><span>*</span> <span>@pc</span>
    <span>switch</span> <span>i64</span> <span>%1</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>i64</span> <span>0x1000</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span> <span>%rtb_main</span>
        <span>i64</span> <span>0x2000</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span> <span>%rtb_func1</span>
        <span>i64</span> <span>0x3000</span><span>,</span> <span>label</span> <span>%rtb_func2</span>
    <span>]</span>

<span>rtb_main:</span>
    <span>; Load rdi and rsi</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>void</span> <span>@rtb_main</span><span>(</span><span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>rdi</span><span>)</span>
<span>rtb_func1:</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>void</span> <span>@rtb_func1</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>define</span> <span>i64</span> <span>@rtb_main</span><span>(</span><span>i64</span> <span>%rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>%rdi</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>; Push rbp on the stack</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>void</span> <span>@rtb_func1</span><span>()</span>

    <span>; Push rbx on the stack</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>void</span> <span>@rtb_func2</span><span>()</span>
    <span>ret</span> <span>void</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As shown in the snippet, the dispatcher inside <code>root</code> is responsible for redirecting the execution to the respective isolated function as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Fuzzing of individual functions</h3>
<p>All the isolated functions found are possible candidates for fuzzing. Now, we need a way to let the translated program run so that all the initialization routines (e.g., the memory allocator) can be carried out, and pause the execution of the <em>guest</em> (the translated program) when the user-defined entrypoint is met (be it <code>main</code> or whenever we need to back out of the program).</p>
<p>This is what the first instrumentation pass is meant to do, i.e., to allow to return from any isolated function to <code>root</code>. The migration is necessary to give control back to <code>LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput</code>, the function in charge of guiding the fuzzing process.
As an example, suppose we need to initialize the program and return to the fuzzing context only once a startup routine (<code>init_vars</code>) has been executed. The transition back would be the following one:</p>
<p><img alt="flow" src="https://rev.ng/blog/fuzzing/flow.svg"></p>
<p>The snippet below shows how we insert a sentinel variable to make such a transition before returning from <code>init_vars</code>.
As can be seen, the terminator block <code>rtb_init_vars.0x1d</code>, which is supposed to return to <code>main</code>, is no longer reachable - instead, we return to <code>root</code>, which ultimately returns to <code>LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>rtb_init_vars:</span>
    <span>store</span> <span>i1</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>i1</span><span>*</span> <span>@ReturnFromFuzzing</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>void</span> <span>@unwind_back</span><span>(</span><span>i32</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>i64</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>     <span>; Stack unwinding mechanism is used here to return to root</span>
    <span>unreachable</span>

<span>rtb_init_vars.0x1d:</span>                                        <span>; Basic block to return to main is now unreachable</span>
    <span>ret</span> <span>void</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The second pass, on the other hand, generates a wrapper around each isolated function in the form of a C header (<code>generated_wrappers.h</code>), thus allowing normal function invocation without inspecting the ABI used by the original program.</p>
<p>Note, though, that we cannot invoke the isolated function directly: we still need to pass through <code>root</code> in order to maintain the functional correctness. 
So, for every isolated function, whose prototype is retrieved through dedicated analyses, we set up the emulated program counter (which points to the respective isolated function), the emulated stack pointer, and the function arguments. If the function is supposed to return, a struct with the possible arguments to be returned is filled.</p>
<h3>Hooking functions</h3>
<p>The third pass allows the user to easily replace existing functions (like <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, <code>send</code>, <code>recv</code> and so forth). This turns out to be useful when we want to add user-defined callbacks, logging or inject raw data, e.g., when a function expects data coming from a socket.</p>
<p>For every isolated function, we take the following steps to perform function hooking:</p>
<ol>
<li>make its symbol have <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#linkage-types">weak linkage</a>;</li>
<li>clone it;</li>
<li>wrap up the original implementation in a dedicated function.</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows us to bypass the <em>One Definition Rule</em>. Hence, if a symbol is redefined, it will override the original …</p></div></div>

September 17, 2020 | https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/09/16/toc-approves-kubeedge-as-incubating-project/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/09/16/toc-approves-kubeedge-as-incubating-project/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Today, the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) voted to accept <a href="https://kubeedge.io/en/">KubeEdge</a> as an incubation-level hosted project.</p>



<p>KubeEdge is an open source system for extending containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at the edge. It is built on top of Kubernetes and provides infrastructure support for network, application deployment, and metadata synchronization between the cloud and the edge.</p>



<p>“We designed KubeEdge to address three major challenges in edge computing – network reliability between the cloud and edge, resource constraint on edge nodes, and scalability challenges of highly distributed edge architectures,” said Zefeng Wang and Yin Ding, KubeEdge maintainers. “By extending cloud native technologies to the edge, KubeEdge forms a complete edge cloud computing ecosystem. We are very excited to continue to make the project more robust as it moves to incubation.”</p>



<p>KubeEdge was accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project in March 2019, and released version 1.0 in June 2019. The KubeEdge team now releases quarterly, timed with the release of upstream Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since joining CNCF, KubeEdge has added more than <a href="https://kubeedge.devstats.cncf.io/d/18/overall-project-statistics-table?orgId=1">395 Contributors</a> from 25 organizations. The project has 14 maintainers from 5 different organizations, including Arm, China Unicom, Huawei, infoblox.com, and inovex.de, and is used in production by <a href="https://huaweicloud.com/">Huawei Cloud</a>, <a href="https://kubesphere.io/">KubeSphere</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md#raisecom-technology-coltd">Raisecom</a>, <a href="https://cucc.wocloud.cn/">WoCloud</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md#xinghai-iot">Xinghai IoT</a>, and more.</p>



<p>“KubeEdge solves a complex and unique use case of running containerized applications on edge devices, which benefits the cloud computing ecosystem as a whole,” said Alena Prokharchyk, CNCF TOC member. “Its architecture meets the reliability, availability, and extensibility criteria needed for further growth and adoption. We look forward to seeing new and improved features as the project moves to this new level.”</p>



<p><strong>Main KubeEdge Features:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Cloud-Edge Reliable Collaboration: Ensure reliable messages delivery without loss over an unstable cloud-edge network.</li><li>Edge Autonomy: Ensure edge nodes run autonomously, and the applications on edge run normally, even when the cloud-edge network is unstable, or the edge is offline and restarted.</li><li>Edge Device Management: Managing edge devices through Kubernetes native APIs implemented by CRD.</li><li>Lightweight Edge Agent: Extremely lightweight Edge Agent&nbsp; (EdgeCore) to run on the resource-constrained edge.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Notable Milestones:</strong></p>



<ul><li>&gt; 2,500 Commits</li><li>&gt; 2,900 GitHub Stars</li><li>&gt; 780 Forks</li></ul>



<p>KubeEdge is an active participant in the CNCF community and contributes to the upstream Kubernetes project to solve common issues. The project is built on Kubernetes and integrates with other CNCF projects, including containerd and CRI-O as a lightweight container runtime, Prometheus for metrics on the edge, and Envoy for ingress. It also uses gRPC to offer cloud edge remote calls for applications.</p>



<p>The KubeEdge team also <a href="https://thenewstack.io/kubeedge-and-its-role-in-multi-access-edge-computing/">collaborated with LF Edge</a> in setting up the Akraino KubeEdge Edge Service Blueprint Family and Akraino Eliot Blueprint Family projects, which can be deployed at enterprise edges or as a cloud edge extension interfacing to the core telco network.</p>



<p>“Kubernetes is the de-facto orchestrator for cloud native services and is starting to evolve in future edge computing deployments,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO/COO of Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “KubeEdge plays an important role in bringing Kubernetes to the edge. We look forward to seeing how the project develops and pushes the Kubernetes community into new areas.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a CNCF-hosted project, joining incubating technologies Argo, CloudEvents, CNI, Contour, Cortex, CRI-O, Dragonfly, etcd, Falco, gRPC, Linkerd, NATS, Notary, OPA, OpenTracing, Operator Framework, Rook, SPIFFE, SPIRE, and Thanos, KubeEdge is part of a neutral foundation aligned with its technical interests, as well as the larger Linux Foundation, which provides governance, marketing support, and community outreach. For more information on maturity requirements for each level, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">CNCF Graduation Criteria</a>.</p>

					<h2>What, why &amp; who for ?</h2>
					<p>This document essentially contains an introduction to the relational algebra that is implemented in SIRA_PRISE. Depending on your background, you may already have some or very extensive knowledge about the subject, in which case you probably do not need to read this document.</p>
					<p>If, however, your knowledge of and about the Relational Model of Data was primarily/solely obtained through the usage of SQL-based systems, and terms such as "relvar", "relation" and "tuple" sound completely unfamiliar to you, then carefully studying this document is probably a sine qua non for you to
						understand and effectively use this new system you've got in your hands.</p>
					<p>This introduction is subdivided in several parts :&nbsp;</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The first part, "<a href="#Terminology">Terminology</a>", defines the components that lay the foundation for any relational database : type, value, tuple, relation, ... &nbsp;It is rather mathematical in nature and may therefore seem to be a bit alienating ("What the hell do IT&nbsp;professionals need
							mathematics for ?"), but let me assure you that understanding&nbsp;this part really is relevant and really is needed for you to understand part two properly.
						</li>
						<li>Part two, "<a href="#Relational_Algebra">Relational Algebra</a>", offers a detailed definition and discussion of all the operators of the algebra, which is the part of the relational model that every database user employs in every single query he/she writes and/or&nbsp;executes.
						</li>
						<li>Part two introduces the operators of the algebra, making abstraction of a very particular data type called the interval type. SIRA_PRISE offers support for interval types, and the third part, "<a href="#interval_types">The RA and interval types</a>", introduces how the operators of the algebra behave
							when faced with relations that hold interval-typed attributes.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>
						<a id="Terminology"></a>Terminology
					</h2>
					<p>You may have wondered, at some time, why "Relational databases" (and "Relational dbms's") are called how they are. You may have assumed that it must have had something to do with this thing called "Entity-Relationship modeling" that you may already have practiced at some point in your career. Your
						assumption was wrong. In fact, the first mention of the term "relational" in the context of data management even predates the invention of E/R modeling ... So where dóes the term come from ?</p>
					<p>Well, the term comes from something that we have presumably all been taught about in our math classes, somewhere between the age of 10 and 20, that thing being the "relation". The Relational Model of Data (RM for short) is no more or less than a mechanism to represent data in general, and which has that
						same mathematical concept of a relation as its key building brick. Before digging into the details of the algebra, it is first necessary to define a couple of terms that are frequently used when talking about the RM. That is where we will start this introduction of the relational algebra.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Set</i>
							</h3>
							<p>Lots of people collect things. Stamps, coins, rare books, art reproductions or even original art masterpieces, just name it and someone exists who collects it. You probably have spent some time in your life too, trying to build up some collection. If you have, doubtless that there have been some items
								that you have managed to collect more than once. It was problaby fun trading those "duplicates" with fellow collectors for items that you had not yet managed to collect. Well, a "collection" is a very fundamental concept in mathematics, one that is in fact needed to define what a "set" is.</p>
							<p>In mathematics, a "collection" is, loosely speaking, any possible gathering in any possible quantity of any possible things. The gathering of (chair, cloud, oak tree, chair) is a collection. Note that the collection has two chairs.</p>
							<p>Now, if a collection has the particular property that none of the items in the collection appear more than once, then we call this collection a "set". This property turns out to be a very useful and important one, and therefore sets, and set theory, are very important in mathematics. So important in fact
								that relational database technology could and would not even have been invented without them. Important enough also, to be repeated in bold :</p>
							<p>
								<b>A set is a collection that does not contain duplicates.<br> Something that does contain duplicates, is not a set.
								</b>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Type/Value</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>So {A,1,oak tree,patent} is a set. {A,patent,A} is not. Now, in the context of data management problems, which is what we're interested in, sets such as those&nbsp;are of course not very useful. In the context of data management, sets are mostly useful only if the items they contain are in some way
										"alike". In that context, we usually deal with sets that contain only numbers, only dates, or some such. Useful sets in data management are sets such as {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday} and {true, false}. Without attempting a formal and precise definition of the term, we can (and do) say that a
										Type is such a "useful" set. And a Value is one of the items contained in a Type. Which brings us to :</p>
									<p>
										<b>A Type is a set of Values.</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Additional remarks</i>
									</h4>
									<p>In data management, we will often need to speak about, or refer to, such Types. For that reason, it is customary that all the Types we use are assigned a name. The type {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday}, e.g. could be assigned the name 'Weekdays'. The type {true, false}, e.g. could be
										assigned the name 'Boolean'. Such that we can say :</p>
									<p>
										<b>A Type is a named set of Values.</b>
									</p>
									<p>You might wonder at the mutual dependency in the definition here. A type is a set of values, and a value is an item in a type. In the end, that doesn't really define much, does it ? Shouldn't we have some other definition of what a 'Value' is ? Well, for the purpose of this introduction, that isn't
										really necessary. The reason for this is that the RM (and the algebra) can work with just any set of types. The RM does not "fall apart" if the set of integers is not defined as a type, nor does the algebra. (It would be difficult to build a useful database without that type, but that's another issue.) And
										the most important consequence is that this observation is equally valid "the other way round" : the RM does not stop you from defining whatever type you like. The RM gives you no answer to the question when or why something is a value, and when or why not. As far as the RM is concerned, a value is whatever
										you want it to be, and a type is whatever set you define it to be. It only depends on whether you have a useful purpose for the type or not. A set such as {Em, C, G, ...} might look pretty insane and useless to most readers, but a guitar player would certainly have some good uses for a type holding the guitar
										chords as values ...</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Cartesian product</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>Looking at our example types Weekday and Boolean, it's not difficult to see how one can "pick a value from the first type, then pick a value from the second one, then arrange those two picked values to form a pair.". One example of such a pair would be (Monday, false). There are 10 such pairs possible,
										and those 10 pairs can be gathered into a set. Such a set turns out to be a very important concept in mathematics too, so important in fact that the concept of such a set is given a name : the "Cartesian Product".</p>
									<p>
										<b>The Cartesian product of two sets is the set of all possible pairs formed from the items in those two sets.</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Remarks</i>
									</h4>
									<p>The term "Cartesian product" is not often encountered in the world of RM. The reason for&nbsp;this will become clear in the next few sections. Nevertheless it is worthwhile to reiterate in a more informal manner : A Cartesian product is a set, and the things that we find in that set are "pairs of other
										things", and those "other things" are precisely the things that are part of one of the sets that were used to form the Cartesian product.</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Relation (Traditional mathematics version)</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>Traditional set theory then goes on to define the concept of a "Relation" :</p>
									<p>A Relation is a subset of a Cartesian product of two sets.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Remarks</i>
									</h4>
								</li>
								<p>Examples of such relations are then : {(Monday, false),(Monday, true)}, {}, {(Tuesday, false),(Thursday, true)}, ...</p>
								<p>Once again it is worthwhile to reiterate in a more informal manner : A Relation is a set, and the things that we find in that set are "pairs of other things", and those "other things" are precisely the things that are part of one of the sets that were used to form the Cartesian product of which the
									Relation happens to be a subset.</p>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>
								<i>Generalized product</i>
							</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<h4>
										<i>Definition</i>
									</h4>
									<p>Following this definition, a relation can be (and is indeed) defined as being a set of pairs. For the context of data management problems, this definition isn't so useful, however. Indeed, when recording data about our customers, sales, ..., we usually record a lot more things than just two. So for the
										specific purpose of data management, the concept of a relation had to be "adapted" somewhat ("generalised" is the correct word, actually) to cater for that problem. It is not difficult to see how this can be done : instead of "picking values from two types and arrange those", one can also "pick one value from
										each of any number of types, and arrange those". The set that is formed by …</p></li></ol></li></ol></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p><em>Stephen Brennan • 16 January 2015</em></p><p>It’s easy to view yourself as “not a <em>real</em> programmer.”  There are programs out
there that everyone uses, and it’s easy to put their developers on a pedestal.
Although developing large software projects isn’t easy, many times the basic
idea of that software is quite simple.  Implementing it yourself is a fun way to
show that you have what it takes to be a real programmer.  So, this is a
walkthrough on how I wrote my own simplistic Unix shell in C, in the hopes that
it makes other people feel that way too.</p>

<p>The code for the shell described here, dubbed <code>lsh</code>, is available on
<a href="https://github.com/brenns10/lsh">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><strong>University students beware!</strong> Many classes have assignments that ask you to
write a shell, and some faculty are aware of this tutorial and code.  If you’re
a student in such a class, you shouldn’t copy (or copy then modify) this code
without permission.  And even then, I would <a href="https://brennan.io/2016/03/29/dishonesty/">advise</a> against heavily relying on this tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="basic-lifetime-of-a-shell">Basic lifetime of a shell</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a shell from the top down.  A shell does three main things in its
lifetime.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Initialize</strong>: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its
configuration files.  These change aspects of the shell’s behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpret</strong>: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be
interactive, or a file) and executes them.</li>
  <li><strong>Terminate</strong>: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any
shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.</li>
</ul>

<p>These steps are so general that they could apply to many programs, but we’re
going to use them for the basis for our shell.  Our shell will be so simple that
there won’t be any configuration files, and there won’t be any shutdown command.
So, we’ll just call the looping function and then terminate.  But in terms of
architecture, it’s important to keep in mind that the lifetime of the program is
more than just looping.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>argv</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// Load config files, if any.
</span>
  <span>// Run command loop.
</span>  <span>lsh_loop</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// Perform any shutdown/cleanup.
</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you can see that I just came up with a function, <code>lsh_loop()</code>, that will
loop, interpreting commands.  We’ll see the implementation of that next.</p>

<h2 id="basic-loop-of-a-shell">Basic loop of a shell</h2>

<p>So we’ve taken care of how the program should start up.  Now, for the basic
program logic: what does the shell do during its loop?  Well, a simple way to
handle commands is with three steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read</strong>: Read the command from standard input.</li>
  <li><strong>Parse</strong>: Separate the command string into a program and arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Execute</strong>: Run the parsed command.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I’ll translate those ideas into code for <code>lsh_loop()</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>lsh_loop</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>line</span><span>;</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>args</span><span>;</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span>

  <span>do</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"&gt; "</span><span>);</span>
    <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>lsh_read_line</span><span>();</span>
    <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>lsh_split_line</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
    <span>status</span> <span>=</span> <span>lsh_execute</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>

    <span>free</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
    <span>free</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>status</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s walk through the code.  The first few lines are just declarations.  The
do-while loop is more convenient for checking the status variable, because it
executes once before checking its value.  Within the loop, we print a prompt,
call a function to read a line, call a function to split the line into args, and
execute the args.  Finally, we free the line and arguments that we created
earlier.  Note that we’re using a status variable returned by <code>lsh_execute()</code> to
determine when to exit.</p>

<h2 id="reading-a-line">Reading a line</h2>

<p>Reading a line from stdin sounds so simple, but in C it can be a hassle.  The
sad thing is that you don’t know ahead of time how much text a user will enter
into their shell.  You can’t simply allocate a block and hope they don’t exceed
it.  Instead, you need to start with a block, and if they do exceed it,
reallocate with more space.  This is a common strategy in C, and we’ll use it to
implement <code>lsh_read_line()</code>.</p>

      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first part is a lot of declarations.  If you hadn’t noticed, I prefer to
keep the old C style of declaring variables before the rest of the code.  The
meat of the function is within the (apparently infinite) <code>while (1)</code> loop.  In
the loop, we read a character (and store it as an <code>int</code>, not a <code>char</code>, that’s
important!  EOF is an integer, not a character, and if you want to check for it,
you need to use an <code>int</code>.  This is a common beginner C mistake.).  If it’s the
newline, or EOF, we null terminate our current string and return it.  Otherwise,
we add the character to our existing string.</p>

<p>Next, we see whether the next character will go outside of our current buffer
size.  If so, we reallocate our buffer (checking for allocation errors) before
continuing.  And that’s really it.</p>

<p>Those who are intimately familiar with newer versions of the C library may note
that there is a <code>getline()</code> function in <code>stdio.h</code> that does most of the work we
just implemented.  To be completely honest, I didn’t know it existed until after
I wrote this code.  This function was a GNU extension to the C library until
2008, when it was added to the specification, so most modern Unixes should have
it now.  I’m leaving my existing code the way it is, and I encourage people to
learn it this way first before using <code>getline</code>.  You’d be robbing yourself of a
learning opportunity if you didn’t!  Anyhow, with <code>getline</code>, the function
becomes easier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>lsh_read_line</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ssize_t</span> <span>bufsize</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>// have getline allocate a buffer for us
</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>getline</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>bufsize</span><span>,</span> <span>stdin</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>){</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>feof</span><span>(</span><span>stdin</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_SUCCESS</span><span>);</span>  <span>// We recieved an EOF
</span>    <span>}</span> <span>else</span>  <span>{</span>
      <span>perror</span><span>(</span><span>"readline"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>EXIT_FAILURE</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>line</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not 100% trivial because we still need to check for EOF or errors while
reading. EOF (end of file) means that either we were reading commands from a
text file which we’ve reached the end of, or the user typed Ctrl-D, which
signals end-of-file. Either way, it means we should exit successfully, and if
any other error occurs, we should fail after printing the error.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-the-line">Parsing the line</h2>

<p>OK, so if we look back at the loop, we see that we now have implemented
<code>lsh_read_line()</code>, and we have the line of input.  Now, we need to parse that
line into a list of arguments.  I’m going to make a glaring simplification here,
and say that we won’t allow quoting or backslash escaping in our command line
arguments.  Instead, we will simply use whitespace to separate arguments from
each other.  So the command <code>echo "this message"</code> would not call echo with a
single argument <code>this message</code>, but rather it would call echo with two
arguments: <code>"this</code> and <code>message"</code>.</p>

<p>With those simplifications, all we need to do is “tokenize” the string using
whitespace as delimiters.  That means we can break out the classic library
function <code>strtok</code> to do some of the dirty work for us.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define LSH_TOK_BUFSIZE 64
#define LSH_TOK_DELIM " \t\r\n\a"
</span><span>char</span> <span>**</span><span>lsh_split_line</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>line</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>tokens</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this code looks suspiciously similar to <code>lsh_read_line()</code>, it’s because it
is!  We are using the same strategy of having a buffer and dynamically expanding
it.  But this time, we’re doing it with a null-terminated array of pointers
instead of a null-terminated array of characters.</p>

<p>At the start of the function, we begin tokenizing by calling <code>strtok</code>.  It
returns a pointer to the first token.  What <code>strtok()</code> actually does is return
pointers to within the string you give it, and place <code>\0</code> bytes at the end of
each token.  We store each pointer in an array (buffer) of character
pointers.</p>

<p>Finally, we reallocate the array of pointers if necessary.  The process repeats
until no token is returned by <code>strtok</code>, at which point we null-terminate the
list of tokens.</p>

<p>So, once all is said and done, we have an array of tokens, ready to execute.
Which begs the question, how do we do that?</p>



<p>Now, we’re really at the heart of what a shell does.  Starting processes is the
main function of shells.  So writing a shell means that you need to know exactly
what’s going on with processes and how they start.  That’s why I’m going to take
us on a short diversion to discuss processes in Unix.</p>

<p>There are only two ways of starting processes on Unix.  The first one (which
almost doesn’t count) is by being Init.  You see, when a Unix computer boots,
its kernel is loaded.  Once it is loaded and initialized, the kernel starts only
one process, which is called Init.  This process runs for the entire length of
time that the computer is on, and it manages loading up the rest of the
processes that you need for your computer to be useful.</p>

<p>Since most programs aren’t Init, that leaves only one practical way for
processes to get started: the <code>fork()</code> system call.  When …</p></div></div>

    <p>The rise of tooling for vulnerability detection combined with pressure driven by Vendor Due Diligence is causing a massive enterprise freezeout for non-mainstream technologies across the board. Of particular concern is the impact this will have on the adoption of functional programming in enterprise and small business B2B development.</p>

<p>I see now that the last 10 years were “easy mode” for the growth of new programming tools and infrastructure, with many new breakthrough technologies seeing rapid adoption. Languages like Node, Go and to some degree Scala saw breakaway success, not to mention all of the new cloud tech, NoSQL tech, containerization and data processing platforms along with their custom query DSLs. Other languages like Haskell saw success in small companies and skunkworks style teams solving very difficult problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-rise-of-vulnerability-scanning">The Rise of Vulnerability Scanning</h3>

<p>Just this past year I’ve come to see we’re in the middle of a massive change across the industry. There are new forces at play which will calcify current software stacks and make it extremely hard for existing or new entrants to see similar success without a massive coordinated push backed by big enterprise companies. This force is the rise of InfoSec and vulnerability detection tooling.</p>

<p>Tools like <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools">Blackduck, WhiteSource, Checkmarx, Veracode</a> are exploding in popularity, there are too many to list and many variations on the same theme. In the wake of so many data leaks and hacking events enterprises no longer trust their developers and SREs to take care of security, and so protocols are being implemented top down. This isn’t just on the code scanning side, there is a similar set of things going on with network scanning as well which impacts programming languages less, but similarly will calcify server stacks.</p>

<p>These tools are quickly making their way into SOC2 and SDLC policies across industry, and if your language or new infrastructure tool isn’t supported by them there’s little chance you will get the previously already tenuous approval to use them. This sets the already high bar for adoption much higher. As you might expect, vendors will only implement support for languages that meet some threshold for profitability of their tools. Not only do you need to build a modern set of tools for your language to compete, now you also need support from external vendors.</p>

<h3 id="vendor-due-diligence">Vendor Due Diligence</h3>

<p>Maybe we just cede this territory to enterprise tools with big backers like Microsoft and Oracle, we never more than a few small inroads anyway. The use of these tools is arguably a good thing overall for software security. Unfortunately, the problem cannot be sidestepped so easily, and I’m afraid this is where things look very bleak. The biggest new trend is in enforcement of these tools through Vendor Due Diligence.</p>

<p>You may not be familiar with Vendor Due Diligence if you aren’t in a manager role. The basic idea is your customer will send you a long list of technical questions about your product which you must fill out to their satisfaction before they buy your product or service. In the B2B space where I work these lists are nothing new, but have been getting longer and longer over the last 10 years, now often numbering in the hundreds of questions.</p>

<p>Most recently I’ve seen more and more invasive questions being asked, some even going into how teams are organized, but important to this article is that across the board they now all ask about vulnerability scanning and now often request specific outputs for well-known vulnerability scanning tools. The implication being that if you’re not scanning with these tools they won’t buy your software, and the list of supported languages is small.</p>

<p>Any experienced technology manager sees the natural tradeoff here. When it comes down to making money versus using cool tech, cool tech will lose every time. You’re just burning money if you’re building cool things with cool tech if you know no one will buy it.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-now">So What Now?</h3>

<p>Potentially we will see a resurgence of “compile-to” functional programming with mainstream language targets to sidestep the issue. I suppose though that the extra build complexity and problems debugging will prevent this from ever being mainstream, not to mention that the vulnerability tools look for specific patterns and likely won’t behave well on generated code.</p>

<p>There is some hope in the form of projects like SonarCube which enables users to come together and <a href="https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-custom-plugin-example">build custom plugins</a>. Will functional programming communities come together to build and maintain such boring tech? I somewhat doubt it. This kind of work is not what most programmers would choose to do in their off time. Similarly, vulnerability detection is unlikely to be a good target to be advanced a little at a time with academic papers. It would take true functional programming fanatics to build companies or tools dedicated to the cause. If you are interested in helping out, pay attention to the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top 10</a> as this list drives focus for many infosec teams.</p>

<p>Where does this leave us? If our communities do nothing then smaller B2B software operations focused mom and pop shops or consumer focused web applications likely won’t see any impact unless static analysis makes it into data protection law. Beyond these use cases FP will be relegated to tiny boxes on the back end where vulnerabilities are much less of a concern and the mathematical skills of functional programmers can bring extreme amounts of value.</p>

<p>I know there are many deeper facets I didn’t cover here, if you want to continue the discussion <a href="https://twitter.com/rickasaurus/status/1300487826782420995">join the thread on twitter</a>.</p>

we'd like it to be. As part of the article, Tratt discusses how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent parsers</a> have a
number of issues in practice and recommends using other things,
such as a LR parser generator.</p>

<p>I have a long standing interest in parsing, I'm reasonably well
aware of the annoyances of recursive descent parsers (although some
of the issues Tratt raised hadn't occurred to me before now), and
I've been exposed to parser generators like Yacc. Despite that, my
normal approach to parsing any new little language for real is to
write a recursive descent parser in whatever language I'm using,
and Tratt's article is not going to change that. My choice here is
for entirely pragmatic reasons, because to me recursive descent
parsers generally have two significant advantages over all other
real parsers.</p>

<p>The first advantage is that almost always, a recursive descent parser
is the only or at least easiest form of parser you can readily create
using only the language's standard library and tooling. In particular,
parsing LR, LALR, and similar formal grammars generally requires you to
find, select, and install a parser generator tool (or more rarely, an
additional package). Very few languages ship their standard environment
with a parser generator (or a lexer, which is often required in some
form by the parser).</p>

<p>(The closest I know of is C on Unix, where you will almost always
find some version of lex and yacc. Not entirely coincidentally,
I've used lex and yacc to write a parser in C, although a long time
ago.)</p>

<p>By contrast, a recursive descent parser is just code in the language.
You can obviously write that in any language, and you can build a
little lexer to go along with it that's custom fitted to your
particular recursive descent parser and your language's needs.  This
also leads to the second significant advantage, which is that if
you write a recursive descent parser, you don't need to learn a new
language, the language of the parser generator, and also learn how
to hook that new language to the language of your program, and then
debug the result. Your entire recursive descent parser (and your
entire lexer) are written in one language, the language you're
already working in.</p>

<p>If I was routinely working in a language that had a well respected
de facto standard parser generator and lexer, and regularly building
parsers for little languages for my programs, it would probably be
worth mastering these tools. The time and effort required to do so
would be more than paid back in the end, and I would probably have
a higher quality grammar too (Tratt points out how recursive descent
parsers hide ambiguity, for example). But in practice I bounce back
and forth between two languages right now (Go and Python, neither
of which have such a standard parser ecology), and I don't need to
write even a half-baked parser all that often. So writing another
recursive descent parser using my standard process for this has
been the easiest way to do it every time I needed one.</p>

<p>(I've developed a standard process for writing recursive descent
parsers that makes the whole thing pretty mechanical, but that's a
discussion for another entry or really a series of them.)</p>

<p>PS: I can't comment about how easy it is to generate good error
messages in modern parser generators, because I haven't used any
of them. My experience with my own recursive descent parsers is
that it's generally straightforward to get decent error messages
for the style of languages that I create, and usually simple to
tweak the result to give clearer errors in some specific situations

<hr>





<p>I value transparency a lot, especially when it comes to the bug bounty space. Bug bounty hunters all around the world are submitting a range of reports where the issues found span across multiple domains, often leveraging numerous techniques and methodologies. However, if you’re not already an active bug bounty hunter who has a good understanding of what a bounty program expects, or will pay out for, you have a major disadvantage compared to someone who does have this knowledge. I hope through this blog post, I can demystify the sort of issues bug bounty programs pay for.</p>

<p>The last blog post I did in this series was around four years ago, <a href="https://shubs.io/high-frequency-security-bug-hunting-120-days-120-bugs/">120 days, 120 bugs</a>. In the last four years, a lot has happened. I moved to Europe for six months, I moved interstate in Australia twice, I won a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VojwIY4GL-4">live hacking event</a>, I co-founded a company and helped build an <a href="https://assetnote.io/">attack surface management platform</a> with a team of people I consider family.</p>

<p>Unlike my previous blog post, I did not set myself a goal to find a bug a day. Instead, I participated in bug bounties whenever time allowed. There were many months where I found nothing at all, which often terrified me when it came to evaluating my self worth as a hacker. I also admitted to myself, that I might be a good hacker, but there is always going to be a better hacker out there, and I’ve made my peace with that as a hyper-competitve person.</p>

<p>If you don’t have an excellent understanding of fundamental application security <a href="http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246978/Threat%20Classification">attacks and weaknesses</a> before you approach bug bounties, in my opinion, you are wasting your time. <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security">Practice and learn more here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a paid, more extensive resource, check out and practice with <a href="https://pentesterlab.com/">PentesterLab</a>.</p>

<p>Participating so heavily in bug bounties has given us the knowledge at Assetnote about what security teams <em>actually</em> care about. It’s the reason we can maintain high signal when we are continuously finding exposures.</p>

<p>My primary motivation for this blog post is to educate the masses on what bug bounty programs are paying out for.</p>

<p>For example, would you know that you could submit a dangling EC2 IP (subdomain pointing to an EC2 IP that is no longer owned by the company) as a bug report without reading the proof in the pudding below? I’ve been paid for this by programs, so clearly they value this sort of information.</p>

<p>Below are all of my findings for the last four years. I’ve redacted information where necessary, but by reading the titles, it should give you a good understanding of what I was reporting to programs.</p>

27 Mar 2017

</span></p><p>It’s been about almost two years since we shipped the first version of <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2015/06/create-all-new-worlds-with-smooth-terrain/">smooth voxel terrain</a> at <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a>, and with it being live for a while and seeing a lot of incremental improvements I wanted to write about the internals of the technology - this feature required implementing serialization, network replication, collision detection, ray casting, rendering and in-memory storage support and within each area some implementation details ended up being quite interesting. Today we’ll talk about voxel definition and storage.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-voxel">What’s in a voxel?</h2>

<p>Whenever you design a voxel system you have to answer a basic question - what defines a voxel? We wanted our terrain to implicitly define a mostly smooth surface with each point on the surface having a material value, so we could use some kind of contouring algorithm to generate polygons from the surface. Since it was important to have control over the surface in 3 dimensions (heightfield would not cut it), we needed to define the data that represents the surface. During a prototyping phase a few options became clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Material. In this model we’d store just a material (an enum value) per voxel, and rely on neighboring voxels to construct the surface.</li>
  <li>Signed distance field. In this model we’d store the distance to the surface from the center of the voxel, with sign determining whether the center is outside or inside. This is a very well known model that’s frequently used to drive algorithms like Marching Cubes. We would also store the material per voxel.</li>
  <li>Hermite data. In this model instead of storing data about voxels, you store data about the intersections between surface and grid edges. Assuming the surface only intersects each voxel edge at most once, you have to store a bit for every edge that defines whether surface intersects this edge, an intersection point (which is defined by a 0..1 scalar), surface normal at the intersection point and the material at the vertices.</li>
  <li>Occupancy. In this model we’d store a material and the occupancy which defines the amount of matter around the voxel center - 0 meaning roughly that the voxel is completely empty and 1 meaning that the voxel is full.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://zeux.io/images/voxstorage_1.png" alt="Voxel models"></p>

<p>We experimented with the material model and rejected it because it did not give us enough flexibility for tools - our voxels had to be pretty big for the solution to be practical for low end platforms, and thus we needed to be able to represent sub-voxel information (for example, to have a tool that can “erode” terrain on a scale much finer than a voxel size).</p>

<p>Hermite data was very interesting - you could build pretty rich tooling based on boolean operations and allow a fine control over smoothness of the surface. However, what wasn’t clear was how we would present this to developers in a form of API. We felt like CSG-based API such as “subtract a sphere out of terrain” was not sufficient - how do you implement a smoothing tool if this is all you have? - and we wanted to give our developers an API that allows full control over the terrain data such that you can implement any tool with it (in fact, all our existing terrain manipulation tools are using the public terrain API and are written in Lua). We didn’t feel like exposing raw Hermite data was an option due to its complexity so we had to discard this approach.</p>

<p>Signed distance field was more expressive than occupancy model, but ultimately resulted in similarly looking content and ended up having a more complicated mental model (how do I fill voxels that are far away from the surface? Does it even matter? How is the distance clamped? etc.) so we did not feel like it was worth the tradeoff.</p>

<p>Thus we settled on the occupancy model, where every voxel would be defined by a material and occupancy pair. Our definition of occupancy is a bit peculiar because due to how our meshing algorithm works matter “overflows” from one voxel to another - occupancy 1 does not mean that the voxel looks like a cube, rather it just means that the voxel has as much matter as it can possibly contain. By discarding the Hermite model we lost an ability to precisely define sharp edges on the surface, which we decided to reclaim by using the material value - in addition to the texture that is applied the material also defines how terrain is shaped around the voxel; thus what defines geometry is the material and occupancy in the voxel and in voxel’s neighborhood. A screenshot from an early prototype shows how different materials with the same occupancy data can produce very different results:</p>

<p><img src="https://zeux.io/images/voxstorage_2.jpg" alt="Material based shaping"></p>

<h2 id="memory-format">Memory format</h2>

<p>To represent a voxel, you need a material (which is an enum) and occupancy (which is a floating-point value in 0..1 range). Material storage is straightforward - we just store an index into the material table, which currently has 23 entries. To conserve space, we store occupancy as a quantized 8-bit value, which adds up to two bytes per voxel.</p>

<p>In a material-occupancy definition there is inherent ambiguity in terms of empty voxel representation - you can define it as occupancy = 0 but then the material choice does not matter; or you can define it as material = air but then the occupancy does not matter. We chose the model with an explicit <code>Air</code> material, and we decode occupancy as <code>(value + 1) / 256.0</code> for non-air materials and 0.0 for air materials (which means that the occupancy is precisely represented in a floating point number which is not true for decoding methods like <code>value / 255.0</code>). Voxels with material = <code>Air</code> and occupancy != 0 are not valid; we make sure they never appear in the grid with simple branchless code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// make sure occupancy is always 0 for Air material (0)</span>
<span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>material</span><span>;</span>
<span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>occupancy</span> <span>=</span> <span>occupancy</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span><span>static_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>material</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>31</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we originally developed the system, we decided to settle on a simple sparse storage format: all voxels would be stored in chunks 32x32x32 with each chunk represented as a linear 3D array (since each voxel needs two bytes for storage, this adds up to 64 KB per chunk; we also experimented with 16x16x16 chunks but the difference wasn’t very noticeable), and the entire voxel grid is simply a hash map, mapping the index of the chunk to the chunk contents itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>HashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Vector3int32</span><span>,</span> <span>Chunk</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>chunks</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s worth noting that we needed a sparse unbounded storage because our worlds do not have set size limits and you can use voxel content at any point; of course, voxel access in a local region needed to be very fast. A simple two-level storage scheme (hash map + 3D array) turned out to work really well for this - it’s simple to implement and reason about, and provides an easy way to trade “sparseness” for increased locality by adjusting chunk size. We ended up using this way of storing voxel data throughout the entire engine, with individual systems adjusting the chunk size to match the expected workload better (storage uses 32^3 chunks, network uses 16^3 chunks for initial replication and 4^3 chunks for updates, physics uses 8^3 chunks, rendering first used 32x16x32 chunks and later switched to chunks that increase in size from 16^3 up to 256^3 voxels).</p>

<p>Inside the chunk we ended up storing several 3D arrays - we call a 3D array of voxels “box” - of different sizes, forming a mipmap pyramid for our voxel content. We have 32^3 Box for the original content, and 16^3, 8^3 and 4^3 mipmaps that contain downsampled voxel data. The extra storage cost of mipmaps ends up being negligible, and the small penalty that we take for updating the mip levels when writing voxels to the voxel grid is well worth it considering that we are using them for Level Of Detail which allows us to render a lot fewer triangles in the distance, as well as for some other optimizations. The downsample algorithm that we use guarantees that if a voxel at a certain level of mip pyramid is filled with <code>Air</code>, all voxels corresponding to this area in the upper levels of the pyramid are also filled with <code>Air</code> - for example, if the bottom mip level has all 64 voxels empty then the entire chunk is empty.</p>

<h2 id="disk-format">Disk format</h2>

<p>When it comes to storing voxels on disk, we wanted a more compact representation than a 3D array. There are a lot of ways to store voxels - we needed an encoding scheme that stored voxels as bytes (without any cross-byte bit packing to avoid efficiency loss of a byte-level lossless compressor - we usually take the encoded voxels and compress them further with LZ4), was reasonably efficient on the types of content we see frequently, and was simple - we could always upgrade the format later if we needed to spend more time doing it.</p>

<p>Our previous experiments in voxel technology suggested that if you take each chunk and do RLE compression on it, efficiently representing runs of voxels with the same contents, it resulted in pretty good compression rates and pretty efficient compression code. Remember, we don’t need to be optimal - we need to compress data to reduce it in size for storage efficiency, but we do frequently have a LZ codec running on top of that. Running RLE before LZ may seem counter-intuitive, but it significantly reduces the size of data making LZ faster, and in some cases means you don’t even need to do LZ compression because RLE on its own is enough - voxel data is frequently very regular.</p>

<p>An additional quirk is that each voxel in our system occupies two bytes; we wanted to have a more compact baseline representation so that even if RLE can’t find runs of sufficient length we still end up with a smaller file. A key realization is that many voxels are completely solid - if you imagine a mountain built from voxels, usually all interior voxels in the mountain only carry material information (that is still meaningful in case you want to dig a hole through the mountain later) - occupancy is usually 1 for these cells. Similarly, for <code>Air</code> we <em>never</em> need to store occupancy - it’s always zero! With this and RLE in mind, here’s the encoding we came up with:</p>

<p>Each run of voxels starts with a byte that …</p></div></div>

<p>It is 2020, and we can say for sure, that <em>ssh-server</em> is still one of the most popular services on Linux systems. During various meetings, I was often asked: <em>How to secure SSH?&nbsp; </em>Even though this question seems trivial, it is not. There are a lot of things to remember to accomplish well-designed service security. Secure shell is used not only for a remote-shell, <em>per se</em>. Many other technologies depend on it, for various reasons. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Git to download and push the code.&nbsp;<span id="eb462557-2983-4179-9c24-ea9a947c5da3" data-items="[&quot;2050246254&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[1]​</span></li><li>Ansible to apply tasks. <span id="d575a00a-c8b1-4fb1-89ce-1e71d53d95d8" data-items="[&quot;2756985050&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[2]​</span></li><li>Cloudera for installation procedures. <span id="51d860cf-fd45-4b09-b73b-ca4df154d347" data-items="[&quot;1280041206&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[3]​</span><br>(Do not ask us, we do not understand it too.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>I have decided to answer the above question once and forever, and always refer to this document, trying to keep it up-date and consistent with current security practices. The purpose of this post is to answer the question: <em>How to secure SSH?</em> It is a comprehensive document for <em>infosec</em> and <em>devops</em> teams, that will guide them through all known best-practices and hardening rules.</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>This paragraph focuses on secure-shell server risks assesment, hardening practices and configuration best-practices. The server configuration is mostly put at <code>/etc/sshd/sshd_config</code>. </p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Contest the need&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The first and the most basic question the Reader should ask himself: <em>Is there even a need for an OpenSSH server at all, for my specific use-case?</em> At the time of writing this article, it is not uncommon to build fully declarative, golden-image infrastructures. We have a wide set of serverless services and technologies that only run a process inside the container. I would say, for sure, that the majority of the infrastructures we, as @sysdogs, provision for our customers, do not have <em>OpenSSH</em> enabled at all. (You can always <a href="https://sysdogs.com/contact/">contact us</a>, if you want to know, how we do it.) </p>
<p>Another perfect example for disabled ssh-server is a local-workstation.<br>There is no need for a secure-shell server on a local laptop, for instance.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Management interfaces-only</h3>
<p>While reading a variety of resources, like <em>Security Technical Implementation Guidelines</em>, they always mark&nbsp; access management as the most crucial part, and top priority. It is required to bind the server only to the interface that is trusted.</p>
<ul><li>For Enterprise infrastructures virtual-machines can have their own management interface with proper <code>firewalld</code> rules. <span id="ff61a54c-2d19-493d-a01c-883274db1866" data-items="[&quot;3975247616&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[4]​</span></li><li>For virtual private servers, we can align this rule to the trusted subset of public addresses that are whitelisted in the firewall.&nbsp;</li><li>In the Cloud environments, we can build a specific security group that defines the access to the server or use other cloud services, like DigitalOcean Firewall. ​<span id="bbb71312-611f-4a8e-9184-57aaeccfafcd" data-items="[&quot;1459351913&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[5]​</span> <span id="8a1875df-b48b-4a34-ad28-5c296e754e33" data-items="[&quot;4020271495&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[6]​</span></li></ul>

<h3>Mandatory Access Control – SELinux</h3>
<p>I am the guy, that would do <code>setenforce 1</code> even if it was already set to <code>1</code>.<br>Just in case. To be sure. Being absolutely honest, I strongly believe SELinux is one of the most helpful services in the Linux world to improve and harden your operating system.</p>
<p>I have read a lot of documentations and tutorials that recommend the end-user to disable SELinux or AppArmor. I completely understand their authors. They told you to do that, because it simplifies the process of software installation and removes the burden of hardening. On the other hand, I fully believe it is like getting your house alarm wrongly configured, getting upset because of the false-positives, then disabling it for the good feeling of yourself.</p>

<h3>Use <code>Protocol 2</code></h3>
<p>Sincerely, I have never seen any <em>secure-shell</em> server with enabled <code>Protocol&nbsp;1</code>. To maintain the state of the art and comprehensiveness of this article, it is important to note it here, that it is insecure and it is not recommended to use <code>Protocol 1</code>.&nbsp; It has a set of vulnerabilities and problems with security. <code>Protocol 1</code> support was removed in RHEL7.4.</p>

<h3>Use <code>tcp/22</code></h3>
<p>I have seen a lot of write-ups that recommend using a different port than <code>tcp/22</code>. I completely disagree with this argument.&nbsp; It is not very difficult to scan all possible ports on the target.&nbsp; Secondly, security by obscurity <strong>always</strong> leads to something weird. By definition, OpenSSH always presents itself first. Last, but not least; using SELinux, you are forced to run the secure-shell server on <code>tcp/22</code>.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;Do not use <code>tcpwrapperd</code></h3>
<p>A set of known Linux websites still recommend using tcp-wrappers as another security layer for sshd. I think it is wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The very first argument for that is that <code>tcpwrappers</code> seems to be a deprecated technology. <span id="974356e0-6dbc-4a2e-8917-dbf1fd443e41" data-items="[&quot;2776761352&quot;]" contenteditable="false">​[7]​</span> It was released over 20 years ago (8 April 1997) and does not seem to be developed anymore. Another factor is that, through this deprecation, maintenance of another security layer, may in paradox add another attack vector for the system and networking.&nbsp; The modern firewalls, intrusion detection systems and possibilities of isolation may completely replace tcp-wrappers functionalities. In the end, fresh operating systems do not link <code>libwrapd</code> to <code>sshd</code>.</p>

That being said, I do only see enabling this as another vector of possible attack, and risk to omit firewalls.</p>
<p>Port-forwarding is the functionality that allows the client to bind local-port to a remote address. It is a very straight and easy way to omit and skip firewall-rules and break compliance.</p>
<p>Agent forwarding is a mechanism of pass</p>
<p><code><strong>Listing.</strong></code> Configuration parameters to disable forwarding.</p>
<pre><code>X11Forwarding no
AllowTcpForwarding no
AllowAgentForwarding no</code></pre>

<h3><strong>Minimize <code>MaxSessions</code> and <code>MaxAuthTries</code></strong></h3>
<p>The authorised user should not have any difficulties with logging in successfully.. Of course, there are exceptions to that statement, but, in general, it is safe to assume it should be completely sufficient to have two tries during one connection session. In contrast, the attacker trying to apply brute-force attacks needs as much login tries as possible. Therefore, i think we can all agree, minimizing <code>MaxAuthTries</code> is a good way of hardening.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A lot of thanks goes to <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/about">Amos</a> for inspiring this article with <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust">A half-hour to learn Rust</a>. I thought I'd try it out, but instead of Rust, this article will try to explain Go in half an hour.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on one or two concepts, I'll try to go through as many Go snippets as I can, and explain what the keywords and symbols they contain mean. This article can be used as a cheat sheet for developers familiar with Go, or a tutorial for developers new to Go, but familiar with other languages.</p>
<p>Ready? Go!</p>
<h4 id="packages"><a href="#packages" aria-label="packages permalink"></a><strong>Packages</strong></h4>
<p>Every Go program is made up of packages,</p>
<p>Programs start by running in package <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>You can use external packages by importing them:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can use exported names in an imported package by using the package name as a qualifier:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>"fmt"</span>
  <span>"math/rand"</span>
<span>)</span>

fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"My favorite number is"</span><span>,</span> rand<span>.</span><span>Intn</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can create a local alias for any import:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
  formatter <span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

formatter<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Or use a dot to access it without any qualifier:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>.</span> <span>"math/rand"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>Intn</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>A name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. This is similar to <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> in other languages:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>x <span>:=</span> <span>"hello"</span> 
A <span>:=</span> <span>"hello"</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Packages can have an <code>init</code> function. This will be executed as soon as the package is imported:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>performSideEffects</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="scope"><a href="#scope" aria-label="scope permalink"></a><strong>Scope</strong></h4>
<p>A pair of brackets declares a block, which has its own scope:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  x <span>:=</span> <span>"out"</span>
  <span>{</span>
    
    x <span>:=</span> <span>"in"</span>
    <span>println</span><span>(</span>x<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>x<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A variable defined outside of any function is considered "global". If capitalized, it can be accessed by other packages:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>package</span> mypackage

<span>var</span> Global <span>string</span> <span>=</span> <span>"I am a global variable!"</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="variables"><a href="#variables" aria-label="variables permalink"></a><strong>Variables</strong></h4>
<p><code>var</code> declares a variable of a given type:</p>

<p>This can also be written as a single line:</p>

<p>You can specify a variable's type implicitly:</p>

<p>Inside of a function body, this can also be written in short form:</p>

<p>You can declare many variables at the same time:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> x<span>,</span> y <span>int</span>
x<span>,</span> y <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>20</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you declare a variable without initializing it, it will implicitly be assigned to the zero value of its type:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> b <span>bool</span>
<span>var</span> x <span>int</span>
<span>var</span> y <span>string</span>
<span>var</span> z <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>int</span>

<span>println</span><span>(</span>b<span>)</span> 
<span>println</span><span>(</span>x<span>)</span> 
<span>println</span><span>(</span>y<span>)</span> 
<span>println</span><span>(</span>z<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<h4 id="type-conversions"><a href="#type-conversions" aria-label="type conversions permalink"></a><strong>Type Conversions</strong></h4>
<p>You can convert values between different types:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> f <span>float64</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> 
i <span>:=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span>f<span>)</span>       </code></pre></div>
<p>Note that this must be done explicitly. Unlike other languages, you cannot pass an <code>int</code> as a <code>float</code> argument and depend on an implicit conversion by the compiler.</p>
<h4 id="constants"><a href="#constants" aria-label="constants permalink"></a><strong>Constants</strong></h4>
<p>Unchanging values can be declared with the <code>const</code> keyword. Constants can be characters, strings, booleans, or numeric values:</p>

<p>You can group the declaration of multiple constants or variables:</p>

<h4 id="iota"><a href="#iota" aria-label="iota permalink"></a><strong>Iota</strong></h4>
<p>The <code>iota</code> keyword represents successive integer constants:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>(</span>
  zero <span>=</span> <span>iota</span>
  one  <span>=</span> <span>iota</span>
  two  <span>=</span> <span>iota</span>
<span>)</span>
fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>zero<span>,</span> one<span>,</span> two<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This can be written in short form:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>(</span>
  zero <span>=</span> <span>iota</span>
  one
  two
<span>)</span>
fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>zero<span>,</span> one<span>,</span> two<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>You can perform operations on an iota:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>(</span>
  four <span>=</span> <span>iota</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span>
  five
  six
<span>)</span>

fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>four<span>,</span> five<span>,</span> six<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>And use the blank identifier to skip a value:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>(</span>
  zero <span>=</span> <span>iota</span>
  <span>_</span>    
  two
  three
<span>)</span>
fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>zero<span>,</span> two<span>,</span> three<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Iota's are most commonly used to represent enums, which Go does not support natively.</p>
<h4 id="the-blank-identifier"><a href="#the-blank-identifier" aria-label="the blank identifier permalink"></a><strong>The Blank Identifier</strong></h4>
<p>The blank identifier <code>_</code> is an anonymous placeholder. It basically means to throw away something:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
<span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>42</span>



<span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>getThing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can use it to import a package solely for its <code>init</code> function:</p>

<p>Or to avoid compiler errors during development:</p>

<h4 id="looping"><a href="#looping" aria-label="looping permalink"></a><strong>Looping</strong></h4>
<p>Go has only one loop, the <code>for</code> loop. It has three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The init statement: executed before the first iteration</li>
<li>The condition: evaluated before every iteration</li>
<li>The post statement: executed at the end of every iteration</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>sum <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span> <span>{</span>
  sum <span>++</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The init and post statements are optional:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
yup <span>:=</span> <span>true</span>
<span>for</span> yup <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"yup!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>An infinite for loop can also be written like this:</p>

<p>You can use break to <code>break</code> out of a loop:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>shouldBreak</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>break</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And <code>continue</code> to skip to the next iteration</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>for</span> i <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>if</span> i <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>continue</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="control-flow"><a href="#control-flow" aria-label="control flow permalink"></a><strong>Control Flow</strong></h4>
<p>Go's <code>if</code> statements have a similar syntax to its loops:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
<span>if</span> <span>1</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>if</code> conditions can also have an init statement:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>
<span>if</span> x <span>:=</span> <span>"hello"</span><span>;</span> x <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>x<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Go also has <code>else</code> and <code>else if</code> statements:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>if</span> something <span>{</span>
  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> somethingElse <span>{</span>
  <span>doSomethingElse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If your <code>if - else</code> statement is getting long, switch to a <code>switch</code> statement :)</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>switch</span> <span>{</span>
<span>case</span> something<span>:</span>
  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>case</span> somethingElse <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span><span>:</span>
  <span>doSomethingElse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>default</span><span>:</span>
  <span>return</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also switch on a condition:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>switch</span> x <span>:=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span> x <span>{</span>

<span>case</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span>
  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

<span>case</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span>
  <span>doSomethingElse</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

<span>default</span><span>:</span>
  <span>return</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can use <code>fallthrough</code> to fall through to the case below the current case:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>switch</span> <span>1</span> <span>{</span>
<span>case</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"1"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>fallthrough</span>
<span>case</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"2"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>In a switch statement, only the first matched case is executed.</p>
<p>Go also has <em>labels</em> to help manage control flow:</p>

<p>You can jump to a specific label with the <code>goto</code> keyword:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>


<span>goto</span> Three
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>

Three<span>:</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Labels have a very specific use case. They can make code less readable and should be avoided most of the time.</p>
<h4 id="arrays"><a href="#arrays" aria-label="arrays permalink"></a><strong>Arrays</strong></h4>
<p>In Go, arrays have a fixed length:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> a <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>string</span> 
a<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>
a<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"World"</span>
<span>println</span><span>(</span>a<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>You create arrays using <em>array literals</em>:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>helloWorld <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>,</span> <span>"World"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You cannot increase an array beyond its capacity. Doing so will panic:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>helloWorld <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>,</span> <span>"World"</span><span>}</span>
helloWorld<span>[</span><span>10</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Space"</span>


</code></pre></div>
<p>To get around this issue, Go provides slices.</p>
<h4 id="slices"><a href="#slices" aria-label="slices permalink"></a><strong>Slices</strong></h4>
<p>Slices are more common than arrays. They do not have a fixed length, and are therefore more flexible:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Slices can also be created with the built-in function <code>make</code>:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>make</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> initialLength<span>)</span>


<span>make</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> initialLength<span>,</span> initialCapacity<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also create a slice by <em>slicing</em> an existing array:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>}</span>
s <span>:=</span> nums<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>:</span><span>4</span><span>]</span>

fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>s<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can omit the start or end index when slicing an array, so for this array:</p>

<p>These expressions are equivalent:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>a<span>[</span><span>:</span><span>]</span>
a<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>:</span><span>]</span>
a<span>[</span><span>:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
a<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Modifying the elements of a slice will modify its underlying array:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>6</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>}</span>

s <span>:=</span> nums<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>:</span><span>4</span><span>]</span>
s<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>999</span>

fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>nums<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Slices are just a fancy way to manage an underlying array. You cannot increase a slice beyond its capacity. Doing so will panic, just like with an array:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>}</span>
nums<span>[</span><span>20</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>9</span>


</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Go has built-in functions to make slices feel like arrays, such as the <code>append</code> function, which can be used to add items to the end of a slice:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>}</span>
nums <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span>nums<span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>)</span>

fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>nums<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can iterate over slices and arrays with <code>range</code>:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>names <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>"john"</span><span>,</span> <span>"joe"</span><span>,</span> <span>"jessica"</span><span>}</span>
<span>for</span> index<span>,</span> name <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> names <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>index<span>,</span> name<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>



</code></pre></div>
<p>We can use the blank identifier to omit the index or the value from <code>range</code>:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> name <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> names


<span>for</span> index<span>,</span> <span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> names
<span>for</span> index <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> names</code></pre></div>
<p>Slices are more complicated than they seem. To understand the inner workings of slices and arrays in detail, check out: <a href="https://blog.golang.org/slices-intro">Go Slices: Usage and Internals</a></p>
<h4 id="maps"><a href="#maps" aria-label="maps permalink"></a><strong>Maps</strong></h4>
<p>Maps are like hashes in ruby or dictionaries in python. You create them like this:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> m <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span>
m<span>[</span><span>"key"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"value"</span>

x <span>=</span> m<span>[</span><span>"key"</span><span>]</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Or with a <em>map literal</em>:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>m <span>:=</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"one"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"two"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or the <code>make</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>m <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can delete map keys:</p>

<p>Check whether a key is present:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> m <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>string</span>
m<span>[</span><span>"key"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"value"</span>

x<span>,</span> ok <span>=</span> m<span>[</span><span>"key"</span><span>]</span> 
x<span>,</span> ok <span>=</span> m<span>[</span><span>"doesnt-exist"</span><span>]</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>And range over their keys and values:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>var</span> m <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span><span>string</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"one"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"two"</span><span>}</span>
<span>for</span> key<span>,</span> value <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> names <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>key<span>,</span> value<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>


</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="functions"><a href="#functions" aria-label="functions permalink"></a><strong>Functions</strong></h4>
<p><code>func</code> declares a function.</p>
<p>Here's a void function:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hi there!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And here's a function that returns an integer:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>fairDiceRoll</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>4</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Functions can return multiple values:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>oneTwoThree</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>They can also take specified arguments:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>sayHello</span><span>(</span>name <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  fmt<span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"hello %s"</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or an arbitrary number of arguments:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>variadic</span><span>(</span>nums <span>...</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>nums<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These are called <em>Variadic Functions</em>. They can be called just like regular functions:</p>

<p>Or you can pass in a slice directly:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>nums <span>:=</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>int</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>}</span>
<span>variadic</span><span>(</span>nums<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>If a function takes two or more arguments of the same type, you can group them together:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>multiply</span><span>(</span>x<span>,</span> y <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> x <span>*</span> y
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>defer</code> statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>defer</span> fmt<span>.</span><span>Print</span><span>(</span><span>"world"</span><span>)</span>
fmt<span>.</span><span>Print</span><span>(</span><span>"hello "</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Defer is often used with an anonymous function:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>defer</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"I'm done!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="anonymous-functions"><a href="#anonymous-functions" aria-label="anonymous functions permalink"></a><strong>Anonymous Functions</strong></h4>
<p>Go supports anonymous functions. Anonymous functions are useful when you want to define a function inline without having to name it:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>printNumber</span><span>(</span>getNum <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  num <span>:=</span> <span>getNum</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>println</span><span>(</span>num<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

one <span>:=</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>return</span> <span>1</span> 
<span>}</span>
<span>printNumber</span><span>(</span>one<span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>A function can also return an anonymous function:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>getOne</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

one <span>:=</span> <span>getOne</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>println</span><span>(</span><span>one</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> 

</code></pre></div>
<p>Anonymous functions allow us to dynamically change what a function does at runtime:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>DoStuff <span>:=</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Doing stuff!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>DoStuff</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

DoStuff <span>=</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Doing other stuff."</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>DoStuff</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>


</code></pre></div>
<p>Anonymous functions can form <em>closures</em>. A closure is an anonymous function that references a variable from outside itself:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>n <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>
counter <span>:=</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  n <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>return</span> n
<span>}</span>
<span>println</span><span>(</span><span>counter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>println</span><span>(</span><span>counter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>


</code></pre></div>
<p>Note how <code>counter</code> has access to <code>n</code>, even though it was never passed as a parameter.</p>
<h4 id="pointers"><a href="#pointers" aria-label="pointers permalink"></a><strong>Pointers</strong></h4>
<p>Go has pointers. A pointer holds the memory address of a value.</p>

<p>The <code>&amp;</code> operator generates a pointer to its operand:</p>

<p>The <code>*</code> operator denotes the pointer's underlying value:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>i <span>:=</span> <span>42</span>
p <span>:=</span> <span>&amp;</span>i     
<span>println</span><span>(</span><span>*</span>p<span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>You can use <code>*</code> to modify the original value:</p>

<h4 id="custom-types"><a href="#custom-types" aria-label="custom types permalink"></a><strong>Custom Types</strong></h4>
<p>You can create a type with the <code>type TypeName SourceType</code> syntax:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>This week I found myself at yet another dinner party that mysteriously contained only two people who were not involved with the tech industry in some way.</p><p>As I looked around and realized for the hundredth time that I was surrounded by people exactly like me, something inside me snapped. I downloaded the latest <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/public_use_microdata_sample/" target="_blank">American Community Survey microdata</a>, fired up R and started calculating feverishly.</p><p>It turns out that among people who</p><ul><li>are under 35</li><li>live in San Francisco, Berkeley or Oakland</li><li>and have at least a bachelor’s degree</li></ul><p>about 10% have a computer-related occupation. An additional 5% are employed in some other capacity by a strongly computer-related industry.</p><p>That’s not <em>nearly</em> large enough to explain how saturated with coders my social groups are. I have plenty of social circles that are (at least nominally) totally different from my work: contra dancers, people interested in effective altruism, folk musicians, friends from college, and so on. And yet I keep finding myself in the middle of a programmer monoculture. Why?</p><p>As <a href="http://xkcd.com/1480/" target="_blank">Randall Munroe recently suggested</a>, suggests, maybe taking up a sport would help expose me to a broader range of people. But which one? Obviously not football, since I’m barely 150 pounds and don’t like traumatic brain injuries. Preferably a more elegant sport that doesn’t require a bunch of awkward equipment. Maybe Ultimate or rock climbing–</p><p>Wait, crap.</p><p>Part of the problem is that my taste in hobbies is influenced by class lines and subculture in ways that I hadn’t realized before.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It turns out that even when it’s totally up to me, most of the things I’m interested in are strongly associated with a very particular band of socioeconomic status—a much smaller band than the set of “all bachelor’s degree holders” in my ACS analysis.</p><p>This stronger selection sneaks in when I try to pick a sport based on things like “elegance,” instead of “size of community” or “what I’ve been playing since I was five years old” or whatever other things people might pick sports for. In fact, just the fact that I’m interested in doing sports for leisure is associated with class, since it’s not something that would be so easy for, say, manual laborers or shift workers.</p><p>But I don’t think socioeconomic selection explains all of it. My parents’ friends were similarly selected, but they didn’t all have <em>literally the same job</em>, and the ones that did were usually coworkers—not people they had met socially who bizarrely all happened to work on the same stuff. My friends in other occupations with similar base rates—say, school teachers—don’t wonder where all the non-teachers are at social events. And I don’t even feel like I’m from a similar subculture to many programmers. What else could be going on?</p><ul><li><p>Maybe that crackpot-sounding stuff about the “programmer’s brain” actually has something to it. Maybe programmers are all drawn to the same activities because those activities are friendly to the programmer’s innately logical, systematizing and abstract habits of thought.</p></li><li><p>Programmers could talk about programming too much, or smell bad, or something, so people from other professions are less likely to put up with them at social events.</p></li><li><p>Perhaps the various subcultures of programmers are closer together, and more distinct from other subcultures, than I perceive. Maybe “programmer culture” is less analogous to other single professions and more analogous to “academic culture” or “hippie culture,” where it would be more reasonable to have that be your entire social group.</p></li><li><p>Maybe I miscalculated from the ACS data and there are actually way more programmers than the 10% number suggests.</p></li></ul><p>Unless I’ve miscalculated pretty badly, though, it’s clear that these social bubble effects are way stronger and more tenacious than I would have expected. And this is just one of the axes where it’s <em>obvious</em> that all the variance is being selected out. I wonder what more subtle facts are being selected for this strongly in my social groups?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>When I lived in Boston, the people I associated with were determined mostly by my parents or my private high school/college, which is plenty enough to explain a monoculture without getting into class effects. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>YADB (Yet Another Database Benchmark)</h3>
<p>The world has a plethora of database benchmarks, starting with the <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dewitt/includes/benchmarking/vldb83.pdf">Wisconsin Benchmark</a> which is my favorite. Firstly, that benchmark was from Dr David Dewitt, who taught me Database Internals when I was a graduate student at University of Wisconsin. Secondly, it is probably the earliest conference paper (circa 1983) that I ever read. And thirdly, the results of this paper displeased Larry Ellison so much that he inserted a clause in newer Oracle releases to prevent researchers from benchmarking the Oracle database.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin paper clearly describes how a benchmark measures very specific features of databases, so it follows that as database capabilities evolve, new benchmarks are needed. If you have a database that has new behavior not found in existing databases, then it is clear that you need a new benchmark to measure this new behavior of the database.</p>
<p>Today, we are introducing a new benchmark, RockBench, that does just this. RockBench is designed to measure the most important characteristics of a real-time database.</p>
<h3>What Is a Real-Time Database?</h3>
<p>A real-time database is one that can sustain a high write rate of new incoming data, while at the same time allowing applications to make queries based on the freshest of data. It is different from a transactional database where the most significant characteristic is the ability to perform transactions, which is why TPC-C is the most cited benchmark for transactional databases.</p>
<p>In typical database ACID parlance, a real-time database provides Atomicity and Durability of updates just like most other databases. It supports an eventual Consistency model, where updates show up in query results as quickly as possible. This time lag is referred to as data latency.  A real-time database is one that is designed to minimize data latency.</p>
<p>Different applications need different data latencies, and the ability to measure data latency allows users to choose one real-time database configuration over another based on the needs of their application. RockBench is the only benchmark at present that measures the data latency of a database at varying write rates.</p>
<p>Data latency is different from query latency, which is what is typically used to benchmark transactional databases. We posit that one of the distinguishing factors that differentiates one real-time database from another is data latency. We designed a benchmark called <a href="https://github.com/rockset/rockbench">RockBench</a> that can measure the data latency of a real-time database.</p>
<h3>Why Is This Benchmark Relevant in the Real World?</h3>
<p><strong>Real-time analytics use cases.</strong> There are many decision-making systems that leverage large volumes of streaming data to make quick decisions. When a truck arrives at a loading dock, a fleet management system would need to produce a loading list for the truck by examining delivery deadlines, delay-charge estimates, weather forecasts and modeling of other trucks that are arriving in the near future. This type of decision-making system would use a real-time database. Similarly, a product team would look at product clickstreams and user feedback in real time to determine which feature flags to set in the product. The volume of incoming click logs is very high and the time to gather insights from this data is low. This is another use case for a real-time database. Such use cases are becoming the norm these days, which is why measuring the data latency of a real-time database is useful. It allows users to pick the right database for their needs based on how quickly they want to extract insights from their data streams.</p>
<p><strong>High write rates.</strong> The most critical measurement for a real-time database is the write rate it can sustain while supporting queries at the same time. The write rate could be bursty or periodic, depending on the time of the day or the day of the week. This behavior is like a streaming logging system that can take in large volumes of writes. However, one difference between a real-time database and a streaming logging system is that the database provides a query API that can perform random queries on the event stream. With writing and querying of data, there is always an inherent tradeoff between high write rates and the visibility of data in queries, and this is precisely what RockBench measures.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-structured data.</strong> Most of real-life decision-making data is in semi-structured form, e.g. JSON, XML or CSV. New fields get added to the schema and older fields are dropped. The same field can have multi-typed values. Some fields have deeply nested objects. Before the advent of real-time databases, a user would typically use a data pipeline to clean and homogenize all the fields, flatten nested fields, denormalize nested objects and then write it out it to a data warehouse like Redshift or Snowflake. The data warehouse is then used to gather insights from their data. These data pipelines add to data latency. On the other hand, a real-time database eliminates the need for some of these data pipelines and simultaneously offers lower data latency. This benchmark uses data in JSON format to simulate more of these types of real-life scenarios.</p>
<h3>Overview of RockBench</h3>
<p>RockBench comprises a Data Generator and a Data Latency Evaluator. The Data Generator simulates a real-life event workload, where every generated event is in JSON format and schemas can change frequently. The Data Generator produces events at various write rates and writes them to the database. The Data Latency Evaluator queries the database periodically and outputs a metric that measures the data latency at that instant.  A user can vary the write rate and measure the observed data latency of the system.</p>

<em>Multiple instances of the benchmark connect to the database under test</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://rockset.com/Evaluating_Data_Latency_for_Real_Time_Databases.pdf">Evaluating Data Latency for Real-Time Databases</a> white paper provides a detailed description of the benchmark. The size of an event is chosen to be around 1K bytes, which is what we found to be the sweet spot for many real-life systems. Each event has nested objects and arrays inside it. We looked at a lot of publicly available events streams like Twitter events, stock market events and online gaming events to pick these characteristics of the data that this benchmark uses.</p>
<h3>Results of Running RockBench on Rockset</h3>
<p>Before we analyze the results of the benchmark, let’s refresh our memory of Rockset’s <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/aggregator-leaf-tailer-an-architecture-for-live-analytics-on-event-streams/">Aggregator Leaf Tailer</a> (ALT) architecture. The ALT architecture allows Rockset to scale ingest compute and query compute separately. This benchmark measures the speed of indexing in Rockset’s <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/converged-indexing-the-secret-sauce-behind-rocksets-fast-queries/">Converged Index™</a>, which maintains an inverted index, a columnar store and a record store on all fields. The benefit of building all indices is that queries are fast because it can leverage any of these pre-built indices. The data latency that we record in our benchmarking is a measure of how fast Rockset can index streaming data. Complete results can be found <a href="https://rockset.com/Evaluating_Data_Latency_for_Real_Time_Databases.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/1d31s1aajogl/1q7BFjCAsnbWNb10jzBnlo/3c56104981e2e264b7a788c36962270c/rockbench-rockset-4xl-50.png" alt="rockbench-rockset-4xl-50">
<em>Rockset p50 and p95 data latency using a 4XLarge Virtual Instance at a batch size of 50</em></p>
<p>The first observation is that a Rockset 4XLarge Virtual Instance can support a billion events flowing in every day (approx. 12K events/sec) while keeping the data latency to under 1 second. This write rate is sufficient to support a variety of use cases, ranging from fleet management operations to handling events generated from sensors.</p>
<p>The second observation is that if you have to support a higher write rate, it is as simple as upgrading to the next higher Rockset Virtual Instance. Rockset is scalable, and depending on the amount of resources you dedicate, you can reduce your data latency or support higher write rates. Extrapolating from these benchmark results: an online gaming system that produces 40K events/sec and requires a data latency of 1 second may be satisfied with a Rockset 16XLarge Virtual Instance. Also, migrating from one Rockset Virtual Instance to another does not cause any downtime, which makes it easy for users to migrate from one instance to another.</p>
<p>The third observation is that if you are running on a fixed Rockset Virtual Instance and your write rate increases, the benchmark results show that there is a gradual and linear increase in the data latency until CPU resources are saturated. In all these cases, the compute resource on the leaf is the bottleneck, because this compute is the resource that makes recently written data queryable immediately. Rockset delegates compaction CPU to <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/remote-compactions-in-rocksdb-cloud">remote compactors</a>, but some minimum CPU is still needed on the leaves to copy files to and from cloud storage.</p>
<p>Rockset uses a specialized <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/optimizing-bulk-load-in-rocksdb/">bulk-load</a> mechanism to index stationary data and that can load data at terabytes/hour, but this benchmark is not to measure that functionality. This benchmark is purposely used to measure the data latency of high-velocity data when new data is arriving at a fast rate and needs to be immediately queried.</p>
<h3>Futures</h3>
<p>In its current form, the workload generator issues writes at a specified constant rate, but one of the improvements that users have requested is to make this benchmark simulate a bursty write rate. Another improvement is to add an overwrite feature that overwrites some documents that already exists in the database. Yet another requested feature is to vary the schema of some of the generated documents so that some fields are sparse.</p>
<p>RockBench is designed to be extensible, and we hope that developers in the database community would contribute code to make this benchmark run on other real-time databases as well.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to see the results of RockBench on Rockset. It demonstrates the value of real-time databases, like Rockset, in enabling real-time analytics by supporting streaming ingest of thousands of events per second while keeping data latencies in the low seconds. My hope is that RockBench will provide developers an essential tool for measuring data latency and selecting the appropriate real-time database configuration for their application requirements.</p>

            <h2>Why is 10,000 written in Roman Numerals as <label>X</label>?</h2>
            <p>Roman Numerals are an ancient way of writing numbers that originated in ancient Rome.</p>
            <p>It is still used today, but mainly for date purposes (like with Super Bowl L for Super Bowl 50) or for movie
                series (Star Wars IV - A New Hope).</p>

            <p>Here are the main symbols that are used:</p>

            <p>To convert 10,000 to Roman Numerals we need to split it up into place values (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.), like this:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this tutorial, we'll learn how to test complex data structures in Python. Examples of such data include images, nested dictionaries, dictionaries of <em>numpy</em> arrays and even file contents. Learning how to test complex data is a very helpful skill, especially if you work in Data Science, Machine Learning or other kinds of scientific programming.</p>

<li><a href="#testing-files">Testing Files</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>For this tutorial we'll use <em>Python 3.6+</em>, <em>pytest</em>, <em>poetry</em>, <em>pandas</em>, <em>numpy</em>, <em>PIL</em> and <code>pytest-regressions</code>.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To create a new project, we’ll use poetry. If you don’t know what poetry is and how to use it, please the amazing <a target="_blank" href="https://python-poetry.org/">official docs</a>.</p>
<p>The first step is to create a new directory and initialize the project.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p complex_data/app
mkdir -p complex_data/tests
<span>cd</span> complex_data
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can install all the dependencies required from the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file. </p>
<pre><code>$ cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "complex_data"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Sample project to learn how to test complex data in Python"
authors = ["miguendes"]
license = "MIT"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.7"
pytest = "^6.0.1"
pytest-regressions = "^2.0.1"
numpy = "^1.19.1"
pandas = "^1.1.2"
pillow = "^7.2.0"

[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core&gt;=1.0.0a5"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have all setup, let's install the packages. Poetry will take care of the <em>virtualenv</em> creation for you and will install everything there.</p>
<pre><code>poetry install
</code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-a-demo-app">Creating a Demo App</h2>
<p>Now, let’s create a demo app so we can build tests for it. This demo will be very basic and enough to demonstrate how to test complex data. The concepts can be applied to any domain that deals with a similar type of data.</p>
<p>To start with, we’ll create two files. The first one will be the actual demo implementation. The next one will hold all the test case we are going to build. Alternatively, you can also clone the  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/miguendes/tutorials/tree/master/complex_data">project from github</a> .</p>
<pre><code>touch app/__init__.py
touch app/complex_app.py
touch tests/__init__.py
touch tests/<span>test</span>_complex_app.py
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-nested-dictionaries">Testing Nested Dictionaries</h3>
<p>A public REST API is a popular way to get data from third party entities. They usually return the data in a <em>json</em> format. And sometimes the data is organized in a deep nested structure. In Python this data will most likely be represented as a dictionary. To exemplify a function that returns a deep dictionary, consider the following example.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>config_data</span><span>(verbose_desc: str, simple_desc: str)</span> -&gt; dict:</span>
    <span>return</span> {
        <span>"agg_results"</span>: {
            <span>"t1"</span>: [<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>, <span>True</span>, <span>False</span>],
            <span>"nums"</span>: [<span>1.3</span>, <span>3.4</span>, <span>23.456</span>, <span>21.3456</span>],
            <span>"count"</span>: <span>120</span>,
        },
        <span>"sample"</span>: {<span>"desc"</span>: {<span>"verbose"</span>: verbose_desc, <span>"simple"</span>: simple_desc}},
    }
</code></pre>
<p>This function takes two parameters, <code>verbose_desc</code> and  <code>simple_desc</code>, and set it under sample -&gt; desc.
Now, how can we test this function? One way is to test it by inspecting each key-&gt;value pair.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_config_data</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    actual = config_data(verbose_desc=<span>"first experiment"</span>, simple_desc=<span>"first"</span>)
    <span>assert</span> actual[<span>"agg_results"</span>][<span>"t1"</span>] == [<span>True</span>, <span>False</span>, <span>True</span>, <span>False</span>]
    <span>assert</span> actual[<span>"agg_results"</span>][<span>"nums"</span>] == [<span>1.3</span>, <span>3.4</span>, <span>23.456</span>, <span>21.3456</span>]

    <span>assert</span> actual[<span>"sample"</span>][<span>"desc"</span>][<span>"simple"</span>] == <span>"first"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If we run the test, we can see that it works, but... You know, it’s too verbose and error-prone. For example, if we add new keys we will need to update the test to add more <em>assert</em> statements. Also, it doesn’t scale at all if the dictionary contains large data. So what is the alternative?</p>
<h4 id="pytest-regressions">pytest-regressions</h4>
<p>It turns out there’s a very interesting <em>pytest</em> plugin that makes this kind of test very easy and simple. With just a few lines of code, you can test this config data.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_config_data_with_pytest_regressions</span><span>(data_regression)</span>:</span>
    actual = config_data(verbose_desc=<span>"first experiment"</span>, simple_desc=<span>"first"</span>)
    data_regression.check(actual)
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! The only step needed is using the <code>data_regression</code> fixture and check the actual data returned. <code>pytest-regressions</code> will create a <code>yaml</code> file with the expected data the first time you run the test. Then it will use this file when you call the test again. As a result, if a regression is introduced, the plugin will detect the diff and the test will fail.</p>
<p>When you run the test for the first time, the test will fail and <code>pytest-regressions</code> will store the output in a directory with the name of the test file.</p>
<pre><code>test_complex_app.py::test_config_data_with_pytest_regressions FAILED     [100%]
test_complex_app.py:23 (test_config_data_with_pytest_regressions)

</code></pre>
<p>If you run it again, the test pass.</p>
<pre><code>test_complex_app.py::test_config_data_with_pytest_regressions PASSED     [100%]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-images">Testing Images</h3>
<p>Image manipulation is a very common task in AI. In order to train Machine Learning algorithms, images must be pre-processed. For instance, some algorithms require the image to be in gray-scale. Sometimes, images must be scaled down, or up. In other occasions you might want to do image augmentation, which usually consists in rotating or skewing the image.</p>
<p>Now, let’s say that we need to resize down an image to 100x100 and convert it to gray as a pre-processing step. We can write a very simple function called <code>convert_image_to_gray</code>. To test this function, we can rely on the great fixture called <code>image_regression</code> provided by <code>pytest-regressions</code>. The following example illustrates that.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>convert_image_to_gray</span><span>(
    input_path: str, output_path: str, size: Tuple[int, int] = <span>(<span>200</span>, <span>200</span>)</span>
)</span>:</span>
    image = Image.open(input_path)
    gray_image = image.convert(<span>"L"</span>)
    gray_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    gray_image.save(output_path, <span>"PNG"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p> The test for it is just like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_convert_image_to_gray</span><span>(image_regression)</span>:</span>
    output_file = Path(<span>"tests/resources/python_logo_gray.png"</span>)
    convert_image_to_gray(
        <span>"tests/resources/python_logo.png"</span>, str(output_file), size=(<span>100</span>, <span>100</span>)
    )
    image_regression.check(output_file.read_bytes(), diff_threshold=<span>1.0</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it again! No extra setup steps, no complex asserts, just one line.</p>
<h3 id="testing-dictionaries-of-numpy-arrays">Testing Dictionaries of Numpy Arrays</h3>
<p>Another common practice in Data Science is to manipulate <em>numpy</em> arrays. It’s very usual to have dictionaries composed of string keys and <em>numpy</em> arrays as values. Testing that is just as annoying as testing nested dictionaries. It tends to get worse when the arrays are made up of float numbers.</p>
<p>Again, as our previous examples, let's consider a function that returns a dictionary of <em>numpy</em> arrays.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>element_wise_mult</span><span>(a: np.array, b: np.array)</span> -&gt; Dict[str, np.array]:</span>
    res = a * b
    <span>return</span> {<span>"res"</span>: res}
</code></pre>
<p>This function just multiplies two 1D <em>numpy</em> arrays and stores the result in a dictionary. To test that we can use <code>num_regression</code> fixture. As you may have guessed, the interface is the same as the other fixtures using the <code>check</code> method. A full test definition goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_elemwise_multi_calculation</span><span>(num_regression)</span>:</span>
    np.random.seed(<span>0</span>)
    a = np.random.randn(<span>6</span>)
    b = np.random.randn(<span>6</span>)
    result = element_wise_mult(a, b)
    num_regression.check(result)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-files">Testing Files</h3>
<p>Python can represent a file object in three categories: raw binary files, buffered binary files and text files.
A binary file can be used to store any kind of binary data such as images, mp3s, videos and so on. A text file, on the other hand, can be a simple <code>.txt</code> or a <code>.html</code>, <code>.md</code> or just your gold old <code>.py</code> script.</p>
<h4 id="binary-file-example">Binary File Example</h4>
<p>The simplest example of binary file would be a function that takes a path string and loads a binary file from disk and returns its bytes. <code>pytest-regression</code> comes with a fixture <code>file_regression</code> that helps a lot when testing file contents.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>read_from_file</span><span>(path: str)</span> -&gt; bytes:</span>
    <span>with</span> open(path, <span>"rb"</span>) <span>as</span> f:
        <span>return</span> f.read()
</code></pre>
<p>The test goes like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_read_from_file</span><span>(file_regression, datadir)</span>:</span>
    contents = read_from_file(<span>"tests/resources/data.bin"</span>)
    file_regression.check(contents, binary=<span>True</span>, extension=<span>".bin"</span>)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="text-file-example">Text File Example</h4>
<p>Like I said before, an <code>.html</code> file is just a text file. In this example we'll consider a function that converts an dictionary to a HTML table.</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>dict_to_html</span><span>(data: dict)</span> -&gt; str:</span>
    html = <span>"&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;"</span> + <span>"&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;"</span>.join(data.keys()) + <span>"&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"</span>

    <span>for</span> row <span>in</span> zip(*data.values()):
        html += <span>"&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;"</span> + <span>"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;"</span>.join(row) + <span>"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;"</span>

    html += <span>"&lt;/table&gt;"</span>

    <span>return</span> html
</code></pre>
<p>And the test...</p>
<pre><code>
<span><span>def</span> <span>test_dict_to_html</span><span>(file_regression)</span>:</span>
    data = {
        <span>"Heights"</span>: [<span>"30"</span>, <span>"12"</span>, <span>"12"</span>],
        <span>"IDs"</span>: [<span>"XXDDUBAB"</span>, <span>"LOPSKSKSS"</span>, <span>"KIOTGGAGA"</span>],
        <span>"Download Count"</span>: [<span>"123"</span>, <span>"34"</span>, <span>"2"</span>],
    }

    html = dict_to_html(data)
    file_regression.check(html, extension=<span>".html"</span>)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Well... We could just assert the string returned, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might be asking. We could just assert the string returned. Yes, that’s a fair point, however if the string is too big, the test setup will become polluted and overly verbose. As an alternative, we could store it as a file and then load it. Well, that’s actually what <code>pytest-regressions</code> does, with the benefit of hiding that complexity.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Testing complex data can be tricky and cumbersome. Fortunately, <code>pytest</code> allows great extensibility as plugins. <code>pytest-regression</code> is a non popular but very useful plugin that makes …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html">SQL window functions</a> are one of those topics that never quite clicked for me
in the abstract, but I’ve been able to take advantage of them on a few recent
projects and wanted to share some of what I’ve learned.</p>

<p>As context for this particular example, I’ve been in the habit of weighing
myself daily for the past ~11 years. Aside from providing a <em>very</em> interesting
data set, it just ends up being a lot of data to query, serialize, transmit, and
then render on the client. I’ve got just over 4000 records currently, and I
recently wanted to add an overview chart that would show the full history
below the normal chart that shows a smaller subset of the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1276cbb84af72431a462be52b35a6f9fe821c691/4d390/assets/images/downsample-example-1276cbb8.png" alt="Downsample example"></p>

<p>This image shows the overview graph (the one on the bottom) as it exists now, downsampled to
include every 10th record, but I initially implemented the overview using the
full weigh-in history. I found that including them all added around 250kB of
data and a few seconds downloading the page content (on a “fast 3G” network
setting). I liked the functionality but realized I could likely get by with only
a subset of the records. So I looked into how I could downsample the data, and a
window function turned out to be the perfect tool.</p>

<h2 id="basic-downsampling-example">Basic Downsampling Example</h2>

<p>If I just wanted to grab all the weigh-in records, ordered by date, I could
use:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>date</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In order to downsample this data, I can use a window function to add a
<code>ROW_NUMBER</code> value for the records ordered by date:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span><span>,</span> <span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>()</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now I had the computed row number but in order to use it to filter the records
I had to include it as a sub-query and then filter in the outer query:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span><span>,</span> <span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>()</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span><span>;</span>
<span>)</span> <span>x</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I only want to return the <code>id</code>, <code>date</code>, and <code>weight</code> fields, but I’m able to
use the <code>ROW_NUMBER</code> in our <code>WHERE</code> clause to grab every 10th record using
<code>mod(ROW_NUMBER, 10) = 0</code> filter.</p>

<p><em>Note</em> - the <code>x</code> here is a name I’m giving to the sub-query. Postgres requires a
name, but I’m not actually using it in the rest of the query.</p>

<p><em>Other Note</em> - you’ll likely want to have an <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/indexes-ordering.html">index on the <code>date</code>
column</a> to make that
<code>ORDER BY</code> clause efficient.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-user-specific">Make It User Specific</h2>

<p>Let’s say I have the same setup as above, but the records in the
table I want to downsample are user-specific and I want to provide a similar
overview graph for each user. Some users will have long histories with
thousands of records, but others will only have a handful, and I’d like to
return a consistent number of records for the overview graph for all users.</p>

<p>In this case I can use another sub-query to determine the relevant downsample
rate on a per-user basis. Let’s say I want to show a maximum of 300 data points
in the overview graph; I can use a query like the following to get the
downsample rate:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>300</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, rather than using the fixed value <code>10</code> as in the first query (aka, grab
every 10th record), we’ll have a value that will vary for each user to ensure
we get ~300 records in the returned data set.</p>

<p>I can then combine that with the original query to efficiently grab the
downsampled overview with the desired ~300 records:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span><span>,</span> <span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>()</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>date</span><span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span>
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span>
<span>)</span> <span>x</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>300</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Note</em> - you’ll likely already have this, but just as a reminder, you’ll want to
have an index on <code>user_id</code> for the relevant table to make sure the sub-query
won’t slow things down too much.</p>

<h2 id="a-final-tweak-for-very-large-tables">A Final Tweak for Very Large Tables</h2>

<p>There’s one last trick that has helped in the
case of a very large table where <code>COUNT(*)</code> is slow enough to be noticed. In
this case I don’t actually care about getting an <em>exact</em> count, so I can take
advantage of postgres metadata to get an approximate count:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>reltuples</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>relname</span> <span>=</span> <span>'weighins'</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A bit cryptic, but this query gets the approximate record count for the table.
It lags a bit behind the actual value as it’s only updated when postgres runs
<code>VACUUM</code> or <code>ANALYZE</code> or similar housekeeping operations, but it’s more than
sufficient for our needs. I’ve tacked <code>::int</code> to explicitly typecast the
result to allow us to use this in our <code>WHERE mod(ROW_NUMBER, ...)</code> filter.</p>

<p>I can combine this as a sub-query to get a reasonably performant downsampled
version of our data, even for very large tables:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span><span>,</span> <span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>()</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span><span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>weighins</span>
<span>)</span> <span>x</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>ROW_NUMBER</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>reltuples</span> <span>/</span> <span>300</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>relname</span> <span>=</span> <span>'weighins'</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html">Postgres Documentation on Window Functions</a> is, unsurprisingly, very
solid. The <a href="https://sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html">SQLite Introduction to Window Functions</a> is also quite good, and
<a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/postgres-window-functions">thoughtbot has a great article on using window functions</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This is an attempt to understand Raph Levien’s <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/audio/2019/02/14/parallel-iir.html">IIR filters can be evaluated in parallel</a> by a person with no particular knowledge of DSP, filtering or relevant mathematics, just an interest in evaluating an IIR filter in parallel and a good deal of programming experience! The goal is to produce an implementation of this article demonstrating in code the approach Raph describes. The code won’t be optimal by any means, but should serve as a sufficient base for building something much better.</p>

<p>Right from the get go we get an inkling this might not be as straight-forward as we might hope:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Author’s note: I got slightly stuck writing this, so am publishing a somewhat unfinished draft</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the article focuses on a simple RC-lowpass filter, given by the equation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>y[i] = x[i] * c + y[i - 1] * (1 - c)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Raph also points out that this formulation of an IIR filter, while easy to understand has been superseded by the state space approach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rather than writing it it in direct form, which emphasizes the serial evaluation strategy, it’s better to use matrices. Basically, y becomes a state vector, and a becomes a matrix. This is known as the state space approach to filters and has many advantages. I’d go so far to say that direct form is essentially obsolete now, optimizing for the number of multiplies at the expense of parallelism, numerical stability, and good modulation properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The state space approach will become important later. It is worth taking a little detour to clear it up.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="state-space-detour">State Space Detour</h2>

<p>All IIR filters are difference equations, which for our purposes are recursive equations that rely on one or more outputs from previous steps. Simply speaking, the deeper the recursion (more previous outputs), the more “powerful” it can be. This recursive level is the <code>order</code> of the filter. For example, to create a low-pass filter with a steeper cut-off, like a brick-wall filter, it will need more than just the single level of recursion of the RC-lowpass filter – it will have a higher order.</p>

<p>A possible building block of such high-order IIRs is the biquad. A biquad is a second order (order = 2) filter. Biquads can be chained together to create even higher-order filters, a representation called second order sections.</p>

<p>This gets us to the <code>direct form</code> referenced in the quote above. Direct Form is a way to represent a biquad. One of the Direct Forms uses the following equation:</p>

<p><code>y[n] = b0 * x[n] + b1 * x[n - 1] + b2 * x[n - 2] - a1 * y[n - 1] - a2 * y[n - 2]</code></p>

<p>This is a second order filter because it relies on two historical values (<code>y[n - 1]</code> and <code>y[n - 2]</code>.) Thinking of the RC-lowpass filter in this way tells us that <code>b0</code> is <code>c</code> and <code>a1</code> is <code>c - 1</code> and the other constants are zero (our filter is first-order.)</p>

<h3 id="conversion-to-state-space">Conversion to State Space</h3>

<p>All IIR filters can be representated by a transfer function, written as <code>H(z)</code>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter">Wiki’s</a> introduction to biquads shows the transfer function. Mapping it to the direct form is trivial, so it is omitted here.</p>

<p>We want to convert the biquad form to a state space form. More generally it would be useful to be able to convert any IIR filter that can be written in terms of <code>H(z)</code> to state space form. This can be done by hand, but fortunately it can be done easily via GNU Octave’s or Matlab’s <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/tf2ss.html">tf2ss</a> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c = 0.44
num = [c]
den = [1 c-1]
[A, B, C, D] = tf2ss(num, den)
A: 0.56
B: 1
C: 0.44
D: 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally we can write the filter in state-space form. State-space form is generally written as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = Ax[n] + Bu[n]
y[n] = Cx[n] + Du[n]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So far our equations have had <code>y</code> as the output (i.e the filtered signal) and <code>x</code> as the input (i.e. the signal to be filtered.) State-space changes this, the signal to be filtered is <code>u</code> and <code>x</code> is the <em>state vector</em>. Generally, <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> are matrices and <code>B</code> and <code>D</code> are vectors. Since our filter is first-order, each of these values are simply numbers. <code>D</code> is zero so it can be removed entirely and <code>B</code> is one so it can be simplified to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = Ax[n] + u[n]
y[n] = Cx[n]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>substituting the constant <code>C</code> from the RC-lowpass filter equation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = (1 - C)x[n] + u[n]
y[n] = Cx[n]`
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="monoid-homomorphism-time">Monoid Homomorphism Time</h2>

<p>This is where the meat of the approach lies. Quoting from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic insight is that the target monoid is a function from input state to output state, and represents any integral number of samples. The monoid binary operator is function composition, which is by nature associative and has an identity (the identity function).
In general, the amount of state required to represent such a function, as opposed to a single state value, is intractable, but in [this case] it works […] because the function is linear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is going to require some unpacking.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="what-is-a-monoid">What is a monoid?</h3>

<p>A monoid is a triplet of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a set being operated on</li>
  <li>an associative binary operator</li>
  <li>an identity element</li>
</ul>

<p>The set might be the set of real numbers, for example. A binary operator is a function that takes two parameters that are elements of the set. Associativity is the property <code>(a op b) op c = a op (b op c)</code>, i.e. you can place the brackets arbitrarily. An identity element is an element <code>e</code> such that <code>e op x = x op e = x</code>. It is a no-op element.</p>

<p>For example, you might have a monoid representing addition: <code>(f64, +, 0)</code> meaning the set being operated on are the 64-bit floats, the binary operation is addition and the identity is <code>0</code> because <code>0+x = x+0 = x</code>. Similarly you could have a monoid representing multiplication: <code>(i32, *, 1)</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Back to the article. Before tackling the homomorphism and what it means, we’ll try to understand what Raph gives us as the path forward:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The target monoid is a function of this form:
<code>y_out = a * y_in + b</code>
This can obviously be represented as two floats, we can write the representation as simply <code>(a, b)</code>. The homomorphism then binds a single sample of input into a function. Given the filter above, an input of <code>x</code> maps to <code>(c, x * (1 - c))</code>.
Similarly, we can write out the effect of function composition in the two-floats representation space. Given <code>(a1, b1)</code> and <code>(a2, b2)</code>, their composition is <code>(a1 * a2, a2 * b1 + b2)</code>. Not especially complicated or difficult to compute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have to understand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is a monoid homomorphism?</li>
  <li>How does the input mapping result in <code>(c, x * (1 - c)</code>?</li>
  <li>Why is <code>y_out = a * y_in + b</code> our target monoid?</li>
  <li>Why is our target monoid represented as <code>(a , b)</code>?</li>
  <li>How is the binary operation (function composition) applied?</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll do it backwards, from easiest to hardest to understand.</p>

<h3 id="how-is-the-binary-operation-function-composition-applied">How is the binary operation (function composition) applied?</h3>

<p>Raph makes the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given <code>(a1, b1)</code> and <code>(a2, b2)</code>, their composition is <code>(a1 * a2, a2 * b1 + b2)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is function composition? Say we have two functions, <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code>, composition is simply <code>f2(f1(x))</code>. In our case the two functions are:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>f1: y[n] = a1 * y[n-1] + b1
f2: y[n] = a2 * y[n-1] + b2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The function composition, <code>f2(f1(x))</code> is thus:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>y[n] = a2 * (a1 * y[n-1] + b1) + b2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which multiplies out to:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>y[n] = a2 * a1 * y[n-1] + a2 * b1 + b2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is clearly still of the form <code>y[n] = a * y[n-1] + b</code>, with <code>(a, b)</code> now being <code>(a2 * a1, a2 * b1 + b2)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-our-target-monoid-represented-as-a--b">Why is our target monoid represented as <code>(a , b)</code>?</h3>

<p>This is now easier to understand. To represent the history of all prior invocations of the monoid, all we need are the <code>(a, b)</code> pair of the most recent function.</p>

<p>In other words, the history <code>fn(fn-1(fn-2(fn-3(...f0(0)...))))</code> can be represented as simply <code>fn(0)</code> provided we know the <code>(a, b)</code> pair.</p>

<p>Why do we know the initial input is zero? This chain of functions starts with <code>y[0] = ...</code>. But <code>y[0]</code> cannot be defined by a prior <code>y[-1]</code>; by definition there is nothing before the first element. Therefore the initial value for <code>y[n-1]</code> must be zero.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-y_out--a--y_in--b-our-target-monoid">Why is <code>y_out = a * y_in + b</code> our target monoid?</h3>

<p>The state space representation for our filter was written as two equations:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = (1-C)x[n] + u[n]
y[n] = Cx[n]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our goal is to evaluate the filter in parallel, so we want to get rid of recursion. The equation for the <em>state vector</em>, <code>x[n]</code> is recursive, so that’s our target. We already know we can evaluate this equation without requiring the prior values provided we can compute values for <code>(a, b)</code>.</p>

<p>Also, from the introduction to this section, we’re told:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The basic insight is that the target monoid is a function from input state to output state</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>x[n]</code> is the <em>state vector</em> so our target monoid is evaluating the state of the filter at any <code>n</code> and producing the corresponding output state.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-input-mapping-result-in-c-x--1---c">How does the input mapping result in <code>(c, x * (1 - c)</code>?</h3>

<p>All the pieces are in place, now we just need to compute those <code>(a, b)</code> values. We’ve got our target monoid:</p>

<p><code>x[n+1] = (1 - C) * x[n] + u[n]</code></p>

<p>let’s write it as:</p>

<p><code>y_out = (1 - C) * y_in + b</code></p>

<p>Remember <code>u[n]</code> is the signal, so when we feed in a single sample <code>x</code>, it takes the place of <code>u[n]</code> which is <code>b</code> in our target form:</p>

<p><code>y_out = (1 - C) * y_in + x</code>.</p>

<p>Pretty clearly, <code>(a, b)</code> is <code>(1 - C, x)</code>. That’s not what we expected. There are two reasons for this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, there’s a mistake in the article. The mapping should result in <code>(1 - C, x * C)</code>. That’s still not the result we have.</li>
  <li>Second, we are computing the state, not the final output. Once we have the state we still need to apply <code>y[n] = Cx[n]</code> to compute the final filtered result. Since that’s not a recursive function it is trivial to compute in parallel. It turns out that <code>(1 - C, x * C)</code> will both compute the state and apply the <code>y[n]</code> equation. I’m not sure how to derive this result, I stumbled upon it by accident. Furthermore, in the general case I’m not sure <code>y[n]</code> can be computed in one step along with the state vector (consider the case where <code>D</code> is non-zero.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-a-monoid-homomorphism">What is a Monoid Homomorphism?</h3>

<p>A per usual, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#Monoid_homomorphisms">Wiki</a> is a good source for this.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, if you have two monoids with binary operators <code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code> and a function <code>f</code> that translates inputs for <code>M1</code> into <code>M2</code>, then you have a homomorphism if:</p>

<p><code>f(M1(x, y)) = M2(f(x), f(y))</code> and given identity elements for the monoids <code>I1</code> and <code>I2</code> <code>f(I1) = I2</code>.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the homomorphism is in this case since it requires two …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

</header>

<p>For some time now (since the 1.26 release, to be precise), Rust has a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46882">very powerful machinery for CTFE</a>, or compile-time function evaluation.
Since then, there have been various discussions about which operations should be allowed during CTFE, which checks the compiler should do, how this all relates to promotion and which kinds of guarantees we should be able to expect around CTFE.
This post is my take on those topics, and it should not be surprising that I am going to take a very type-system centric view.
Expect something like a structured brain dump, so there are some unanswered questions towards the end as well.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<h2 id="some-background">Some Background</h2>

<p>CTFE is the mechanism used by the compiler, primarily, to evaluate items like <code>const x: T = ...;</code>.
The <code>...</code> here is going to be Rust code that must be “run” at compile-time, because it can be used as a constant in the code – for example, it can be used for array lengths.</p>

<p>Notice that CTFE is <em>not</em> the same as constant propagation: Constant propagation is an optimization pass done by compilers like LLVM that will opportunistically change code like <code>3 + 4</code> into <code>7</code> to avoid run-time work.
Being an optimization, constant propagation must, by definition, not change program behavior and will not be observable at all (other than performance).
CTFE, on the other hand, is about code that <em>must</em> be executed at compile-time because the compiler needs to know its result to proceed – for example, it needs to know the size of an array to compute how to lay out data in memory.
You can statically see, just from the syntax of the code, whether CTFE applies to some piece of code or not:
CTFE is only used in places like the value of a <code>const</code> or the length of an array.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>demo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span> <span>// CTFE</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span> <span>// no CTFE (but maybe constant propagation)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We say that the <code>3 + 4</code> above is in <em>const context</em> and hence subject to CTFE, but the <code>4 + 3</code> is not.</p>

<h2 id="const-safety">Const Safety</h2>

<p>Not all operations can be used in const context.
For example, it makes no sense to compute your array length as “please go read that file from disk and compute something” – we can’t know what will be on the disk when the program actually runs.
We could use the disk of the machine compiling the program, but that does not sound very appealing either.
Things get even worse when you consider letting the program send information to the network.
Clearly, we don’t want CTFE to have actually observable side-effects outside of compilation.</p>

<p>In fact, just naively letting programs read files would also be grossly unsafe:
When computing the length of an array twice, it is important that we obtain the same result.
<strong>Update:</strong> As @eddyb points out, things get even worse once you consider const generics, traits, and coherence: At that point, you have to <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/mir-constant-evaluation/3143/47">rely on evaluating the same expression in different crates to produce the same result</a>. <strong>/Update</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>CTFE must be deterministic.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If not, the compiler could end up thinking that two arrays have the same length, but then later compute different layouts.
That would be a disaster.
So, any kind of external input and any kind of non-determinism is a complete no-go for CTFE.
This does not just concern I/O, even converting a reference to a <code>usize</code> is not deterministic.</p>

<p>The compiler will throw a CTFE error if such an operation is ever attempted to be executed.
Those programs that <em>are</em> executable in const context are called <em>const safe</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A program is const safe if it can be executed by CTFE without hitting an error (panics are allowed).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very much in analogy with the idea that a <em>safe</em> (or <em>run-time safe</em>, to distinguish it from const safe) program is a program that does not cause any memory errors or data races.
In fact, we will see that this analogy between “programs that are well-behaved under CTFE” (const safety) and “programs that do not cause UB” (run-time safety) can carry us very far.</p>

<p>One very interesting question now is whether some given function <code>foo</code> should be allowed to be called in const context.
We could just always say “yes”, and rely on the fact that CTFE will throw an error when <code>foo</code> does anything fishy.
The problem with this approach is that, if <code>foo</code> is in a library, updating the library might change <code>foo</code> in a way that makes it no longer const-safe.
In other words, making <em>any</em> function not const-safe any more would be a semver violation because it could break downstream crates.</p>

<p>The typical mechanism to solve that problem is to have an annotation that explicitly marks a function as “usable in const context”.
In Rust, the proposed mechanism for this purpose is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111"><code>const fn</code></a>; in C++ it is called <code>constexpr</code>.
The compiler can now reject calling non-<code>const</code> functions in const context, so library authors can add non-const-safe operations without breaking semver.</p>

<h2 id="const-type-system-and-const-soundness">Const Type System and Const Soundness</h2>

<p>This leads us to the interesting situation that the compiler will reject code in const context that it would accept just fine outside of const context.
In particular, the body of a <code>const fn</code> is <em>also</em> considered to be in const context – otherwise, if we allowed calling arbitrary functions, we would have the same problem again.
One useful way to think about this is that we have a second type system, a “const type system”, that is used to type-check code in const context.
This type system does not allow calls to non-<code>const</code> functions.</p>

<p>It should probably also not allow casting a reference to an integer, because (as discussed above) that is a non-deterministic operation which cannot be performed during CTFE.
What else?</p>

<p>Before we go on and add random additional checks, let us step back and think about what our goals are here.
Typically, the purpose of a type system is to establish some sort of guarantee for a well-typed program.
For Rust’s “main” (“run-time”) type system, that guarantee is “no undefined behavior”, which means no memory errors and no data races.
What is the guarantee for our new const type system?
We have already talked about it above: It’s const safety!
This leads us to the definition of const soundness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Our const type system is sound if well-typed programs are const-safe.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, notice how this is very similar to the correctness statement for the run-time type system, which guarantees run-time safety.</p>

<p>However, we have to be a bit careful here.
Consider the following piece of code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>const</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_eight_mod_256</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>256</span> <span>==</span> <span>8</span> <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We will definitely want to allow this code.
Why should <code>==</code> or <code>%</code> not be const-safe?
Well, we could call our function as follows:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>is_eight_mod_256</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>into_raw</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That statement is certainly <em>not</em> const-safe as the result depends on where exactly the allocator puts our <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box</code></a>.
However, we want to blame the <code>as usize</code> for this issue, not the <code>is_eight_mod_256</code>.</p>

<p>The solution is for the const type system to not just have separate rules about which operations are allowed, we also must change our notion of which values are “valid” for a given type.
An integer obtained from a pointer is valid for <code>usize</code> at run-time, but it is <em>not</em> valid for <code>usize</code> in const mode!
After all, there are basic arithmetic operations that we expect all <code>usize</code> to support, that CTFE cannot support for pointers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A function is const-safe if, when executed with const-valid arguments, it does not trigger a CTFE error and returns a const-valid result (if it returns at all).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under this definition, <code>is_eight_mod_256</code> is const-safe because whenever <code>x</code> is an actual integer, it will evaluate without any error.
At the same time, this shows that converting a reference into <code>usize</code> is <em>not</em> const-safe, because the input of this operation is const-valid, but the output is not!
This provides a solid justification for rejecting such casts in const context.</p>

<h2 id="ctfe-correctness">CTFE correctness</h2>

<p>In Rust, CTFE is performed by miri, a MIR interpreter that used to be a <a href="https://github.com/solson/miri/">separate project</a> but whose core engine has been integrated into rustc.
miri will execute the code in const context step-by-step and just complain and fail with an error when an operation cannot be performed.
This does not just concern non-determinism; miri does not support everything it could support because @oli-obk is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5ba21844f6c85a0cd55c8ea0250d5cd758134f84/src/librustc_mir/interpret/const_eval.rs#L199">super careful</a> about not accidentally stabilizing behavior that should undergo an RFC.</p>

<p>In fact, right now miri will reject all operations on raw pointers.
They all raise a CTFE error and hence must all be rejected by the const type system.
The plan is to change miri so that it can support more operations, but we have to be careful in doing so.
I have already mentioned that miri must be deterministic, but there is another point to consider that you might have expected to play a much more prominent role:
CTFE, at least if it succeeds, should match run-time behavior!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>CTFE is correct if, when it loops forever, completes with a result, or panics, that behavior matches the run-time behavior of the same code.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We clearly do not want code to behave differently when it lives in const context and is run by CTFE, and when it is compiled to machine-code and executed “for real”.</p>

<p>Or, do we?
Don’t get me wrong, I am not advocating for deliberately breaking that property, but it sure is worth considering what would go wrong if miri was <em>not</em> CTFE-correct.
Maybe surprisingly, it turns out that this would not be a soundness issue!
All we care about for the purpose of soundness is for CTFE to be deterministic, as already discussed.
We don’t re-run the same code at run-time and rely on it still doing the same, so nothing actually breaks if CTFE behavior diverges from run-time behavior.</p>

<p>That said, not being CTFE correct is surely very surprising and we should avoid it best we can.
However, I am told that actually predicting the result of floating-point operations deterministically <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/floating_point_determinism/">is extremely hard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111#issuecomment-386765720">LLVM isn’t exactly helping</a>.
So, we will likely have to live with either considering floating point operations to be const-unsafe (raising a CTFE error), or not having CTFE correctness when floating point operations are …</p></article></div>

<p>Published Feb. 12, 2012</p>
<p>Belatedly, the world has learned that Roger M. Boisjoly, the whistleblower who tried to prevent the <em>Challenger</em> space shuttle explosion, passed away recently in Nephi, Utah.</p>

<p>Roger M. Boisjoly, the son of a mill worker, was born April 25, 1938, in Lowell, Massachusetts. &nbsp;From childhood, he was known for his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lowellsun.com/news/ci_19902357?source=rss#ixzz1mDSiN0rn">honesty</a>&nbsp;and “would not back down from what he believed in,” say family members. After earning a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lowellsun.com/news/ci_19902357?source=rss#ixzz1mDOGMpcw">mechanical engineering</a>&nbsp;degree from the University of Lowell, he began working in the aircraft industry. After a move to California, then to Utah, he took a job with&nbsp; Morton Thiokol, working on solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle program.</p>
<p>In 1985, he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html">warned</a>&nbsp;managers that 0-rings used to seal joints in the booster rockets could fail at freezing temperatures. ‘The result would be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html">a catastrophe of the highest order</a>&nbsp;— loss of human life,’ he wrote in a memo.&nbsp; But, the problem had not been resolved when the space shuttle&nbsp;<em>Challenger</em>&nbsp;was prepared for launch on January 28, 1986.</p>
<p>On the night of January 27, temperatures fell below freezing.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/9067491/Roger-Boisjoly.html">Boisjoly and four other engineers</a>&nbsp;tried desperately to convince management that the launch should be scrubbed.&nbsp; They warned that the cold would cause rubber o-rings to become brittle and fail, allowing hot gases to leak at the joints. Morton Thiokol and NASA managers dismissed the arguments, and decided to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/roger-boisjolys-death-goes-unnoticed-predicted-1986-nasa-rocket-explosion-68897/">go ahead</a>&nbsp;with the launch.</p>
<p>The next day, Challenger lifted off from its pad at Kennedy Space Center.&nbsp; At first, the launch appeared normal, but 73 seconds into flight the shuttle exploded, sending fragments arcing across the bright Florida sky.&nbsp; In view of a horrified public, including thousands of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/reagan-challenger.htm">schoolchildren</a>&nbsp;watching a live broadcast, seven astronauts plummeted to their deaths in the Atlantic ocean.</p>
<p>NASA’s actions following the disaster were typical for a government agency with a scandal on its hands: it impounded documents and told employees and others connected with the program&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SwuCxfZn_kEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22NASA+Had+Warning+of+a+Disaster+Risk+Posed+by+Booster%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PxrIMhhWBM&amp;sig=8jGg4rLQy4_dX4_bloIqwa5NW8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9RE4T5nfLaTb0QHw6tnhAg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22NASA%20Had%20Warning%20of%20a%20Disaster%20Risk%20Posed%20by%20Booster%22&amp;f=false">not to talk to reporters</a>, even off the record.</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan established a commission, known as the “Rogers Commission,” to search for the cause of the explosion and, initially, NASA managers were successful in &nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SwuCxfZn_kEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22NASA+Had+Warning+of+a+Disaster+Risk+Posed+by+Booster%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PxrIMhhWBM&amp;sig=8jGg4rLQy4_dX4_bloIqwa5NW8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9RE4T5nfLaTb0QHw6tnhAg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22NASA%20Had%20Warning%20of%20a%20Disaster%20Risk%20Posed%20by%20Booster%22&amp;f=false">diverting attention</a>&nbsp;from the o-rings. &nbsp;But, the dissenting engineers refused to let an important truth be swept under the carpet.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was clear to the engineers that NASA was bent on minimizing the pre-launch concern over the cold. Boisjoly was sufficiently concerned that he took his&nbsp;personal files&nbsp;into a sort of protective custody. He emptied his desk and took the critical memos with him to Huntsville. He slept with them in his motel room. He hid them in the locked trunk of his rented car when he went to work at the Marshall Space Flight Center. He sent copies home to Roberta. And still he worried that someone might try to lose or destroy them. –&nbsp;William C. Rempel, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-28/news/mn-1361_1_engineers/3">Los Angeles Times</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The investigation took a new direction after February 9, when the New York Times published a&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6f6LrdOXO6wC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=new+york+times+february+9+challenger+closed+session&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycL-vpTDJY&amp;sig=poGvZlXOiWbefMO3NCP8jvXlbyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jlo4T5SNOuPu0gHU5MHfAg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20york%20times%20february%209%20challenger%20closed%20session&amp;f=false">front-page story</a>&nbsp;(“NASA Had Warning of a Disaster Risk Posed by Booster”) citing concerns about o-ring failure expressed in documents it had obtained from an “anonymous solid fuel rocket analyst.”&nbsp; Afterward, the commission held three&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6f6LrdOXO6wC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=new+york+times+february+9+challenger+closed+session&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycL-vpTDJY&amp;sig=poGvZlXOiWbefMO3NCP8jvXlbyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jlo4T5SNOuPu0gHU5MHfAg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20york%20times%20february%209%20challenger%20closed%20session&amp;f=false">closed sessions</a>&nbsp;where personnel from Morton Thiokol and Marshall Space Flight center were questioned, including participants in the teleconference that took place on the eve of Challenger’s launch.&nbsp; As a result, the o-ring issues became a major focus of the investigation.</p>
<p>Boisjoly, who had been known as a “crackerjack troubleshooter,” was re-branded a “<a href="http://www.ocregister.com/news/boisjoly-248703-boyd-chapman.html">whistleblower</a>.” “After he finally passed [his] files personally to Major Gen. Donald J. Kutyna of the presidential commission, Boisjoly was&nbsp;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-28/news/mn-1361_1_engineers/3">accused</a>&nbsp;of ‘airing the company’s dirty laundry’ in front of the whole country,” wrote the LA Times.</p>
<p>In June 1986, the commission confirmed that the o-rings and cold weather led to the disaster.&nbsp; But, it did not attach blame to any of the individuals who ignored the engineers’ warnings.&nbsp; Instead, the commission criticized the “flawed”&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EP9D_30SpkMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA9&amp;lpg=RA1-PA9&amp;dq=NASA+HAD+WARNING+OF+A+DISASTER+RISK+POSED+BY+BOOSTER&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZsOwDSnG83&amp;sig=YgXOJqYLqYNITsW9iFk8pvKbEEg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3BQ4T-_vBqL50gG43JDTBQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=NASA%20HAD%20WARNING%20OF%20A%20DISASTER%20RISK%20POSED%20BY%20BOOSTER&amp;f=false">process</a>&nbsp;of decision-making.</p>
<p>The pre-launch effort by Boisjoly and others to stop the launch did not qualify as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/EthicsResources/Otherresources/whistle.html">whistleblowing</a>, some experts say, because the engineers did not go outside approved channels. But, that legal definition is unrealistically narrow.</p>
<blockquote><p>If it is a distinguishing mark of actions labeled whistleblowing that the agent intends to&nbsp;force attention to a serious moral problem, both Boisjoly’s and MacDonald’s responses qualify. This feature is the foundation of the public’s interest in whistleblowing. By bringing such serious problems to light, whistleblowers contribute to protecting the public’s welfare.&nbsp;<em>– Vivian Weill, <a href="http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/EthicsResources/Otherresources/whistle.html">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> (1996)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We now know that Boisjoly&nbsp;<a href="http://keranews.org/post/remembering-roger-boisjoly-he-tried-stop-shuttle-challenger-launch">met secretly</a>&nbsp;with an NPR reporter shortly after the shuttle disaster to provide information about the problems at Morton Thiokol — clearly not an approved channel. Unquestionably, that was an act of whistleblowing, but Boisjoly’s request for&nbsp;<a href="http://keranews.org/post/remembering-roger-boisjoly-he-tried-stop-shuttle-challenger-launch">anonymity</a>&nbsp;prevented it from becoming public knowledge.</p>
<p>The clearest evidence of whistleblowing, writes Weill, may be its most predictable consequence:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://whistleblowing.us/2012/02/remembering-roger-m-boisjoly-challenger-disaster-whistleblower-1938-2012/Weil%20nevertheless%20suggests%20that%20Boisjoly%20was%20a%20whistleblower,%20under%20different%20standards.%20Retaliation%20may%20be%20the%20most%20predictable%20feature%20of%20whistleblowing,%20perhaps%20enough%20to%20make%20it%20a%20defining%20feature.writes">retaliation</a>. There was no shortage of that after the engineers exposed the truth of o-ring failures. &nbsp;Along with Allan MacDonald, another engineer who tried to stop the Challenger launch, Boisjoly was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.standard.net/topics/atk/2011/01/27/two-men-fought-prevent-challenger-launch">taken off the investigation team</a>&nbsp;by Morton Thiokol management. The environment, he said, was hostile.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Thiokol managers] were extremely angry when I turned in my documentation and that anger increased as I continued to testify,” says Boisjoly. During testimony at a committee hearing, he publicly refuted a manager’s assertion that Thiokol engineers weren’t unanimous in recommending that the launch be canceled. “When I finished they were so damn mad&nbsp;that I think if they had guns they would have shot me on the spot,” he says. – Molly Gavin, Engineering Times (August, 1995), <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/blogs/nspe-blog/pe-warned-space-shuttle-disaster">republished</a> by NSPE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later, in “Truth, Lies and O-Rings,” MacDonald wrote that “Roger and I already felt like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.standard.net/topics/atk/2011/01/27/two-men-fought-prevent-challenger-launch">lepers</a>, but when we returned to Utah following the May 2 session our colleagues treated us as if we had just been arrested for child sexual abuse.”</p>
<p>Colleagues and even neighbors&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10084988">shunned</a>&nbsp;Boisjoly. Thiokol “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/us/roger-boisjoly-73-dies-warned-of-shuttle-danger.html">cut him off</a>&nbsp;from space work,” and NASA “tried to&nbsp;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/07/local/la-me-roger-boisjoly-20120207">blackball him</a>&nbsp;from the industry.” “Managers isolated him in his position and “<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">made life a living hell</a>&nbsp;on a day-to-day basis.”</p>
<p>“When I realized what was happening, it absolutely destroyed me,” Boisjoly told The Associated Press in a 1988 telephone interview. “<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10084988">It destroyed my career, my life, everything else.</a>”&nbsp; Boisjoly hung on for six months before deciding to take&nbsp;<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">long-term disability</a>&nbsp;leave, having been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He would not return to Thiokol.</p>
<p>Boisjoly filed lawsuits against Thiokol and NASA, including a&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam">qui tam</a></em>&nbsp;claim that Morton Thiokol had defrauded the public. The&nbsp;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-04/news/mn-4921_1_justice-department-spokeswoman">Justice Department refused</a>&nbsp;to join the suit as expected, and the lawsuits were&nbsp;<a href="http://ut.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19880831_0000002.DUT.htm/qx">dismissed</a>.&nbsp; The chilling spectacle of a whistleblower’s fall from grace sent a powerful message to others in the industry to stay silent about the next disaster in the making.</p>
<p>Boisjoly viewed the lawsuits as “<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">an exercise in total futility</a>.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think [the court system was]&nbsp;afraid of what they’d find.” The suits never even made it to the discovery process, he says. Boisjoly decided not to pursue the lawsuits further. “I tried to get on with my life,” he says. – Gavin, 1995</p></blockquote>
<p>Boisjoly’s moral courage earned him multiple&nbsp;<a href="http://www.onlineethics.org/cms/12717.aspx">awards</a>, including one from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1988, and another from the Cavallo Foundation in 1990. Despite the awards, Boisjoly saw no hope of returning to his former career.&nbsp; Like many other blacklisted whistleblowers, he decided to&nbsp;<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">go into business for himself</a>.&nbsp; He obtained a professional engineering license and began consulting as a forensic engineer. In additon, he wrote papers and lectured to engineering students on a subject dear to him:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html#ixzz1locDb6ls">ethical decision making.</a></p>
<p>NASA’s management culture failed to preserve the costly lessons of the&nbsp;<em>Challenger&nbsp;</em>disaster. In January 2003, NASA launched&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">another space shuttle</a>&nbsp;under circumstances that worried engineers. &nbsp;Foam insulation broke off during&nbsp;<em>Columbia’s&nbsp;</em>lift-off and punched a hole in a wing, leaving it vulnerable to the extreme forces of reentry. On February 1, as it re-entered earth’s atmosphere,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">Columbia disintegrated</a></em>&nbsp;in the skies above Texas, sending another seven astronauts to their deaths.</p>
<p>The space shuttle program&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html">ended</a>, several flights later, on July 21, 2011.&nbsp; Less than six months after, on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html#ixzz1locDb6ls">January 6, 2012</a>, Roger Boisjoly finally found peace.&nbsp; At the age of 73 — one year for every second of Challenger’s last flight — he died in his sleep of cancer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>This is the first in a series of posts describing how we can debug applications in production using eBPF, without recompilation/redeployment. This post describes how to use <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/gobpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gobpf</a> and uprobes to build a function argument tracer for Go applications. This technique is also extendable to other compiled languages such as C++, Rust, etc. The next sets of posts in this series will discuss using eBPF for tracing HTTP/gRPC data, SSL, etc.</p><p>When debugging, we are typically interested in capturing the state of a program. This allows us to examine what the application is doing and determine where the bug is located in our code. A simple way to observe state is to use a debugger to capture function arguments. For Go applications, we often use Delve or gdb.</p><p>Delve and gdb work well for debugging in a development environment, but they are not often used in production. The features that make these debuggers powerful can also make them undesirable to use in production systems. Debuggers can cause significant interruption to the program and even allow mutation of state which might lead to unexpected failures of production software.</p><p>To more cleanly capture function arguments, we will explore using enhanced BPF (<a href="https://ebpf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBPF</a>), which is available in Linux 4.x+, and the higher level Go library <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/gobpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gobpf</a>.</p><p>Extended BPF (eBPF) is a kernel technology that is available in Linux 4.x+. You can think of it as a lightweight sandboxed VM that runs inside of the Linux kernel and can provide verified access to kernel memory.</p><p>As shown in the overview below, eBPF allows the kernel to run BPF bytecode. While the front-end language used can vary, it is often a restricted subset of C. Typically the C code is first compiled to the BPF bytecode using Clang, then the bytecode is verified to make sure it's safe to execute. These strict verifications guarantee that the machine code will not intentionally or accidentally compromise the Linux kernel, and that the BPF probe will execute in a bounded number of instructions every time it is triggered. These guarantees enable eBPF to be used in performance-critical workloads like packet filtering, networking monitoring, etc.</p><p>Functionally, eBPF allows you to run restricted C code upon some event (eg. timer, network event or a function call). When triggered on a function call we call these functions probes and they can be used to either run on a function call within the kernel (kprobes), or a function call in a userspace program (uprobes). This post focuses on using uprobes to allow dynamic tracing of function arguments.</p><p>Uprobes allow you to intercept a userspace program by inserting a debug trap instruction (<code>int3</code> on an x86) that triggers a soft-interrupt . This is also <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/01/27/how-debuggers-work-part-2-breakpoints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how debuggers work</a>. The flow for an uprobe is essentially the same as any other BPF program and is summarized in the diagram below. The compiled and verified BPF program is executed as part of a uprobe, and the results can be written into a buffer.</p><div><figure>

  </figure></div><p>Let's see how uprobes actually function. To deploy uprobes and capture function arguments, we will be using <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/app.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> simple demo application. The relevant parts of this Go program are shown below.</p><p><code>main()</code> is a simple HTTP server that exposes a single <em>GET</em> endpoint on <em>/e</em>, which computes Euler's number (<strong>e</strong>) using an iterative approximation. <code>computeE</code> takes in a single query param(<em>iters</em>), which specifies the number of iterations to run for the approximation. The more iterations, the more accurate the approximation, at the cost of compute cycles. It's not essential to understand the math behind the function. We are just interested in tracing the arguments of any invocation of <code>computeE</code>.</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>To understand how uprobes work, let's look at how symbols are tracked inside binaries. Since uprobes work by inserting a debug trap instruction, we need to get the address where the function is located. Go binaries on Linux use ELF to store debug info. This information is available, even in optimized binaries, unless debug data has been stripped. We can use the command <code>objdump</code> to examine the symbols in the binary:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>From the output, we know that the function <code>computeE</code> is located at address <code>0x6609a0</code>. To look at the instructions around it, we can ask <code>objdump</code> to disassemble to binary (done by adding <code>-d</code>). The disassembled code looks like:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>From this we can see what happens when <code>computeE</code> is called. The first instruction is <code>mov 0x8(%rsp),%rax</code>. This moves the content offset <code>0x8</code> from the <code>rsp</code> register to the <code>rax</code> register. This is actually the input argument <code>iterations</code> above; Go's arguments are passed on the stack.</p><p>With this information in mind, we are now ready to dive in and write code to trace the arguments for <code>computeE</code>.</p><p>To capture the events, we need to register a uprobe function and have a userspace function that can read the output. A diagram of this is shown below. We will write a binary called <code>tracer</code> that is responsible for registering the BPF code and reading the results of the BPF code. As shown, the uprobe will simply write to a perf-buffer, a linux kernel data structure used for perf events.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/9f8b26f88f9b132440ef1b9d48b5a341/app-tracer.svg"><figcaption>High-level overview showing the Tracer binary listening to perf events generated from the App</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now that we understand the pieces involved, let's look into the details of what happens when we add an uprobe. The diagram below shows how the binary is modified by the Linux kernel with an uprobe. The soft-interrupt instruction (<code>int3</code>) is inserted as the first instruction in <code>main.computeE</code>. This causes a soft-interrupt, allowing the Linux kernel to execute our BPF function. We then write the arguments to the perf-buffer, which is asynchronously read by the tracer.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/87301c7282e8f8270fee2afb9fe85c81/app-trace.svg"><figcaption>Details of how a debug trap instruction is used call a BPF program</figcaption></figure></div><p>The BPF function for this is relatively simple; the C code is shown below. We register this function so that it's invoked every time <code>main.computeE</code> is called. Once it's called, we simply read the function argument and write that the perf buffer. Lots of boilerplate is required to set up the buffers, etc. and this can be found in the complete example <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/trace_example/trace.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Now we have a fully functioning end-to-end argument tracer for the <code>main.computeE</code> function!

Many aspects of Go, such as nested pointers, interfaces, channels, etc. make this process challenging, but solving these problems allows for another instrumentation mode not available in existing systems. Also, since this process works at the binary level, it can be used with natively compiled binaries for other languages (C++, Rust, etc.). We just need to account for the differences in their respective ABI's.</p><p>BPF tracing using uprobes comes with its own set of pros and cons. It's beneficial to use BPF when we need observability into the binary state, even when running in environments where attaching a debugger will be problematic or harmful (ex. production binaries). The biggest downside is the code required to get even trivial visibility into the application state. While BPF code is relatively accessible, it's complex to write and maintain. Without substantial high-level tooling, it's unlikely this can be used for generic debugging.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/12645e1cb582041085ede1877e97c812/wavingnaut.svg"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Go dynamic logging is something we are working on at Pixie.

<div><p>Welcome to Signals &amp; Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack, from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.  </p><p>Today, I’m going to have a conversation with Andrey Mokhov about build systems. Build systems are an important but I think poorly understood and often unloved part of programming. Developers often end up with only a hazy understanding of what’s going on with their build system learning just enough to figure out what arcane invocation they need to get the damn thing working and then stop thinking about it at that point, and that’s a shame because build systems matter a lot to our experience as developers.  </p><p>A lot of what underlies a good developer experience really comes out of the build system that you use and also there’s a lot of beautiful ideas and structure inside of build systems. Sadly, a lot of that beauty is obscured by a complex thicket of messy systems of different kinds and a complicated ecosystem of different build systems for different purposes, and I’m hoping that Andrey can help us see through some of that thicket down to some of the elegance of all of this underneath.  </p><p>Andrey is a great person to have that conversation with because he’s had a long and interesting experience with build systems having done some work on Hadrian, which is the build system for the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a> and having written a few important papers that try and analyze and break down the ecosystem of build systems and help you understand kind of what’s going on fundamentally underneath, and finally, in the last few years, Andrey has been working here working on Jane Street build systems.  </p><p>So, thanks Andrey for joining me, and maybe to start with, you can start by explaining to us a little bit about what a build system is.</p></div>

<h2 id="140">1:40</h2>


<div><p>Hi, Ron. It’s great to be on the podcast. So what is a build system?  Build systems automate the execution of various tasks of individual developers like me and whole companies like Jane Street. So, as a software developer, what are the kind of tasks that I need to do every day? I need to compile and recompile source files. I need to run some tests. I need to keep my documentation up to date. There are lots of tasks like this.  </p><p>Every task is pretty simple and straightforward on its own, but there are a lot of them, and they are tedious and I need to remember to do them in the right order, so it’s great to have some automation that does it for me. In the old days, like, how would you do this without automation, you would just write a script, and the script was your build system. And that’s how I worked myself when I used to work on projects with just a few files. And it works perfectly fine in those settings.</p></div>

<h2 id="223">2:23</h2>


<p>Beyond just using simple scripts, what’s the next step up available to developers in terms of automation?</p>

<h2 id="227">2:27</h2>


<div><p>Well, before, I don’t know, 1976 when Make was developed, there was nothing else and people were just writing scripts. And projects were getting bigger and bigger, it became difficult and at some point Make was developed to automate this. So Make was a huge breakthrough. It’s very simple. It allows you to write down the tasks that you need to execute and each task has some inputs and some outputs and the task itself, so what kind of command line you need to run to execute this task.  </p><p>And this very simple approach worked very well and it’s still being used these days. So these days I would say Make is still the most popular build system out there. If you go to a random open source project you will find a Makefile there.</p></div>

<h2 id="308">3:08</h2>


<p>Which on some level is kind of astonishing, just given how old Make is.</p>

<h2 id="311">3:11</h2>


<p>I’m amazed at how successful Make was and still is.</p>

<h2 id="314">3:14</h2>


<p>What was the thing that made Make such a big step forward?</p>

<h2 id="316">3:16</h2>


<p>Well, it was easy to use, right? You just write a few rules and the format for specifying those rules is pretty straightforward. It’s just a text file. And Make is available to you on pretty much any system. You type Make and it works. I guess it’s that kind of conceptual simplicity which attracted a lot of people to it, and of course also the pain that they had experienced before when they had to run all those tasks manually and they kept forgetting to run things in the right order. And I think this was one of the direct motivations of creating Make.</p>

<h2 id="345">3:45</h2>


<p>So, you talk about having a simple conceptual model, and what is that model on some level when you configure a job in Make, what you’re doing is specifying a collection of rules. Each rule says what you do, what’s the command you run to execute that rule, what it depends on and what it produces, and now Make has what is essentially a graph like model representing what are the things you need to do and what are the dependencies. Given that simple model, what are the services that Make now provides to you that you didn’t have before?</p>

<h2 id="412">4:12</h2>


<div><p>The main benefit of using Make compared to a script is that Make only reruns the tasks that need to be rerun. So how does it figure it out?  When you have like 1000 files in your project and you edit a single source file, if you run the script, it will basically recompile all 1000 files and then maybe relink some executables and rerun all the tests. And obviously that’s very wasteful. If you’ve only edited one file, only one file need to be recompiled.  </p><p>Make figures this out by just looking at timestamps. So, it just looks at the time of the file that you’ve just edited and it’s newer than the file that depends on it, so that files that depends on it needs to be recompiled and then its timestamp is updated, and so this wave of changes propagates through the build graph that you have and at the end for every task that you have in your description, you have the simple rule that everything that all the inputs of the task produced before the task, the outputs of the task have reproduced. This is before/after relationship is enforced everywhere in the build graph.</p></div>

<h2 id="511">5:11</h2>


<p>Right. Service number one that’s provided is incrementality. Small changes require small amounts of work in response to them.</p>

<h2 id="519">5:19</h2>


<p>That’s right. Yeah.</p>

<h2 id="520">5:20</h2>


<div><p>And this is important to developers kind of for obvious reasons, which is to say a key thing you want from your tools is responsiveness. You want to do something, see the results, think about whether that was the right thing to do and go back and make other changes, and so having tools that are responsive is enormously helpful. There’s a couple of the things that come to mind for me in terms of what Make helps out with. One of them is, it helps get the build right. One of the tricks with rebuilding your software is making sure that you’ve done all the things that you need to do. Like you could imagine that you changed a file and then you remember to rebuild that but you didn’t remember to rebuild everything that depended on it.  </p><p>And so having a simple language where you can express the dependencies and then once you get it right, you have a system that takes care of running things in the right order. There’s just a whole class of errors that you can make either in manual construction of a script or a manual kicking off of build tasks that just go away. I guess another thing is parallelism. There’s the incrementality of only having to do a small amount of work, but having this graph structured representation of the build also helps you kick off things in parallel.</p></div>

<h2 id="620">6:20</h2>


<p>Yeah. Absolutely. Like trying to maintain this parallelism by hand in a build script would be pretty annoying, right? You add a new file and suddenly you have a new dependency and need to rearrange the parallelism. Having some automation here is great as well.</p>

<h2 id="633">6:33</h2>


<p>Okay. This all sounds like a very short story. We had this problem, how to build things. A nice system like Make came out. It has a clean way of expressing dependencies and giving you some services off the back of that specification. All done, problem solved. What’s missing?  Why is the story of Make from 1976 not enough?</p>

<h2 id="651">6:51</h2>


<div><p>There are few things that are missing in Make. One of them as I mentioned, the way Make determines that a task needs to be rebuilt, is by looking at timestamps but very often this is too limiting. Let me give you a common example. You edit a source file by just adding a comment and as a result, you recompile that file and the result doesn’t change, but the timestamp does change anyway.  </p><p>It means that everything that depended on that file needs to be recompiled if you’re using Make. This is one of the problems that basically sometimes you want what we call “early cutoff” in build systems. If you recompile a file and the result is the same, you don’t want to recompile everything else that depends on it, so this is one feature that was missing.</p></div>

<h2 id="729">7:29</h2>


<p>Right. Essentially the problem is that the heuristic that Make uses for figuring out what needs to be redone is overly conservative, right? It will refire when it doesn’t strictly speaking need to refire.</p>

<h2 id="738">7:38</h2>


<p>That’s right. It’s overly conservative, at the same time I like it a lot because it basically just repurposes existing information. It’s just the information that is out there. The file system records modification times. Make itself doesn’t store anything at all, which is a very nice property to have. But if you want to support things like early cutoff you now need to start storing some information.</p>

<h2 id="757">7:57</h2>


<p>Right. I guess in addition Make’s timestamp-based recomputation is, as you say, overly conservative. It’s also under conservative, isn’t it?  I.e., it will fail to rebuild in some cases where it should.</p>

<h2 id="808">8:08</h2>


<p>Yeah and it’s fairly common for example, that various like backup software, for example, would mess up modification times, which would basically cause your project not to compile correctly and then you would have to go for the so-called “clean build” to just get around that limitation. Yes. Make’s reliance on timestamps is problematic.</p>

<h2 id="825">8:25</h2>


<p>Something goes wrong with Make, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>In our tumultuous</strong> present, mindfulness and meditation can seem like attractive ways to process difficult feelings and emotions. Meditative practices have long been a support strategy for traditional cultures facing collective trauma, and a method for bringing individuals and communities into mutual solidarity. Tibetan refugees, who have lived through cultural genocide, use meditation and ritual to join with their spiritual ancestors. In this way, they experience their own suffering as a doorway into compassion for others.</p>
<p>Tibetan culture, through its resilience, kindness, intelligence and joy, has inspired millions of people in the West to take up meditation. But are the practices that many of us turn to the same in substance as the rituals that other communities have relied upon for centuries? In most cases, the answer is no: they have a profoundly different orientation and, significantly, they lack the crucial communal features that make traditional meditation so vital and nurturing for the brain and body. In fact, modern meditation can often work against us â€“ reinforcing our separation from others, rather than strengthening the social bonds that are needed to overcome adversity and barriers to compassion.</p>
<p>The traditional and modern approaches to meditation are shaped by two distinct visions of the person. Those in traditional contemplative cultures typically understand persons to be constituted by their relationship to others, as the historian David McMahan <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195183276.001.0001/acprof-9780195183276">notes</a> in <em>The Making of Buddhist Modernism</em> (2008). As a consequence, practitioners first learn to experience themselves in meditation as empowered and supported by the care, compassion and wisdom of their spiritual ancestors and community. By contrast, citizens of the modern West often see persons as individual selves that exist prior to the community â€“ atomistic individuals who choose whether or not to enter into relationships.</p>
<p>These different conceptions of the person have important consequences for meditation. In the modern view, practitioners tend to think of meditation as an autonomous project of self-help: through their own efforts, they try to foster beneficial states of mind. Socially conditioned in this way, Westerners enter into â€˜lovingkindness meditationâ€™ (<em>metta</em>) as a way of summoning up a sense of love for themselves and those they feel close to; then, for those theyâ€™re neutral towards; and, finally, for people they dislike.</p>
<p>For traditional Buddhist communities, any such meditation wouldnâ€™t begin with an atomistic self who is trying to generate a positive mindset from scratch. In such cultures, practitioners begin meditation with rituals and prayers that remind them that they are part of a connected community, blessed and supported by a lineage of spiritual ancestors that spans many generations. This starting point is shared by contemplative and ritual forms of Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and many indigenous religions. In Tibetan Buddhism, for example, meditators envision a field of refuge that includes buddhas, bodhisattvas, spiritual teachers and other inspiring figures, who bless and sustain them and their world within qualities of unconditional love, compassion and wisdom. Practitionersâ€™ efforts to cultivate those same qualities begin not with self-help, but with the support and empowerment of their teachers and communities. In this way, the person meditating learns to become an extension of that field of love and compassion in which they are held, by progressively extending love and compassion to others.</p>
<p>Modern meditation and mindfulness, beginning with an atomistic sense of self, can reinforce an individualâ€™s sense of disconnection</p>
<p><strong>This kind of</strong> deeply supportive framework, found in all contemplative traditions, is mostly absent from modern meditation programmes. Because these communal dimensions of blessing and empowerment are embedded in premodern, ritualised cosmologies, they are often deemed an unneeded byproduct of â€˜primitive culturesâ€™, which can be jettisoned in order to â€˜moderniseâ€™ the practice. However, these cosmologies serve a valuable function that maps directly onto attachment theory, one of the most influential approaches to developmental and social psychology.</p>
<p>Attachment theory is based on the idea that the care that children receive in infancy stays with them through their lifespan â€“ for better or worse. Infants who receive sensitive and responsive care go on to develop a self that they feel is worthy of love. In turn, this supports their curiosity and courage to explore the world, because they trust that a source of security and support is available when needed. Sporadic or unreliable care, on the other hand, fosters insecurity and a distrust in support from others in times of need.</p>
<p>But the experience of security and insecurity is not locked in at infancy. Feelings of security and insecurity accrue throughout oneâ€™s life from relationships with peers, mentors, romantic partners and so on. This means that we all have traces of security and insecurity in different relational contexts. Through the lens of attachment theory, the ritual and devotional practices of traditional contemplative cultures, which are repeated many thousands of times throughout a personâ€™s life, offer a powerful field of care in which practitioners experience themselves as recipients of love, compassion and wisdom. From this secure base, they are empowered to extend sustainable, inclusive and unconditional care to others.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, humans come prepared with capacities for care and compassion. But without the experience of actually receiving care, people can develop inner psychological blocks to compassion â€“ including a lack of inner security, courage and confidence. Lack of security can foster aversion to othersâ€™ suffering, a sense of isolation and biases against others. These psychological barriers interact with and are reinforced by systemic inequities such as racism, classism, sexism and homophobia.</p>
<p>Modern meditation and mindfulness, by beginning with an atomistic sense of self, can increase an individualâ€™s sense of disconnection. They can present meditation as a passive source of comfort for the self, instead of a practice that uses discomfort to create solidarity with other sufferers. In her <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300215809/american-dharma">book</a> <em>American Dharma</em> (2019), the Buddhist scholar Ann Gleig documents how communally oriented meditation can help people to become conscious of socially conditioned traumas, to heal internalised racism, and to tolerate the discomfort that conversations about race and privilege can generate.</p>
<p>Traditional cultures of compassion training strive to dismantle barriers to compassion by bringing to mind a field of care in which practitioners are held and supported, and from which they can learn to hold and support others. This relational starting point promotes resilience and connectivity, and bolsters the psychological and social resources we need today to confront systemic injustice. But how might secular people in modern individualistic cultures gain access to such communal benefits?</p>
<p>By reinhabiting moments of supportive caring connection, we can establish a core of inner safety that can be returned to again and again</p>
<p><strong>Research findings in psychology</strong> show that feelings of security can be temporarily increased, including among people who have predominantly insecure attachment histories. Social psychologists developed a method called <em>attachment security priming</em>, in which participants are asked to visualise a moment of receiving care from a loving figure, a trusted friend, or simply by thinking of words such as â€˜loveâ€™, â€˜safetyâ€™ or â€˜careâ€™ for a moment. These simple priming <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16351370/">exercises</a> temporarily increase feelings of security, safety and courage. In turn, participants are more likely to offer help to others, have more patience listening to othersâ€™ difficult emotions, and possess less bias against other groups. This research suggests that attachment security priming could be integrated into meditation to recover the relational basis of the practice.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://mindrxiv.org/dmxj7/">article</a> forthcoming in the journal <em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em>, we introduce a relational starting point of support for meditation, derived from traditional Tibetan practice, and informed by research on attachment security priming. There are various ways to engage a relational starting point for meditation, depending on oneâ€™s own life experience, background and worldview:</p><ul>
<li>You can recall a simple moment of supportive caring connection with another person, from any time in your life, and re-inhabit that caring moment as if itâ€™s happening now â€“ evoking a rich experience of loving qualities and energies in mind and body. For example, Paul can call to mind playing cards with his loving grandmother at her kitchen counter, and John can recall a moment visiting a joyfully welcoming aunt as a young child.</li>
<li>A second option is to bring to mind someone to whom you feel grateful for their impact on your life, and experience the uplifting quality of imagining that person as present with you now.</li>
<li>A third option, if you practise in any spiritual tradition, is to bring to mind a saint, divine figure or field of spiritual ancestors, with whom you feel a deep connection.</li>
<li>If none of those options resonate, you might recall a time you spent somewhere special to you in the natural world â€“ a place that felt deeply welcoming or peaceful. Or recall a loving moment with a pet. Or bring vividly to mind a moment when you were a loving presence to another person.</li>
</ul><p>According to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/78/embodied-and-grounded-cognition#overview">theories</a> of embodied cognition, when we recall any such caring moment, it is simulated and re-enacted in multiple systems of the brain and body, including perceptual, motor, visual and affective systems. During the caring moment practice, we can visualise and simulate a felt sense of security, by experiencing that moment as if it were happening now, along with …</p></div></div></div>

  <div dir="auto">
    <p>I don’t like how modern web applications are built. Many of the web applications
are too unstable, That you can’t imagine having the system running without a
team supporting it. The fact that we try to automate manual processes then the
automation needs manual intervention defies the purpose. Some companies has an
army of developers if they were to do the business by hand they would make a
better job than the programmed system. There are many reasons for this
situation. One of the reasons is the excessive use of third party dependencies.</p>

<p>Lets take a look on a basic modern web based system, There are several layers
on software running on the machine, starting from firmware to your business
logic.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_212438.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_212438.jpg"></p>

<p>I don’t think this is very helpful to understand the gravity of the situation.
There are many actors that are not considered in this picture. Layers are also
missing because they are implicit in other layers. Lets expand these hidden
layers and actors. It will help us understand better why that small Nodejs or
RubyOnRails application we wrote isn’t just one layer in this picture.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_214548.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_214548.jpg"></p>

<p>Here are the layers we added this time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>System core utilities</li>
  <li>Other processes your application depends on like “memcached, Redis, MySQL,
Postgres…etc”</li>
  <li>Third party code your application depends on an ORM, Template engine,
pagination library, a library that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/">pads your string with
spaces</a> just
because.</li>
  <li>Server applications that sits in front of your code handling HTTP and response
compression…etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of these layers there is <strong>at least</strong> one team responsible for
maintaining it.</p>

<p>Again, We missed other layers and people in this picture. Most of the
applications are using external SAAS providers for logs or monitoring or bug
reporting or provide parts of the system functionality that can take more time
to build by the company team. lets add them to the picture along with their
teams.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_221047.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_221047.jpg"></p>

<p>This picture is for one application, I won’t expand it to a whole system with
different services and programs that is the reality of all companies.
Lets stick to one application for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>So here is the first point I want to make: With every service you use you’re not
just a user, This service is now part of your application, You are held
responsible for it’s behavior and misbehaving. You will inherit bugs in their
system. When this service team is affected by COVID-19 and get reduced to the
point where they can’t fix issues you will be affected too. When They get slower
your application will get slower too. When their service is down your
application will experience malfunction too, Your system and theirs is now
connected. So add external services integration cautiously. By adding an
external system you’re putting your trust in this service team and their ability
in delivering what the service is promising now <strong>and</strong> in the future. This is not
an easy decision and it should be treated as such.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_224907.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_224907.jpg"></p>

<p>Now lets move to the direct dependencies of your application. If you’re using
any modern programming language it’ll have a way to package code into reusable
format that could be reused by other applications. one package can use code from
other packages, these packages can use other packages and so on like a tree.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_231326.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_231326.jpg"></p>

<p>With every package in this tree we depend on the code inside this package and
the team that maintains it. A freshly generated rails project depends on 74
packages for ruby and <code>Yarn list</code> that lists JavaScript dependencies output 3102
lines, that’s 3176 packages with teams maintaining them and bugs and new
versions all the time.</p>

<p>This is wrong for many reasons. I will list some of them here for the sake of
clarity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have put your trust in at least 3176 other developers. You have never met
them, never talked to them, there are no guarantee they will continue to
maintain this package. There are no guarantee they won’t put code in their
package to show <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/npm-bans-terminal-ads/">ads in your
terminal</a> or <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/dk/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hacker-infects-node-js-package-to-steal-from-bitcoin-wallets">code that
steals your bitcoin wallets
</a>.</li>
  <li>You are not really using all of this code. When someone is writing an open
source package it will suffer sooner or later from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">feature
creeping</a> You are probably using
couple features of this package and don’t need the rest, but you wanted the
banana and got the whole forest now.</li>
  <li>With every package update you’re inventing unnecessary work for yourself. New
versions of packages are released all the time. Updating your project to <strong>get
the latest bug fixes and features</strong> is usually what people do. Most of the
time because of feature creeping these versions changes are not relevant to
you at all, but you won’t know until you read the change log. If it’s relevant
to your project you’ll need to do an update. if something is deprecated or
changed you’ll need to change your code. So suddenly someone somewhere is
telling you to change your code. That’s part of the control you have over your
code handed over to someone you never talked to or knew.</li>
  <li>When your programming language has a new release you can’t update unless all of
your dependencies are up to date. For ruby 2.7.0 for example some language syntax is
now deprecated and shows warning when you run your project. So to fix that you
either fix it in the package and open a PR with the change or wait for the
maintainer to update it.</li>
  <li>When you encounter a bug in a dependency you will have to understand this
package code, fork, branch, fix rinse and repeat. That requires a some
cooperation from the library maintainer which is most of the time isn’t
possible because most of the open source projects are voluntarily maintained.</li>
  <li>Developing new features or modifying existing features are ordre of magnitude
harder. You’ll need to dig into the documentation of the dependencies looking
for support for this little feature you want to add. That is if there is any
documentation at all for that part of the code. Otherwise you’ll have to dig
in to the library code.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the second point I want to make: Using external library implies that you
trust the maintainer and you also inherit his decisions about using other
libraries and so forth. This decision should be weighed based on the benefit of
the library and how many of it’s features you’re going to use and other factors
like the maturity and how responsive is the maintainer, please don’t use GitHub
stars as a factor in your decision it’s misleading. And if the part you use from
the library isn’t too big I recommend using the library to save some time and
effort upfront but make sure you get rid of it and implement the part you need.
An example of that is a pagination library like rails “Kaminari” if you’re using
it to save you some time then sure. But keep on your todo list a task to remove
it and implement the feature yourself. An example of libraries that’s hard to
get rid of it “OpenCV” This is something that reimplementing the part you need
probably will be a huge task so it can stay. You’ll need to use your best
judgment to decide between these 2 sides of the spectrum.</p>

<p>I like to think of what I do as building an automated system, I would like this
system to run by itself, keep itself clean and healthy, doesn’t need manual
intervention. If the whole team disappeared out of existence I would like that
system to work for a very long time without any supervision.</p>

<p>More code means more bugs for me to fix, by extension more code that I didn’t write
means more bugs that I probably can’t solve. This is dangerous and shouldn’t be
taken lightly. Extending your code with external libraries or systems can cut
down effort hence the cost of development. But when this is taken lightly it
backfires badly.</p>

<p>Distributed cloud applications (aka microservices) have introduced an enormous
amount of complexity into the design and operation of cloud software. What used
to manifest itself as complexity hidden within a single process or runtime now
finds itself spread across tens or hundreds of loosely coupled services. While
all of these services can use different languages and can scale independently
from one another, the distributed nature can often make the app as a whole hard
to navigate, hard to deploy, and hard secure.</p>
<p>This new complexity makes it increasingly difficult to manage and contribute to
cloud-native applications, and beckons questions as to how we can maintain
healthy cloud software. How can we take advantage of the benefits of
service-oriented design without introducing friction and cost elsewhere?</p>
<p>Fortunately we've run into this problem before. Microservices aren't the first
pattern that has forced developers to figure out how to collaborate and
contribute to endless webs of interconnected components. For the last few
decades the solution has been the same: <strong>dependency management</strong>.</p>
<p>We use dependency managers every day to re-use public and private software
packages, build upon the work of others, and gracefully encapulate the details
of our own work into consumable formats. There are a number of reasons why
dependency management is the key to unlocking the power of distributed software,
and it's high time we learn from the past to power the future of cloud-native
development.</p>
<h2 id="1-developer-collaboration"><a href="#1-developer-collaboration" aria-label="1 developer collaboration permalink"></a>1. Developer collaboration</h2>
<p>One of the most important functions of dependency managers like
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>, <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/">Pip</a>,
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html">Maven</a>, and others, is to broker
collaboration amongst developers. By providing a consistent packaging mechanic
that seamlessly enables code to be extended, dependency managers have enabled
otherwise unrelated teams to consume each other's work. While these tools can be
used within the walls of enterprises to enable teams to publish and collaborate
on their work, we've seen dependency managers used at a much grander scale to
broker collaboration within the open-source community. The consistency of the
tooling and width of adoption has enabled the creation of enormously powerful
and freely accessible libraries for all to use and continue to build upon.</p>
<p>While this level of collaboration has been realized within the communities for
individual languages (NPM for Javascript, Pip for Python, etc.), it has yet to
be fully realized within the cloud-native community. We fortunately have Docker
to create consistency in how cloud services are packaged, but containers don't
have enough information about the relationships between services to resolve and
extend dependencies. Adding proper dependency management to index and resolve
relationships to peer apps and services is critical if we want to realize for
microservices what others already do with libraries in individual languages.</p>
<h2 id="2-self-service-environments"><a href="#2-self-service-environments" aria-label="2 self service environments permalink"></a>2. Self-service environments</h2>
<p>The collaborative effects of dependency managers don't happen by magic. The main
reason consistent dependency resolvers are so powerful is because developers all
around the world are able to reproduce their effects using the same commands and
processes. Reproducibility is a key element of dependency managers. Without it,
no one would be able to download and operate libraries and packages created by
others without complex, custom bootstrapping logic – the creation of which would
be an enormous barrier to adoption and distribution.</p>
<p>Service-oriented applications are no different from language-specific libraries
in this regard. Our ability to extend the work of others is predicated on our
ability to run or otherwise access the services and applications we hope to make
calls to. Teams have been able to make due by operating centralized QA or
sandbox environments, but the inability to reproduce these environments creates
a new set of problems. Engineers can't operate their own development
environments, services that depend on others can't be easily shipped, developers
are forced to write their own scripts to run their app locally and remotely, and
every team needs to about production-grade tools, networking, and network
security. By leveraging a consistent, dependency management solution, teams need
only to assert the network dependencies for their services to give everyone in
the org a consistent way to spin up services in their stack along with its
dependencies – allowing everyone to operate their own environments.</p>
<h2 id="3-automation"><a href="#3-automation" aria-label="3 automation permalink"></a>3. Automation</h2>
<p>The self-service benefits of consistent dependency management doesn't just mean
that developers can operate their own environments. It also means that
environments can be provisioned and torn down through automation. The
consistency of a single command or process to resolve dependencies, enrich
networking, and automate security is the perfect recipe for integration into
CI/CD pipelines!</p>
<p>If every service can be run consistently (e.g. with container platforms) and is
aware of its own dependencies, new environments can be provisioned for each
merge request and changes can be seamlessly promoted into staging and production
when merged into relevant branches. This means that every team can achieve
scalable
<a href="https://thenewstack.io/what-is-gitops-and-why-it-might-be-the-next-big-thing-for-devops/">GitOps</a>
for every developer and every new service added to the application.</p>
<h2 id="4-security"><a href="#4-security" aria-label="4 security permalink"></a>4. Security</h2>
<p>One of the risks introduced by microservice architectures is the need for each
service to expose APIs that broker access to their functionality. Since these
services live as separate processes, communication over a network is one of the
only ways for them to connect to each other and receive requests for processing.
This means that each new service exposes an interface that can be accessed by
others, and if developers aren't careful they can accidentally expose it to the
wrong parties.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.architect.io/images/blog/why-distributed-apps-need-dependency-management/declare-data-breach.webp" alt="Cloud Security"></p>
<p>Preventing accidental exposure of network interfaces is yet another area where
dependency management can provide support. With developers providing a
structured index of their own service's network dependencies, not only can we
automatically resolve those dependencies, but we can also enrich the environment
with the corresponding network policies required to lock it down – only services
that depend on each other can access each other. This structured approach
drastically reduces the need for developers to understand network security
tooling, and opens them up to create new services more freely.</p>
<h2 id="5-flexibility"><a href="#5-flexibility" aria-label="5 flexibility permalink"></a>5. Flexibility</h2>
<p>Another benefit of dependency management with respect to microservices and
distributed applications is flexibility. With developers capturing the details
of their immediate dependencies and associating them with their own services,
the resolver itself is free to instrument the relationships in unique ways in
each environment that gets deployed. Want to try out a different API gateway or
service mesh? Want to instrument distributed tracing by capturing ingress and
egress traffic from each service? With automation that can hook into the
dependency resolver, operators are free to experiment with new tools and configs
without any code changes to existing services or distractions for developers.</p>
<h2 id="why-doesnt-it-already-exist"><a href="#why-doesnt-it-already-exist" aria-label="why doesnt it already exist permalink"></a>Why doesn't it already exist?</h2>
<p>Dependency resolution would be an enormously powerful tool solution to enable
developers to collaborate and contribute to cloud-native applications, but can't
we use the vast number of package managers that already exist to help with
instrumentation? While it would be nice to use existing tools, resolving
dependencies for networked applications isn't the same as resolving the
relationships between libraries and binaries.</p>
<p>The download of code artifacts that fulfill dependency requirements for
libraries all happens at build-time to create one master binary/library.
Microservices however don't get bundled into single binaries and instead need to
be run as independent services and then connected to over a network. This means
that the resolution strategy has additional steps, and happens at an entirely
different lifecycle stage than regular libraries. Turns out, the earliest point
in an application lifecycle that we can properly resolve dependencies for
distributed applications is at deploy-time. It is at this point that we know
both the relationships between all services in the stack as well as the tooling
and details of the target environment needed to properly provision and connect
services.</p>
<p>To sum it up, it's hard to create a large scale resolver for network
dependencies, but doing so would provide enormous benefits to engineering teams
and the cloud community as a whole. If we're to properly navigate the growing
landscape of cloud-native tools, we'll need to learn from dependency management
practices of the past.</p></div></div></div>]]>

People want to make it complicated.</p>
<p>My brain isn’t that smart – I need to dumb things down. And it ends up, dumbing things down can usually elevate your chances of success. </p>
<p>When I consider a project, I like to compare it to a washing machine.</p>
<p>Washing machines do <span>one thing</span>. </p>
<p>Set a cycle, mash a button, and the receptacle goes to work.</p>
<p>It doesn’t dry clothes. It doesn’t fold clothes. It doesn’t warn you when you throw a red shirt in with all your whites.</p>
<p>It just washes.</p>
<p>Here in the United States, consumers purchase one metal box to clean, plus one metal box to dry. You’d think we’d have combined them by now, like Europe has, but no – – separate. And we sorta prefer it that way.</p>
<p>I admire that simplicity. Simplicity can be an unfair advantage, if you think about it.</p>
<p>One of my projects involves <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/">selling sweet Vidalia onions</a>. A lot of my customers ask: “What else does your farm sell online, Peter?”</p>
<p>My answer: “Nothing, just onions.”</p>
<p>At the beginning of that project, my monkey brain kept insisting we expand into other categories.</p>
<p><strong><em>“SELL <span>&nbsp;GEORGIA PEACHES!&nbsp;</span>“</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; it’d say. </p>
<p><strong><em>“OH OH! <span>&nbsp;GEORGIA PECANS!&nbsp;</span>“</em></strong></p>
<p>I allowed it to chirp over the course of two shipping seasons, but by the third, I’d duct taped its mouth.</p>
<p><em>Where my internal monologue wound up, was here</em>: Why downshift into another category when our primary continues to grow 25%-50% every year? Why water down my attention when our principal has clearly struck a nerve? And hell, we’re still tweaking logistics, customer support, quality control, etal on Vidalia anyway. It’s nowhere near perfected.</p>
<p>Growth for growth’s sake doesn’t make sense to me. We’re not Amazon. We don’t want to be Amazon. We’re privately owned &amp; family operated – we don’t have to listen to that diatribe.</p>
<p><em><strong>What does make sense</strong> is controlled growth</em>, with a strong connection to our product &amp; customers. Correction, an <em><strong>intense</strong></em> connection with our product &amp; customers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>A couple of years ago, while I was still working at Apollo, <a href="https://github.com/leebyron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee Byron</a>, <a href="https://github.com/robzhu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Zhu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dotansimha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dotan simha</a> and <a href="https://github.com/urigo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I</a> worked on the GraphQL Subscriptions spec and the reference implementation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>During that work, we created and merged the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference implementation into graphql-js</a> and created two supporting libraries: <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graphql-subscriptions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subscriptions-transport-ws</a>. Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/Wi7P39sF2nw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk with deep dive into all the details</a>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Since leaving Apollo, <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/issues/777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not a lot of work has been gone into those libraries</a>.
That's why I was so thrilled that <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Denis</a> decided to pick up that important work and create a new library for the WebSocket Protocol.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We will support his work of maintaining the library and standardizing it with the GraphQL over HTTP working group.
This is a part of a lot of exciting work coming up about GraphQL and real-time, so follow us for new things in this space!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Denis will take it away from here!</p></blockquote><h3>Introduction</h3><p>At some point in time during your web development journeys, you may’ve been faced with the challenge to add a real-time component. The synonym for realtime in the browser is the WebSocket API. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is how MDN’s describes it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user’s browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.</p></blockquote><p>Google Chrome was the first browser to support the WebSocket Protocol, adding support in 2009 - two years before it was officially standardised in 2011. As the need for full-duplex server-client communications rose, other browsers followed suit.</p><p>As of today, all major browsers support the WebSocket Protocol - see the <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=Web%20Sockets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can I Use table</a>.</p><h3>WebSockets ❤️ GraphQL</h3><p>Okay, so, how do I use WebSockets to add support for the <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Subscription" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL <code>subscription</code> operation</a>? Doing a basic Google search, you’d be faced with a single solution, namely <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>subscriptions-transport-ws</code></a>. Looking through the repository, checking recent comments, reading through the issues and open PRs - might have you notice the abundance of bugs and their security implications. <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-transport-ws/issues/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A summary can be found here</a>.</p><p>The authors have done a brilliant job, but unfortunately other projects and needs have reduced their disposable time for maintaining and nurturing this well accomplished, yet needy, idea. But, it did indeed inspire me to take up their legacy and revitalised it! Having faced various WebSocket challenges with GraphQL myself - I jumped in writing a new library from scratch.</p><p>With no further ado - I humbly introduce <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-transport-ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>graphql-transport-ws</code></a>. A coherent, feature-full, zero-dependency, plug-n-play, lazy, simple, server and client implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new, security first GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol</a> with full support for all 3 GraphQL operations: <code>Queries</code>, <code>Mutations</code> and <code>Subscriptions</code>. The protocol aims to be standardised and become a part of GraphQL with the help of the foundation’s <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL over HTTP work group</a>.</p><p>The library is written in TypeScript and the full implementation totals merely ~1000 lines of well formatted, commented, code. It leverages modern JavaScript primitives and the well established presence of WebSockets.</p><h3>How do I get started?</h3><p>I am glad you asked!

With this launch,  developers using Twilio's Programmable Voice get an <a href="https://www.voicegain.ai/post/speech-to-text-accuracy-benchmark-september-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>accurate</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://www.voicegain.ai/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>affordable</u></a>, and easy to use ASR/Speech-to-text platform to build speech-IVRs or Voice Bots.</p><h2 id="viewer-3b1oa">Key Features of Twilio Media Streams support</h2><p id="viewer-2dncc">Voicegain Twilio Media Streams support gives developers the following features:</p><ol><li id="viewer-aa64c"><p><strong>Grammar Support: </strong>Developers can now write speech IVR applications that use <strong>grammars</strong>. Many traditional VoiceXML IVRs are built using grammars. However, until now Twilio TwiML did not support use of speech grammars as the &lt;Gather&gt; command supports only text capture. This made it hard to migrate existing VoiceXML IVR applications to the Twilio platform. Mapping of text to semantic meaning had to be done separately, plus large vocabulary recognizer was more likely  to return spurious recognitions. Voicegain solves these problems by supporting both <strong>GRXML </strong>and <strong>JSGF </strong>speech grammars at the core speech-to-text (ASR) engine level. This delivers higher accuracy compared to an ASR that uses a large vocabulary language model to recognize text and then applies grammars to the recognized text. </p></li><li id="viewer-2lkid"><p><strong>90% Savings on ASR Licensing costs: </strong>Build <strong>low cost</strong> speech IVR application. -- A big advantage for developers of the Twilio Programmable Voice platform has been its affordable pricing. However, that was not necessarily true for existing ASR options like &lt;Gather&gt; that is priced at 2 cents for 15 seconds (with 15 second minimum) or 8 cents per minute. With Voicegain the <a href="https://www.voicegain.ai/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>price</u></strong></a><strong> is 1.25 cents per minute</strong> measured at 1 second increments.  Including the billing increment, <strong>we are 90% cheaper. </strong></p></li><li id="viewer-df1pl"><p><strong>Better Timeout Support: </strong>Voicegain supports configurable timeouts for no-input, <strong>complete timeout</strong> and incomplete timeout. Because the grammar is integrated with the recognizer, Voicegain ASR is able to deliver accurate complete timeout response which is not possible with &lt;Gather&gt; command for which the only way to tell if the caller stopped speaking is a large enough pause. </p></li><li id="viewer-7mckv"><p>Simplify <strong>dynamic prompt playback</strong>. -- In order to make use of &lt;Connect&gt;&lt;Stream&gt; as easy as possible, we support passing prompts when invoking &lt;Stream&gt;. Prompts can be provided either as text or as URLs. If provided as text then Voicegain will either use TTS or perform dynamic concatenation of prerecorded prompts.  A prompt manager for such prerecorded prompts is provided as part of Voicegain Web Portal. 
Configurable <strong>barge-in </strong>is supported for the prompts.</p></li><li id="viewer-auc98"><p><strong>Fine-tune and test grammars</strong>. -- Voicegain Web Portal includes a tool for reviewing and fine tuning grammars. The tool also supports regression tests. With this functionality you will never have to deploy grammars without knowing how well they are going to perform after changes.</p></li></ol><h2 id="viewer-9t19d">How Twilio Media Streams works with Voicegain </h2><div id="viewer-f0q42"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.voicegain.ai/post/announcing-twilio-twiml-connect-stream-support" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e90723_efa9609d4fc345188b98e3e91f4dd19d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_901,h_509,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e90723_efa9609d4fc345188b98e3e91f4dd19d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-f3v81">TwiML &lt;Stream&gt; requires a websocket url.

The websocket URL will be returned in the response.  </p><div id="viewer-1tiqr"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.voicegain.ai/post/announcing-twilio-twiml-connect-stream-support" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e90723_04f7848807a349069c88b747fca35bcc~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_896,h_555,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e90723_04f7848807a349069c88b747fca35bcc~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-4cgk5">In addition to the wss url, Custom Parameters within &lt;Connect&gt;&lt;Stream&gt; command are used to pass information about the question prompt to be played  to the caller by Voicegain. This can be a text or a url to a service that will provide the audio.</p><p id="viewer-chsps">Once &lt;Connect&gt;&lt;Stream&gt; has been invoked, Voicegain platform takes over-  it:</p><ul><li id="viewer-4k6o4"><p>Plays the prompt via the back channel of &lt;Stream&gt;</p></li><li id="viewer-dl5vs"><p>As soon as caller starts speaking, the prompt playback is stopped (if it it was still playing) exactly like in &lt;Gather&gt;</p></li><li id="viewer-400cn"><p>Spoken words are are recognized using grammar. Recognition result is then provided as a callback from Voicegain Platform. In case of no-input or no-match an appropriate callback will also be made.</p></li><li id="viewer-39pqs"><p>&lt;Stream&gt; connection is stopped and the TwiML application will continue with a next command.</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5oe9j">BTW, we do support DTMF input as an alternative to speech input. </p><p id="viewer-4bi5v">[UPDATE: you can see more details of how to use Voicegain with Twilio Media Streams in this new <a href="https://www.voicegain.ai/post/how-to-use-voicegain-with-twilio-media-streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Blog post</u></a>.]</p><h2 id="viewer-5rju5">Other features of the Voicegain Platform</h2><p id="viewer-afees"><strong>1. On Premise Edge Support: </strong>While Voicegain APIs are available as a cloud PaaS service, Voicegain also supports OnPrem/Edge deployment. Voicegain can be deployed as a containerized service on a single node Kubernetes cluster, or onto multi-node high-availability Kubernetes cluster (on your GPU hardware or your VPC).</p><p id="viewer-e2nci"><strong>2. Acoustic model customization:</strong> This allows to achieve very high accuracy beyond what is possible with out of the box recognizers. The grammar tuning and regression tool mentioned earlier, can be used to collect training data for acoustic model customization.</p><h2 id="viewer-9md6b">More Features Coming </h2><p id="viewer-1ghtq">On our near-term roadmap for Twilio users we have several more features:</p><ul><li id="viewer-1th58"><p>Advanced <strong>Answering Machine Detection</strong> (AMD) -- will be invoked using &lt;Connect&gt;&lt;Stream&gt; and will provide very accurate answering machine detection using speech recognition.</p></li><li id="viewer-93p29"><p><strong>Large vocabulary language model </strong>to just capture the spoken words (no grammars are used) and integrate with any NLU Engine of your choice. We think it will be attractive because of the lower cost compared to &lt;Gather&gt;.</p></li><li id="viewer-9luup"><p><strong>Real-time agent assist</strong> - we are combining our real-time speech recognition with speech analytics to deliver an API that will allow for building real-time agent assist and monitoring applications.</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-c9mgf">You can sign up to <a href="https://voicegain.ai/trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>try our</u></a> platform.

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I want to see an LR parser which produces the following syntax tree
(from <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#show-syntax-tree"><strong>Show Syntax Tree</strong></a> rust-analyzer command, with whitespace nodes elided for clarity):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

    PARAM_LIST@6..7
      L_PAREN@6..7 "("
  STRUCT@9..31
    STRUCT_KW@9..15 "struct"
    NAME@16..17
      IDENT@16..17 "S"

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The most error-resilient LR-style parser I know, <a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter">tree sitter</a>, produces this instead (tree sitter is GLR, this is <strong>not</strong> the style of parsing advocated by the article):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
</pre></td><td><pre>source_file [0, 0] - [5, 0])
  ERROR [0, 0] - [4, 1])
    identifier [0, 3] - [0, 6])
    struct_pattern [2, 0] - [4, 1])
      type: type_identifier [2, 0] - [2, 6])
      ERROR [2, 7] - [2, 8])
        identifier [2, 7] - [2, 8])
      field_pattern [3, 3] - [3, 9])
        name: field_identifier [3, 3] - [3, 4])
        pattern: identifier [3, 6] - [3, 9])
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note two things about the rust-analyzer’s tree:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There’s an (incomplete) “function” node for <code>fn foo(</code>.
Unclosed parenthesis doesn’t preclude the parser from recognizing parameter list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incomplete function does not prevent struct definition from being recognized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are important for IDE support.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that the cursor is just after <code>(</code>.
If we have rust-analyzer’s syntax tree, than we can figure out that we are completing a function parameter.
If we are to get fancy we might find the calls to the (not yet fully written) <code>foo</code>, run type inference to figure out the type of the first argument, and than suggest parameter name &amp; type based on that (not currently implemented — there’s soooooo much yet to be done in rust-analyzer).
And correctly recognizing <code>struct S</code> is important to not break type-inference in the code which uses <code>S</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of literature about error recovery for LR parsers, how come academics haven’t figured this out already?
I have a bold claim to make: error-recovery research in academia is focusing on a problem irrelevant for IDEs.
Specifically, the research is focused on finding “minimal cost repair sequence”:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a set of edit operations is defined (skip, change or insert token),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a “cost” metric is defined to distinguish big and small edits,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an algorithm is devised to find the smallest edit which makes the current text parse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This is a very academia-friendly problem — there’s a precise mathematical formulation, there’s an obvious brute force solution (try all edits), and there’s ample space for finding polynomial algorithm.</p>
<p>But IDEs don’t care about actually guessing &amp; repairing the text!
They just need to see as much of (possibly incomplete) syntax nodes in the existing text as possible.
When rust-analyzer’s parser produces</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>  PARAM_LIST@6..7
    L_PAREN@6..7 "("
STRUCT@9..31
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>it doesn’t think “Oh, I need to insert <code>)</code> here to complete the list of parameters”.
Rather, it sees <code>struct</code> and thinks “Oh wow, didn’t expect that! I guess I’ll just stop parsing parameter list right here”.</p>
<p>So, here’s</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Important"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>First Challenge</p>
Design error <em>resilient</em> (and not just error <em>recovering</em>) LR parsing algorithm.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Note that error resilience is a topic orthogonal to error reporting.
I haven’t payed much attention to error reporting (in my experience, synchronous reporting of syntax errors in the editor compensates for bad syntax error messages), but it might be the case that MCRS are a good approach to there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>By Pau Alcalá - Co-founder of Palabra</em></p><p>While finding product-market fit for <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=direct-sales-tips-startups&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a>, our marketing strategy was exclusively organic and our first sales came from 1-1 conversations with potential users. After a month of difficult conversations and failed demos, I learned a very new and innovative approach to direct sales: actually listening to what people are saying. In this post I'll share my experience and some tips to listen to users, in the hopes of saving founders &amp; early startup teams some time and energy.</p><h2>What we mean by direct sales</h2><p>As the name suggest, direct sales means you talk directly to your prospect and try to sell them your solution via a 1-1 conversation. This conversation usually starts by reaching the prospect you think your product would work for, and sharing why you think your solution would be good for them.</p><p>Taking a direct approach is more common for B2B businesses, because the decision to purchase is strategical and the price is higher, which means you get a bigger return for each user you convert. But I think it's a good strategy to follow for any early stage SaaS, because it's an easy and direct way of learning about your users and implementing solutions that work for them.</p><p>The biggest challenges to direct sales is finding the right prospects and knowing how to show them value as quickly as possible. With direct conversations you'll probably get a higher conversion rate than self-served sales, but at a much slower rate.</p><h2>Why direct sales in a SaaS startup?</h2><p>When we launched <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=direct-sales-tips-startups&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a> we had no audience and not enough user data to understand who we should be targeting or how to convert them into paying users. We had two possible paths to follow:</p><ol><li>Awareness-first: Experimenting with low-budget ads or organic strategies in different channels, with different messages to see which stick better. This approach is the startup playbook, feeding the top of the funnel with as many prospects as possible assuming most of them will not end up buying, and learn how to convert them better later on.</li><li>Conversion-first: Spending almost no time to feed the top of the funnel (keep a low stream of leads and prospects) but improving that funnel to have better conversions. Leads would be scarce, but we'd learn how to qualify them and provide value so they are willing to buy and stay around.</li></ol><p>The first path was the riskier for us. First, because we had little experience with paid acquisition, and wouldn't know if our misses would be due to lack of experience or just wrong channels.</p><p>Second, we wanted to engage in deep conversations with users as soon as possible. We didn't really care about general trends, we wanted to actually understand what people were struggling with in email automation, and where to take our product so that it worked for them. That's why we decided to take the second path.</p><p>Our initial strategy was to ask a bunch of questions about people's current email automation strategies and try to turn the initial conversation into a sales pitch. We'd learn fast and get a few sales in the meantime.</p><p>Sounds easy, right? Well, it was not.</p><h2>What a failed sales conversation looks like</h2><p>After my first couple of calls I knew I was doing something wrong, but didn't know what it was. Sign ups were rarely because of my "sales" 1-1s, and every conversation left me with a sour feeling.</p><p>What usually happened was that I got to a call, asked the person a couple of questions about their strategies, and at some point I'd get nervous and start talking a lot. People are usually nice and would listen to what I had to say, but I could feel they weren't really interested, and felt like I was wasting time.</p><p>So what was I doing wrong?</p><p>After talking with my co-founder and a couple of friends in the SaaS industry, I found that I wasn't really paying attention to what prospects were saying. My team would ask questions about our prospects that I didn't know how to answer.</p><p>That meant I wasn't really selling, but I also wasn't learning about our users. I found I had to learn how to listen first, and sell later.</p><h2>How to talk less and sell more</h2><p>Listening to prospects is not at easy as it sounds when you are worried about selling them your solution. Specially if you're in early stage and don't have much experience selling software, it'll be hard to keep a clear mind and letting the user take the conversation where they want to.</p><p>But here's the thing: selling isn't about convincing people to try your product, it's about identifying how your product can solve a problem for them.</p><p>In a direct sales conversation, you should have two take outs:</p><ol><li>Identifying if the person you're talking to has a problem you could solve (the more details the better)</li><li>Communicating clearly how your product is a solution to their problem.</li></ol><p>If you fail at #1, you'll end up trying to convince people who don't actually have a problem you could help them with. Those are not your users, and there's nothing you can do today to make their life easier. Even if you somehow convince them to sign up, they'll probably cancel their subscription, making your churn go up.</p><p>Failing at #2 is usually connected to #1, because the only way of communicating a solution clearly is to understand the problem perfectly. You have to <strong>listen really carefully</strong> to understand what those problems are.</p><p>Most of your conversations with prospects should be about #1. Make a lot of questions. Listen closely and follow up on what isn't clear. Make the other person feel listened to. Worst case scenario, you end up with valuable insights about what problems people have. As an early stage startup, this information is crucial to find product-market fit.</p><p>Here are some lessons I learned while taking a direct sales approach to SaaS. Most of them came from reading <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">The Mom Test</a>, talking to awesome people and experimenting on my own.</p><h2>3 direct sales tips to listen to your users</h2><h3>Writing down what you want to get from the conversation</h3><p>This list should be really short. My initial conversation guide had 15+ questions to get to understand the problem, and then a short demo. It worked kinda fine, but I usually got lost by question 5, and then started thinking about what to ask next instead of listening to the answer.</p><p>The Mom Test suggests you should "prepare your list of 3". Three things you want to get from each conversation, depending on who you'll be talking to. And that was magic.</p><p>In early Palabra demos, when I asked to have a quick chat to someone in a startup, I usually had three different scenarios:</p><ul><li>The founder talked to me directly, who had no details about the email automation strategies his/her team was using but could provide context.</li><li>I talked to a marketer in the startup, who usually had many years of experience and had tried a bunch of other email automation tools.</li><li>I talked to a technical co-founder or dev, who had a lot of questions about technical aspects of Palabra and had tried different integrations before.</li></ul><p>I prepared three different notes to look at before each conversation, one for each "buyer" persona, and wrote down my list of three.</p><p>I started asking questions that came to mind from listening to what people were saying, and spend almost no time looking at my notes. If I ever felt I was starting to get lost, I just glanced to my list of three for that particular person to check if I was missing something. Freedom.</p><h3>Having a structured set of questions</h3><p>This advice came from a great friend and the <a href="http://sofandrade.com/">best UX designer I've met</a>. She knows all about user interviews, and since I was also trying to learn from our prospects, I knew it would help. Her advice was to divide my questions into chunks or topics I wanted to know about.</p><p>Having differentiated topics gives you flexibility to follow the conversation and not worry about what to ask after each answer. If you ask a question from the first topic and your user's answer goes to a slightly different topic, you can go to that part of your guide and then come back after that's done.</p><p>As an example, this was the structure I ended up using for each guide:</p><ul><li>About them/their job/their goals</li><li>About their emails, what they were using them from</li><li>About their email automation tools, what they were using and how</li><li>About their pains, what was missing from their current tools?</li></ul><p>What usually happened is that my email questions got answers related to tools. So I just moved over to the "tools" set of questions and then looked to see if I was missing something important at the end.</p><p>A smart move was to leave questions about pains for last. By then I usually had enough information about their problem and could offer a clear solution with <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=direct-sales-tips-startups&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a>.</p><p>If we had a solution, I'd briefly tell people why I thought this would work, and offered to show them in a demo. By focusing on their specific solution in the demo, I only showed one feature and not the whole product, which was a much better use of everyone's time.</p><h3>Doing some background research - but still ask people</h3><p>You can't go into a sales pitch without knowing who you're talking to. For B2B sales you need to know about the company and the person you're actually going to talk to. The key here is to use that information wisely.</p><p>I used to start conversations on what I'd learned from their landing page, to let people know I had done my homework. But his was actually making me start with the wrong foot -by talking too much.</p><p>Asking about their company and what they do there gives you inside information you wouldn't get from LinkedIn or a landing page. And it also helps break the ice, since it's an easy answer for anyone.</p><p>My solution was full transparency. I started each conversation by saying I had done a bit of research about them but still wanted to hear from themselves. Then I would ask what they usually do.</p><p>This was incredibly effective. Being honest took away all of my nervousness and allowed me to relax into the conversation. I felt like I had no secrets, I was just telling the truth and asking questions. And I think this works both ways: the person you're talking to will probably trust you more if you're …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Friends are a treasure. In an uncertain world, they provide a comforting sense of stability and connection. We laugh together and cry together, sharing our good times and supporting each other through the bad. Yet a defining feature of friendship is that itâ€™s voluntary. Weâ€™re not wedded together by law, or through blood, or via monthly payments into our bank accounts. It is a relationship of great freedom, one that we retain only because we want to.</p>
<p>But the downside of all this freedom, this lack of formal commitment, is that friendship often falls by the wayside. Our adult lives can become a monsoon of obligations, from children, to partners, to ailing parents, to work hours that trespass on our free time. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Febs0000046">study</a> of young adultsâ€™ social networks by researchers at the University of Oxford found that those in a romantic relationship had, on average, two fewer close social ties, including friends. Those with kids had lost out even more. Friendships crumble, not because of any deliberate decision to let them go, but because we have other priorities, ones that arenâ€™t quite as voluntary. The title of the Oxford paper summed up things well: â€˜Romance and Reproduction Are Socially Costlyâ€™.</p>
<p>Such is the pace and busyness of many peopleâ€™s adult lives that they can lose contact with their friends at a rapid rate. For instance, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873313001056?via%3Dihub">study</a> by the Dutch sociologist Gerald Mollenhorst found that, over a period of seven years, people had lost touch with half of their closest friends, on average. Whatâ€™s especially alarming is that many of us seem to be losing friends faster than we can replace them. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-13785-001">meta-analysis</a> by researchers in Germany published in 2013 combined data from 177,635 participants across 277 studies, concluding that friendship networks had been shrinking for the preceding 35 years. For example, in studies conducted between 1980 and 1985, participants reportedly had four more friends on average, compared with the participants whoâ€™d taken part in studies between 2000 and 2005.</p>
<p>If weâ€™re not careful, we risk living out our adulthoods friendless. This is a situation thatâ€™s worth avoiding. Friends are not only a great source of fun and <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2018/11/20/where-americans-find-meaning-in-life/">meaning</a> in life, but studies <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/74/2/222/3760165">suggest</a> that, without them, weâ€™re also at greater risk of feeling more depressed. Itâ€™s telling that in their <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00415">study</a> â€˜Very Happy Peopleâ€™ (2002), the American psychologists Ed Diener and Martin Seligman found that a key difference between the most unhappy and most happy people was how socially connected they were. Friends give us so much, which is why we need to invest in making them. Hereâ€™s how.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>Making more friends in adulthood is going to take some deliberate effort on your part. Itâ€™s an exciting challenge in theory, but one of the first obstacles youâ€™ll encounter is having enough confidence. Especially if you are shy by nature, putting yourself out there can seem scary, triggering fears of rejection. These fears might lead you to engage in two types of avoidance that will inhibit your ability to make friends. First, you might practise â€˜overt avoidanceâ€™, by not putting yourself in situations where itâ€™s possible to meet new people. Instead of going to your friendâ€™s movie night, with the chance to meet others, you end up staying at home. Second, you might find yourself engaging in â€˜covert avoidanceâ€™, which means that you show up but donâ€™t engage with people when you arrive. You go to the movie night, but while everyone else is analysing the film after itâ€™s over, you stay silent in the corner, petting someoneâ€™s pet corgi and scrolling through Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Assume that people like you</strong></p>
<p>Both these forms of avoidance are caused by understandable fears of rejection. So imagine how much easier it would be if you knew that, were you to show up in a group of strangers, most of them would love you and find you interesting. This mindset actually has a self-fulfilling quality â€“ an American <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.51.2.284">study</a> from the 1980s found that volunteers who were led to believe that an interaction partner liked them began to act in ways that made this belief more likely to come true â€“ they shared more about themselves, disagreed less, and had a more positive attitude. This suggests that if you go into social situations with a positive mindset, assuming people like you, then itâ€™s more likely that this will actually turn out to be the case.</p>
<p>Of course, you might still be reluctant to assume others like you because you donâ€™t believe itâ€™s true. If this is you, you might take comfort from research that found, on average, that strangers like us more than we realise. The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618783714">paper</a>, by Erica J Boothby at Cornell University and colleagues, involved having pairs of strangers chat together for five minutes, to rate how much they liked their interaction partner, and to estimate how much their partner liked them. Across a variety of settings and study durations â€“ in the lab, in a college dorm, at a professional development workshop â€“ the same pattern emerged. People underestimated how much they were liked, a phenomenon that Boothby and her colleagues labelled â€˜the liking gapâ€™.</p>
<p>What wisdom should we take from this research? It can remind us to go into new social events assuming that people will like us. It can keep us from being paralysed by fears of rejection, pushing us to question some of these fears. Try working on your internal dialogue, your inner voice that perhaps makes overly negative assumptions about how people will respond to you. Doing this will help give you the confidence to go out there and start initiating friendly contact with strangers.</p>
<p><strong>Initiate</strong></p>
<p>In <em>We Should Get Together: The Secret to Cultivating Better Friendships</em> (2020), Kat Vellos describes being inspired to write her book after a moment of feeling utterly alone. She was looking for a friend to hang out with, so she posted on Facebook: â€˜Who wants to go eat French fries and talk about life with me?â€™ Everyone who responded lived in another state; her local San Francisco Bay Area friends were all booked up. As she put it:</p>
<blockquote>I didnâ€™t just want to eat snacks and talk about life. I was craving a different kind of life â€“ one that would give me abundant access to friends who wanted to see me as much as I wanted to see them.</blockquote>
<p>This experience made Vellos realise that she needed more friends, so she created and executed a plan to make some. Eventually, she was running two successful meetup groups, and had established friendships with people she liked and wanted to get closer to. How did she change her life? She initiated. Vellos set aside time to reach out to people regularly, to revitalise old relationships and to awaken new ones, to check in, to find time to hang out. Her story reveals how initiative can change the course of our friendships.</p>
<p>To embrace the importance of initiating, you must to let go of the myth that friendship happens organically. You have to take responsibility rather than waiting passively. Science backs this up. Consider a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0265407509106718">study</a> of older adults in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The participants who thought friendship was something that just happened based on luck tended to be less socially active and to feel lonelier when the researchers caught up with them five years later. By contrast, those who thought friendship took effort actually made more effort â€“ for example, by showing up at church or at community groups â€“ and this paid dividends, in that they felt less lonely at the five-year follow-up.</p>
<p>But itâ€™s not just showing up that matters, itâ€™s saying â€˜helloâ€™ when you get there. This means introducing yourself to other people, asking them for their phone numbers, following up and asking them to hang out. Initiating is a process, one that we must do over and over again to make new friendships.</p>
<p>Initiation is particularly important for people who find themselves in new social settings â€“ such as people who have moved to a new city, started a new school or job. In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-97266-009">study</a> of first-year undergraduates at the University of Denver in 1980, it was those students who rated themselves as having superior social skills who managed to develop more satisfying social relationships. Moreover, in the Fall, when everyone was new, it was specifically â€˜initiation skillâ€™ that was most important. Once friendships were more stable, it didnâ€™t matter as much.</p>
<p>Although we might fear that other people will turn us down if we initiate with them, the research finds that this is a lot less likely than we might think. When the American psychologists Nicholas Epley and Juliana Schroeder <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-28833-001">asked</a> research participants to open up conversations with their fellow train commuters, can you guess how many of them were shot down? None! Epley and Schroder concluded that: â€˜Commuters appeared to think that talking to a stranger posed a meaningful risk of social rejection. As far as we can tell, it posed no risk at all.â€™</p>
<p><strong>Keep showing up</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve initiated some new contacts, the challenge of turning them into genuine friendships begins. I learned this lesson when I moved to Atlanta to start a job as assistant professor. At first, I was proactive at making friends. I showed up to events, asked my friends if they knew anyone in the area, and went to some meetup groups. I met a few people, but most of these friendships fizzled. I was good at sparking a connection but struggled to sustain it.</p>
<p>According to Rebecca G Adams, professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, sociologists have long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html">recognised</a> that friendships thrive when we have continuous interaction. My problem with sustaining connection was that I lacked the opportunity for repeated encounters. Going to a lecture, or a happy hour, or a networking event afforded me only one opportunity to connect. If you can, itâ€™s a better idea to sign up for activities that give you multiple opportunities to connect, such as a language class, a writing course, an …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<!-- <img src="/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/header.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Fixing AWS Architecure Diagrams: Distributed Load Testing"> -->

<p><em>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a vast library of practical solutions to common business problems. In this series, we focus on the architecture diagrams included in these solutions and attempt to expand and improve on them. Read the previous entry <a href="https://blog.ilograph.com/posts/fixing-aws-architecture-diagrams-vod/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Below is AWS’s architecture diagram for their <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/distributed-load-testing-on-aws">Distributed Load Testing on AWS solution</a>. It comes directly from the linked repository. While the solution is excellent, the architecture diagram accompanying it exhibits a number of problems that limit its use as a technical resource.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/original.png" alt="An AWS diagram"></p>

<p>This diagram has some common issues (see the <a href="https://blog.ilograph.com/posts/fixing-aws-architecture-diagrams-vod/">previous entry</a> in this series) and a few new ones:</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> The diagram lacks a clear purpose. It is referred to simply as an “Architecture Overview” in the solution.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> There are no named resources; only AWS Services (e.g. <em>Amazon S3</em>) are shown. Looking at this diagram, a viewer has no way of knowing <em>what</em> buckets, lambdas and other resources exist or how they are related.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> All of the arrows are unlabeled. The exact nature of the relations between these resources is a mystery.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> The diagram mixes run-time and deployment-time concerns.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> The diagram is missing critical details about security and access management.</p>

<p><strong>In short, this diagram makes an <em>impression</em>, but fails to truly <em>inform</em> the viewer</strong>. This would be acceptable for a decorative element in a blog post or presentation, but as a technical resource, it can be much better. In this article, we remake this diagram with an aim toward creating a valuable source of information in its own right.</p>

<p>Like last time, we split the original into multiple perspectives, each focused on a single goal. We’ll have <strong>nine</strong> perspectives in total. Four will show static relations between the solution’s resources. The remainder show sample workflows (e.g. creating a new test, or canceling a test) with detailed control flows between the resources. We’ll start with one of the most important perspectives, run-time dependency:</p>

<h4 id="perspective-1-run-time-dependency">Perspective 1: Run-time Dependency</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-which-resources-depend-on-which-resources-at-run-time">Goal: Show which resources depend on which resources at run-time</h6>

<p><strong>Original</strong>
<img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/old_1.png" alt="Run-time dependency (old)"></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>
<a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Runtime%2520Dependency"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/new_1.png" alt="Run-time dependency">
</a></p>

<p>We address the issues in the original head-on. The perspective uses real resource names, and the relationship arrows are labeled. We’ve removed deploy-time concerns (e.g. <em>CodeBuild</em>) to focus on run-time concerns. And we’ve added detail about the testing console, including screen names and their API dependencies.</p>

<p>At first blush the diagram is much busier than the original; however, we can select a resource and see both what resources depend on it and what resources it depends on:</p>



<p>The aforementioned deploy-time dependencies are not <em>truly</em> gone, we’ve just moved them to a different perspective:</p>

<h4 id="perspective-2-deploy-time-dependency">Perspective 2: Deploy-time Dependency</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-which-resources-depend-on-which-resources-at-deploy-time">Goal: Show which resources depend on which resources at deploy-time</h6>

<p><strong>Original</strong>
<img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/old_2.png" alt="Deploy-time dependency (old)"></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>
<a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Deployment%2520Dependency"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/new_2.png" alt="Deploy-time dependency">
</a></p>

<p>This perspective’s goal is identical to the last one, only it is focused on deploy-time dependencies. Note that this includes external dependencies (a <em>Docker Hub</em> image and a <em>PyPi</em> library). It also shows source code dependencies for the lambdas. Once the solution is successfully deployed, the dependencies described in this perspective are no longer relevant to the solution run-time.</p>

<h4 id="perspective-3-security-and-access-management">Perspective 3: Security and Access Management</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-which-resources-can-access-which-resources-and-how">Goal: Show which resources can access which resources, and how</h6>

<p>This perspective describes something the original doesn’t fully attempt to address: security and access management. For the solution to work, resources need to get data from, send data to, and sometimes (in the case of lambdas) invoke other resources. This is all managed through roles, policies, and permissions governed primary through IAM.</p>

<p>Obviously, this perspective goes into considerably more detail than the original diagram does. Like earlier, we can select individual resources to see what resources it can access and be accessed by (and how).</p>

<p>Naturally, the load testing cluster requires internet access to work. This simple diagram shows the resources allowing the cluster to access the internet from within the VPC.</p>

<p>All of the previous perspectives are <em>static</em> perspectives. There is no notion of time; the relations they describe are continuously in effect. They do not have steps showing how the resources actually interact. To help the viewer better understand <em>how</em> the resources interact (and how complex those interactions can get), we include five <strong>sequence</strong> perspectives for this solution:</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The conclusion of the <a href="https://blog.ilograph.com/posts/fixing-aws-architecture-diagrams-vod/">previous entry</a> listed guidelines for better architecture diagrams, all of which we followed here. We benefited greatly from breaking up the original diagram into multiple perspectives and using real resource names, for example. By making these and other improvements, we hopefully made this diagram much more useful as a technical resource.</p>

            <p>Just a note about nomenclature before we start; I’ll use “functor” to represent the <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2015/01/20/functors/">categorical meaning</a> of the concept:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A functor is a mapping between categories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and <code>Functor</code> and <code>Contravariant</code> to specify the typeclass encodings of functors.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s begin!</p>
<p>Contravariant functors are odd aren’t they? Covariant functors (which are modelled by the <code>Functor</code> typeclass) are quite straightforward but <strong>contra</strong>variant functors as their name implies seem to be the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Before we get into what a contravariant functor is, it’s useful to look at the <code>Functor</code> <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">typeclass</a> which we know and love.</p>
<h2 id="functor">Functor</h2>
<p>A <code>Functor</code> is defined as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>where</span>
<span>  fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b</code></pre></div>
<p>We often understand a <code>Functor</code> to be a “container” or a “producer” of some type, where the function supplied to <code>fmap</code> is applied to the elements that are “contained” or “produced” in some type constructor<a href="#type-constructor-1"><sup>1</sup></a> <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>A simple example would be the list (<code>[]</code>) type, that can represent zero or more values. Given a <code>[a]</code> we can turn it into a <code>[b]</code> when given a function <code>a -&gt; b</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> [] a <span>=</span> [] <span>|</span> a <span>:</span> [a]  <span>-- an approximation of the [] data type</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> [] <span>where</span>
  fmap _ [] <span>=</span> []
  fmap f (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> f x <span>:</span> fmap f xs</code></pre></div>
<p>In the example below we convert a <code>[Int]</code> into a <code>[String]</code> given a function <code>Int -&gt; String</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>import </span><span>Data.Semigroup</span> ((&lt;&gt;))

<span>myInts ::</span> [<span>Int</span>]
myInts <span>=</span> [<span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>5</span>]

<span>emptyInts ::</span> [<span>Int</span>]
emptyInts <span>=</span> []

<span>intToString ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
intToString n <span>=</span> (show n) <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>"!"</span>

<span>myStrings ::</span> [<span>String</span>]
myStrings <span>=</span> fmap intToString myInts <span>-- ["1!","2!","3!","4!","5!"]</span>

<span>myEmptyString ::</span> []
myEmptyString <span>=</span> fmap intToString emptyInts  <span>-- []</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another example would the <code>Maybe</code> data type, that represents a value that may or may not exist.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span> <span>|</span> <span>Just</span> a

<span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>where</span>
  fmap _ <span>Nothing</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
  fmap f (<span>Just</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> (f x)</code></pre></div>
<p>In the example below we convert a <code>Maybe Int</code> into a <code>Maybe String</code> given a function <code>Int -&gt; String</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>import </span><span>Data.Semigroup</span> ((&lt;&gt;))

<span>maybeInt ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>
maybeInt <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>10</span>

<span>notInt ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>
notInt <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>

<span>intToString ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
intToString n <span>=</span> (show n) <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>"!"</span>

<span>maybeString ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span>
maybeString <span>=</span> fmap intToString maybeInt <span>-- Just "10!"</span>

<span>notString ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span>
notString <span>=</span> fmap intToString notInt <span>-- Nothing</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Functor</code> typeclass has laws, that ensure <code>Functor</code> instances behave in a predictable way.</p>
<h3 id="laws">Laws</h3>
<h4 id="identity">Identity</h4>

<p>Essentially if you do nothing to the value of a <code>Functor</code>, you get the same <code>Functor</code> you started with.</p>
<h4 id="composition">Composition</h4>
<div><pre><code>fmap (f <span>.</span> g) <span>==</span> fmap f <span>.</span> fmap g</code></pre></div>
<p>If you convert the result of a Functor by <code>fmap</code>ing with a function <code>g</code> and then <code>fmap</code>ing that result with a subsequent function <code>f</code>, it’s the same as composing functions <code>g</code> and <code>f</code> (<code>f . g</code>) and then <code>fmap</code>ing once.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/functor-laws-ct.png" alt="Functor Laws"></p><p>Functor Laws</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-wrong-type-of-fmap">The Wrong Type of fmap</h3>
<p>Now let’s look at something a little different. Let’s create a data type to wrap a predicate of some sort. A predicate is something that will evaluate to a <code>Bool</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>Predicate</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> {<span> getPredicate ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> }</code></pre></div>
<p>An example of a Predicate is <code>greaterThanTen</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>greaterThanTen ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>Int</span>
greaterThanTen <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\n <span>-&gt;</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>that tests whether a number is greater than ten.</p>
<p>We can run with it <code>getPredicate</code> and an <code>Int</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>getPredicate greateThanTen <span>5</span>  <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate greateThanTen <span>11</span> <span>-- True</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It could be useful to define a <code>Functor</code> instance for Predicate - say if we have a <code>Predicate Int</code> and we want to convert it into a <code>Predicate String</code> when we have a <code>Int -&gt; String</code> function. Let’s try and implement that:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>-- fmap (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Predicate a -&gt; Predicate b</span>
  fmap f (<span>Predicate</span> p) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\b <span>-&gt;</span> undefined)
  fmap f (<span>Predicate</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\b <span>-&gt;</span> undefined)  <span>-- expanding p</span>
  fmap (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) (<span>Predicate</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\b <span>-&gt;</span> undefined) <span>-- expanding f</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we’ve run into a small problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we compose (a -&gt; Bool) and (a -&gt; b) to give us a (b -&gt; Bool) ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are given a <code>b</code> but we don’t have access to any functions that actually use a <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>The problem is that we can’t. It’s because of something called “polarity” of the type variable <code>a</code>. No <code>Functor</code> instance for you <code>Predicate</code>.</p>

<h2 id="polarity">Polarity</h2>
<p>Polarity is a way of representing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)">variance</a> using the position of type variables. Let’s take a simple function <code>a -&gt; b</code> as an example.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/function-polarity.png" alt="Function Polarity"></p><p>Function Polarity</p>
</div>
<p>If a type variable is in <strong>input</strong> position like <code>a</code> it is given a <strong>negative</strong> polarity. If it is in an <strong>output</strong> position like <code>b</code> then it is given a <strong>positive</strong> polarity.</p>
<p>These polarities map directly to variant types.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Polarity</th>
<th>Variance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Positive</td>
<td>Covariant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Negative</td>
<td>Contravariant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Both</td>
<td>Invariant</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>What this means is that <code>Functor</code>s (which are actually covariant functors) require a type constructor in a covariant position in order for you to define a <code>Functor</code> instance for that type.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a type that we know has a <code>Functor</code> instance like <code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/maybe-polarity.png" alt="Polarity of the Maybe data type"></p><p>Polarity of the Maybe data type</p>
</div>
<p>We can see that the type variable <code>a</code> occurs in a covariant (or output) position within the definition of the <code>Just</code> constructor.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the definition of <code>Predicate</code> data type:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/predicate-polarity.png" alt="Polarity of the Predicate data type"></p><p>Polarity of the Predicate data type</p>
</div>
<p>We can see that the type variable <code>a</code> occurs in a contravariant (or input) position. This indicates that we can’t create a (covariant) <code>Functor</code> instance for this data type.</p>
<p>But we want to map things! What do we do?</p>
<h2 id="contravariant">Contravariant</h2>
<p>Welcome the <code>Contravariant</code> typeclass to the stage! It’s defined as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Contravariant</span> f <span>where</span>
<span>  contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f b <span>-&gt;</span> f a</code></pre></div>
<p>Snazzy! <code>Contravariant</code> also takes some kind of type constructor <code>f</code> just like <code>Functor</code> but it has this weirdly named <code>contramap</code> function instead of <code>fmap</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>     fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b <span>-- Functor</span>
<span>contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f b <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-- Contravariant</span>
                         <span>^^^</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we read <code>fmap</code> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have an <code>a</code> in some context and a function that takes that <code>a</code> and converts it to a <code>b</code>, I can give you a context with a <code>b</code> in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we can then read <code>contramap</code> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a context that needs an <code>a</code> and a function that can convert <code>b</code>s to <code>a</code>s, I can give you a context that needs <code>b</code>s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that probably doesn’t make much sense. So let’s try and look at this in terms of our non-<code>Functor</code>: <code>Predicate</code>. <code>Predicate</code> has a <strong>need</strong> for an <code>a</code>, which it then uses to tell if something about that <code>a</code> is True or False.</p>
<p>Let’s try and write a <code>Contravariant</code> instance for <code>Predicate</code> given that we know that the type <code>a</code> in <code>Predicate</code> occurs in an input position.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Contravariant</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>-- contramp (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f b -&gt; f a</span>
  contramap (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> a <span>-- substituting for `f` for Predicate</span>
  contramap aToB (<span>Predicate</span> bToBool) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\a <span>-&gt;</span> undefined)</code></pre></div>
<p>Given that we have a function <code>a -&gt; b</code> and essentially a function of type <code>b -&gt; Bool</code> (wrapped inside a <code>Predicate b</code>), we can if given an <code>a</code>, convert it to a <code>b</code> using <code>aToB</code> and then give that <code>b</code> to <code>bToBool</code> to give us a <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s a slightly long-form implementation of the <code>Contravariant</code> instance for <code>Predicate</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Contravariant</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
<span>  contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> a
  contramap aToB (<span>Predicate</span> bToBool) <span>=</span>
    <span>Predicate</span> <span>$</span> \a <span>-&gt;</span>
      <span>let</span> b    <span>=</span> aToB a
          bool <span>=</span> bToBool b
      <span>in</span> bool</code></pre></div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/contramap-predicate.png" alt="contramap on Predicate"></p><p>contramap on Predicate</p>
</div>
<p>or more succinctly:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Contravariant</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
<span>  contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> a
  contramap f (<span>Predicate</span> b) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>$</span> b <span>.</span> f</code></pre></div>
<p>We can see from the definition of <code>Predicate a</code> that all we are doing is running the supplied function <code>f</code> <strong>before</strong> the function within <code>Predicate b</code>. The reason we do that is to adapt a new input type to match an existing input type to gain some functionality.</p>
<p>If we revisit the (covariant) <code>Functor</code> instance for <code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>where</span>
  fmap _ <span>Nothing</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
  fmap aToB (<span>Just</span> a) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> (aToB a)</code></pre></div>
<p>we can see that the function <code>aToB</code> is run <strong>after</strong> we have a value of <code>a</code>. We do that to convert a result of some type to another type.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/fmap-maybe.png" alt="fmap on Maybe"></p><p>fmap on Maybe</p>
</div>
<p>These are the essential differences between covariant and contravariant functors:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Typeclass</th>
<th>Function runs</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Functor</td>
<td>after</td>
<td>Convert results</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contravariant</td>
<td>before</td>
<td>Adapt inputs</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now that we know the essential difference between <code>Functor</code> and <code>Contravariant</code>, let’s look at how we can use <code>contramap</code> with our <code>Predicate</code> class.</p>
<p>Given that we already have a <code>Predicate</code> that determines whether a number is greater than ten:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>numGreaterThanTen ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>Int</span>
numGreaterThanTen <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\n <span>-&gt;</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>say we want to write another <code>Predicate</code> that verifies that the length of String is greater than ten characters.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>strLengthGreaterThanTen ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>String</span>
strLengthGreaterThanTen <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\s <span>-&gt;</span> (length s) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Sure, that’s pretty contrived but bear with me. Let’s also say we have a <code>Person</code> data type and we want to know if a person’s name is over ten characters long - if so we consider that to be a long name.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Person</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span> {<span> personName ::</span> <span>String</span>,<span> personAge ::</span> <span>Int</span> }

<span>personLongName ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>Person</span>
personLongName <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\p <span>-&gt;</span> (length <span>.</span> personName <span>$</span> p) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>And we can run these <code>Predicate</code>s as:</p>
<div><pre><code>getPredicate numGreaterThanTen <span>5</span> <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate numGreaterThanTen <span>20</span> <span>-- True</span>

getPredicate strLengthGreaterThanTen <span>"hello"</span>       <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate strLengthGreaterThanTen <span>"hello world"</span> <span>-- True</span>

getPredicate personLongName <span>$</span> <span>Person</span> <span>"John"</span> <span>30</span>        <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate personLongName <span>$</span> <span>Person</span> <span>"Bartholomew"</span> <span>30</span> <span>-- True</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And this is fine, but there’s some duplication across each of the <code>Predicate</code>s - namely the part where we compare a number to ten:</p>
<div><pre><code>(\n <span>-&gt;</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)  <span>-- Int</span>
(\s <span>-&gt;</span> (length s) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>) <span>-- String</span>
(\p <span>-&gt;</span> (length <span>.</span> personName <span>$</span> p) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>) <span>-- Person</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It would be nice if we didn’t have to repeat ourselves.</p>
<p>If we look at the differences between <code>numGreaterThanTen</code>, <code>strLengthGreaterThanTen</code> and <code>personLongName</code> we can see that the only difference is that one works on an <code>Int</code> and the others work on <code>String</code> and <code>Person</code> respectively. <code>strLengthGreaterThanTen</code> and <code>personLongName</code> each convert their input types to an <code>Int</code> and then do the same comparison:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>Predicate</span> (\(<span>n ::</span> <span>Int</span>) <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>let</span> num <span>=</span> id n
  <span>in</span> num <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>-- (1)</span>

<p><em>A new way of operating.</em></p>



<p>This is one of the books every creator should read. It is full of information for those trying to build an online audience. In this new world where information is abundant, it’s hard to be spotted. How to get people to notice your work? How can you get your stuff out there? And how you can get an audience?</p>



<p>Austin starts by this quote:</p>



<blockquote><p>Be so good they can’t ignore you.</p><cite>Steve Martin</cite></blockquote>



<p>And while it’s true, it’s not enough to be good. In order to be found, you have to be findable. This book goes into details on how sharing your work with the world can help you build an audience. The same audience that will help you get your word out once you’re ready.</p>



<p>The book helps you think about your work as a never-ending process and how to share it in a way that attracts people who might be interested in what you do.</p>



<h2>You don’t have to be a genius</h2>



<p>We see a genius as an individual with superhuman talents, free of the influence of a precedent, and with a direct connection to God. When inspiration comes, it strikes like a lighting bolt and then he spends the rest of his time in his studio turning this idea into a masterpiece.</p>



<p>But that’s not true.</p>



<p>Creative work is done in a group. All group members are contributing ideas, stealing from each other, copying, etc. It’s not about how smart you are, but about what you have to contribute, the ideas you share, the quality of connections you make, and the conversations you start. Austin calls this group a <strong>scenius</strong>.</p>



<p>Find your scenius, and be a good contributor.</p>



<hr>



<p>Austin then moves to talk about being an “expert”. He explains how the world is changing at such a rapid pace that it’s turning us all to amateurs. So instead of fighting it, embrace being an amateur.</p>



<p>An amateur is someone following something in the spirit of love. Because they have little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything and share results.</p>



<blockquote><p>In the beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities. In the expert’s mind, there are only few.</p></blockquote>



<p>On the spectrum of creative work, the difference of mediocre and good is vast. But mediocrity is still on the spectrum, you can move up in increments. The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something. Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing.</p>



<p>The best way to start in the path of sharing you work is to commit to learning in front of others. Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note. Look for voids you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first.</p>



<hr>



<p>On doing what we love, Austin explains how we’ve always been told to find our voice, but we never really know what this means. You can’t find your voice if you don’t use it. So talk about the things you love. Your voice will follow.</p>



<p>When talking about your work, make sure you do it online. In this day and age, if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist. We all have the opportunity to use our voices, to have our say, but so many of us are wasting it. If you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about, you have to share them.</p>



<h2>Think process, not product</h2>



<p>In a pre-digital world, the only way an artist could connect with an audience was through a gallery show or art magazine. But today, with social media, an artist can share whatever she wants, whenever she wants, at almost no cost. By sharing her day-to-day process, she can form a unique bond with her audience. <strong>Take people behind the scenes</strong>.</p>



<blockquote><p>People really want to see how sausages get made</p></blockquote>



<p>Become a documentarian of what you do. Let your audience see the person behind the products.</p>



<p>A lot of us go about our work and feel like we have nothing to show for it at the end of the day. But whatever the nature of your work, there is an art to what you do, and <strong>there are people who would be interested in that art</strong>. If only you presented it to them in the right way!</p>



<p>How can you show your work even when you have nothing to show? You need to make stuff (also see my post on <a href="https://elazzabi.com/2020/05/12/how-to-create-a-public-portfolio-when-what-you-do-is-private-or-proprietary/">how to create a public portfolio when your work is private</a>). No one will give a damn about your résumé, they want to see what you have made with your little fingers. Start a journal and write your thoughts, or speak in an audio recorder. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages. Shoot videos. etc. This is not about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. When you are ready to share, you’ll have a surplus of material to choose from.</p>



<h2>Share something small every day</h2>



<p>Every success needs decades worth of hard work and perseverance. But thankfully, you don’t need that time all in one big chunk. And speaking about chunks, forget big chunks. Forget years, months, weeks… Focus on something small. Focus on days.</p>



<p>Once a day, after you finish your work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece you can share. If you’re just starting, share your influencers and what’s inspiring you. If you’re in the middle, share your process or methods of work. If you completed the project, share the final result. If you have multiple projects in the wild, report how they are doing or share stories about how people are interacting with your work.</p>



<p>The form you use for sharing doesn’t matter. Blog, tweet, video, it doesn’t matter. There’s no one-size-fits-all plan for everybody. Pick what works for you, and stick to it.</p>



<p>Produce and share a lot. <em>Theodore Sturgeon</em>, a fiction author, states that 90% of what we produce is crap, the other 10% is good work. But the problem is we don’t know which is which until we share it with others. So make sure to share a lot, but keep in mind anything you share will be there forever. So don’t share something you don’t want your boss or mom to see.</p>



<hr>



<p>You daily updates will construct what Austin calls the <strong>Flow</strong>. But you need another part to achieve results, and it’s called the <strong>Stock</strong>. If the <em>flow</em> is the daily stream of updates, the <em>stock</em> is the content that will be still interesting in months and years from publication.</p>



<p>Stock is what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time. And the magic formula is to <strong>maintain your flow, while working on your stock in the background</strong>.</p>



<p>Your stock is made by collecting, organizing, and expanding upon your flow. Social media is a public notebook where we share our ideas and invite others to share their voice with us. But the thing with notebooks is you need to revisit them in order to make the most out of them.</p>



<p>Social networks are good, but they come and go. If you’re really interested in sharing your work and expressing yourself, nothing beats owning your own space online, a place that you control. Buy a good domain name, and create your blog.</p>



<p>A blog is the perfect machine to turn flow into stocks. One blog post is nothing on its own. But publish a thousand blog posts over a decade, and it turns into your life’s work. This sounds technical, but a few Google searches will show you the way.</p>



<h2><strong>Open your cabinet of curiosities.</strong></h2>



<p>If you happened to be wealthy and educated in the 16th-17th century, chances are you had a cabinet of curiosities. A room filled with rare objects that served as a kind of external display. Books, skeletons, jewels, shells… were all part of the cabinet.</p>



<p>Before we are ready to take the leap of sharing our own work with the world, we can share our tastes in the work of others. Where do you get your inspiration? What do you read? Do you subscribe to anything? What movies do you see?…</p>



<p>When you share this online, always credit people and include a link pointing to the website of the creator.  The number one rule of the Internet is <strong>people are lazy</strong>. If you don’t include a link, no one will bother searching.</p>



<h2>Tell good stories</h2>



<blockquote><p>You might think that the pleasure you get from a painting depends on its color, its shape, and its pattern. And if that’s right, it shouldn’t matter if it’s an original or a forgery. But our brains don’t work like that. When shown an object, a face… people’s assessment -how much they like it- is deeply affected by what you tell them about it</p><cite>Paul Bloom – Psychology Professor</cite></blockquote>



<p>Words matter. Your work doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Whether you realize it or not, you’re already telling a story about your work. Every email you send, tweet, video, comment… they are all contributing to the narrative you’re constantly constructing.  If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one.</p>



<p>To tell a story, you need structure. But sadly, our life is messy. A good pitch has 3 acts: The first act is the past, where you’ve been, what you want, how you came to want it… The second act is the present, where you are now, how you’ve worked hard and used up most of your resources. The third act is the future, where you’re going, and how exactly is the person you’re pitching can help you get there.</p>



<p>Whether you’re telling a finished or unfinished story, always keep your audience in mind. Speak to them directly in plain language. Be brief. Learn to speak. Lear to write. Use spell-check…</p>



<h2>Teach what you know</h2>



<p>Think about what you can share from your process that would benefit your audience. What are your techniques? Are you skilled at using certain tools/materials? The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online. Use pictures, words, and videos. Make people better at something they want to be better at.</p>



<h2>Don’t turn into human spam</h2>



<p>There is a category of humans called human spam. They’re everywhere, and they exist in every profession. They don’t want to pay their dues, they want their piece right away. They don’t listen to your ideas, they tell you theirs. You should …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Searching for an open-source Google Analytics alternative?</em></p><p><em>Our guest has your back. Uku Täht is the founder of <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, an open-source web analytics project built with Elixir. For the last couple of months, his project has attracted a lot of attention through <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics">informative blog posts</a> and very positive user reviews.</em></p><p><em>In this interview, we talk about his use of Elixir in production: the benefits, the downsides, the specifics, and why Elixir is so good for projects like Plausible Analytics.</em></p><h2 id="interview-with-uku-t%C3%A4ht">Interview with Uku Täht</h2><p><strong>Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</strong></p><p>Plausible Analytics is an open-source project dedicated to making web analytics more privacy-friendly. Our mission is to reduce corporate surveillance by providing an alternative web analytics tool that doesn’t have any links to AdTech.</p><p>I started building Plausible almost two years ago as a side project. I’ve been working on it full-time since the beginning of this year and I’ve also partnered up with Marko who handles the marketing and communication side of things.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/uj/ujixp3oy.2_(22)_(1).jpg" alt="ujixp3oy.2_(22)_(1).jpg"></p><hr><center><i>Uku Täht, the founder of Plausible Analytics.</i></center><p><strong>What is the key feature or set of features that make using Plausible Analytics a feasible replacement over Google Analytics?</strong></p><p>Google Analytics is overkill for most website owners. Plausible cuts through the noise by presenting all the important website traffic insights and metrics on one single page. You don’t need training or experience in web analytics to get started.</p><p>Keeping the script lightweight is also a priority. Our script is more than 17 times smaller than the Google Analytics script and more than 45 times smaller than the recommended Google Analytics integration using the Google Tag Manager.</p><p>But the biggest reason to choose Plausible is the fact that we’re committed to building open source software. The code behind our service is freely available for anyone. By using Plausible you help build software that everyone can benefit from, not just the corporations.</p><p><strong>How did Elixir as the language of choice work for you when implementing these features?</strong></p><p>I think Elixir is perfect for our use-case. It’s a very productive language once you learn it and it can also handle tons of traffic. Last month we processed 60 million pageviews with absolutely no issues.</p><p>Elixir really shines when you have stateful requirements for the app server. For example, we keep all the active sessions in memory so we don’t have to look a session up from the database on every event. It was a joy to build this part of the app using the GenServer primitives.</p><p><strong>How much did the fact that your product is not only self-hosted but also a SaaS inform your decision to go with Elixir? Did you choose it to scale a SaaS?</strong></p><p>I do believe that using Elixir allows us to make self-hosting a bit easier. In other languages, it’s common to use tools like Redis and external message queues but in Elixir we can often avoid these extra tools and keep the infrastructure requirements simple.</p><p>Plausible is currently designed to run on just one node. Once we start building out support for multi-node deployments, things will get really interesting. I feel like Elixir and the BEAM are designed perfectly for our use-case where we need multiple nodes to share state about visitors sessions.</p><p>Hopefully, we can evolve the architecture without needing extra infrastructure bits and pieces. The goal is to keep the requirements as simple as possible so everyone can run the code on their own server. By relying on BEAM fundamentals, we can probably avoid in-memoy stores, external message queues, and cluster managers altogether, making Plausible easy to self-host.</p><p><strong>Could you tell us more about your deployment: where do you host, how do you deploy, do you use the hot code reload functionality?</strong></p><p>We <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/made-in-eu">recently moved</a> from Heroku to using Digital Ocean. I wanted to eat our own dog food when it comes to the Docker infrastructure we built for self-hosting. So now we have a Digital Ocean droplet pre-configured with Docker and we just pull new images from our <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/plausible/analytics">DockerHub</a>.</p><p>Since we have a single node deployment, we do have around 30 seconds of downtime on each deploy and we don’t have auto-scaling support. We will deal with these issues as we scale, I just wanted to be upfront about the downsides of how we’re running it.</p><p>We don’t use hot code reloading since it doesn’t play well with the Docker flow.</p><p><strong>What was the biggest challenge while developing Plausible Analytics with Elixir?</strong></p><p>We use a database called Clickhouse for storing our stats. It’s a fairly new and cutting-edge database and it doesn’t have a robust integration with Elixir yet. We use a low-level connection library which gives us random errors sometimes.</p><p>I’m thinking about taking the time to write a proper Ecto adapter for Clickhouse so we can run migrations and have better error handling. It’s easy to complain about the lack of libraries in the Elixir ecosystem but I’d like to do my part in helping the ecosystem thrive.</p><p><strong>Are you satisfied with the result?</strong></p><p>Definitely. If I could go back and do it all over, I would choose the same stack again. Elixir+Phoenix is really fun to work with and it performs even better than I expected.</p><p><strong>Any key takeaways that you would like to share with our audience?</strong></p><p>Elixir is a wonderful language and its ecosystem is really coming along. I would encourage everyone to give it a try and contribute back to the ever-growing list of libraries and frameworks to make it even more powerful.</p><hr><p>I’d like to thank Uku for the interview! If you want to see more examples of Elixir used in production, check out <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-in-production-venu">our interview</a> with one of the Venu co-founders or read our post about <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-companies">companies that use Elixir</a>.</p><p>Additionally, if you have your own Elixir in production story to tell (both good and bad), we definitely want to hear it!

<p><b>Corto</b> is a library for compression and decompression meshes and point clouds (C++ and Javascript).
</p><p>Source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/corto">Github</a></p>

<p>Corto supports point clouds and meshes with per vertex attributes: normals, colors, texture coordinates and custom attributes.</p>


<p>The main focus of this work is on decompression speed, see performances, both for C++ lib and javascript, while still providing good compression rates.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#corto">corto</a> is program to compress .ply and .obj models
</li><li><a href="#libcorto">libcorto</a> is a C++ compression/decompression library
</li><li><a href="#corto.js">corto.js</a> a javascript library for .crt decompression
</li><li><a href="#cortoloader">CORTOLoader</a>, a threejs loader.
</li></ul>

<p>This work is based on the compression algorithm developed for the <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/nexus">Nexus</a> project for creation and visualization of multiresolution models. This approach has many advantages for large models in term of streaming and adaptive rendering.<br>
See <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publications/2015/PD15/">Fast decompression for web-based view-dependent 3D rendering</a>.</p>

</div> <!--row -->

<h2><a name="corto"></a>Corto</h2>

<p>A small executable to convert <em>.ply</em> and <em>.obj</em> into compressed format <em>.crt</em></p>

<pre>Usage:

corto [options] FILE

FILE is the path to a .ply or a .obj 3D model.

	-o &lt;output&gt;: filename of the .crt compressed file.
						if not specified the extension of the input file will be replaced.
	-e &lt;key=value&gt;: add an exif property, or more than one.
	-p : treat the input as a point cloud.
	-v &lt;bits&gt;: vertex bits quantization. If not specified an euristic is used
	-n &lt;bits&gt;: normal bits quantization. Default 10.
	-c &lt;bits&gt;: color bits quantization. Default 6.
	-u &lt;bits&gt;: texture coordinate bits. Default 10.
	-q &lt;step&gt;: quantization step unit (float) instead of bits for vertex coordinates
	-N &lt;prediction&gt;: normal prediction can be:
						delta: use difference from previous normal (fastest)
						 estimated: use difference from compute normals (cheaper)
						border: store difference only for boundary vertices (cheapest)
	-A : compute and add normals to the model.
	-P &lt;file.ply&gt;: decompress and save as .ply for debugging purpouses
</pre>

<p>Material groups for obj (newmtl) and ply with texnumbers are preserved into the crt model, additional properties can be stored in the file using the <em>-e</em> option.</p>

<p><em>-v 12</em> will result in the quantization of the coordinates to 1/4096th of the largest dimension in the bounding box. If not specified the quantization step is set to 1/20th of the average edge.</p>

<p><em>-n 10</em> normals are stored using the octahedron parametrization to a square of 1024x1024 positions, resulting in a better sample distribution than quantization in 3D.</p>


<h2><a name="cortoloader"></a>CORTOLoader</h2>

<p>CORTOLoader.js is similar to THREE.OBJLoader in functionality, and can easily replace it in three.js.</p>

<pre>var loader = new THREE.CORTOLoader({ path: "models/" });  
//materials autocreated, pass otherwise option loadMaterial: false

loader.load("bunny.crt", function(mesh) {
	//needed to render on texture load
	mesh.addEventListener("change", render);

	if(!mesh.geometry.attributes.normal)
		mesh.geometry.computeVertexNormals();

	scene.add(mesh); 
	render();
});
</pre>

<p>CORTOLoader is pretty self-explanatory in how to create a THREE.Mesh:</p>

<pre>var decoder = new CortoDecoder(blob); //where blob is an ArrayBuffer
var model = decoder.decode();

var geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
if(model.nface)
	geometry.setIndex(new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.index, 1));

if(model.groups.length &gt; 0) {
	var start = 0;
	for(var i = 0; i &lt; model.groups.length; i++) {
		var g = model.groups[i];
		geometry.addGroup(start*3, g.end*3, i);
		start = g.end;
	}
}

geometry.addAttribute('position', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.position, 3));
if(model.color)
	geometry.addAttribute('color', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.color, 3, true));
if (model.normal)
	geometry.addAttribute('normal', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.normal, 3, true));
if (model.uv)
	geometry.addAttribute('uv', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.uv, 2));

var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry);
</pre>



<h2><a name="corto.js"></a>Corto.js</h2>

<p>CortoDecoder class decodes a .crt as an arraybuffer and returns an objects with attributes (positions, index, colors etc).</p>

<pre>&lt;script src="js/corto.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'bunny.crt');
request.responseType = 'arraybuffer';
request.onload = function() {
	var decoder = new CortoDecoder(this.response);
	var model = decoder.decode();
	console.log(model.nvert, model.nface, model.groups);
	console.log('Index: ', model.index);
	console.log('Positions: ', model.position);
	console.log('Colors: ', model.color);
	console.log('Nornmals: ', model.normal);
	console.log('Tex coords: ', model.uv);
	//custom attributes can be encoded, see cortolib below for details.
}
request.send();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h2><a name="libcorto"></a>Libcorto</h2>

<p>Interface is not entirely stable, no mayor change is expected. See src/main.cpp for an extensive example.</p>

<pre>#include &lt;corto/encoder.h&gt;
#include &lt;corto/decoder.h&gt;

std::vector&lt;float&gt; coords;
std::vector&lt;uint32_t&gt; index;
std::vector&lt;float&gt; uv;
std::vector&lt;float&gt; radius;

//fill data arrays...

crt::Encoder encoder(nvert, nface);

//add attributes to be encoded
encoder.addPositions(coords.data(), index.data(), vertex_quantization_step);
encoder.addUvs(uvs.data(), pow(2, -uv_bits));

//add custom attributes
encoder.addAttribute("radius", (char *)radiuses.data(), crt::VertexAttribute::FLOAT, 1, 1.0f);

const char *compressed_data = encoder.stream.data();
const uint32_t compressed_size = encoder.stream.size();
Decoding

crt::Decoder decoder(size, data);

//allocate memory if needed
coords.resize(decoder.nvert*3);
index.resize(decoder.nface*3);

//tell the decoder where to decompress data
decoder.setPositions(coords.data());

if(decoder.data.count("uv")) {
	out.uvs.resize(decoder.nvert*2);
	decoder.setUvs(out.uvs.data());
}
//actually decode
decoder.decode();
</pre>

<h3><a name="encoder"></a>Encoder</h3>

<pre>Encoder(uint32_t _nvert, uint32_t _nface = 0, Stream::Entropy entropy = Stream::TUNSTALL);
</pre>

<p>The Encoder class assume the input is an indexed mesh, specify the number of vertices and faces (0 for point clouds). For debug or entropy compression test Stream supports lzip and lz4, they can be enabled defining ENTROPY_TESTS in the makefile.</p>

<p>Vertex coordinates, attributes and indices are passed to the encoder (assuming they respect the nvert, nface paramenters: 3*nvert for positions and normals, 4*nvert for colors, 2*nvert for uv, 3*nface for indices)</p>

<h4>Coordinates</h4>

<pre>bool addPositions(const float *buffer, float q = 0.0f, Point3f o = Point3f(0.0f)); //for point clouds
bool addPositions(const float *buffer, const uint32_t *index, float q = 0.0f, Point3f o = Point3f(0.0f));
bool addPositions(const float *buffer, const uint16_t *index, float q = 0.0f, Point3f o = Point3f(0.0f));
</pre>

<p><em>q</em> specify the quantization parameter, while <em>o</em> the origin of the quantization (v[i*3+k] = (buffer[i*3+k] - o[k])/q</p>
<p>If q is not specified the quantization step is estimated as 1/20th of the average edge length (or a function of the volume and number of the points
for point clouds).</p>

<pre>bool addPositionsBits(const float *buffer, int bits);
bool addPositionsBits(const float *buffer, uint32_t *index, int bits);
bool addPositionsBits(const float *buffer, uint16_t *index, int bits);
</pre>

<p>It might be more convenient to specify quantization step in term of the bits needed per coordinate</p>

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<pre>bool addNormals(const float *buffer, int bits, NormalAttr::Prediction no = NormalAttr::ESTIMATED);
bool addNormals(const int16_t *buffer, int bits, NormalAttr::Prediction no = NormalAttr::ESTIMATED);

bool addColors(const unsigned char *buffer, int rbits = 6, int gbits = 7, int bbits = 6, int abits = 5);

bool addUvs(const float *buffer, float q = 0);
</pre>

<p>Normal quantization is expressed in bits, referring to the octahedron parametrization space.</p>
<p>Prediction for normal attribute can be</p>
<ul>
<li>DELTA: difference from previous normal, it's fast but provide less compression
</li><li>ESTIMATED: difference from normal estimated from the vertex coordinates (and wont apply to point clouds)
slower than DELTA, but especially when coordinates are saved with high precision will provide better compression
</li><li>BORDER: will only preserve boundary normals. This is especially useful if the model is split into pieces
(for example in <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/nexus">Nexus</a> multiresolution viewer.
</li></ul>
<p>Color quantization for red, green, blue, alpha. Internally the color is stored as 
poor man YCbCr color space (where G estimates Y!), might be changed to something better and quantization refer to the internal space</p>

<h4>Generic attributes</h4>

<pre>bool addAttribute(const char *name, const char *buffer, VertexAttribute::Format format, 
	int components, float q, uint32_t strategy = 0);
bool addAttribute(const char *name, char *buffer, VertexAttribute *attr);
</pre>

<h4>Groups</h4>

<pre>void addGroup(int end_triangle);
void addGroup(int end_triangle, std::map<std::string, std::string=""> &amp;props);
</std::string,></pre>

<h4>Result</h4>

<pre>void encode();
</pre>

<p>After the decode call the numnber of vertices and faces might be different: degenerate triangles are removed and duplicated points
in point clouds are also removed</p>

<pre>uint32_t nvert = encoder.nvert;
uint32_t nface = encoder.nface;
</pre>

<p>The <em>.crt</em> bytes are stored in the <em>stream</em> member</p>

<pre>size_t count = encoder.stream.size();
size_t written = fwrite ( encoder.stream.data(), 1, count, file);
</pre>

<p>For details on compression bitrates see <em>main.cpp</em>.</p>





<h3><a name="decoder"></a>Decoder</h3>

<pre>Decoder(int len, const uchar *input);
</pre>

<p>Upon initializatiom, the decoder class will provide info about what is presente in the <em>.crt</em>, default attributes
are <em>position, normal, color, uv</em>.</p>

<pre>uint32_t nvert = encoder.nvert;
uint32_t nface = encoder.nface;

bool hasAttr(const char *name);
</pre>

<p>You are in charge to pass the decoder an allocated memory buffer where to decode attributes and index</p>

<pre>	bool setPositions(float *buffer);
	bool setNormals(float *buffer);
	bool setNormals(int16_t *buffer);
	bool setColors(uchar *buffer);
	bool setUvs(float *buffer);

	void setIndex(uint32_t *buffer);
	void setIndex(uint16_t *buffer);
</pre>

<p>Custom attributes can be requested, either using the default attribute type or a custom class.</p>

<pre>	bool setAttribute(const char *name, char *buffer, …</pre></div></div>

</div><p>to control context cancelation using Unix signals, simplifying handling operating system signals in Go for certain common cases. This is my first contribution to the Go standard library, and I am very excited!</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>When writing <abbr title="command-line interface">CLI</abbr> code, I often needed to handle cancellation – for instance, when a user presses CTRL+C producing an interrupt signal. Another possible use case is to handle graceful termination of HTTP servers using <code>http.*Server.Shutdown(ctx)</code>.</p>
<p>I had to write code using the signal package often and in multiple places. I didn’t want that, so I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/henvic/ctxsignal">ctxsignal</a> package to solve this common problem two years ago.</p>
<p>However, I kept finding it in other places and noticing people would often not handle proper termination correctly or at all, so I got motivated to submit a proposal and try to improve this situation.</p>

</div><p>This program will print <code>"missed signal"</code> after 10 seconds or will print <code>"signal received"</code> when the user sends an interruption signal, such as by pressing CTRL+C on a keyboard.</p>
<p>Please note that the second returned value of the <code>signal.NotifyContext</code> function is a function called <code>stop</code> instead of <code>cancel</code>. Once you’re done handling a system signal, you should call <code>stop</code>. We call it <code>stop</code> instead of <code>cancel</code> because you need to call it to stop capturing any further system signal you registered with <code>NotifyContext</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stop function unregisters the signal behavior, which, like signal.Reset, may restore the default behavior for a given signal.</p>

<li>After some discussions, a somewhat modified proposal was accepted on 1 April as a WithCancelSignal in the context package</li>
<li>It was moved back to the proposal stage on 15 April after some concerns were presented about having it in the context package</li>
<li>After more discussions, it was accepted again on 20 May as NotifyContext in the signal package</li>
<li>A couple of days ago, I restarted working on it.</li>

                <div>
                    <h3>Here's my best practice guidelines for form design. </h3>
                    <p>Working on a design system for a bank has taught me a lot about forms. I've watched testing in our labs. I've worked alongside experts from specialist accessibility organisations. I've seen forms tested by disabled people and users of assistive technology. I've also read a lot of research.</p> 
                    <p>From all this learning I've formed my own forms best-practice guidelines. I thought it would be useful start recording it. Here's my work in progress. I do UI/UX so I'm coming at this from a designer's perspective.               
              
    </p><h2 id="principles"> First, some principles</h2>
                    
                    <hr>
					<p>It's important to start with with a set of principles. It's easy to become swayed by design trends and I have to bring myself back to the user.</p><p>I aspire to the <a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/">Inclusive Design Principles</a>. Designing forms for people experiencing permanent, temporary or situational disabilities improves the experience for everyone. I also look to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility">WCAG</a> principles. Your website or app must be: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>perceivable</li>
	<li>operable</li>
	<li>understandable</li>
	<li>robust and compatible</li>

	</ul>
	<p>In summary, think of your user and keep things as simple and as functional as possible. But don't overvalue simplicity and style at the <a href="https://uxmyths.com/post/115783813605/myth-34-simple-minimal">cost of clarity</a>.

        <p>Buttons trigger an action or event such as continuing to the next stage or submitting a form. Use them purposely.</p>        
        
		<div>        
        	<h3>My guidelines</h3>  
        
       		 <ul>
        	<li>Button text should describe the action the button performs and be consistent through the journey.</li>
        	<li>Don't overload the user with choices. Use only one primary button on each page for the main action.</li>
        	<li>Place the submit button where users look for it. In a standard form journey this is usually to the left edge of the form, directly below the final field.</li>
        	<li>Make destructive buttons like cancel or previous harder for the user to find. A back button or link often works well above the form.</li>
        	<li>Avoid disabled buttons. They have poor contrast and can cause confusion.</li>
        	</ul>

        	<li>Order radios from most to least common options. If this will cause an unwanted bias, order options alphabetically.</li>
			<li>Place hint text under the form label.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="8thaz7jLrmqDqCxZnm3JAC">
	<time datetime="2020-09-16">September 16, 2020</time>
  
	<p>These are my thoughts on ageism - discriminating people, and more importantly, ideas, just because of someone’s age.</p>

<p>I’m 22 years old. If you’re older than me, don’t hang up. Give me a chance. Sure, I may not have as much experience as you, and a lot of what I say may be wrong and uninformed, but that’s fine. Mistakes are good because that means decisions are being made - and I can fix those mistakes, but I have to start somewhere - and that’s where this post comes in.</p>

<p>I’m going to pitch this idea in two ways. First, to someone younger than me, and then, to someone older. You’ll want to read them both to fully understand my view</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>To someone younger,<br>
When I disregard an idea you have - it might be because it’s a terrible idea - but more often than not, it’s because I’m jealous. I see a better version of myself when I look at you. You bring with you so much enthusiasm and potential, that I often wonder “What the f*** am I doing with my life?”. My feedback doesn’t come from a good place, and I certainly don’t have your best interests at heart. I feel like you might out-achieve me, and that’s terrifying. I too had big dreams 10 years ago that I haven’t achieved - so why should you? </p>

<p>I’m shutting you down because it makes me feel better. If anyone can understand that - it’s got to be you. Why? Well, you’re really ambitious, and you’ll do anything to leave your mark on this world, including preventing others from stealing your limelight. You came to me because you saw someone you respected and could look up to - and because I’m similar to you. If I am indeed similar to you, then I’m doing exactly what you would do too.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll walk away from a conversation with me the same way I did with my elders - with disdain, and a burning passion to prove them wrong. </p>

<p>More importantly, if I tell you that you’re doing a good job - be terrified. Approval from someone you respect is a dangerous drug. Your goal isn’t to get my approval - it’s to get me to be terrified of you and for me to do anything I can to shut you down. It’s so easy to get trapped relying on the approval of an elder.</p>

<p>Honestly, at the end of the day, I blame you. You look up to us, as elders, to be your mentors and you expect us to be mature and have your best interests at heart. Why is that? Because we’re older? That’s aegist.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>To my elders,<br>
I do look up to you. Not because you’re older than me, or have more experience. No. I look to you as a worthy opponent - someone I can still beat. I’ve already failed my younger self by not hitting the goals I had, but when I see you - I’m not there yet, and that means I can still do better. </p>

<p>At first, I try to figure out what you were like at my age. Sure, I’m interested in your life, but more importantly, I’m pacing myself. I try to figure out what metrics I’m doing better than you on, and on what metrics I’m doing worse. If you’re within a reasonable band, then I’ll treat you as an equal. If you were significantly ahead when you were my age, then I’ll try my best to catch up. You can’t change your past, but I can change my future, and that means I have potential. I will still see you as an equal though - because anything more, and I’m bound to your approval. If I’m bound to your approval, then I can never beat you. I can only ever be good enough.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your advice, and yes, even your stories and experiences. Learning what you did right and wrong is really valuable. After all, passing knowledge between generations is what brought humanity this far. While spewing words of wisdom is great for your self esteem - don’t ever forget the golden rule. You’re giving me advice, not orders. Don’t be disappointed when I don’t do what you say. I value your opinions, the same way I value the opinions of a peer or someone younger than me. Would you like me to weigh your words more highly? Why? Because you’re older than them? That’s aegist.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Ageism is an unfortunate fact of life in our society. We all experience it, but we also all contribute to it. Instead of trying to fix society, it’s far easier to adjust your own worldview so you’re less affected by it. I hope this essay helps you do just that</p>

Quality of software is driven by both the talent of its creators and how they feel while theyâ€™re crafting it. Teams that have the time and energy to be focused on the work itself can build magical, high quality software. Our tools and practices need to do their best to nurture this, not take it away.</p><p>To bring back the right focus, these are the foundational ideas Linear is built on.</p></header><section><h2>Principles</h2><h3>Build for the creators</h3><p>Software project management tools should build with the end users â€“ the creators â€“ in mind. Keeping individuals productive is more important than generating perfect reports.</p><h3>Opinionated software</h3><p>Productivity software should be opinionated. It's the only way the product can truly do the heavy lifting for you. Flexible software lets everyone invent their own workflows, which eventually creates chaos as teams scale.</p><h3>Create momentum â€“ don't sprint</h3><p>We should find a cadence and routine of working. In cycles, we decide priorities and assign responsibilities. Our goal is to maintain a healthy momentum with our teams, not rush towards the end.</p><h3>Meaningful direction</h3><p>Our daily work might be filled with tasks but we should understand and remind our teams of the purpose and long term goals of our work. Roadmaps, projects and milestones are all important to keep in mind as we plan our weekly schedules.</p><h3>Aim for clarity</h3><p>Donâ€™t invent terms if possible, as these can confuse and have different meanings in different teams. Projects should be called projects.</p><h3>Say no to busy work</h3><p>Our tools should not make us the designers and maintainers of them. We should throw away or automate the busy work so you can focus on the more important work.</p><h3>Simple first, then powerful</h3><p>Teams at different sizes have different needs. Tools should be simple to get started with and grow more powerful over time.</p><h3>Decide and move on</h3><p>There isn't always a best answer. The important thing is to make a decision, and move on.</p></section><section><h2>Practices</h2><h3>Set monthly, quarterly or/and annual roadmaps</h3><p>Ambitious goals are the only way to make a significant impact. Companies should focus on them when they define their high level direction. Reserve some space on your roadmaps for unexpected and reactive work that always comes up and allow your roadmap to change if needed.</p><h3>Connect daily work to larger goals with projects</h3><p>All projects and work should directly correlate to these goals. Review projects and their target dates during roadmap meetings and pull from projects as you plan cycles.</p><h3>Work in <i>n-week</i> cycles</h3><p>Cycles create healthy routine and focus teams on what needs to happen next. 2-week cycles are the most common in software building. They're short enough to not lose sight of other priorities but long enough to build significant features. Cycles should feel reasonable. Don't overload cycles with tasks and let unfinished items move to the next cycle automatically.</p><h3>Keep a manageable backlog</h3><p>You don't need to save every feature request or piece of feedback. Important ones will resurface and low priority ones will never get fixed. A more focused backlog makes it easier and faster to plan cycles, and ensures the work will actually get done.</p><h3>Mix feature and quality work</h3><p>All software has bugs, more than we can ever fix. Include bugs and other fixes as part of your cycles. Invest in tooling as it is a force multiplier if done right.</p><h3>Specify project and issue owners</h3><p>Each project should have a named owner responsible to own delivery and write the project brief. The same goes for issues. Others should collaborate but responsibility should lie with a single person.</p><h3>Write project specs</h3><p>Aim for brevity. Short specs are more likely to be read. The purpose of a spec is to briefly communicate the "why", "what" and "how" of the project to the rest of the team. Ideally these short documents force teams to scope out work so priorities are clear and teams avoid building the wrong thing.</p><h3>Understand your users</h3><p>The more popular your product, the more feedback you'll get. Overflowing inboxes are a good sign unless they're bug reports. Donâ€™t worry too much about organizing all the feedback. Collect it and use it as a research library when developing new features. Try to spot trends. Use feedback, even complaints, as an opportunity to get to know your users and ask them to explain why they want a specific feature so you find out their needs. Solve the problem â€“ donâ€™t just build the feature.</p><h3>Scope issues to be as small as possible</h3><p>It's hard to see visible progress when working on large tasks, which can be demotivating. Break down work into smaller parts and create an issue for each one when possible. Ideally you can complete several concrete tasks each week. It feels great to mark issues as done.</p><h3>Measure progress with actual work</h3><p>The clearest way to see whether something is complete or not is to show the diff in the code or design file. When the tasks are scoped small, your changes will be small and easier to review, too. Avoid massive pull requests or large design changes.</p><h3>Run cross-functional teams</h3><p>Designers and engineers should work together on projects, creating a natural push and pull. Designers bring their skills to explore ideas and push your team's thinking. Engineers can challenge thinking around implementation and will bring the winning ideas to reality. The best creators often have talent for both. Directly loop in other teams when building features they'll use or ask customers they interact with to use.</p><h3>Write a changelog</h3><p>Itâ€™s important to look back and celebrate what you achieved as a team. Consistent changelogs also communicate to the user new features, the value they get from your product, and your commitment to improving it. It's also an easy way to connect your team's individual work to the collective value they create.<!-- --> <a href="https://medium.com/linear-app/startups-write-changelogs-c6a1d2ff4820">Read more</a> on how we write ours.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<p>Repl is a great window into a running program, but the textual nature of its output limits developer’s ability to inspect the program: a text is not an object, and we are dealing with objects in the VM.</p>

<p>Reveal aims to solve this problem by creating an in-process repl output pane that makes inspecting values as easy as selecting an interesting datum. It recognizes the value of text as a universal interface, that’s why its output looks like a text: you can select it, copy it, save it into a file. Unlike text, reveal output holds references to printed values, making inspecting selected value a matter of opening a context menu.</p>

<p>Unlike datafy/nav based tools, Reveal does not enforce a particular data representation for any given object, making it an open set — that includes datafy/nav as one of the available options. It does not use datafy/nav by default because in the absence of inter-process communication to datafy is to lose.</p>

<p>Not being limited to text, Reveal uses judicious syntax highlighting to aid in differentiating various objects: text <code>java.lang.Integer</code> looks differently depending on whether it was produced from a symbol or a class.</p>



<p>The easiest way to try it is to run a Reveal repl:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {vlaaad/reveal {:mvn/version "1.0.130"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-m</span> vlaaad.reveal repl
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Executing this command will start a repl and open Reveal output window that will mirror the evaluations in the shell.</p>



<h2 id="tap-support"><code>tap&gt;</code> support</h2>

<p>Clojure 1.10 added <code>tap&gt;</code> function with the purpose similar to printing the value for debugging, but instead of characters you get the object. Reveal repls show tapped values in their output windows — you won’t need <code>println</code> anymore!</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/tap.gif" alt="Tap demo"></p>

<h2 id="eval-on-selection">Eval on selection</h2>

<p>You can evaluate code on any selected value by using text input in the context menu. You can write either a single symbol of a function to call or a form where <code>*v</code> will be replaced with selected value.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/eval-on-selection.gif" alt="Eval on selection demo"></p>

<h2 id="inspect-object-fields-and-properties">Inspect object fields and properties</h2>

<p>Any object in the JVM has class and fields, making them easily accessible for inspection is extremely important. With <code>java-bean</code> contextual action you get a debugger-like view of objects in the VM. Access to this information greatly improves the visibility of the VM and allows to explore it. For example, for any class you have on the classpath you can get the place where it’s coming from:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/java-bean.gif" alt="Java bean demo">
I learned about it after implementing this feature :)</p>

<h2 id="look-and-feel-customization">Look and feel customization</h2>

<p>Reveal can be configured with <code>vlaaad.reveal.prefs</code> java property to use different font or theme:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/light-theme.png" alt="Light theme"></p>

<h2 id="url-and-file-browser">URL and file browser</h2>

<p>You can open URL-like things and files: both internally in Reveal and externally using other applications in your OS e.g. file explorer, browser or text editor.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/browse.gif" alt="Browse demo"></p>

<h2 id="doc-and-source">Doc and source</h2>

<p>Reveal can show you documentation and sources for various runtime values — namespaces, vars, symbols, functions, keywords (if they define a spec). Like <a href="https://cljdoc.org/">cljdoc</a>, it supports <code>[[wikilink]]</code> syntax in docstrings to refer to other vars, making them accessible for further exploration.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/doc-and-source.gif" alt="Doc and source demo"></p>

<h2 id="ref-watchers">Ref watchers</h2>
<p>Reveal can watch any object implementing <code>clojure.lang.IRef</code> (things like atoms, agents, vars, refs) and display it either automatically updated or as a log of successors.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/watchers.gif" alt="Ref watchers demo"></p>

<h2 id="charts">Charts</h2>

<p>Reveal can show data of particular shapes as charts that are usually explorable: when you find an interesting data point on the chart, you can then further inspect the data in that data point.</p>

<p>The simplest shape is labeled numbers. Labeled means that those numbers exist in some collection that has a unique label for every number. For maps, keys are labels, for sequential collections, indices are labels and for sets, numbers themselves are labels.</p>

<p>A pie chart shows labeled numbers:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/pie-chart.gif" alt="Pie chart demo"></p>

<p>Other charts support more flexible data shapes — both because they can show more than one data series, and because they can be explored, where it might be useful to attach some metadata with the number. Since JVM numbers don’t allow metadata, you can instead use tuples where the first item is a number and second is the metadata. Bar charts can display labeled numbers (single data series) or labeled numbers that are themselves labeled (multiple data series):</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/bar-chart.gif" alt="Bar chart demo"></p>

<p>Line charts are useful to display progressions, so Reveal suggests them to display sequential numbers (and labeled sequential numbers):</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/line-chart.gif" alt="Line chart demo"></p>

<p>Finally, Reveal has scatter charts to display coordinates on a 2D plane. A coordinate is represented as a tuple of 2 numbers and as with numbers, you can use a tuple of coordinate and arbitrary value in the place of coordinate. Reveal will suggest scatter charts for collections of coordinates and labeled collections of coordinates.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/scatter-chart.gif" alt="Scatter chart demo"></p>

<h2 id="table-view">Table view</h2>

<p>There are cases where it is better to make sense of the value when it is represented by a table: collections of homogeneous items where columns make it easier to compare corresponding parts of those items, and big deeply nested data structures where it’s easier to look at them layer by layer.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/table.gif" alt="Table view demo"></p>

<h2 id="and-more">…and more</h2>

<p>Reveal was designed to be performant: it can stream syntax-highlighted output very fast. In addition to that, there are various helpers for data inspection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>text search that is triggered by <kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl F</kbd>;</li>
  <li>out of the box <a href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/deep-diff2">lambdaisland’s deep-diff</a> output highlighting: all you need to do is have it on the classpath;</li>
  <li>various contextual actions:
    <ul>
      <li>deref derefable things;</li>
      <li>get meta if a selected value has some meta;</li>
      <li>convert java array to vector;</li>
      <li>view the color of a thing that describes a color (like <code>"#fff"</code> or <code>:red</code>);</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="ui-concepts-and-navigation">UI concepts and navigation</h2>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/concepts.png" alt="Concepts"></p>

<p>Reveal UI is made of 3 components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>output panel that contains data submitted to reveal window (e.g. repl output);</li>
  <li>a context menu that can invoke actions on selected values;</li>
  <li>results panel that has 1 or more tabs with action results produced from the context menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Navigation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd> or right mouse button to open a context menu on selection;</li>
  <li>Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch focus between output and results panel;</li>
  <li>In results panel:
    <ul>
      <li>Use <kbd>Ctrl ←</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl →</kbd> to switch tabs in results panel;</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the tab</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In a context menu:
    <ul>
      <li>Use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move focus between available actions and input text field;</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute selected action or form written in the text field;</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the context menu.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>

<p>Reveal can be customized using <code>vlaaad.reveal.prefs</code> java property that contains an edn map of UI preferences. Supported keys (all optional):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>:theme</code> — color theme, <code>:light</code> or <code>:dark</code>;</li>
  <li><code>:font-family</code> — system font name (like <code>"Consolas"</code>) or URL (like <code>"file:/path/to/font.ttf"</code> or <code>"https://ff.static.1001fonts.net/u/b/ubuntu.mono.ttf"</code>) — reveal only supports monospaced fonts;</li>
  <li><code>:font-size</code> — font size, number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>clj <span>-A</span>:reveal <span>\</span>
<span>-J-Dvlaaad</span>.reveal.prefs<span>=</span><span>'{:font-family "Consolas" :font-size 15}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-m</span> vlaaad.reveal repl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="user-api">User API</h2>

<p>The main entry point to Reveal is <code>vlaaad.reveal</code> ns that has various repls and lower-level functionality for data inspection.</p>

<h3 id="repl"><code>repl</code></h3>

<p>It is a repl wraps <code>clojure.main/repl</code> with additional support for <code>:repl/quit</code> and <code>tap&gt;</code>. It is as simple as it gets. I use it all the time. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>clj <span>-A</span>:reveal <span>-m</span> vlaaad.reveal repl
<span># Reveal window appears</span>
Clojure 1.10.1
<span>user</span><span>=&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="io-prepl"><code>io-prepl</code></h3>

<p>This prepl works like <code>clojure.core.server/io-prepl</code>. Its purpose is to be run in a process on your machine that you want to connect to using another prepl-aware tool. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>clj <span>-A</span>:reveal <span>\</span>
<span>-J-Dclojure</span>.server.reveal<span>=</span><span>'{:port 5555 :accept vlaaad.reveal/io-prepl}'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now you can connect to this process using any socket repl and it will show a Reveal window for every connection:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>nc localhost 5555
<span># reveal window appears</span>
<span>(</span>+ 1 2 3<span>)</span> <span># input</span>
<span>{</span>:tag :ret, :val <span>"6"</span>, :ns <span>"user"</span>, :ms 1, :form <span>"(+ 1 2 3)"</span><span>}</span> <span># output</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="remote-prepl"><code>remote-prepl</code></h3>

<p>Reveal is the most useful when it runs in the process where the development happens. This prepl, unlike the previous two, is not like that: it connects to a remote process and shows a window for values that arrived from the network. It can’t benefit from easy access to printed references because these references are pointing to values deserialized from bytes, not values in the target VM. It’s still nice and performant repl, and it’s useful when you want to use Reveal to talk to another process that does not have Reveal on the classpath (e.g. production or ClojureScript prepl).</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start a prepl without Reveal on the classpath:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.764"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-J-Dclojure</span>.server.cljs-prepl<span>=</span><span>'{:port 50505 :accept cljs.server.browser/prepl}'</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Connect to that prepl using Reveal:
    <div><div><pre><code>$ clj -A:reveal -m vlaaad.reveal remote-prepl :port 50505
# at this point, 2 things happen:
# 1. Browser window with cljs prepl appears
# 2. Reveal window opens

# input
js/window

# output
{:tag :ret, 
 :val #object [Window [object Window]], 
 :ns "cljs.user", 
 :ms 25, 
 :form "js/window"}
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ui"><code>ui</code></h3>

<p>Calling this function will create and show a Reveal window. It returns a function that you can submit values to — they will appear in the output panel. All built-in visual repls are thin wrappers of other repls that submit values to a window created by this generic function. You can use it to create custom Reveal-flavored repls, or, instead of using it as a repl, you can configure Reveal to only show tapped values.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>require</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>[</span><span>vlaaad.reveal</span><span> </span><span>:as</span><span> </span><span>reveal</span><span>])</span><span>

</span><span>;; open a window that will show tapped values:</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>add-tap</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>reveal/ui</span><span>))</span><span>

 </span><span>;; submit value to the window:</span><span>
</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div></div>

        <p>Today Apple announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2020/">at their media event</a> that the final public release of iOS 14 ships tomorrow, which came as quite a shock to all third-party developers.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>This unwelcome surprise comes against the backdrop of dozens of controversies around the App Store — most recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust">Hey.com</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games-account">Epic</a>, but more generally its <a href="https://marco.org/2020/09/11/app-review-changes">painfully confusing</a> and <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/05/10/heads_up_to_rss_reader_authors">arbitrarily applied</a> rules, its incomprehensible <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/rejection/">app rejections</a> and their often sudden retractions, app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/07/flexbright-adjust-display-temperature/">approvals followed by sudden removals</a> without explanation, and the general unequal treatment of developers where <a href="https://gizmodo.com/researchers-uber-s-ios-app-had-secret-permissions-that-1819177235">big companies</a> or favorites <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/02/27/bbedit-12-6-to-return-to-the-mac-app-store/">get special treatment</a>. It leaves me wondering, what the hell is Apple’s strategy here? This is not a flurry of bad PR for the sake of it. There are serious problems here that need to be addressed — in particular, Developer Relations.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p>Historically, these events announce new hardware and the upcoming release of the next major version of iOS, which is typically made public a few days later or the following week. For as long as I can remember it goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple hosts a media event on a Tuesday in September.</li>
  <li>Announcements include new iPhones, iPads, and Watches. Or, at least some combination of those. Maybe something about Apple TV.</li>
  <li>All of the new hardware will run the latest version of iOS (or watchOS, or tvOS).</li>
  <li>The next major release of iOS is announced to be shipping on Friday (in a few days) or sometime the following week, like the next Tuesday.</li>
</ul>

<p>But today, Apple announced that iOS 14 is shipping <strong>tomorrow</strong>. This was near the end of the event — at roughly 11:00 AM Pacific time. This means West Coast developers have half a day to put the final touches on their app updates for iOS 14 <strong>AND</strong> get their apps submitted with the just-released Xcode 12 GM <strong>AND</strong> get through App Store review. None of those tasks are trivial, and no one familiar with them would agree that this is a sufficient amount of time to complete them. If you happen to be working on the East Coast, this means you were given just a few hours before the working day was over to get your app ready and submitted. And if you live in Europe or anywhere else in the world, well, go fuck yourself and good luck tomorrow!</p>

<p>On top of this, critical bugs still exist in the latest releases of the SDKs, Xcode 12, and iOS 14. It seems they will not be addressed.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p>Given the increasingly tenuous relationship that Apple has with developers, I do not understand how it could be in their interest to act like such an asshole right now. Not to mention, it is unlikely that they will even be able to review all of these app submissions in time. We already do not feel valued due to the aforementioned issues, and this is an outright negligent response to developer relationships the company has damaged over the past few years. Announcing that iOS 14 ships tomorrow with virtually no notice to developers is yet another breach of trust, another disappointment, and quite frankly feels like a big ‘fuck you’ to developers. What purpose does it serve to place this last-minute, unnecessary stress on third-party developers?</p>

<p>Who is in charge of iOS releases at Apple that thought this was a good idea? Who is the head of Developer Relations that thought this was a good idea?</p>

<p>To whomever made these decisions: <strong>y’all fucked up. Again.</strong></p>

September 15, 2020 | https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt12/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt12/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt11">last post</a> I ended by saying we
would be able to use <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a> to generate some simple tunes.
In this post we will actually put that to the test. Click the video to hear the end result :)</p><p>Brother John / Frère Jacques is a popular nursing rhyme, and also one of the few things I was taught
to play on the piano as a kid. As such, I thought it’d be fitting to try to code this song this time.
The notes for playing this are taken from <a href="https://www.true-piano-lessons.com/frere-jacques.html">true-piano-lessons.com</a>.
The code takes the notes starting in the key of C. (Maybe since it’s in Go, I should have started in G. Feel free to change it).</p><p>In the previous posts, we actually ignored the problem of turning notes into frequencies.
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a> works with given frequencies. So we’ll need to
first implement a way to turn the notes into frequencies. For this, I came up with a somewhat
hackish solution but I didn’t know a better way other than hardcoding it.</p><p>As we’re making the music using the equal-tempered scale we can calculate the frequencies for each
note given a reference frequency. I’m using <code>middle C</code> as the reference frequency, which can be
derived from <code>concert A (A440</code>) in this way: <code>middleC = (concertA * math.Pow(2, 3/12)) / 2</code>.</p><p>To follow along with how we derive the frequencies for each note, I suggest taking a look at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">wikipedia</a>. The basic idea however is that we have
12 semitones in an octave, so for each octave we have to generate the 12 semitones based off a
reference frequency. Confusingly however, an octave starts at <code>C</code> and not at <code>A</code>. (it does loop
around) so we get: <code>C D E F G A B</code>. Each time we loop around and get back to C, we move up one
octave (meaning higher frequency, thus higher pitch).</p><p>You can view a table of all frequencies from C0 (C at octave 0) up to B8 (B at octave 8)
<a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html">here</a>.</p><p>The code for this is a bit hacky, so if you have a better way please let me know! :-)</p><p>Here I am generating in both the fourth and fifth octave, from C4 -&gt; B5. If we print the map
generated by this code we get (abbreviated)</p><p>Also note that I have added <code>WAIT</code> with frequency 0 in there. This is a bit hacky (and unnecessary
in Go). I’ve added this so we can have some more wait time between playing different sections of the song.
As the default-zero value of a float is zero, and because you can access a map safely even when a
key is missing, this was not necessary. We could just call the map with the <code>WAIT</code> key even if it
wasn’t inserted and our result would still be correct.</p><p>If you’re reading this, there’s a pretty good chance you know this. But I wanted to highlight it, as
I think this is a pretty cool feature of Go! Yet, in this case, I chose to be explicit about the
intend of the <code>WAIT</code> note.</p><p>Alright, so we have our notes and our frequencies associated with them. We still need to actually
generate a wave. For this I’ve introduced the convenience function “play” which takes a few
parameters and returns a frame:</p><p>This is quite similar to the past about
<a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io.posts/audio-from-scratch-pt10.md">ADSR</a>, and just as in that post we
will apply the ADSR envelope to the signal here as well. Notice that ‘play’ takes a <code>LookupOscillator</code>.
In the previous post we’ve build a few of these for generating sine waves, triangle, square, etc.</p><p>This function tells us, play a note for a certain duration (in seconds) with a given oscillator, and
return a slice of frames. This function allowed me to quickly change the type of wave, and play
around with the result of playing different notes for different timespans.</p><p>Getting the ADSR envelope to sound like I wanted to was honestly the goold old way of trial and error. 😅.</p><p>Finally we have everything ready to compose the song. The below code is definitely not pretty, but it gets the job done!
First we generate the notes, then we create a wave table of a shape that we’d like. We
plug this into an Oscillator, and then we start calling the <code>Play</code> function with the notes that we
need.</p><p>For convenience I’ve added some variables to easily adapt the duration of sections of the song.
Variables, yeah!</p><div><div>

September 15, 2020 | https://www.ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    
<p>After several posts discussing different aspects of IT as a whole, I would like to start discussing another thread of thinking: software architecture. This is a huge topic and I pondered for quite a while where to start. Finally, I decided to start with debunking the long-lived architectural myth of reusability because this makes it easier to understand some of the ideas that I will discuss in later posts.</p>
<p>Reusability is a recurring topic that I discuss for lots of years meanwhile:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of my first public talks discussed reusability <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>I wrote an article about reusability for a (German) IT journal at the same time.</li>
<li>Some years later I published a <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2015/10/the-broken-promise-of-re-use/">post</a> discussing reusability on the blog of <a href="https://www.codecentric.de/">codecentric AG</a>.</li>
<li>I discuss this topic in many of my talks and workshops, especially in the context of service design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, all these places only discuss selected aspects of the reusability fallacy. Here I try to brings those aspects together and discuss reusability in a more comprehensive way – probably still missing some relevant facets.</p>
<h2 id="the-fallacy">The fallacy</h2>
<p>Reusability is sort of a holy grail in software architecture and design for many years. The discussion about reusable software modules <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> gained momentum in the early 1970s. E.g., the seminal computer science paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5388187">“Structured design”</a> by Stevens, Myers and Constantine from 1974 already discussed reusability as one of the goals of structured design. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>This discussion persists until today. And admittedly, the idea is intriguing: I create a software module once and as there are basically no reproduction costs in software, I can reuse it at no cost in as many places as I want. Invest once, harvest forever. What an efficiency lever! What a cost saver!</p>
<p>Hence, it is not surprising that generations of IT managers demand reusability as essential design goal, and their high priests, the architects in return try hard to deliver reusability. Over time this yearning for reusability has become independent. Nobody asks anymore if reusability makes sense in the given context. Reusability is important. Period!</p>
<p>Eventually, it even turned around: architects discovered that they can use reusability as a powerful sales argument for the introduction of new architectural paradigms. It was not necessary that they proved their claim. Simply arguing with reusability was enough to convince IT managers of the new paradigm. The typical reasoning was (and still is) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We definitely need to invest in implementing &lt;shiny new paradigm&gt;. I know this does not create any business value now, but it allows to create <strong>reusable</strong> &lt;building blocks of paradigm&gt;! This way, we will have to pay a lot less for future projects, they will be a lot faster and we will be a lot more flexible. <em>The investment will pay for itself in no time!</em>â€�</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From all that I have seen in my IT career, it never worked this way – and I am very sure, it also never will work in the future.</p>
<h2 id="a-deeply-industrial-belief">A deeply industrial belief</h2>
<p>The reason why it never works this way, has several facets. First of all, reusability is a deeply industrial belief. In the physical world, reusability is mostly interchangeable with standardization. Standardized parts support building the product at a lower price and can easily be reused in multiple products. On the other hand, any part that is designed with reusability in mind is a candidate for becoming a standardized part.</p>
<p>The key aspect of reusability/standardization in the physical world is that it helps to save costs over time. You need to spend the efforts to design the part only once. The production process needs to be designed and set up only once. The required tooling needs to be created and installed only once. Afterwards you can produce as many copies of the part as you like without having to repeat the design and setup investments.</p>
<p>This way, reusability helps satisfying the key success criterion of <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/markets/#industrial-markets">industrial markets</a>: scale production in a cost-efficient way. A big part of the cost savings comes from the production of the parts, that you can produce lots of them without having to design and set up the production process and tooling over and over again.</p>
<p>If you additionally create the part in a way that it can be (re)used in different contexts, you can produce an even higher quantity which helps spreading the fixed costs for design and setup even further, i.e., the part becomes even cheaper (in terms of costs, not quality).</p>
<p>Thus, consistently aiming for reusability makes a lot of sense in the physical world where you create houses, bridges, furniture, electronic devices, etc. from reusable parts. But transferring this idea of cost savings via reusability to software development is riddled with several caveats.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-is-part-of-design-not-production">Implementation is part of design, not production</h2>
<p>The first persistent misunderstanding is that writing code can be compared to building a house or assembling a car. The idea is that software architecture and design work can be compared to designing a car or house and writing code is executing the plan, i.e., assembling the final product.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this perception is completely wrong. The final product in software development is the executable program. We usually create it by compiling the source code <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. In other words: IT has the probably most efficient production process imaginable for more than 60 years meanwhile – so efficient, that we usually completely forget about it.</p>
<p>Today, this production process typically is a step in a CI/CD pipeline, but it does not change the fact that we build our products in an extremely efficient way without any human intervention.</p>
<p>Writing code on the other hand is completing the design. The product design is only completed after the last line of source code is written. Writing code is like adding the details of a car design, designing the details of the shape, the interior design, the power transmission and so on – everything that needs to be done <em>before</em> a car can be produced. Producing the actual product, the executable program from the code is negligible in terms of time, costs and effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing code is completing the design.</p>
<p>Building the product from the completed design is just issuing a command (and has nothing to do with writing code).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, all those metaphors that compare writing code with assembling a car or building a house are wrong.</p>
<p>This also means that the assumption derived from the physical world breaks that we can save lots of money in the production process by using reusable parts. The production process in IT is already unbelievable cheap compared to any physical domain. Additionally, we can produce as many copies of a part at basically zero cost: it is called the copy command.</p>
<p>Accordingly, all considerations that are based on the value of reusability in the physical world do not work in IT as reusability in software development does not help to save money in the production process.</p>
<h2 id="the-inherent-lack-of-standardization-in-it">The inherent lack of standardization in IT</h2>
<p>This still leaves room for efficiency gains through reusability in the design process. To (mis)use the metaphor of automobiles once more: Many car manufacturers use a platform strategy these days, i.e., they reuse a lot of standardized base parts in their car designs. E.g., they do not design the engines or chassis from scratch for every new model they design, but reuse engines or chassis from their platform, complementing them with parts individually designed for the specific model.</p>
<p>While this platform approach of reusing parts again primarily targets cost savings on the production side (which is not relevant in IT, as we have seen in the last section), it probably also helps to reduce time, costs and effort in the design process.</p>
<p>We can apply this idea to software development: The more reusable parts we can use in our design, i.e., software development process, the more time, costs and effort we can probably save.</p>
<p>This is where another peculiarity of IT strikes.</p>
<p>In his famous essay <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220477127_No_Silver_Bullet_Essence_and_Accidents_of_Software_Engineering">“No silver bullet”</a> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, Fred Brooks reasons about essential and accidental complexity in software development. One of the drivers of essential complexity he lists is “complexity”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complexity. Software entities are more complex for their size than perhaps any other human construct, because no two parts are alike (at least above the statement level). If they are, we make the two similar parts into one, a subroutine, open or closed. In this respect software systems differ profoundly from computers, buildings, or automobiles, where repeated elements abound. […] Likewise, a scaling-up of a software entity is not merely a repetition of the same elements in larger size; it is necessarily an increase in the number of different elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, Brooks clearly rejects the idea that we can design a software solution from a set of higher-level standardized building blocks in the same way as we can design a wall by arranging the same type of brick multiple times. Each part we use will be different from all other parts.</p>
<p>Yet, while making the case against standardized building blocks, Brooks still leaves room for reuse: he states each part in our solution will be different, but we may use a part several times from higher-level contexts. Following this idea, we reuse lower-level functionalities to support higher-level functionalities.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-left-for-reusability">What is left for reusability</h2>
<p>In this post, I tried to deconstruct a part of the reusability fallacy: the fallacy that we can save lots of money from a more efficient production process by using standardized, reusable parts. Software development is all about design. The design is only completed after the last line of code is written.</p>
<p>The actual production process, i.e., creating the executable program, is so efficient and cheap that there is nothing left to save. Thus, all the reusability approaches that take concepts from the physical world and try to apply them to software development do not work.</p>
<p>We are left with efficiency gains in the design process itself due to the use of reusable parts. In the <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_2/">next part of this little series</a> …</p></div></div>

  <section><p>Kontrast is a contrast checker available for desktop and mobile devices. You can
use Kontrast to choose background and text color combinations for your website or
app that your users will find easy to read. Kontrast can help you improve the
accessibility for your site or app for people with vision problems.</p>

<p>Kontrast won’t catch all the problems, but it should still be very helpful to catch
many issues early on, when designing your interface.</p>

<p>I released the first version of Kontrast earlier this month.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kde.org/screenshots/kontrast/kontrast.png" alt="Kontrast main page"></p>

<p>Another big feature of Kontrast is the possibility to generate random color
combinations with good contrast. These colors can be saved in the application itself,
so that you can keep a particularly good color combination for later use.</p>

<p>Kontrast is available for the Linux desktop, <a href="https://plasma-mobile.org/">Plasma Mobile</a> and
there is also a Beta version for Android.</p>

<p>This application is built using the excellent <a href="https://develop.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami">Kirigami</a>
framework.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kde.org/screenshots/kontrast/kontrat_mobile.png" alt="Kontrast mobile view"></p>

<p>You can download and install Kontrast from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.kde.kontrast">Flathub</a> and
a nightly build is also available <a href="https://binary-factory.kde.org/job/Kontrast_android/">in binary factory</a>.</p>

            <p><em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-4/">previous</a></em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. Last time, we added some
primitive unary instructions like <code>add1</code> and <code>integer-&gt;char</code>. This time, we’re
going to add some primitive <em>binary</em> functions like <code>+</code> and <code>&lt;</code>. After this
post, we’ll be able to compile programs like:</p>



<p>Note that these expressions may look like function calls but, like last
chapter, they are not opening new stack frames (which I’ll explain more about
later). Instead, the compiler will recognize that the programmer is directly
applying the symbol <code>+</code> and generate special code. You can think about this
kind of like an inlined function call.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that the compiler has a certain internal contract:
the result of any given compiled expression is stored in <code>rax</code>. This isn’t some
intrinsic property of all compilers, but it’s one we’ve kept so far in this
series.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is similar to but not the same as the calling convention that I
mentioned earlier, where function results are stored in <code>rax</code>. That calling
convention is for interacting with other people’s code. Within your own
generated code, there are no rules. So we could pick any other register,
really, for storing intermediate results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we’re building primitive functions that can take two arguments, you
might notice a problem: our strategy of storing the result in <code>rax</code> won’t work
on its own. If we were to naïvely write something like the following to
implement <code>+</code>, then <code>rax</code> would get overwritten in the code generated by
compiling <code>operand1(args)</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_call</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_symbol_matches</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>"+"</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>operand2</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>)));</span>
      <span>// The result of this is stored in rax ^</span>
      <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>operand1</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>)));</span>
      <span>// Oops, we just overwrote rax ^</span>
      <span>Emit_add_something</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>/*dst=*/</span><span>kRax</span><span>));</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could try and work around this by adding some kind of register allocation
algorithm and take advantage of <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, etc. Or, simpler, we could decide
to allocate all intermediate values on the stack and move on with our lives. I
prefer the latter. It’s simpler.</p>

<h3 id="stack-background-info">Stack background info</h3>

<p>Since we can’t yet save our compiled programs to disk, there’s some amount of
setup that has to happen before they’re run. Right now, the C programs I’m
providing along with this series compile to binaries that just run the test
suites for the compiler. They don’t actually run full programs. For this
reason, there are already some call frames on the stack by the time our
generated code is run.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the stack at the moment we enter a compiled Lisp program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>|                  | High addresses
+------------------+
|  main            |
+------------------+ |
|  ~ some data ~   | |
|  ~ some data ~   | |
+------------------+ |
|  compile_test    | |
+------------------+ |
|  ~ some data ~   | |
|  ~ some data ~   | v
+------------------+
|  Testing_exe...  | rsp (stack pointer)
+------------------+
|                  | &lt;-- Our frame!
|                  | Low addresses
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this diagram, we have the C program’s <code>main</code> function, which has its own
local variables and so on. Then the <code>main</code> function calls the <code>compile_test</code>
unit suite. This in turn calls this <code>Testing_execute_expr</code> function
(abbreviated in the diagram), which is responsible for calling into our
generated code. Every call stores the return address (some place to find the
next instruction to execute) on the stack and adjusts <code>rsp</code> down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Refresher: the call stack grows <em>down</em>. Why? Check out this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54391533/569183">StackOverflow
answer</a> that quotes an architect
on the Intel 4004 and 8080 architectures. It’s stayed the same ever since.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this diagram, we have <code>rsp</code> pointing at a return address somewhere inside
the function <code>Testing_execute_expr</code>, since that’s what called our Lisp
entrypoint. We have some data “above” (higher addresses) <code>rsp</code> that we’re not
allowed to poke at, and we have this empty space “below” (lower addresses)
<code>rsp</code> that is in our current <em>stack frame</em>. I say “empty” because we haven’t
yet stored anything there, not because it’s necessarily zero-ed out.  I don’t
think there are any guarantees about the values in this stack frame.</p>

<p>We can use our stack frame to write and read values for our current Lisp
program. With every recursive subexpression, we can allocate a little more
stack space to keep track of the values. When I say “allocate”, I mean
“subtract from the stack pointer”, because the stack is already a contiguous
space in memory allocated for us. For example, here is how we can write to the
stack:</p>



<p>This puts the integer <code>4</code> at displacement <code>-8</code> from <code>rsp</code>. On the stack diagram
above, it would be at the slot labeled “Our frame”. It’s also possible to read
with a positive or zero displacement, but those point to previous stack frames
and the return address, respectively. So let’s avoid manipulating those.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that I used a multiple of 8. Not every store has to be a to an address
that is a multiple of 8, but it is natural and I think also <em>faster</em> to store
8-byte-sized things at aligned addresses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s walk through a real example to get more hands-on experience with this
stack storage idea. We’ll use the program <code>(+ 1 2)</code>. The compiled version of
that program should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move <code>compile(2)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>rax</code> into <code>[rsp-8]</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>compile(1)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Add <code>[rsp-8]</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So after compiling that, the stack will look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>|                  | High addresses
+------------------+
|  Testing_exe...  | RSP
+------------------+
|  0x8             | RSP-8 (result of compile(2))
|                  | Low addresses
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the result will be in <code>rax</code>, per our internal compiler contract.</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but at some point we’ll need our compiled programs
to emit the <code>push</code> instruction or make function calls of their own. Both of
these modify the stack pointer. <code>push</code> writes to the stack and decrements
<code>rsp</code>. <code>call</code> is roughly equivalent to <code>push</code> followed by <code>jmp</code>.</p>

<p>For that reason, x86-64 comes with another register called <code>rbp</code> and it’s
designed to hold the Base Pointer. While the stack pointer is supposed to track
the “top” (low address) of the stack, the base pointer is meant to keep a
pointer around to the “bottom” (high address) of our current stack frame.</p>

<p>This is why in a lot of compiled code you see the following instructions
repeated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>myfunction:</span>
<span>push</span> <span>rbp</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>rsp</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span>  <span>; optional; allocate stack space for locals</span>
<span>; ... function body ...</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>rsp</span><span>,</span> <span>rbp</span>  <span>; required if you subtracted from rsp above</span>
<span>pop</span> <span>rbp</span>
<span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first three instructions, called the <em>prologue</em>, save <code>rbp</code> to the stack,
and then set <code>rbp</code> to the current stack pointer. Then it’s possible to maintain
steady references to variable locations on the stack even as <code>rsp</code> changes.
Yes, the compiler could adjust its internal table of references every time the
compiler emits code that modifies <code>rsp</code>, but that sounds much harder.</p>

<p>The last three instructions, called the <em>epilogue</em>, fetch the old <code>rbp</code> that we
saved to the stack, write it back into <code>rbp</code>, then exit the call.</p>

<p>To confirm this for yourself, check out this <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/qPM8Mh">sample compiled C
code</a>. Look at the disassembly following the
label <code>square</code>. Prologue, code, epilogue.</p>

<h3 id="stack-allocation-infrastructure">Stack allocation infrastructure</h3>

<p>Until now, we haven’t needed to keep track of much as we recursively traverse
expression trees. Now, in order to keep track of how much space on the stack
any given compiled code will need, we have to add more state to our compiler.
We’ll call this state the <code>stack_index</code> — Ghuloum calls it <code>si</code> — and we’ll
pass it around as a parameter. Whatever it’s called, it points to the first
writable (unused) index in the stack at any given point.</p>

<p>In compiled functions, the first writable index is <code>-kWordSize</code> (<code>-8</code>), since
the base pointers is already at <code>0</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_function</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Buffer_write_arr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kFunctionPrologue</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>kFunctionPrologue</span><span>);</span>
  <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>node</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>kWordSize</span><span>));</span>
  <span>Buffer_write_arr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kFunctionEpilogue</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>kFunctionEpilogue</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve also gone ahead and added the prologue and epilogue. They’re stored in
static arrays. This makes them easier to modify, and also makes them accessible
to testing helpers. The testing helpers can use these arrays to make testing
easier for us — we can check if our expected code is book-ended by this code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>byte</span> <span>kFunctionPrologue</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// push rbp</span>
    <span>0x55</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// mov rbp, rsp</span>
    <span>kRexPrefix</span><span>,</span> <span>0x89</span><span>,</span> <span>0xe5</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>byte</span> <span>kFunctionEpilogue</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// pop rbp</span>
    <span>0x5d</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// ret</span>
    <span>0xc3</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For <code>Compile_expr</code>, we just pass this new stack index through.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_pair</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Compile_call</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>AST_pair_car</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>),</span> <span>AST_pair_cdr</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>),</span>
                        <span>stack_index</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And for <code>Compile_call</code>, we actually get to use it. Let’s look back at our stack
storage strategy for compiling <code>(+ 1 2)</code> (now replacing <code>rsp</code> with <code>rbp</code>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move <code>compile(2)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>rax</code> into <code>[rbp-8]</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>compile(1)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Add <code>[rbp-8]</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For binary functions, this can be generalized to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compile <code>arg2</code> (stored in <code>rax</code>)</li>
  <li>Move <code>rax</code> to <code>stack_index</code></li>
  <li>Compile <code>arg1</code> (stored in <code>rax</code>)</li>
  <li>Do something with the results (in <code>[rbp-stack_index]</code> and <code>rax</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The key is this: for the first recursive call to <code>Compile_expr</code>, the compiler
is allowed to emit code that can use the current <code>stack_index</code> and anything
below that on the stack. For the <em>second</em> recursive call to <code>Compile_expr</code>, the
compiler has to bump <code>stack_index</code>, since we’ve stored the result of the first
compiled call at <code>stack_index</code>.</p>

<p>Take a look at our implementation of binary add:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_call</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span>
                 <span>word</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_symbol_matches</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>"+"</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>operand2</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>));</span>
      <span>Emit_store_reg_indirect</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>/*dst=*/</span><span>Ind</span><span>(</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Bazel For Open-Source C/C++ Libraries Distribution]]>

September 15, 2020 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/bazel-for-libraries-distribution-an-open-source-library-author-perspective/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/bazel-for-libraries-distribution-an-open-source-library-author-perspective/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past a few days, I’ve been experimenting with Bazel as a library distribution mechanism for <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a>.</p>

<p>I am pretty familiar with hermetic build systems at this point. My main knowledge comes from Buck dating 8 years back. At that time, it never occurred to me such a build system could eventually be a library distribution mechanism. During the same 8 years, NPM has taken over the world. New language-dependent package managers such as Go module, Cargo and Swift Package Manager popularized the concept of using the public repositories (GitHub) as the dependency references. Languages prior to this period, mainly C / C++ are moving to this direction, slowly.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a> has a simple autoconf based feature detection / configuration system. You would expect the package to work when <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code>. However, it never made any serious attempt to be too smart. My initial experience with monorepos at companies strongly influenced the decision to have a simple build system. I fully expect that serious consumers will vendor the library into their monorepo using their own build systems.</p>

<p>This has been true for the past a few years. But as I am finishing up <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> and increasingly using that for other closed-source personal projects, maintaining a closed-source <em>monorepo</em> setup for my personal projects while upstreaming fixes is quite an unpleasant experience. On the other hand, <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> from the beginning meant to be a low-level implementation. I am expected to have high-level language bindings at some point. Given that I am doing more application-related development with <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> in closed-source format now, it feels like the right time.</p>

<p>Although there is no one-true library distribution mechanism for C / C++, there are contenders. From the good-old apt / rpm, to Conan, which has gained some mind-share in the open-source world in recent years.</p>

<p>The choice of Bazel is not accidental. I’ve been doing <a href="https://liuliu.me/eyes/migrating-ios-project-to-bazel-a-real-world-experience/">some Swift development with Bazel</a> and the experience has been positive. Moreover, the choice of high-level binding language for <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a>, I figured, would be Swift.</p>

<h2 id="configure">Configure</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a>’s build process, as much as I would rather not, is host-dependent. I use autoconf to detect system-wide libraries such as libjpeg and libpng, to configure proper compiler options. Although <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a> can be used with zero dependency, in that configuration, it can sometimes be slow.</p>

<p>Coming from the monorepo background, Bazel doesn’t have many utilities that are as readily available as in autoconf. You can write automatic configurations in Starlark as <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/repository_rules.html">repository rules</a>, but there is no good documentation on how to write robust ones.</p>

<p>I ended up <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/blob/unstable/WORKSPACE#L25">letting whoever use ccv to decide how they are going to enable certain features</a>. For things like CUDA, such configuration is not tenable. I ended up copying over <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/rules_cuda">TensorFlow’s CUDA rules</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>Good old C / C++ libraries are notoriously indifferent to libraries dependencies v.s. toolchains. Autoconf detects both toolchain configurations as well as available libraries. These types of host dependencies make cross-compilation a skill in itself.</p>

<p>Bazel is excellent for in-tree dependencies. For out-tree dependencies however, there is no established mechanism. The popular way is to write a <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/protobuf_deps.bzl#L5">repository rules to load relevant dependencies</a>.</p>

<p>This actually works well for me. It is versatile enough to handle cases that <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/blob/unstable/config/ccv.bzl#L103">have Bazel integrations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/dflat/blob/unstable/deps.bzl#L17">have no Bazel integrations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="consume-bazel-dependencies">Consume Bazel Dependencies</h2>

<p>Consumption of the packaged Bazel dependencies then becomes as simple as adding <code>git_repository</code> to the <code>WORKSPACE</code> and call proper <code>&lt;your_library_name&gt;_deps()</code> repository rule.</p>

<p>After packaging <a href="https://libccv.org/">ccv</a> with Bazel, now <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/WORKSPACE#L3">Swift for nnc can consume the packaged dependency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-versioning-challenges">Semantic Versioning Challenges</h2>

<p>While the Bazel-provided library distribution mechanism works well for my case, it is simplistic. For one, there is really no good way to do <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. It is understandable. Coming from a monorepo culture, it is challenging for anyone to dive into dependency hells of library versioning. A <a href="https://donatstudios.com/Go-v2-Modules">slightly different story happened to Go</a> a while back as well.</p>

<p>It is messy if you want to pin a specific version of the library while your dependencies are not agreeing with you. This is going to be messy regardless in C / C++ world, unless you prelink these extremely carefully. Bazel’s philosophy from what I can see, seems largely on <em>keeping the trunk working</em> side. It is working so far, but one has to wonder whether this can scale if more libraries adopted Bazel as the distribution mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h2>

<p>The past a few months experience with Bazel has been delightful. While I would continue to use language specific tools (pip, Go modules, Cargo, NPM) when doing development in that particular language, Bazel is a capable choice for me when doing cross-language development. Concepts such as <code>workspace</code>, <code>git_repository</code>, <code>http_archive</code> fit well within the larger open-source ecosystem. And most surprisingly, it works for many-repo setup if you ever need to.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

					<p>A friend once said to me: <q>You know, to some people, C is just a bunch of macros that expand to assembly</q>. It’s been years ago (smartasses: it was also before <tt>llvm</tt>, ok?), but the sentence stuck with me. Do <em>Kernighan and Ritchie</em> really look at a C program and see assembly code? Does <em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> surf the Web any differently than you and me? And what on earth <em>did</em> <em>Keanu Reeves</em> see when he looked at all of that funky green gibberish soup, anyway? No, seriously, what the heck <em>did</em> he see there?! Uhm, back to the program. Anyway, what does Python look like in <em>Guido van Rossum</em>‘s<sup>1</sup> eyes?</p>
<p>This post marks the beginning of what should develop to a <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/tag/pythons-innards/">series</a> on Python’s internals, I’m writing it since I believe that explaining something is the best way to grok it, and I’d very much like to be able to visualize more of Python’s ‘funky green gibberish soup’ as I read Python code. On the curriculum is mainly <em>CPython</em>, mainly <em>py3k</em>, mainly <em>bytecode evaluation</em> (I’m not a big compilation fan) – but practically everything around executing Python and Python-like code (<em>Unladen Swallow</em>, <em>Jython</em>, <em>Cython</em>, etc) might turn out to be fair game in this series. For the sake of brevity and my sanity, when I say <em>Python</em>, I mean <em>CPython</em> unless noted otherwise. I also assume a POSIX-like OS or (if and where it matters) Linux, unless otherwise noted. You should read this if you want to know how Python works. You should read this if you want to contribute to CPython. You should read this to find all the mistakes I’ll make and snicker at me behind me back or write snide comments. I realize it’s just <em>your</em> particular way to show affection.</p>
<p>I gather I’ll glean pretty much everything I write about from Python’s source or, occasionally, other fine materials (documentation, especially <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/c-api/index.html">this</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/extending/index.html">that</a>, certain PyCon lectures, <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/05/07/searching-mailing-list-archives-offline/">searching</a> <a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev">python-dev</a>, etc). Everything is out there, but I do hope my efforts at putting it all in one place to which you can RSS-subscribe will make your journey easier. I assume the reader knows some C, some OS theory, a bit less than some assembly (any architecture), a bit more than some Python and has reasonable UNIX fitness (i.e., feels comfortable installing something from source). Don’t be afraid if you’re not reasonably conversant in one (or more) of these, but I can’t promise smooth sailing, either. Also, if you don’t have a working toolchain to do Python development, maybe you’d like to head over <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/04/08/contributing-to-python/">here</a> and do as it says on the second paragraph (and onwards, as relevant).</p>
<p>Let’s start with something which I assume you already know, but I think is important, at least to the main way I understand… well, everything that I do understand. I look at it as if I’m looking at a machine. It’s easy in Python’s case, since Python relies on a Virtual Machine to do what it does (like many other interpreted languages). Be certain you understand “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines">Virtual Machine</a>” correctly in this context: think more like JVM and less like VirtualBox (very technically, they’re the same, but in the real world we usually differentiate these two kinds of VMs). I find it easiest to understand “Virtual Machine” literally – it’s a machine built from software. Your CPU is just a complex electronic machine which receives all input (machine code, data), it has a state (registers), and based on the input and its state it will output stuff (to RAM or a Bus), right? Well, CPython is a machine built from software components that has a state and processes instructions (different implementations may use rather different instructions). This software machine operates in the process hosting the Python interpreter. Keep this in mind; I like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">machine</a> metaphor (as I explain in minute details <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/07/04/pythons-innards-for-my-wife/">here</a>).</p>
<p>That said, let’s start with a bird’s eye overview of what happens when you do this: <kbd>$ python -c 'print("Hello, world!")'</kbd>. Python’s binary is executed, the standard C library initialization which pretty much any process does happens and then the main function starts executing (see its source, <kbd>./Modules/python.c: main</kbd>, which soon calls <kbd>./Modules/main.c: Py_Main</kbd>). After some mundane initialization stuff (parse arguments, see if environment variables should affect behaviour, assess the situation of the standard streams and act accordingly, etc), <a href="http://docs.python.org/c-api/init.html#Py_Initialize">./Python/pythonrun.c: Py_Initialize</a> is called. In many ways, this function is what ‘builds’ and assembles together the pieces needed to run the CPython machine and makes ‘a process’ into ‘a process with a Python interpreter in it’. Among other things, it creates two very important Python data-structures: the <strong>interpreter state</strong> and <strong>thread state</strong>. It also creates the built-in <strong>module</strong> <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html">sys</a> and the module which hosts all <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#built-in-functions">builtins</a>. At a later post(s) we will cover all these in depth.</p>
<p>With these in place, Python will do one of several things based on how it was executed. Roughly, it will either execute a string (the <kbd>-c</kbd> option), execute a module as an executable (the <kbd>-m</kbd> option), or execute a file (passed explicitly on the commandline or passed by the kernel when used as an interpreter for a script) or run its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop">REPL</a> loop (this is more a special case of the file to execute being an interactive device). In the case we’re currently following, it will execute a single string, since we invoked it with <kbd>-c</kbd>. To execute this single string, <kbd>./Python/pythonrun.c: PyRun_SimpleStringFlags</kbd> is called. This function creates the <kbd>__main__</kbd> <strong>namespace</strong>, which is ‘where’ our string will be executed (if you run <kbd>$ python -c 'a=1; print(a)'</kbd>, where is <kbd>a</kbd> stored? in this namespace). After the namespace is created, the string is executed in it (or rather, interpreted or <em>evaluated</em> in it). To do that, you must first transform the string into something that machine can work on.</p>
<p>As I said, I’d rather not focus on the innards of Python’s parser/compiler at this time. I’m not a compilation expert, I’m not entirely interested in it, and as far as I know, Python doesn’t have significant Compiler-Fu beyond the basic CS compilation course. We’ll do a (very) fast overview of what goes on here, and may return to it later only to inspect visible CPython behaviour (see the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement">global</a> statement, which is said to affect parsing, for instance). So, the parser/compiler stage of <kbd>PyRun_SimpleStringFlags</kbd> goes largely like this: tokenize and create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_syntax_tree">Concrete Syntax Tree</a> (CST) from the code, transorm the CST into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> (AST) and finally compile the AST into a <strong>code object</strong> using <kbd>./Python/ast.c: PyAST_FromNode</kbd>. For now, think of the code object as a binary string of machine code that Python VM’s ‘machinary’ can operate on – so now we’re ready to do interpretation (again, <em>evaluation</em> in Python’s parlance).</p>
<p>We have an (almost) empty <kbd>__main__</kbd>, we have a code object, we want to evaluate it. Now what? Now this line: <kbd>Python/pythonrun.c: run_mod, v = PyEval_EvalCode(co, globals, locals);</kbd> does the trick. It receives a code object and a namespace for <strong>globals</strong> and for <strong>locals</strong> (in this case, both of them will be the newly created <kbd>__main__</kbd> namespace), creates a <strong>frame object</strong> from these and executes it. You remember previously that I mentioned that <kbd>Py_Initialize</kbd> creates a thread state, and that we’ll talk about it later? Well, back to that for a bit: each Python thread is represented by its own thread state, which (among other things) points to the stack of currently executing frames. After the frame object is created and placed at the top of the thread state stack, it (or rather, the byte code pointed by it) is evaluated, opcode by opcode, by means of the (rather lengthy) <kbd>./Python/ceval.c: PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd>.</p>
<p><kbd>PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd> takes the frame, extracts opcode (and operands, if any, we’ll get to that) after opcode, and executes a short piece of C code matching the opcode. Let’s take a closer look at what these “opcodes” look like by disassembling a bit of compiled Python code:</p>
<pre title="">&gt;&gt;&gt; from dis import dis # ooh! a handy disassembly function!
&gt;&gt;&gt; co = compile("spam = eggs - 1", "&lt;string&gt;", "exec")
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis(co)
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (eggs)
              3 LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
              6 BINARY_SUBTRACT     
              7 STORE_NAME               1 (spam)
             10 LOAD_CONST               1 (None)
             13 RETURN_VALUE        
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
<p>…even without knowing much about Python’s bytecode, this is reasonably readable. You “load” the name <kbd>eggs</kbd> (where do you load it from? where do you load it to? soon), and also load a constant value (<kbd>1</kbd>), then you do a “binary subtract” (what do you mean ‘binary’ in this context? between which operands?), and so on and so forth. As you might have guessed, the names are “loaded” from the <kbd>globals</kbd> and <kbd>locals</kbd> namespaces we’ve seen earlier, and they’re loaded onto an operand stack (not to be confused with the stack of running frames), which is exactly where the binary subtract will pop them from, subtract one from the other, and put the result back on that stack. “Binary subtract” just means this is a subtraction opcode that has two operands (hence it is “binary”, this is not to say the operands are binary numbers made of ‘0’s and ‘1’s).</p>
<p>You can go look at <kbd>PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd> at <kbd>./Python/ceval.c</kbd> yourself, it’s not a small function by any means. For practical reasons I can’t paste too much code from there in here, but I will just paste the code that runs when a <kbd>BINARY_SUBTRACT</kbd> opcode is found, I think it really illustrates things:</p>
<pre title="">        TARGET(BINARY_SUBTRACT)
            w = POP();
            v = TOP();
            x = PyNumber_Subtract(v, w);
            Py_DECREF(v);
            Py_DECREF(w);
            SET_TOP(x);
            if (x != NULL) DISPATCH();
            break;
</pre>
<p>…pop something, take the top (of the operand stack), call a C function called PyNumber_Subtract() on these things, do something we still don’t understand (but will in due time) called “Py_DECREF” on both, set the top of the stack to the result of the subtraction (overwriting the previous top) and then do something else we don’t understand if x is not null, which is to do a …</p></div></div>

<h4>
By Khaled Abou Alfa • Published 29th of July, <span>2020
</span></h4>
<p>
In 1927, Oleg Losev, a Russian inventor and scientist would introduce the world to the light-emitting diode. This technology would remain dormant for decades. Progress was made in 1962 with the introduction of the first red <span>LED</span>. For the next 30 years, an industry would hunt for the elusive colour blue. Over time the risk of pouring resource and treasure into this pursuit increased - you were chasing the pot of gold at the end of a blue coloured rainbow.
</p>
<p>
These pursuits would continue with little success until the early 90s. Then the work of Shuji Nakamura, Isamu Akosaki and Hiroshi Amano unlocked the secrets of the blue <span>LED</span>. So significant was this discovery that in 2004, the trio would receive the Nobel price in Physics.
</p>
<p>
This work would be employed in diverse contexts, from the multitude of screens we depend upon to data communications. For the built environment, this discovery would transform artificial lighting across the world. The incandescent (and to a lesser extent the fluorescent) lamp illuminated the 20th century. Light for the 21st century would be ushered in by the <span>LED</span> lamp.
</p>
<h2 id="obsolete-lighting-law">Obsolete Lighting Law</h2>
<p>In 1999, <a href="http://www.haitzs-law.com/uploads/7/6/3/6/76362633/1999-_national_research_report__same_as_2000_sarndia_nrp_.pdf">Roland Haitz co-authored</a> a research report, on the future of <span>LED</span> lighting (which was renamed as solid state lighting). The paper included data collected over decades that plotted both the cost of lumens and the red light output per <span>LED</span> package since the 1970s. 20 years ago Haitz empirically predicted the world we are living in today and captured in a<span></span> <span>‘</span>law’ which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every decade, for a given wavelength of light, the cost per lumen falls by a factor of 10 and the amount of light generated per <span>LED</span> package increases by a factor of 20.<br>
— Haitz’s Law</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A new report, which addressed the shortcomings and reviewed the impact of the earlier report, was published <a href="http://www.haitzs-law.com/uploads/7/6/3/6/76362633/2011-physica_-_haitz_r_2011_pssa.pdf">a decade later in 2010</a>. This paper predicted that within the decade (by 2020), we would have reached a point of diminishing returns. It acknowledged that Solid State Lighting (<span>SSL</span>) is limited in two areas. The conversion efficacy - converting electrical energy to luminous flux cannot exceed 100%. The actual need for increased flux range - just because you can produce it, doesn’t mean the market needs it. The paper provided indications of where the future after 2020 is likely to evolve:
</p>
<p><em><span>‘</span>These include digital tuning of both the chromaticity and the temporal/spatial placement of light within the environment that is being lit.’</em></p>
<p><span>
27</span> years after the initial spark of the blue <span>LED</span> revolution, we are now entering a period of equilibrium of both the efficacy and flux of solid state lighting. The advances in lighting have now begun to shift into new territory, one of circadian rhythms, diurnal patterns and refined controllability.
</p>
<h2 id="controllability">Controllability</h2>
<p>Inline with the predictions from 10 years ago, the lighting industry has begun to focus its attention on how <span>SSL</span> can be controlled and manipulated. The technology available today would be considered both technically impossible and prohibitively expensive, compared with technology from only 15 years ago.</p>
<p>
The terms<span></span> <span>‘</span>circadian lighting’ or<span></span> <span>‘</span>human centric lighting’ have begun entering the lexicon as a means to enhance the wellbeing of everyone interacting with the built world. With the advent of <span>SSL</span> technology we are now able to control parameters such as colour spectrum, intensity and directionality. These systems offer control based on the exact location, the relationship to the outside world and what is happening outside in real time.
</p>
<p>
The main debate for the use of this type of lighting control is whether it actually works. Does it suppress the levels of Melatonin in the body? Does it make people more alert and therefore more responsive throughout the day? These are some of the questions that the industry will need to address for the technology to become more widespread.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In the last two decades, the lighting industry has experienced a revolution. This has led to an expanded scope of what is achievable with light in a manner unimaginable back in 1927. Incredibly these benefits have come at a greatly reduced level of energy consumption (typically 1/5th of previous technologies). The work is far from done, as incandecent lamp sources (amongst others) remain in wide use throughout the world (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/246030/estimated-led-penetration-of-the-global-lighting-market/">global penetration of LEDs hovers around 61%</a>). We must wean ourselves both for our own wellbeing and that of the planet.</strong>

<p>We now know what form factor Dyson had chosen for their <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/exclusive-inside-story-dyson-ev">now shelved electric vehicle</a>. Micromobility this is <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>
The Dyson’s interview demonstrates the tone deaf nature associated with cars. You may need a car for some activities, but for most of your mobility needs, you likely can get away with other methods. How different our cities would be if we could understand and embrace that reality together.
</p>
<p>
In adjacent news the guys over at Micromobility.io have been documenting our transition for a while. Just released is <a href="https://micromobility.io/landscape">version 2.0 of their Landscape document</a>. The document demonstrates the breadth that is on offer in this field.

<p>The 2020 Tokyo Olympics may have been postponed but that doesn’t mean we don’t get to marvel at some stunning timber architecture. As covered in <a href="https://www.stet.build/ia/007">issue 007</a>, the Japanese know a thing or two about building in timber. The completion of the <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/nikken-sekkei-timber-gymnastics-center-tokyo-olympic-games-07-23-2020/">Ariake gymnastics center</a> is a wonderful extension of that history.</p>

<h2 id="spoke-pens">Spoke Pens</h2>
<p><img src="https://blot.im/cdn/blog_78585a67eddd4bfcb7936222fddae5c7/_image_cache/59e3faa3-40df-46fe-98d7-bbf3cdd7d852.jpg" alt="Spoke Pens" width="680" height="680"></p>
<p>Over the past 5–10 years there has been an incredible industry of machined pens produced and sold on Kickstarter. I have found that the ergonomic design and available refill options to be under-represented. Rather than focusing on the utility of the pen itself, many focus on both the materials and aesthetic design instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told,<span></span> <span>“</span>Make it look good!” That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.<br>
— Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this regard, the <a href="https://spokedesign.com/">Spoke pens and pencils</a> are different. The inside was considered first - even though the outside has a strong design language. The pen is primarily a wrap around the pen refill or pencil mechanism. The pens accept the standard Muji Gel ink refills or the Uni Signo <span>DX</span> refills (both come in a range of colours and go down to the 0.38mm range). While the pencil is based on the Pentel <span>P20</span># mechanical pencil mechanism. Both are highly recommended.

		<td>We woke up early today, as we had little time to prepare before leaving Japan. Why so last minute? Because we only decided to leave yesterday morning. The reason we decided so late, was because we were waiting for a SIM card for our Iridium GO satellite phone, and we received it yesterday morning. As soon as we got it, we grabbed our passports and boat papers and hurried to the Immigration Office in Shizuoka to check out (a 4-5 hour train ride away). We were eager to leave on the 9th, as there was a good weather window, with moderate winds coming from a favourable direction. Because we weren't planning to leave until late yesterday morning, there were many tasks we had no yet done, or had not had time to do.<p>We're usually more organized than this, with only a few menial tasks to do, but not this time. Last minute departures is not our style, but we also wanted to take this window. We had to find a post box to send the pocket wifi we rented and to fill our water tanks — this may not seem like much, but it was, as it piled up on top of other things we'd forgotten, like finding and installing the pot holders to the stovetop, installing the jack lines, taking out the tethers, putting key items back in the ditch bag plus a number of other last minute things that had escaped us at the time.</p></td>

We use this opportunity to chat, meanwhile butterflies gather in my gut. I am nervous. I always am before a big trip and this time is no different, although this is our biggest passage yet, and will also likely be the most challenging. My gut has every right to twist itself into knots. We ask Shuhei to drop off our pocket wifi in a post box, he agrees ­— ah, what a kind person. He came by this with his truck to help Robusta with some last minute tasks, like getting produce, gas etc. We had done most of that ahead of time.</td>

		<td>We push off our spot and head over to the Shimoda Boat Services pontoon to fill our water tanks. We tied up to it and began to ferry bins back and forth to empty them in our tank. We filled as many recipients as we could carry, as we don't know how long the trip will take. Once the tanks and jerry cans were full, we left the pontoon and headed outside of the breakwater. The Shimoda coastguard ship was lifting anchor at the time, it went past us, disappearing quickly as it was going much faster. Outside of the breakwater, we saw the lighthouse on our starboard side, the one we had difficulty rounding when we arrived here a week and a half ago due to 30-knot winds off our bow. Today, the seas were tame and the skies clear and blue. <p>We saw the Kurofune, a replica of Commodore Perry's black ship, taking tourists about the harbor. It was the first time we'd seen it on the water, as there weren't many tourists before due to concerns with the coronavirus. Now that the state of emergency's been lifted, people started traveling more around the country.</p></td>

The kuroshio, or <i>black current</i>, is very strong in this area, and even stronger between the islands as the water is forced through a narrow opening. We had no problem with ships, even with many heading to Tokyo. Our speed made it easy to work our way out of the main shipping channel. We are flying!

<p>Besides manually compiling <a href="https://archive.xfce.org/xfce/4.16pre1/src/">tarballs</a>, it’s also possible to use <a href="https://github.com/schuellerf/xfce-test">xfce-test</a> (<code>ubuntu_20.04-xfce-4.16pre1</code> tag) to easily preview Xfce 4.16 without the risk of breaking your system.</p>

<p>Update: Arch Linux users more adventurous than usual can try <code>-devel</code> packages from AUR. Likewise, openSUSE users can install <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Xfce_repositories">packages</a> built directly from git master. If you’re afraid to trash your system consider playing with a virtual machine first.</p>

<p>Please go ahead try this release if possible, we would be more happy to hear your impressions as well as get bug reports before the final release.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>

<p>We’re expecting to release Xfce 4.16pre2 at the end of this month and if necessary pre3 will be released in October. If everything goes as planned Xfce 4.16 should be released by November!</p>

<![CDATA[Go’s Major Versioning Sucks – From a Fanboy]]>
            </title>

September 15, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/09/15/gos-major-version-handling-sucks-from-a-fanboy/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/09/15/gos-major-version-handling-sucks-from-a-fanboy/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>I’m normally a fan of the rigidity within the Go toolchain. In fact, we use Go on the <a href="https://app.qvault.io/dashboard/courses">front and backend at Qvault</a>. It’s wonderful to have standardized formatting, vetting, and testing across the entire language. The first real criticism I’ve had is with the way Go modules handle major versions. It’s over-the-top opinionated and slows down development in a significant number of scenarios.</p>



<h2>Refresher on “Go Mod”</h2>



<p>Go modules, and the associated commands <code>go mod</code> and <code>go get</code> can be thought of as Go’s equivalents to NPM and Yarn. The Go toolchain provides a way to manage dependencies and lock the versions that a collection of code depends on.</p>



<p>One of the most common operations is to update a dependency in an existing module. For example:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash"># update all dependencies
go get -u ./...

# add missing and remove unused dependencies
go mod tidy

# save all dependency code in the project's "vendor" folder
go mod vendor</code></pre>



<h2>Semantic Versioning</h2>



<p>Go modules use git tags and semantic versioning to keep track of the versions of dependencies that are compatible with the module in question. Semantic versioning is a way to format version numbers and it looks like this: <code>v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}</code>. For example, <code>v1.2.3</code>.</p>



<p>Each number is to be incremented according to the following standards:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</code></pre>



<h2>Package-Side Problems</h2>



<p>Go has decided that all versions beyond <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> are required to use the major version in the module path. There are two ways to accomplish this. </p>



<p><strong>The first and recommended way</strong> is laid out in an example on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.golang.org/v2-go-modules#TOC_4." target="_blank">Go Blog</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>To start development on&nbsp;<code>v2</code>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<code>github.com/googleapis/gax-go</code>, we’ll create a new&nbsp;<code>v2/</code>&nbsp;directory and copy our package into it.</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words, for every major version, we are encouraged to maintain a new copy of the entire codebase. This is also the only way to do it if you want pre-modules users to be able to use your package.</p>



<p><strong>The second way</strong> is to just change the name of your module in <code>go.mod</code>. Fore example, <code>module github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-tinydate</code> would become <code>module github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-tinydate/v2</code>. Besides this not working for older versions of Go, I also find it problematic because it breaks (in my mind) one of the most useful things about module names – they reflect the file path.</p>



<h2>Package-Side Solutions</h2>



<p>Allow package maintainers to specify the major version simply by updating git tags, no module name changes required. There is no need for two sources of truth.</p>



<p>We can enforce safe updating by adding warnings or prompts to the <code>go get</code> CLI. We don’t have to add unnecessary time-consuming policies.</p>



<h2>Client-Side Problems</h2>



<p>When new versions of dependencies are released we have a simple command to get the newest stuff: <code>go get -u</code>. The problem is that this command has no way to automatically update to a new major version. It will only download new minor changes and patches. There isn’t even a console message to inform you that a new major version exists!</p>



<p>That said, the reason for not auto-updating is clear, and to be fair, well-founded:</p>



<blockquote><p>If an old package and a new package have the same import path, the new package must be backwards compatible with the old package.</p><cite><a href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import" rel="noopener">Import compatibility rule</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In other words, we should only increment major versions when making breaking changes, and if breaking changes are made they can’t have the same import path. While this makes sense, I think a simple console warning would have been a better solution than forcing a cumbersome updating strategy on the community.</p>



<p><strong>Another problem </strong>on the client-side is that we don’t only need to update <code>go.mod</code>, but we actually need to <code>grep</code> through our codebase and change each import statement to point to the new major version:</p>



<blockquote><p>Users who wanted to use&nbsp;<code>v2</code>&nbsp;had to change their package imports and module requirements to&nbsp;<code>github.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2</code>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Instead of a few simple CLI commands to get the latest dependencies, we’re making changes to the code itself.</p>



<h3>A Caveat – Diamond Imports</h3>



<p>Using different paths for different major versions makes more sense in situations where we may require two different versions of the same package, you know, <a aria-label="diamond imports (opens in a new tab)" href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import#dependency_story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">diamond imports</a> and all that. This is the exception, not the rule, and it seems strange to tap dance around a problem that doesn’t exist in most codebases.</p>



<h2>Client-Side Solution</h2>



<p><code>go get -u</code> should have an additional command line flag to update major versions, and should default to showing a warning that there is a newer major version you don’t have yet.</p>



<p><em>Default</em> import paths should not change between major versions. If a module requires various versions, those <em>extra</em> versions could be flagged by having a different path.</p>



<h2>Why This Sucks For Me</h2>



<p>It is often the case that I want to build a package that has domain-specific logic and will only be used only in services at the small company I work for. For example, we have a repo that holds the <code>struct{}</code> definitions for common entities used across our system.</p>



<p>Occasionally we need to make backward-incompatible changes to those struct definitions. If it were an open-source library we wouldn’t make changes so often, but because it’s internal and we are aware of all the dependencies, we change the names of exported fields <em>regularly</em>. We aren’t changing names because we chose bad ones to begin with, we are usually changing names because requirements from the business change rapidly in a startup. </p>



<p>This means major version changes are a fairly regular occurrence. Some say that we should just stay on <code>v0</code>, and that’s a reasonable solution. The problem is these ARE production packages that are being used by a wide number of services. We WANT to Semver.</p>



<p>Go makes updating major versions so cumbersome that in the majority of cases, we have opted to just increment minor versions when we should increment major versions. We want to follow the proper versioning scheme, we just don’t want to add the unnecessary steps to our dev process.</p>



<h2>Hey – I Get It</h2>



<p>I understand why these decisions were made – and I even think in a lot of cases they were great decisions. For any open-source or public facing module this makes great sense. The Go toolchain is enforcing strict rules that encourage good API design.</p>



<p>In their effort to make public APIs great, they made it unnecessarily hard to have good “local” package design.</p>



<p>There is an <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40323" rel="noopener">open issue on Github</a> that would make new major versions more discoverable from the CLI. Take a look at that if you are interested.</p>



<p>Go still has the best toolchain and ecosystem. NPM and PIP can suck it.</p>



<p>If you disagree, @ me on Twitter.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div><article> <p>Performance tuning is one of those programming rituals that gets oddly addicting. Seems like humans have a fundamental impulse to make a graph plot in their desired direction. This can be seen in a wide assortment of fields. Day traders watch metrics focused on their net earnings, nutritionists keep their calorie counts logged, and programmers focusing on performance obsess over memory allocations.</p> <p>After spending sometime obessing myself I found myself making large allocation improvements with some tricks in the popular <a href="https://github.com/jackc/pgx">PGX</a> library.</p> <p>I'd like to shout out <em>Kale Blanekship</em> and <em>Eric Chlebek</em> from the performance channel in #gophers slack. They provided the clues used in this post.</p> <h2>The code</h2> <p>The code that's being profiled is a new distributed lock implementation for <a href="https://github.com/quay/claircore/">ClairCore</a>. Postgres is the only required infrastructure for ClairCore by design. While it's not the best mechanim for a distributed lock, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/explicit-locking.html">postgres advisory locks</a> can be utilized to get <em>mostly</em> there.</p> <p>You can view the distlock implementation <a href="https://github.com/ldelossa/distlock">here</a></p> <h2>Reducing channel allocations</h2> <p>Our distlock implementation utilizes the request/response channel-of-channel pattern. A request object with a response channel is pushed onto a request channel. When the receiver gets the request it writes to the response channel, unblocking any client listening.</p> <p>This pattern is useful but will also alloc a lot of channels resulting in bloating the heap.</p> <p>To demonstrate this a benchmark will be taken that profiles lock acquisition and lock return.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> go <span>test</span> -benchtime <span>"1m"</span>  -run xxx -bench . -memprofile memprofile.out -cpuprofile cpuprofile.out</span>
</code></pre> <p>The command above runs a 1 minute benchmark profiling both memory and cpu.</p> <p>Next lets start an interactive pprof session over the memory profile and drill into the function where the channel allocations are occuring.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> go tool pprof distlock.test memprofile.out</span>

</code></pre> <h2>A PGX Trick</h2> <p>Removing the cost of the response-request model was a good win but there is still more to tune.</p> <p>Lets generate a graph of our call stack and associated allocations.</p> <pre><code>❯ go tool pprof -svg distlock.test memprofile.out
</code></pre> <p><img alt="photo of high PGX allocations" src="https://www.ldelossa.is/profile001.png"></p> <p>The above diagram is showing a large amount of allocations in PGX's getRows method. Its not rare for methods dealing with serialization to and from the database to allocate heavily. But it would be nice if we could eliminate this.</p> <p>Getting a session pg advisory lock typically looks like this.</p> <pre><code>SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock($1);
SELECT pg_advisory_unlock($1);
</code></pre> <p>Both lock functions return a table expression resulting in a true or a false.</p> <p>An optimization we can make is changing these queries to only return a row if the lock function returns true. Our application logic can then simply check whether any rows are returned and not read the contents.</p> <p>First lets fix our queries.</p> <pre><code>SELECT lock FROM pg_try_advisory_lock($1) lock WHERE lock = true;
SELECT lock FROM pg_advisory_unlock($1) lock WHERE lock = true;
</code></pre> <p>A slight modification allows us to only return rows if the lock function returns true.</p> <p>The next step is to short circuit the PGX library from reading the rows. This took a bit of library spelunking but I eventually discovered this...</p> <pre><code>rr := m.conn.PgConn().ExecParams(ctx,
    trySessionUnlock,
    [][]<span>byte</span>{
        keyify(key),
    },
    <span>nil</span>,
    []<span>int16</span>{<span>1</span>},
    <span>nil</span>)
tag, err := rr.Close()
<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
    <span>return</span> response{<span>false</span>, <span>nil</span>, err}
}
<span>if</span> tag.RowsAffected() == <span>0</span> {
    <span>return</span> response{<span>false</span>, <span>nil</span>, fmt.Errorf(<span>"unlock of key %s returned false"</span>, key)}
}
</code></pre> <p>By using the lower level PgConn object we can exec our queries, get a response writer, and immediately close it to obtain the command tag. The command tag tells us if any rows were affected by the exec. This effectively tells us whether the lock was obtained or not in a somewhat indirect way.</p> <p>Let's take a new 1 minute memory profile to see how this effects our heap.</p> <p><img alt="photo of high PGX allocations" src="https://www.ldelossa.is/profile002.png"></p> <p>Notice the large improvement achieved.</p> <p>We can also compare the benchmark output.</p> <pre><code>85149            890605 ns/op            1288 B/op         21 allocs/op
</code></pre> <p>Where PGX was reading the rows.</p> <pre><code>58051           1238353 ns/op             517 B/op         11 allocs/op
</code></pre> <p>By eliminating the reading of rows we perform many more cycles and cut our allocation in roughly half.</p> <h2>Disclaimer on optimization</h2> <p>Is it worth to dig this deep into your allocations? Depends. If you know the code you are writing will be in the "hot-path" its empowering to know what your allocation profile looks like. Learning the skills to performance tune is addicting and powerful but writing code that can be read and easily maintained should always be the first goal. That being said I do think every engineer should go down the rabbit hole at least once. Its a lot of fun.</p> </article></div></div></div>]]>

<p>So you know when you’re flopping about at home, minding your own business, drinking from your water bottle in a way that does not possess <em>any</em> intent to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia?</p>

<p>It’s a feeling I know all too well, and in which I was vigorously partaking when I got this message in “the group chat”<sup id="fnref:groupchat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:groupchat">1</a></sup>.</p>

<em>A nice message from my friend, with a photo of a boarding pass 🙂 A good thing about messages from your friends is that they do not have any rippling consequences 🙂🙂🙂</em></p>

<p>The man in question is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott">Tony Abbott</a>, one of Australia’s <em>many</em> former Prime Ministers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/tony_abbott_wikipedia.png" alt="if u google tony abbott u get this|small">
<em>That’s him, officer</em></p>

<p>For security reasons, we try to change our Prime Minister every six months, and to never use the same Prime Minister on multiple websites.<sup id="fnref:kevin07" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kevin07">2</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="the-boarding-pass-photo">The boarding pass photo</h4>
<p>This particular former PM had just posted a picture of his boarding pass on Instagram (Instagram, in case you don’t know it, is an app you can open up on your phone any time to look at ads).</p>

<p>My friend<sup id="fnref:hoggemoade" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hoggemoade">3</a></sup> (who we will refer to by their group chat name, 𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊) is asking<sup id="fnref:onbehalf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:onbehalf">4</a></sup> whether I can “hack this man” not because I am the kind of person who regularly commits 𝒄𝒚𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒐𝒏 on a whim, but because we’d recently been talking about boarding passes.</p>

<p>I’d said that people post pictures of their boarding passes all the time, not knowing that it can sometimes be used to get their passport number and stuff. They just post it being like “omg going on holidayyyy 😍😍😍”, unaware that they’re posting cringe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some hacker is rubbing their hands together, being all “yumyum identity fraud 👀” in their dark web Discord, because this happens a <em>lot</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpassposts.png" alt="screenshot of #boardingpass on instagram"></p>

<hr>

<p>So there I was, making intense and meaningful eye contact with this chat bubble, asking me if I could “hack this man”.</p>

<h3 id="surely-you-wouldnt">Surely you wouldn’t</h3>
<p>Of course, my friend wasn’t <em>actually</em> asking me to hack the former Prime Minister.</p>



<p>However.</p>



<p>You <em>gotta</em>.</p>

<p>I mean… what are you gonna do, <em>not</em> click it? Are you gonna let a <em>link</em> that’s like 50% advertising tracking ID tell you what to do? Wouldn’t you be <em>curious</em>?</p>

<p>The former Prime Minister had just posted his boarding pass. Was that <em>bad</em>? Was someone in danger? I didn’t know.</p>

<p>What I did know was: the <em>least</em> I could do<sup id="fnref:nocrime" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nocrime">5</a></sup> for my country would be to have a casual browse 👀</p>

<h2 id="investigating-the-boarding-pass-photo">Investigating the boarding pass photo</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-hubris">Step 1: Hubris</h3>

<p>So I had a bit of a casual browse, and got the picture of the boarding pass, and then…. I didn’t know what was supposed to happen after that.</p>

<p>Well, I’d heard that it’s bad to post your boarding pass online, because if you do, a bored 17 year-old Russian boy called “Katie-senpai” might somehow use it to commit identity fraud. But I don’t know anyone like that, so I just clumsily googled some stuff.</p>

<h4 id="googling-how-2-hakc-boarding-pass">Googling how 2 hakc boarding pass</h4>
<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/uhhboardingpasshacking.png" alt="uhhh|small"></p>

<p>Eventually I found <a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hackers-use-hidden-data-airline-boarding-passes-hack-flights-0180728/">a blog post</a> explaining that yes, pictures of boarding passes can indeed be used for Crimes. The part you wanna be looking at for all your criming needs is the barcode, because it’s got the “Booking Reference” (e.g. <code>H8JA2A</code>) in it.</p>

<p>Why do you want the booking reference? It’s one of the two things you need to log in to the airline website to manage your flight.</p>

<p>The second one is your… last name. I was really hoping the second one would be like a password or something. But, no, it’s the booking reference the airline emails you and prints on your boarding pass. And it also lets you log in to the airline website?</p>

<p>That sounds suspiciously like a password to me, but like I’m still fine to pretend it’s not if you are.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-scan-the-barcode">Step 2: Scan the barcode</h3>
<p>I’ve been practicing every morning at sunrise, but still can’t scan barcodes with my eyes. I had to settle for a barcode scanner app on my phone, but when I tried to scan the picture in the Instagram post, it didn’t work :((</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpass.png" alt="the boarding pass photo">
<em>Maybe I shouldn’t have blurred out the barcode first</em></p>

<h3 id="step-2-scan-the-barcode-but-more">Step 2: Scan the barcode, but more</h3>

<p>Well, maybe it wasn’t scanning because the picture was too blurry.</p>

<p>I spent around 15 minutes in an “enhance, ENHANCE” montage, fiddling around with the image, increasing the contrast, and so on. Despite the montage taking up way too much of the 22 minute episode, I couldn’t even get the barcode to scan<sup id="fnref:step3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:step3">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-notice-that-the-booking-reference-is-printed-right-there-on-the-paper">Step 2: Notice that the Booking Reference is printed right there on the paper</h3>

<p>After staring at this image for 15 minutes, I noticed the Booking Reference is just… printed on the baggage receipt.</p>

<p>I graduated university.</p>

<p>But it did not prepare me for this.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/bookinglogin2.png" alt="Manage booking login screen with empty fields-large"></p>

<p>After recovering from <em>that</em> emotional rollercoaster, I went to <a href="https://qantas.com.au/">qantas.com.au</a>, and clicked “Manage Booking”. In case you don’t know it because you live in a country with fast internet, Qantas is the main airline here in Australia.</p>

<p>(I also very conveniently started recording my screen, which is gonna pay off <em>big time</em> in just a moment.)</p>

<h3 id="step-4-type-in-the-booking-reference">Step 4: Type in the Booking Reference</h3>

<p>Well, the login form was just… <em>there</em>, and it was asking for a Booking Reference and a last name. I had just flawlessly read the Booking Reference from the boarding pass picture, and, well… I knew the last name<sup id="fnref:lastname" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lastname">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I did hesitate for a split-second, but… no, I had to know.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-get-a-yikes-in-the-chat">Can I get a YIKES in the chat</h3>

<p>Leave a comment if you really felt that.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/yikes.png" alt="yikes"></p>

<p>I guess I was now logged the heck in as Tony Abbott? And for all I know, everyone else who saw his Instagram post was right there with me. It’s kinda wholesome, to imagine us all there together. But also probably suboptimal in a governmental sense.</p>

<h5 id="was-there-anything-secret-in-here">Was there anything secret in here?</h5>

<p>I then just incredibly browsed the page, browsed it so hard.</p>

<p>I saw Tony Abbott’s name<sup id="fnref:name" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:name">8</a></sup>, flight times, and Frequent Flyer number, but not really anything <em>super</em> secret-looking. Not gonna be committing any cyber treason with a Frequent Flyer number. The flight was in the past, so I couldn’t change anything, either.</p>

<p>The page said the flight had been booked by a travel agent, so I guessed some information would be missing because of that.</p>

<p>I clicked around and scrolled a considerable length, but still didn’t find any government secrets.</p>

<p>Some people might give up here. But I, the Icarus of computers, was simply too dumb to know when to stop.</p>

<h3 id="were-not-done-just-because-a-web-page-says-were-done">We’re not done just because a <em>web page</em> says we’re done</h3>

<p>I wanted to see if there were juicy things hidden <em>inside</em> the page. To do it, I had to use the <em>only</em> hacker tool I know.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/inspectelement.png" alt="Right click > Inspect-small">
<em>Right click &gt; Inspect Element, all you need to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia</em></p>

<p>Listen. This is the only part of the story that might be confused for highly elite computer skill. It’s not, though. Maybe later someone will show you this same thing to try and flex, acting like only <em>they</em> know how to do it. You will not go gently into that good night. You will refuse to acknowledge their flex, killing them instantly.</p>

<h5 id="how-does-inspect-element-work">How does “Inspect Element” work?</h5>
<p>“Inspect Element”, as it’s called, is a feature of Google Chrome that lets you see the computer’s internal representation (HTML) of the page you’re looking at. Kinda like opening up a clock and looking at the cool cog party inside.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Pocketwatch_cutaway_drawing.jpg" alt="cog party|small">
<em>Yeahhh go little cogs, look at ‘em absolutely going off. Now imagine this but with like, JavaScript</em></p>

<p>Everything you see when you use “Inspect Element” was already downloaded to your computer, you just hadn’t asked Chrome to show it to you yet. Just like how the cogs were already in the watch, you just hadn’t opened it up to look.</p>

<p>But let us dispense with frivolous cog talk. Cheap tricks such as “Inspect Element” are used by programmers to try and understand how the website works. This is ultimately futile: Nobody can understand how websites work. Unfortunately, it kinda <em>looks</em> like hacking the first time you see it.</p>

<p>If you’d like to know more about it, I’ve prepared a short video.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hey youtube welcome to my hacking tutorial, today we're gonna hack.... the nsa <a href="https://t.co/2Z35GJjSZE">pic.twitter.com/2Z35GJjSZE</a></p>— “Alex” (@mangopdf) <a href="https://twitter.com/mangopdf/status/1123400764926226432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2019</a></blockquote>


<h3 id="browsing-the-manage-booking-pages-html">Browsing the “Manage Booking” page’s HTML</h3>

<p>I scrolled around the page’s HTML, not really knowing what it meant, furiously trying to find anything that looked out of place or secret.</p>

<p>I eventually realised that manually reading HTML with my eyes was not an efficient way of defending my country, and Ctrl + F’d the HTML for “passport”.</p>

<h3 id="oh-no">oh no</h3>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/passportjson.gif" alt="Blurred screenshot of close up &quot;passport&quot; number"></p>

<h3 id="oh-yes">Oh yes</h3>

<p>It’s just <em>there</em>.</p>

<p>At this point I was fairly sure I was looking at the <em>extremely</em> secret government-issued ID of the <em>28th Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, servant to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</em> and I was <em>kinda</em> worried that I was somehow doing something wrong, but like, not enough to stop.</p>

<h3 id="anything-else-in-this-page">….anything <em>else</em> in this page?</h3>

<p>Well damn, if Tony Abbott’s passport number is in this treasure trove of computer spaghetti, maybe there’s wayyyyy more. Perhaps this HTML contains the lost launch codes to the Sydney Opera House, or Harold Holt<sup id="fnref:holt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:holt">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Maybe there’s a phone number?</p>

<p>Searching for <code>phone</code> and <code>number</code> didn’t get anywhere, so I searched for <code>614</code>, the first 3 digits of an Australian phone number, using my colossal and highly celestial galaxy brain.</p>

<h5 id="weird-uppercase-letters">Weird uppercase letters</h5>
<p>A weird pile of what I could only describe as extremely uppercase letters came up. It looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>RQST QF HK1 HNDSYD/03EN|FQTV QF HK1|CTCM QF HK1 614[phone number]|CKIN QF HN1 DO NOT SEAT ROW [row number] PLS SEAT LAST ROW OF [row letter] WINDOW
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, there’s a lot going on here. There is indeed a phone number in here. But what the heck is all this <em>other</em> stuff?</p>

<p>I realised this was like… Qantas staff talking to eachother <em>about</em> Tony Abbott, but not <em>to</em> him?</p>

        <blockquote><p>You sometimes can identify markers for an imminent project meltdown. But you have to pay attention to the red flags. Here’s what to look for.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should have recognized the signs earlier. Everyone else in our startup software company was busy at work, aware that we needed to finish our software to acquire the venture capital we needed. Yet, Sandra began bringing the newspaper to work, and reading the entire thing, while the people around her wrote code, worked on the business plan, or tried to make sense of our accounting. Although it was inevitable that she’d leave – and perhaps the team implosion was also a foregone conclusion – I somehow refused to deal with the early indications.</p>
<p>Not every software development crisis has an early warning system, but plenty of them do. If you learn to recognize the signs early enough – and you’re willing to confront the problem, as I was not – you may be able to prevent the project from failing. If you can’t prevent the meltdown, perhaps you can save yourself.</p>
<h3>Meetings of the minds</h3>
<p>When you first join a team, or when you begin to have a bad feeling that you can’t quite name, pay attention to the way people behave during team meetings. I don’t mean necessarily that you should rush to get your résumé in order, if people get upset with one another. But do watch for signs that the proceedings don’t matter to the participants.</p>
<p>A quality engineer at a midrange German bank attended his first meeting on a new project. People arrived and left at will, without saying a word. Nobody kept minutes, he told me. “We usually don’t need that,” project participants told him. At that point, says the engineer, “I knew that the level of discipline in this project was far too low to produce anything valuable. This proved to be true within a year.”</p>
<p>Are developers writing code instead of paying attention to what the users are asking? Do people regularly check their e-mail? It’s time to wonder about their commitment.</p>
<p>Meetings also show stress among the people who are supposed to be working together, especially when meetings don’t happen. In one project, where formerly independent teams were expected to merge, “They saw themselves as competing with one another,” reports Solomon, a programmer at a large financial firm. “When we did the requirements interviews, the users (and their managers) were looking to ‘protect’ the ‘way we’ve always done business.'” Some managers planned to limit the influence of other groups; political battles were fought over the design. “There was no process for surfacing these issues (many of them valid business issues) and having management make a decision,” Solomon says.</p>
<p>In fact, the number of meetings you attend is a sign on its own. If you have to gather a committee for a two-hour roundtable for every decision – because nobody can accept one person making the call – bump that project to the bottom of your priority list. Particularly so if meetings have more than five people, or when managers outnumber workers. Each such meeting moves the project doomsday clock closer to boom.</p>
<p>Another red flag is procrastination about timely updates for stakeholders. For example: A decision is required but not yet made. A milestone is not reached due to delays but someone doesn’t want to disclose that stumble. “Those may not kill or put a project in ‘zombie,’ status,” says one programmer, “But if the communication has broken down it’s a good indicator of heading that way.”</p>
<h3>Expectations out of whack</h3>
<p>I’ve heard dozens of stories from developers and tester about the signs that a project is headed downhill. By far, the most common source of problems is inaccurate or poorly-communicated project expectations – and an inappropriate reaction from management when things go awry.</p>
<p>“Why haven’t we done [this task]?”</p>
<p>“Oh, [task] is easy; we can do that any time.”</p>
<p>For example, one tester once was on a project that was completely oversold. The project team spent long weeks on the project. They even pulled all-nighters. But <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/estimating-testing-time-a-few-useful-guidelines/">the scope was too large for the timeframe and the staffing</a>. “The pressure on the company to produce a customer (and on the executive team) was such that the team was nearly run into the ground.”</p>
<p>This tester was lucky. After a wholesale change in upper management, a VP was sent to fire everyone in sight, after being told that the problems were the team’s fault. But this executive was astute enough to listen. The VP realized the problem wasn’t the staff, but the sales person and upper management who had sold the project. “He was able to slightly reset expectations with the customer, and we managed to put the project into production, producing a reference in the process.” Whew. One happy ending.</p>
<p>Others aren’t so fortunate. Don, a software consultant, found that “the surest single measure of increased likelihood of project failure is a management or owners who believe the task being performed is of one or more orders of magnitude less complexity than it actually is. This is usually reflected in poor or inept staffing… and other resource and planning shortfalls.”</p>
<h3>The C-suite gets involved</h3>
<p>If there’s no <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-do-a-product-evaluation-for-enterprise-software/">project champion</a>, by whatever job title, you should worry. Project sponsors need clout; the people above them have to respect them. Otherwise, while projects can be completed, they’re rarely transformational. However, the project champion also captures and communicates the team’s vision.</p>
<p>The sad alternative is when you see a big upswing in manager and upper-level manager check-ins. There’s a sudden surge in, “Is there anything we can do to help?” questions that would have been useful two months earlier.</p>
<p>Or personnel appear who aren’t integrated into the team. They don’t seem to have clear roles. For instance, a director from another department shows up, demanding to know why they weren’t consulted on the project, even though their superior had approved the process or task.</p>
<p>Another sign: Your project scope changes like the weather, for reasons you cannot fathom, and you have no ability to push back. As one techie described a too-familiar scenario: “The smoke of your burning deadlines will outline vast and terrible corporate gods who do not wish you well.”</p>
<h3>Project plan? What project plan?</h3>
<p>Often, those inaccurate expectations are a sign of earlier errors in analysis. A sure sign of failure is when time pressure exceeds normal limits – by far. “All of a sudden, you have loads of work to do, in ever-decreasing time intervals,” says a consultant who works in financial organizations. “This clearly shows that some points during the analysis and/or design phase was done horribly wrong.”</p>
<p>A related sign: The software is being built in parts, and nobody has integrated the parts yet. Especially if it’s because they don’t like to collaborate with the other authors.</p>
<p>There are <em>so</em> many variations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The project manager never presents a timeline, schedule, or milestone list.</li>
<li>A deadline for an important task is postponed more than two times.</li>
<li>Your weekly update call includes a lot of awkward silences. Or the definition of “done” drifts into science fiction.</li>
<li>You hear, “Are you sure this will take that long?”</li>
<li>Or they say, “Let’s use the occasion to also do &lt;big thing that’s completely unrelated&gt; while we have leverage.”</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to wait long for over-complicated expectations to emerge. Solomon adds, “When the chief architect explained the project, I started to count the tiers, and arrived at seven. A seven-tier architecture would contain so many chances to fail that I was immediately sure that the product would never see the customers. I was right. Twenty-three million Euros for nothing.”</p>
<h3>The attack of the killer accountants</h3>
<p>Your first clue: The snack closet doesn’t get refilled.</p>
<p>The more elaborate version: A random bean counter yells for the fainting couch when you submit a project expense line item has been utterly unremarkable during your entire tenure. Long-standing vendor contracts are scrutinized. Suddenly you need signoff from busybodies who have to render judgment on a critical spending component of your plan which nonetheless represents &lt;1% of the budgeted outlay.</p>
<p>The cost cutting isn’t logical. They don’t lay off an engineering team, which might be a hard-headed business decision. But they cancel required services, such as the organization’s Trello subscription.</p>
<h3>Inappropriate staffing</h3>
<p>Instead of dealing with the underlying problem – the team or the company can’t deliver what they’d promised – one way that poor management deals with the impending crisis is to hire or fire people. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-good-qa-director-and-a-great-one/">they often pick the wrong ones</a>. For example, in one project, Management felt the project was underfunded for the goals it was trying to reach.&nbsp;They couldn’t hire enough people with the right skills (that was too expensive) and caused the project to be slow to deliver.</p>
<p>When you can’t hire as many people as you need, you attempt to get more from the existing staff. In some cases, management threatens to lay people off if they don’t work harder. In one tester’s <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/3-reasons-to-stop-hating-one-on-one-meetings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-on-one session meeting</a>, the manager pointed out that the tester wasn’t at work in the evening. The tester told him he currently worked 50 hour weeks, and the company only paid for 37.5 hour weeks. The manager responded, “If you are not working 60 hour weeks, you are not working hard.” Ten minutes later, he added, “If you are not working hard, you are the list of people to be laid off.” The tester took the boss at his word. “I’m not sure if that project ever shipped. I quit and found a new job.”</p>
<p>How long do you wait before you recognize there’s a crisis? David’s ready to throw in the towel. He’s in a group that handles a couple dozen products, but David is the only developer, tester, and now manager. “I know the situation is bad. My company decided to fix the problem with people leaving or being laid off by building from the top. My program manager left, so naturally they replace him with a VP of Sales.” Two months …</p></div></div>
