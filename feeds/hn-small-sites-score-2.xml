<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
				<p>
	Today I implemented WebSocket support for 
	 <a href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth">Tholian Stealth</a> 
	.
</p>
<p>
	But, I soon came to realize that when implementing WebSockets from
	scratch that there is no go-to-and-know-everything resource
	available on the internet.
</p>
<p>
	Also, reading the RFC is kinda tedious, so I'm trying my best to
	have enough code demos available for clarifications. This guide
	tries to cover everything when it comes to the current WS13
	network protocol, including reserved frames and how to support
	them in future.
</p>
<p>
	Most people will most likely use socket.io, but from my personal
	view I wouldn't recommend it. In my use cases I use WebSockets
	peer-to-peer (yes, you can, despite everybody else claiming no),
	and the whole dependency tree of socket.io is rather redundant
	than performant.
</p>
<p>
	For the implementation we're going to build in this article,
	we only need plain node.js and its 
	 <code>net</code>
	 core stack. The
	implementation will be peer-to-peer, which means it can be used
	for both the client-side and server-side whereas both sides
	are implemented in node.js for the sake of simplicity.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	First off, you have to know that the 
	 <code>WS13</code>
	 protocol is specified as
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC6455</a> 
	and that there were a couple of legacy versions of Web Browsers around
	for a while that implemented the websocket protocol in a buggy manner.
</p>
<p>
	This is not the case anymore and I will completely ignore your shitty
	Safari from the dark ages here (it's 2019, not 2011 after all).
</p>
<p>
	The Web-Socket Protocol is a web protocol that uses HTTP's 
	 <code>Upgrade</code>
	mechanism in order to upgrade a connection. That means the first request
	to the server is actually an HTTP request with the 
	 <code>Connection: Upgrade</code>
	and 
	 <code>Upgrade: websocket</code>
	 headers.
</p>
<p>
	If the server has a specialized service-oriented architecture that
	needs more than just websocket data frames in order to work, it is
	good to implement it as a so-called sub protocol.
</p>
<p>These subprotocols can be used in the Web Browser, too.</p>
<pre>// Browser Example
let socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:12345', [
	'me-want-cookies' // Sub-Protocol
]);

let data = JSON.stringify({ foo: 'bar' });
let blob = new Uint8Array(8);

socket.send(data); // Text Frame
socket.send(blob); // Binary Frame
</pre>
<h2>Web-Socket Server</h2>
<p>The demo will be implemented in modern node.js.</p>
<p>
	The server creation has to be done with the 
	 <code>net.Server()</code>
	 interface,
	as the data that we need to access is 
	 <code>raw TCP data</code>
	 and our library
	will have to support binary encodings.
</p>
<p>
	It is important that the TCP connection is modified to fit our needs
	in order to never timeout. The WS13 protocol uses a 
	 <code>Ping Frame</code>
	 and
	a 
	 <code>Pong Frame</code>
	 which we have to manage ourselves, so we need to tell
	the TCP networking stack that by setting 
	 <code>socket.allowHalfOpen</code>
	 to 
	 <code>true</code>
	and by calling 
	 <code>socket.setTimeout(0)</code>
	 and 
	 <code>socket.setKeepAlive(true, 0)</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	As node.js runs 
	 <code>libuv</code>
	 in the background, which is of asynchronous
	nature, we also have to make sure that everything gets send as soon
	as possible by calling 
	 <code>socket.setNoDelay(true)</code>
	.
</p>
<pre>// server.mjs
import net    from 'net';
import { WS } from './WS.mjs';


// Chapter: Opening Handshake
const parse_opening_handshake = (buffer) =&gt; {

	let headers = {};
	return headers;

};

let server = new net.Server({
	allowHalfOpen:  true,
	pauseOnConnect: true
});

server.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; {

	socket.on('data', (buffer) =&gt; {

		let headers = parse_opening_handshake(buffer);
		if (
			headers['connection'] === 'Upgrade'
			&amp;&amp; headers['upgrade'] === 'websocket'
			&amp;&amp; headers['sec-websocket-protocol'] === 'me-want-cookies'
		) {

			WS.upgrade(socket, headers, (result) =&gt; {

				if (result === true) {

					console.log('WS.upgrade() successful.');

					socket.allowHalfOpen = true;
					socket.setTimeout(0);
					socket.setNoDelay(true);
					socket.setKeepAlive(true, 0);

					socket.removeAllListeners('timeout');
					socket.removeAllListeners('data');

					socket.on('data', buffer =&gt; {

						WS.receive(socket, buffer, request =&gt; {
							console.log('Received request ', request);
						});

					});

				} else {

					console.error('WS.upgrade() unsuccessful.');
					console.error('Sorry, no HTTP allowed either, yo');

					socket.end();

				}

			});

		} else {

			console.error('Sorry, no TCP allowed, yo');

			socket.end();

		}

	});

	socket.on('error',   () =&gt; {});
	socket.on('close',   () =&gt; {});
	socket.on('timeout', () =&gt; socket.close());

	socket.resume();

});

server.on('error', () =&gt; server.close());
server.on('close', () =&gt; (server = null));

server.listen(12345, null);
</pre>
<h2>Opening Handshake</h2>
<p>
	The initial request that is done via HTTP is conform to 
	 <code>HTTP/1.1</code>
	,
	so it is very easy to parse and the payload is encoded in 
	 <code>utf8</code>
	and not 
	 <code>binary</code>
	, which eases up the parsing process.
</p>
<p>
	The headers are - as every network byte ordered data - separated
	by 
	 <code>\r\n</code>
	 after each line, which means it's best to simply parse
	line-by-line and just trim everything off to have margin for
	malformed but recoverable handshakes.
</p>
<pre>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.cookie.engineer
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Origin: http://localhost:12345
Sec-WebSocket-Key: bm9tbm9tCg==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
</pre>
<p>
	The header parsing mechanism for 
	 <code>HTTP/1.1</code>
	 is quite easy,
	as it's just utf8 encoded data that has a trailing 
	 <code>\r\n\r\n</code>
	following its headers section.
</p>
<p>
	Fragmented frames always have this, but you never know what
	kind of script kiddie is challenging your server - so it's
	good to have a failsafe parsing mechanism in place.
</p>
<pre>// server.mjs

const parse_opening_handshake = (buffer) =&gt; {

	let headers = {};

	let req = buffer.toString('utf8');
	let raw = req.split('\n').map((line) =&gt; line.trim());

	if (raw[0].includes('HTTP/1.1')) {

		raw.slice(1).filter((line) =&gt; line.trim() !== '').forEach((line) =&gt; {

			let key = line.split(':')[0].trim().toLowerCase();
			let val = line.split(':').slice(1).join(':').trim();

			headers[key] = val;

		});

	}

	return headers;

};
</pre>
<h2>Connection Upgrade</h2>
<p>
	After the initial Opening Handshake request, it's expected to send
	the handshake verification back to the client.
</p>
<p>
	The handshake response contains the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Accept</code>
	 header
	and the 
	 <code>Upgrade: WebSocket</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Connection: Upgrade</code>
	 as well.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, it is good to let the client know which protocol
	we are expecting (so that mismatches can be handled automatically)
	by sending the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies</code>
	 and
	the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13</code>
	 headers.
</p>
<p>
	Note that the 
	 <code>nonce</code>
	 salt for the reply is static and is the
	utf8 value 
	 <code>258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11</code>
	.
</p>
<pre>// WS.mjs
import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
import crypto     from 'crypto';



const WS = {};


WS.upgrade = (socket, headers, callback) =&gt; {

	headers  = headers instanceof Object    ? headers  : null;
	callback = callback instanceof Function ? callback : null;

	if (headers !== null) {

		let nonce = headers['sec-websocket-key'] || null;
		if (nonce !== null) {

			let hash   = crypto.createHash('sha1').update(nonce + '258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11').digest('hex');
			let accept = Buffer.from(hash, 'hex').toString('base64');
			let blob   = [];

			blob.push('HTTP/1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake');
			blob.push('Upgrade: WebSocket');
			blob.push('Connection: Upgrade');
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Accept: ' + accept);
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies');
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13');
			blob.push('');
			blob.push('');

			// XXX: Flags are used later
			socket._is_server = true;
			socket._is_client = false;

			socket.write(blob.join('\r\n'));

			if (callback !== null) {
				callback(true);
			}

			return true;

		}

	} else {

		if (callback !== null) {
			callback(false);
		}

		return false;

	}

};

WS.receive = (socket, buffer, callback) =&gt; {};

// Chapter: Peer-To-Peer Web-Sockets
WS.ping = (socket) =&gt; {};

// Chapter: Sending Web-Socket Frames

	Web-Socket Frames can be a bit complicated when just looking at
	the figure. Here's a bullet-point list of what to remember
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Frames can be fragmented (because of TCP), so the first bit is the <code>fin</code> flag.</li>
	<li>The <code>rsv1</code> , <code>rsv2</code> and <code>rsv3</code> are Web-Socket Extension flags. If set to <code>1</code> , the payload can be processed differently.</li>
	<li>The <code>opcode</code> decides what kind of Web-Socket frame follows.</li>
	<li>The <code>client-to-server</code> transferred <code>mask flag</code> decides whether or not the payload needs to be XOR-masked.</li>
	<li>The <code>masking key</code> is <code>32 bits</code> long (4 bytes). It is only transferred when <code>mask flag</code> is set to <code>1</code> .</li>
	<li>The <code>server-to-client</code> transferred <code>mask flag</code> is always set to <code>0</code> and the data frame does not contain a masking key.</li>
	<li>Frames have a variable payload size. Payload length can …</li></ul></article></div>

					<p>Since release 0.9.0, a single service cluster can now monitor and audit multiple workload clusters. This allows organization to have one workload cluster per team, application or department — whatever suits their information security policies — but without incurring an increase in monitoring overhead.

					<p>To simplify compliance with access control policies, Compliant Kubernetes now includes support for propagating group claims from OpenID providers — such as Okta and Google — to Grafana, Harbor and the Kubernetes API. This allows your organization’s central roles to be mapped to various permissions. For example, when onboarding a new hire, you may add them to the “on-call operator” group in Okta, which will immediately give them access to various Grafana dashboards and <code>kubectl exec</code> permissions.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the owner of a kebab joint slap a <strong>massive, buzzing wasp </strong>with his <strong>bare hand</strong> directly into the grill whilst you pitch your new startup to him? If this also happens to you, <em>your business idea is not good</em>.</p>
<p>Many gurus online will tell you how to achieve success. I’m the opposite. Today I will instruct you on the noble art of achieving <strong>failure when creating a new software startup</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s right. Want to know a <strong>secret </strong>(it’s all about secrets today)? If you want to ensure your new startup fails, then please <strong>keep your idea secret so that nobody steals it</strong>. We learned this lesson the painful way.</p>
<p>But wait, who am I? I’m a guy that started creating software companies back in 2014 and failed a few times until I eventually succeeded. You can check my <a href="https://diego-os.com/about-me/" data-type="page" data-id="11">About Page</a> to learn more about me.</p>
<p>This post is part of a series where I share <strong>common pitfalls on starting a company</strong> – <em>and how to avoid them</em>. I’ve fallen for these traps before so that you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Also, I promise <strong>the wasp story is real</strong> and related to the topic. You will soon see…</p>
<h2>Coding in “stealth mode”</h2>
<p>Let me tell you a story. The year was 2015, and I had a great cushy job right after graduation. I no longer had to eat <em>unbranded pasta</em> and <em>questionable ham sandwiches</em> every day, I was living the dream!</p>
<p>But then, I caught the sneaky <strong>startup bug</strong>. I thought, why work for someone else when I can <strong>follow my dreams</strong> and <strong>start a startup?</strong></p>
<p>I somehow happened to read somewhere that JustEat – the takeaway delivery company – was making <strong>a lot of money</strong>. Why not start something like that, but somehow “better”?</p>
<p>So, I read a couple of business books, I partnered up with someone, and we started coding in our spare time. In no time we had a prototype for our killer app… a JustEat clone… <em><strong>but with pictures of the food!</strong></em> Revolutionary!</p>
<p>Curious to learn what happened next? Did this epic tale of the underdogs following their dreams end up in massive success? Will the bards of the future sing about our heroic deeds? is wasp kebab any good?</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: Our fear of Bill Gates dropping from a helicopter into our “office” (a smelly bedroom) to snatch our “archives” (a battered notebook I bought in Poland for £0.20) didn’t materialize. Something else happened.</p>
<h2>But “I don’t want anyone to steal my ideas”</h2>
<p>So, we came up with a random idea for a food-related app, and called it <strong>Foodswiper </strong>– it was like Tinder, <em>but for food</em>. Then, we started coding for months <strong>in secret</strong>, without telling anyone.</p>
<p>Of course, our idea was so valuable, so <em>irresistible</em>, that mentioning it would trigger all our friends to immediately ditch their jobs and families, and start coding to <strong>steal our idea</strong>. Even our moms were suspected of such intrigues.</p>
<p>I remember my flatmate throwing away post from the government directed at our company. He thought the address was wrong – I rescued the letter from the rubbish at night (of course in secret) and felt like <strong>James Bond</strong>.</p>
<p>So, why is all of this wrong?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, <strong>nobody is going to steal your ideas</strong>. The only ideas worth protecting are highly specialized academic research, military secrets, copyrightable material, etc. The obvious stuff that needs to be secret.</p>
<p>Secondly, keeping your idea secret prevents you from getting <strong>crucial feedback</strong> <strong>from customers</strong>, and getting customer feedback should be your goal when starting a new software product company.</p>
<p>In our case, with Foodswiper, we spent months coding the application up and when we finally came out to the real world to get some customers… we discovered that <strong>nobody wanted our app</strong>.</p>
<p>A lot of pain and resources could have been saved if we tried to get our idea out there earlier instead of coding it up in secret for months.</p>
<h2>Why do people fall for this trap?</h2>
<p>I literally think the real reason people keep their ideas secret is <strong>fear of failure</strong>. Ironically, this fear of failure leads to failure itself!</p>
<p>People that want to start startups are often – but not always – accomplished individuals that have succeeded at many things in the past. <strong>When you have a good track record, you don’t want to sully it with failure.</strong></p>
<p>For example, in my case, I kind of had a very good trajectory. I graduated top of my class from Cambridge University, got a great job at Citi, and was succeeding at everything I cared about in life.</p>
<p>If you asked me back then why I kept my startup idea secret, I probably would have said <em>“so that nobody steals it”</em>, but the real reason was probably closer to fear of failure coupled with inexperience.</p>
<p>A startup is a big gamble. So many things can go wrong. It can be really painful to be “winning at life” for many years and then lose it all. <strong>All your fancy titles mean nothing</strong> when you start a startup. It’s all about results.</p>
<p>Some people invest all their money and get financially ruined after all, and plenty of really accomplished people have tried the startup game and failed. We all know some stories like these of have heard of them.</p>
<h2>The solution: limiting the downside</h2>
<p>At least I can proudly say we had <strong>some </strong>foresight back in the day. We acknowledged that we didn’t know many things so we engineered a situation where it wouldn’t be the end of the world if we failed.</p>
<p>Basically, we saved up all we could working in London. Then, we moved to a cheap country where our savings would last us around 2 years. This gave us <strong>plenty of time to learn</strong> (and eventually succeed with a different idea).</p>
<p>The backup plan was to come back to working as software developers for another company, and we were young and had no dependents, so the risk of total failure was mostly mitigated.</p>
<p>When you remove the risk of catastrophic ruin should your idea not work out, then you limit the fear and increase your chances of success.</p>
<h2>Gather customer feedback early</h2>
<p>I promised I would talk about the wasp. So picking up where I left off, we coded furiously for months, and then, we took to the streets of London to try to convince restaurant owners one by one to sign up for our app.</p>
<p>Did I mention this was <strong>after</strong> I quit my job to pursue that startup idea full time? i.e. <strong>dropping my income to zero</strong>. This was a depressing time. Nobody from any restaurant was interested at all.</p>
<p>Imagine a twenty-something year old, <em>inexplicably dressed in a suit,</em> entering your takeaway establishment and asking if you want to sign up for an app with <strong>no users</strong> that they have <strong>never heard of</strong>.</p>
<p>We basically visited hundreds of restaurants and nobody, <strong>zero people</strong>, were interested… until we got a signal from the heavens.</p>
<p>After an exhaustive search we finally found <em>one guy</em> that wanted to sign up for our app. To be fair, this man was really enthusiastic and wanted to help, I really appreciate people like this, but it was not meant to be.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this just wouldn’t work. This is when the guy slapped the wasp into the grill. Needless to say you don’t want to see a dead wasp in your food. Also, too bad we needed millions of other people to also sign up.</p>
<p>There were so many insurmountable problems. If only the guy slapped me in the face that day, maybe that way I would have learned quicker.</p>
<p>We should have stopped the project then with the wasp incident, but we still stubbornly continued for 6 more months. For some reason we thought that restaurants were not interested because <strong>we lacked features!</strong> </p>
<p>It makes me cringe to think about those extra 6 months now. What we were lacking was <strong>customers</strong>, not <strong>features</strong>. We had <em>freaking </em>business cards! But not a single user.</p>
<p>We somehow convinced ourselves to continue writing code and features with no users! It’s insanity! We even <strong>made up</strong> some graphs with “projections” and automated billing systems for zero cash-flow. Ridiculous.</p>
<h2>Succeed with your idea instead of keeping it secret</h2>
<p>Instead of keeping your idea secret you should test it as soon as possible. Don’t fall for the same trap we did.</p>
<p>In our case, we eventually learned this lesson and stopped <em>Foodswiper</em>. We then tested 5 business ideas in just one month <strong>before</strong> coding them up. Out of those 5, one of them was <a href="https://nutriadmin.com/">https://nutriadmin.com</a>, which was successful.</p>
<p>We tested the ideas <strong>very quickly</strong> by creating a single one page mockup for each, and then placing ads, sending cold emails, and contacting prospects to ask if they would buy the product we were planning to build.</p>
<p>This allowed us to quickly discard 4 out of our 5 ideas (we didn’t find any interest for them for different reasons).</p>
<p>Moreover, when we found the app idea for nutritionists, the people we talked to gave us <strong>a list of the features they would need</strong>, and other key details that helped us succeed! Clearly this is a much better approach!</p>
<p>When we eventually launched our first (terrible) version of the software, we already had a couple of people in our list to try to sell it to. Even though we lacked features, some people paid for it and said they found it <strong>useful</strong>!</p>
<p>Over the years we have extended and grown this app to a much more professional product. But it all started with an idea and customer feedback. <strong>Crucially</strong>, it didn’t start with months of coding in secret.</p>
<p>I didn’t invent this “technique”, it’s broadly called <strong>customer development</strong>, and was popularized by Steve Blank in his book <em>The 4 steps to the epiphany</em> and later by his student Eric Ries in <em>The Lean Startup</em>. It works, confirmed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What is serverless computing, and why is it taking the cloud computing world by storm? </p><p>These are some of the great questions that we are asked on a daily basis at Koyeb! While answering these questions, we will discuss some of the core concepts that are vital for newcomers and engineers looking to keep pace with emerging cloud computing technologies.</p><p>This blog post is the first in our Serverless Series about serverless computing. If you want to learn more about how serverless technologies is changing the application landscape, be sure to check out the next blog post in the Serverless Series: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://koyeb.com/blog/going-serverless-implications-benefits-and-challenges"><strong>Going Serverless: Implications, Benefits and Challenges</strong></a>.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#overview"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>In short, serverless computing means the fact of installing, maintaining, scaling, or upgrading servers is completely abstracted for the user.</p><p>Serverless is a significant evolution in cloud computing because users no longer have to manage the underlying infrastructure in order to scale their functions, containers, databases, and more; cloud service providers take care of this for them automatically and cost-effectively.</p><p>Above all, going serverless is a strategic decision with considerable benefits in the short and long term. Serverless is becoming the new standard to host modern and greenfield applications.</p><h2 id="quick-refresher-on-the-history-of-cloud-computing">Quick Refresher on the History of Cloud Computing<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#quick-refresher-on-the-history-of-cloud-computing"><span></span></a></span></h2><h3 id="pre-cc-cloud-computing">Pre-CC (Cloud Computing)<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#pre-cc-cloud-computing"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>At the dawn of the computing era, those who wanted to leverage computing technology needed to buy, install, maintain, and upgrade their own physical servers - a very expensive and time-consuming endeavor.</p><p>Even with their high-cost, computing technologies increased efficiency by orders of magnitude, so firms began to transition to the digital era. Still, building a computing infrastructure required massive amounts of upfront investment in the form of time, manpower, and money. Best practices included investing in large computing infrastructures that your firm would grow into and owning enough servers to handle the occasional spikes in activity. This capacity over-provisioning was really inefficient with expensive servers idling most of the time.</p><h3 id="cloud-computing-emergence">Cloud Computing Emergence<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#cloud-computing-emergence"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Since the introduction of cloud computing in the mid-2000s, individuals and firms alike can outsource their computing infrastructures to cloud service providers (CSPs). CSPs provide and manage different levels of cloud computing services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).</p><p><img src="https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/blog/aaS-graphic.png" alt="Managed Services"></p><p>IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are often represented as a pyramid as each of them provides a higher level of abstraction.</p><p>This outsourcing is a radical evolution in computing practices. Small and large companies alike can save incredible amounts of money, manpower, and time all while tailoring their computing infrastructures exactly to their needs and refocusing those resources back into their businesses.</p><h2 id="the-rise-of-serverless">The Rise of Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#the-rise-of-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h2><h3 id="serverless-is-a-broad-and-global-term">Serverless is a Broad and Global Term<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#serverless-is-a-broad-and-global-term"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Serverless computing is an evolution of cloud computing. In short, serverless computing means the duty of installing, maintaining, scaling, or upgrading servers is completely removed for the user. </p><p>In fact, the word serverless only makes sense from the user's perspective because the user no longer has to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. Servers are still very much in the picture as servers perform the computing operations, but there is a responsibility shift: they are now maintained and provisioned by the cloud service provider.</p><p>The term serverless started to be actively used in the industry for mainstream computing and web applications in 2015, after the launch of AWS Lambda, a serverless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform. Although FaaS is often associated with the serverless term, these two concepts should not be conflated. During the following years, a lot of other serverless services emerged, and the promise to reduce infrastructure complexity quickly enticed developers and companies.</p><h3 id="everything-serverless">Everything Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#everything-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Nearly all services can become serverless: compute, storage, database, messaging, and more. Indeed, there are already several different types of managed serverless services: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), Container-as-a-Service (CaaS), and Database-as-a-service (DBaaS), just to name a few.</p><p><img src="https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/blog/types-of-serverless-services.png" alt="Managed Serverless Services"></p><p>At its core, going serverless means outsourcing the work of managing your underlying infrastructure. It means no longer having to scale, operate, or update the servers that run your applications. Cloud service providers now handle these operations and offer them as a service.</p><h3 id="the-technologies-enabling-serverless">The Technologies enabling Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#the-technologies-enabling-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Serverless technologies are possible thanks to a combination of several computer science advancements:</p><ul><li><strong>Containers:</strong> The rise of containerized resources with improvements in core Linux cgroups feature, hardware virtualization and the Docker/OCI are core enablers, allowing efficient virtualization and abstraction of physical resources.</li><li><strong>Ability to host arbitrary code:</strong> The ability to securely host any code with isolation thanks to virtualization progress is essential to allow mainstream serverless.</li><li><strong>Distributed Computing:</strong> The increase in network bandwidth and reduction of network latency has enabled wider distributed computing adoption, which is essential to provide variable amounts of computing power, above the limits of a single physical server.</li><li><strong>Versioning, naming and discovery:</strong> The last decade has seen significant progress in continuous deployment technologies with improvements in versioning and service discovery tooling, increasing the capacity to deploy in a distributed environment.</li><li><strong>Events and message passing:</strong> Event-driven architectures are a significant enabler for serverless as tasks can easily be distributed and processing power can grow as requests come.</li><li><strong>Microservices</strong>: Creating small, specialized services is essential to provide the right amount of resources for each processing function.</li><li><strong>Autoscaling:</strong> Finally, autoscaling is a core component of serverless, which has itself been made possible by strong advancements in load-balancing and monitoring technologies.</li></ul><p>The AtLarge Research Team provides a good overview of the technological evolution that lead to serverless in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atlarge-research.com/pdfs/serverless-history-now-future18ieeeic.pdf"><em>Serverless is More: From PaaS to Present Computing</em></a>, give it a read if you want to dive deeper!</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further reading<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#further-reading"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>We hope you enjoyed this short retrospective on the history of cloud computing and serverless.

And yes there are heroes and villains, action sequences, humor and plot twists. You have to be careful not to wear the audience out. You have to manage building to a climax. Steve understood this better than anyone.</p></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>How much time went into preparing the iPhone demo?</p></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>Quite a lot! That’s the thing, no other CEO would have imagined spending the time Steve invested in his keynotes. For the most important ones, we started 3 or so months out. He would run the company until maybe 2:00 pm and then spend a few hours with me. Then he may start in again in the evening, me at my house and him at his, and we’d stay up until midnight. Sometimes we’d be at it again at 6 am.&nbsp;</p><p>I saw part of my job—and Steve never knew this—as managing his emotional ramp to the event. I’ve even described my job much like being a product manager. There were all kinds of things that could mess that up: the product timing, or the photos that were taken weren’t good enough, or he had a bad day, or we didn’t have all the assets he needed… or at times too many!&nbsp;</p><p>With movies, you never want anything to affect suspension of belief. You want your audience to stay in that magical moment and not think about how things are done.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the iPhone, we wanted to show that if you rotate your phone to landscape mode, the photo would automatically rotate too. But we were not projecting a video of the actual iPhone that Steve was holding in his hand, only the video from the iPhone. That would have made it shaky on the big screen with distracting reflections. </p><p>So we showed a graphic of an iPhone, to look like the Keynote slides, and projected Steve’s demo iPhone screen into the exact right position in the graphic.&nbsp;The trick was that when Steve rotated the iPhone to landscape mode, the right thing to do to keep customers in the moment was to rotate the iPhone graphic with its inserted video feed rotating in sync as well. But how?</p><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>It took a month for one of the brilliant Apple engineers to work out how to do this. It looked natural to the audience and no one had to think about how it happened.&nbsp;</p><p>When Steve saw this happen he first time, he knew it’d be magic and it had to be shown live. He rotated it back and forth several times in his demo and no one ever questioned what they were seeing because it looked exactly they way it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If I remember, the internal estimate of the marketing power of the iPhone demo Steve did that day was in excess of $1 billion of PR spend from demo until we shipped.</p><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Amazing!

<p>This is the second part of a three part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, II) discussion of the idea of a ‘universal warrior’ – the assumption that there is a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of fundamental truth for understanding war, either in the past or present, or else a useful blueprint for current life more generally.  In investigating this question, we are using Steven Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">recent video series</a> as our foil, since it is a more completely explained expression of this idea and one should always try to debate the stronger form of the opposing argument.</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">Last time we took a look at the social place of people involved in war</a>.  We found that, far from there being a universal combatant, distinctions between soldiers and warriors are both significant for the present and important for understanding the past.  Moreover, beyond that simple dichotomy, the idea of a universal war experience in turn conceals the basic fact that many people who were neither warriors nor soldiers, not properly combatants of any kind, experienced war in unique ways, be they victims of warfare, homefront supporters, or economically invested in the enterprise.  Already we have seen that there’s far more than just one sort of person <em>with</em> a war experience.</p>



<p>This week (and next), we’re narrowing our focus just to the combatants and asking to what degree is even the experience of combat and soldiering (or ‘warrioring’) common.  Does it evoke the same emotions or require the same kinds of character?  Is it conditioned on the same values?  Does it involve the same activities or experiences?  Is combat understood the same, from one society to another?</p>



<p>Even so narrowed, our topic is necessarily massive, since we are considering the experience of <em>all</em> wars at <em>all</em> times.  But fortunately (for the wear and tear on my keyboard, if nothing else) our thesis – that there are quite a lot of broad universals in the war experience – does not need to be tested <em>everywhere</em> if it can be shown to fail in many places.  Consequently, we are going to bounce around a bit here; I hope the reader will understand that I mean these examples to be broadly representative, rather than exhaustive.</p>



<p>If that method seems a bit patchwork, it is important to remember just how <em>expansive</em> the argument implied by this notion of a ‘universal’ warrior or war experience is.  <strong>In arguing for a ‘warrior archetype’ that recurs in all cultures</strong> (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-eight/">as Steven Pressfield does</a>),<strong> or more obliquely in arguing that some given sort of long vanished ‘warrior culture’ </strong>(like the Spartans) <strong>provides material for emulation today, they are making a claim for a <em>human universal</em>, and a profound one at that</strong>.  After all, the suggestion is not that, for instance, some particular Spartan (or knightly, or Viking, or Samurai, or Apache, or…) tactic or weapon should today be used, but that the <em>ethos</em> and worldview of those ‘warriors’ is valuable because it taps into a true human <em>constant</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Because after all, a lot has changed!</strong>  We no longer fight with spears, or muskets.  Our wars are, in some obvious ways, vastly different from the conflicts of the past.  <strong>Yet for these past values, social systems, or habits to be directly applicable to the present, <em>something</em> would have to be fundamentally constant, at a deep and fairly profound level, in human conflict</strong>.  And it has to be something rather more than ‘people die in war, and that is sad for some people.’  After all, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/27/the-10-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america-according-to-bls-data.html">people die in logging</a>, and you don’t hear all of these fellows waxing lyrical about the ‘universal lumberjack’ (though I can assure you, if it does exist well…<a href="https://youtu.be/pfRdur8GLBM">then he’s a lumberjack and he’s ok</a>).  It has to be something more than ‘war is scary’ because after all so too is running <em>into </em>burning buildings, but we’re not discussing patterning our lives around the ‘universal firefighter’ either.  There would have to be some more profound truth to the phrase – to abuse the <em>Fallout</em> series – that ‘War, war never changes.’</p>



<p>And that is a thesis we can test!  Does war change from one culture to the next?  From one period to the next?  From one place to the next?  Let’s find out!</p>

<h2>Raids and Battles</h2>



<p>So what is the experience of combat like?  Well, first we have to ask, <em>what sort of combat do you mean?</em></p>



<p>As I’ve noted before, the branch of military history most focused on the experience of combat is what is sometimes called the ‘Face of Battle’ school, after John Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle</em> (1976).  Taking three battles from English history (Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme), Keegan aimed to reconstruct the experience of those battles in its own long chapter, beginning with the campaign that led to them, then discussing the interaction of men and weapons (infantry vs. cavalry, cavalry vs. cavalry and so on) seeking to use the physics of the battlefield to explain how these interactions would go.  He then focuses on how men cohered in the face of terror; then on to the casualties and the aftermath.</p>



<p>We might imagine that this standard order (replicated, I might add, in <em>The Western Way of War </em>(1989), albeit with more problems of evidence) implies a standard sequence of events, moments and emotions in a battle.</p>



<p>Except that for most of the human experience, this sort of battle was rare and generally indecisive when it did happen (a point which leads to the marvelous title of the upcoming, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Other-Face-Battle-Forgotten-Experience/dp/0190920645">The Other Face of Battle</a></em>).  This ‘Face of Battle’ kind of war – formally constituted field armies meeting in set-piece battles out on open fields, with a clearly defined ‘peace’ before and after the war, along with a zone of conflict and a ‘home front’ – is the kind of war modern folks tend to be quickest to imagine, because in most of the industrialized world, we imagine this as <em>our</em> way of war.  But it not the oldest, or most common, or original way of war.</p>



<p>The oldest way of war was what Native North Americans called – evocatively – the ‘cutting off’ way of war (a phrase I am borrowing from W. Lee, “The Military Revolution of Native North America” in <em>Empires and Indigines</em>, ed. W. Lee (2011)), but which was common among non-state peoples <em>everywhere</em> in the world for the vast stretch of human history (and one may easily argue much of modern insurgency and terrorism is merely this same toolkit, updated with modern weapons).  <a href="https://youtu.be/4I8kic8xZh8">The goal of such warfare was not to subjugate a population but to drive them off, forcing them to vacate resource-rich land which could then be exploited by your group</a>.  To do this, you wanted to inflict maximum damage (casualties inflicted, animals rustled, goods stolen, people captured) at minimum risk, until the lopsided balance of pain you inflicted forced the enemy to simply move away from you to get out of your operational range.</p>



<p>The main tool of this form of warfare (detailed more extensively in A. Gat, <em>War in Human Civilization</em> (2006) and L. Keeley, <em>War Before Civilization</em> (1996)) was the raid.  Rather than announcing your movements, a war party would attempt to advance into enemy territory in secret, hoping (in the best case) to catch an enemy village or camp unawares (typically by night) so that the population could be killed or captured (<em>mostly</em> killed; these are mostly non-specialized societies with limited ability to incorporate large numbers of subjugated captives) safely.  Then you <em>quickly</em> get out of enemy territory before villages or camps allied to your target can retaliate.  If you detected an incoming raid, you might rally up <em>your</em> allied villages or camps and ambush the ambusher in an equally lopsided engagement.</p>



<p>Only rarely in this did a <em>battle</em> result – typically when both the surprise of the raid and the surprise of the counter-raid ambush failed.  At that point, with the chance for surprise utterly lost, both sides might line up and exchange missile fire (arrows, javelins) at fairly long range.  Casualties in these battles were generally very low – instead the battle served both as a display of valor and a signal of resolve by both sides to continue the conflict.  That isn’t to say these wars were bloodless – indeed the overall level of military mortality was much <em>higher</em> than in ‘pitched battle’ cultures, but the killing was done almost entirely in the ambush and the raid.</p>



<p><strong>We may call this the first system of war.</strong>  It is the oldest, but as noted above, never entirely goes away.  We tend to call this style ‘asymmetric’ or ‘unconventional’ war, but it is the <em>most</em> conventional war – it was the first convention, after all.  It is also sometimes denigrated as primitive, but should not be judged so quickly – first system armies have managed to frustrate far stronger opponents when terrain and politics were favorable.</p>

<p>What changed?  Very briefly, agriculture, cities and the state.  Agriculture created a stationary population that both wouldn’t move but which could also be dominated, subjugated and have their production extracted from them.  Their wealth was clustered in towns which could be fortified with walls that would resist any quick raid, but control of that fortified town center (and its administrative apparatus of taxation) meant control of the countryside and its resources.  Taking such a town meant a siege – delivering a large body of troops and keeping them there long enough to either breach the walls or starve out the town into surrender.  This created a war where …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>After doing a little searching, I’ve found it’s a little difficult to understand the differences between strongly typed, weakly typed, dynamically typed, and statically typed programming languages. I’d like to clear that up.</p>

<p>First, let’s define what typing is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In programming languages, a type system is a <strong>collection of rules</strong> that assign a property called a type to the various constructs—such as variables, expressions, functions or modules—a computer program is composed of. The main purpose of a type system is to reduce bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. <strong>This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or it can happen as a combination of static and dynamic checking.</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two important pieces to pull from the definition. The first is that a type system is a collection of rules. The second is that checking for the rules can apply at different times.</p>

<p>Here’s what we can deduce so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strongly typed - many rules</li>
<li>Weakly typed - few rules</li>
<li>Dynamically typed - rules applied at run time</li>
<li>Statically typed - rules applied at compile time</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an extremely helpful post by <a href="http://blogs.agilefaqs.com/2011/07/11/dynamic-typing-is-not-weak-typing/">Naresh Jain</a> that includes this diagram:</p>

<p><a href="http://josephspurrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/strongweakstaticdynamic_type.png"><img src="http://www.josephspurrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/strongweakstaticdynamic_type.png" alt="strongweakstaticdynamic_type"></a></p>

<p>Naresh’s image shows that there are different degrees of typing. There are languages that have more rules (more strongly typed) than others.</p>

<p>Here’s another definition from Wikipedia that explains a strongly typed language:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1974, Liskov and Zilles described a strong-typed language as one in which “whenever an object is passed from a calling function to a called function, its type must be compatible with the type declared in the called function.” Jackson wrote, “In a strongly typed language each data area will have a <strong>distinct type</strong> and each process will state its communication requirements in terms of these types.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this definition, PHP is NOT a strongly typed language because you can pass multiple variable types to the same function. Let’s take a look at this example of PHP:</p>

<pre><code>// Pass the integer 4
// Outputs: int(9)
var_dump(foo(4));

// Pass the string 4
// Outputs: int(9)
var_dump(foo('4'));

// Pass the string 4
// Outputs: Fatal error: Unsupported operand types
var_dump(foo(array(4)));

// Argument does not have a distinct type
function foo($bar)
{
    // Return the value + 5
    return $bar + 5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, the function, foo(), does not specify a distinct type for argument $bar so a programmer can pass any type of variable. The first time the function is called, the integer of 4 is passed and returns an integer of 9. The second time the function is called, the string of 4 is passed and again returns an integer of 9. The third and final time the function is called, an array containing an integer of 4 is passed and results in a Fatal Error.</p>

<p>The example above shows PHP is weakly typed and dynamically typed. In terms of the number of rules, PHP uses strings and integers interchangeably so there are “less rules”. Therefore, PHP is considered a weakly typed language. PHP is also dynamically typed because the rules are applied at run time instead of at compile time since PHP is not compiled and instead interpreted at run time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> PHP does support type hinting which makes it less weakly typed/more strongly typed, yet it is still considered a weakly typed language because you cannot use type hinting for integers or strings.</p>

<p>In summary, here are how I see the different types defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strongly typed</strong> - types cannot be used interchangeably</li>
<li><strong>Weakly typed</strong> - types can be used interchangeably</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically typed</strong> - types are checked at run time</li>
<li><strong>Statically typed</strong> - types are checked at compile time</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, this clears up a few things.</p>

As "the railrodder", Keaton crosses Canada from east to west on a railway track speeder. True to Keaton's genre, the film is full of sight gags as our protagonist putt-putts his way to British Columbia. Not a word is spoken throughout, and Keaton is as spry and ingenious at fetching laughs as he was in the old days of the silent slapsticks.

<p>You have no doubt heard of the

It made headlines when, in February 2020,
Chrome started rolling out changes to <code>SameSite</code>’s default behaviour;

Both in anticipation and in reaction to <code>SameSite</code>’s activation in browsers,
posts started
sprouting on blogs all over the Web to spread the word

such as <a href="https://twitter.com/rowan_m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rowan Merewood</a>’s <a href="https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.dev piece</a>
entitled “SameSite cookies explained”.
Unfortunately, relatively few of the posts about <code>SameSite</code>
went to the effort of clarifying the concept of <em>site</em>,
from which the concepts of <em>same-site request</em> and <em>cross-site request</em>
are of course derived.</p>
<p>Moreover, many posts,
including those produced by influential members of the infosec community,
appeared to use the terms “origin” and “site” interchangeably or, at least,
somewhat loosely.</p>
<p>Back in February 2019, Kristian Bremberg <a href="https://blog.detectify.com/2019/02/05/guide-http-security-headers-for-better-web-browser-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote the following</a>
on the venerable Detectify blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SameSite attribute is rather new and provides excellent protection
against CSRF attacks. If a cookie uses the SameSite attribute,
the web browser will make sure that the request made with the cookie came
from the <strong>origin</strong> that sat [sic] the cookie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>Infosec superstar <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt</a> himself,
in <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seminal post</a> entitled
“Promiscuous Cookies and Their Impending Death via the SameSite Policy”
and published in early January 2020, described the effects of the different
<code>SameSite</code> attribute values as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>None: what Chrome defaults to today without a SameSite value set</li>
<li>Lax: some limits on sending cookies on a <strong>cross-origin</strong> request</li>
<li>Strict: tight limits on sending cookies on a <strong>cross-origin</strong> request</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>And a few months later, in an otherwise fascinating <a href="https://blog.reconless.com/samesite-by-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>
analysing how the advent of <code>SameSite</code> was affecting a range of vulnerabilities
cherished by hackers,
the <a href="https://twitter.com/0xReconless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reconless team</a> wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the update, all cookies without an explicit <code>SameSite</code> attribute will
be treated as having <code>SameSite=Lax</code>.
This means <strong>cross-origin</strong> requests no longer carry cookies,
except for top-level navigations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p><em>Domain</em>, <em>host</em>, <em>origin</em>, <em>site</em>…
Using those terms loosely in informal communication is natural;
such laxity in the use of terminology can be forgiven,
and if you’ve been guilty of it yourself, you’re in good company.</p>
<h2 id="are-site-and-origin-interchangeable">Are “site” and “origin” interchangeable? <a href="#are-site-and-origin-interchangeable">¶</a></h2>
<p>However, the advent of the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute raises some questions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a careful distinction between “origin” and “site” warranted, here?</li>
<li>Is it just a distinction without a difference?</li>
<li>Is a <em>cross-site</em> request no different from a <em>cross-origin</em> request?</li>
<li>Could the cookie attribute have as well been named “SameOrigin”, then?</li>
<li>Or, if there is indeed a real difference between “site” and “origin”,
does it matter to practitioners?</li>
<li>And, if the difference does matter, how so?</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have already guessed the answers from the title of this post:
“site” has a very technical meaning in the context of <code>SameSite</code>,
yet it is unduly neglected;
and the distinction between <em>site</em> and <em>origin</em> <em>does</em> matter,
yet the two concepts are frequently conflated.</p>
<p>This lapse in terminology didn’t escape everyone.
That Google’s <em>Developer Advocate of Web</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/agektmr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eiji Kitamura</a>
felt the need to dedicate
a whole <a href="https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>
about the distinction between “origin” and “site”,
only a few months after Chrome activated <code>SameSite</code>, is revealing.</p>
<p>In order to understand why the distinction matters,
you first need to understand the difference between <em>origin</em> and <em>site</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-origin">What do we mean by “origin”? <a href="#what-do-we-mean-by-origin">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you work with Web technologies,
you have at least some familiarity with the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</a>,
arguably one of the main pillar of Web security.
The concept of <em>origin</em> of a URI is of course central to the SOP and,
as such, it is relatively well-understood.
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 3.2 of RFC 6454</a> defines an <em>origin</em> as a triple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roughly speaking, two URIs are part of the same origin
(i.e., represent the same principal) if they have the same
scheme, host, and port.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The port is optional; if not specified, the default port associated to the scheme
is implied (e.g. 80 for <code>http</code> and 443 for <code>https</code>).
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Glossary/Origin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN Web Docs</a> has a series of useful examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-site">What do we mean by “site”? <a href="#what-do-we-mean-by-site">¶</a></h2>
<p>Behind the painfully generic term that is “site”
hides a concept fundamentally more difficult to grasp
than that of <em>origin</em>.
For one thing, the term “site” was not always a technical one:
it predates the SOP and was in in common use
<a href="https://blog.jeremiahgrossman.com/2006/07/origins-of-cross-site-scripting-xss.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when attacks like cross-site scripting came onto the scene</a>.
Furthermore, the modern concept of <em>site</em> is fraught with technical difficulties.
It is intimately linked to that of a host’s <em>registrable domain</em>,
which the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-registrable-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL Living Standard</a> defines as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] a domain formed by the most specific public suffix,
along with the domain label immediately preceeding it, if any.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A host’s registrable domain is also known as its “eTLD+1”, short for
“effective top-level domain plus one”.)</p>
<p>In the simplest of cases, <strong>the site of an origin simply corresponds
to the registrable domain (if any) of the origin’s host</strong>.</p>
<p>Two examples, to fix ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site of <code>https://www.example.org</code> is <code>example.org</code>,
because <code>org</code> is the host’s most specific public suffix
and, therefore, <code>example.org</code> is the host’s eTLD+1.</li>
<li>The site of <code>https://jub0bs.github.io</code> is <code>jub0bs.github.io</code>,
because <code>github.io</code> is the host’s most specific public suffix
and, therefore, <code>jub0bs.github.io</code> is the host’s eTLD+1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes! Perhaps surprisingly, <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>github.io</code> is a public suffix</a>!</p>
<p>It’s worth noting, however, that the concept of registrable domain is a fluid one,
because it relies on the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public-Suffix List</a>,
a list which is not set in stone but <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/blob/master/public_suffix_list.dat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to change over time</a>.
Not to mention that different browsers may not necessarily stay abreast of
changes to the Public-Suffix list at the same pace.</p>
<p>The technicalities do not end there!
As <a href="https://web.dev/schemeful-samesite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.dev warns us</a>,
the concept of <em>site</em> is still evolving and
will soon incorporate the scheme also.
The change currently sits behind a flag in Chrome but will soon be rolled out.
However, to sidestep this difficulty and prolong the relevance of this post,
I’ll only consider origins whose scheme is <code>https</code> in what follows.</p>
<h2 id="same-site-vs-cross-site-requests">Same-site vs. cross-site requests <a href="#same-site-vs-cross-site-requests">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve dealt with the concept of <em>site</em>,
we can finally discuss the concepts of <em>same-site</em> and <em>cross-site</em> requests.
A given request is either <em>same-site</em> or <em>cross-site</em>.
Whether a request is same-site or cross-site depends on the comparison
between the sites of the request’s source origin and target origin:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the two sites are identical, the request is said to be <em>same-site</em>;</li>
<li>If the two sites are different, the request is said to be <em>cross-site</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are three examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.example.org</code> to <code>https://bar.example.org</code>
is same-site,
because the site of both origins is <code>example.org</code>.</li>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.github.io</code>
to <code>https://bar.github.io</code> is cross-site,
because the site of the first origin is <code>foo.github.io</code>,
whereas the site of the second origin is <code>bar.github.io</code>.</li>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.bar.example.org</code> to <code>https://bar.example.org</code>
is same-site, because the site of both origins is <code>example.org</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve made it this far down the present post, I thank you for your patience.
Take heart: the payoff is near!</p>
<h2 id="cross-origin-same-site-requests">Cross-origin, same-site requests <a href="#cross-origin-same-site-requests">¶</a></h2>
<p>All cross-site requests are necessarily cross-origin; that much is clear.
However, as shown by the first and third examples above,
not all cross-origin requests are cross-site.</p>
<p><img src="https://jub0bs.com/images/cor_vs_csr.svg" alt="Venn-diagram"></p>
<p>And the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute is only concerned with cross-site requests;
it has no effect on cross-origin requests that happen to be same-site.
This is why the distinction between <em>origin</em> and <em>site</em> is important.</p>
<h2 id="online-demo">Online demo <a href="#online-demo">¶</a></h2>
<p>To prove my point,
I’ve drawn inspiration from <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt’s post</a> and
I’ve deployed a simple Go server to <code>samesitedemo.jub0bs.com</code> composed
of two simple endpoints.
Endpoint <code>/setcookie</code> sets a <code>SameSite=Strict</code> cookie, like so</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>Set-Cookie: StrictCookie=foo; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; SameSite=Strict
</span></code></pre></div><p>Endpoint <code>/readcookie</code> prints the cookie (if any) attached to the request.
I’ve also set up two “attacking” pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled</a></li>
<li><a href="https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both pages simply consist in a single link to
<code>https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/readcookie</code>.</p>
<p>To fix ideas, here’s what you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to
<a href="https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/setcookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/setcookie</a>.
Doing so will set the <code>Strict</code> cookie in your browser.</li>
<li>Navigate to
<a href="https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled</a>
and follow the link on that page.
Because the site of the attacking URI (<code>jub0bs.github.io</code>)
is different from that of the target URI (<code>jub0bs.com</code>),
the browser does not attach the cookie to the request resulting from
following the link, and no cookie gets printed in the response.
<code>SameSite=Strict</code> works as expected, and the “attack” is foiled.</li>
<li>Now navigate to
<a href="https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/</a>
and follow the link on that page.
Because the site of the …</li></ol></div></div>

<p><strong>Notes Taken: 2021-01-28</strong></p>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0">GOTO 2017 • The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture • Martin Fowler</a></p>
<p>Martin explains there are several different understandings of what Event-Driven Architecture is. All of these are valid but are distinct in their actual form. Martin delves into four of these.</p>
<p>At a high level, there is a difference between events and commands.
Events explain, 'something <strong>has</strong> happened', the receiver is free to ignore the event or do something in response to the event occurring.
Commands explain, 'something <strong>should</strong> happen', the producer of the command has to know what command to issue.
Events and commands are both valid, the disadvantage of commands is that the producer has to know which system wants to react to a command, and the producer must issue the appropriate command - arguably this creates more coupling.</p>
<p>The four patterns of Event-Driven Architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Event Notification</li>
<li>Event Carried State Transfer</li>
<li>Event Sourcing</li>
<li>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pattern-1-event-notification">Pattern 1: Event Notification</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=200s">Timecode - 3:20</a></p>
<p>Martin pictures a system where a user changes their address in the <strong>Customer Management System</strong>, this should cause the&nbsp;<strong>Insurance Quoting System</strong> to calculate a new quote for the customer. In a classic model, the customer management system must call out to the Insurance Quoting System to order a requote. This creates a strong coupling, in particular the Customer Management System is dependent on the Insurance Quoting System. This is likely suboptimal as the Insurance Quoting System is a more specialised and less general system than the Customer Management System; Martin argues dependencies should usually be drawn from specialised systems to more general systems. Instead of calling from the Customer Management System to the Insurance Quoting System, the Customer Management System could publish an event 'CustomerAddressChange' to a queue, and the Insurance Quoting System could listen for these events and requote the customer when it receives the event. This effectively alters a coupling of&nbsp;'<em>Customer Management System -&gt; Insurance Quoting System</em>' into&nbsp;<em>Customer Management System -&gt; Event Queue &lt;- Insurance Quoting System</em>.
This is the most basic of event architectures, it simply alters the way dependencies can be drawn.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-2-event-carried-state-transfer">Pattern 2: Event Carried State Transfer</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=893s">Timecode - 14:53</a></p>
<p>A less common pattern. Built atop Event Notification, when we receive an event, we pull the data from the Customer Management System and store the relevant parts in our own database. This means the Insurance Quoting System can stay available, even when the Customer Management System goes down. The problem is we now have to copies of data so we lose consistency.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-3-event-sourcing">Pattern 3: Event Sourcing</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=1251s">Timecode - 20:51</a></p>
<p>The previous two patterns are largely still CRUD, when we make a change, we save it to a database,&nbsp;<strong>overwriting</strong> the previous value and maybe publishing an event.
Event Sourcing changes this, we both overwrite the current state but we also log an event to an event log.
We now have a system with two forms of state, the <strong>application state</strong> and the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
The application state is the point in time state, which can be recovered from the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
The standard for an event sourcing system, is that at any point in time the application state can be destroyed and we can&nbsp;<strong>reliably recover</strong> from the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
In Event Sourcing, we move from being oriented around application state, with events as an optional extra, to being oriented around a log of all events, with application state derived from that log.</p>
<p>Developers are constantly using an example of an event sourcing program, almost all vcs systems such as git are event sourced.
The current commit/working state is the application state, and branches, commits, etc are all just events in the event log.
For business people, an accounting system makes for a good analogy to an event sourced system.
The current balance of accounts is the application state, but the series of entries in the ledger is the set of events that are used to construct that state.</p>
<p>One great benefit of Event Sourcing is that we can change the models of application state at any time, and fully reconstruct from our event log. Instead of writing database migrations when data models change, like we do in the SQL world, we just change how state is derived from events. We can even test systems in a read only mode against production, by reading the event log to construct a new application state. One key advantage Martin mentions is that Event Sourcing enables a 'Memory Image'. This essentially means that our application state can be completely ephemeral, and in memory; you don't need a database for application state, you only need to read from the event log and construct the application state in memory. This can be very fast and performant. The other benefit of this is that memory is super fast, and you can essentially avoid database calls, whilst having persistence. Martin mentions, think about the opportunities opening up here as we begin to see more and more systems with high amounts of RAM or super fast non-volatile RAM.</p>
<p>There are added complexities. Consider how you can order events reliably. Consider how you ensure transactional guarantees, if you write to the event log, you must also update the application state at the same time. You can't update application state before writing to the event log because then you have a working state that is ahead of the event log state, and remember, the event log state is the source of truth. Event Sourcing systems generally bring asynchrony with them, and this can add quite a bit of complexity. You must also consider consistency, what does it mean to write to the event log, if other systems are going to react to those events, they will not be consistent at the point of time you write to the event log. This is a trade off with all event driven architectures however.</p>
<p>Martin mentions in passing that he is very surprised by how uncommon Event Sourcing is in practice.</p>
<p>Martin brings forward a final and very important consideration when Event Sourcing. We must carefully consider which events are worth storing, and which are not. Suppose there is a service that receives an order to 'buy 15 widgets', the service then creates a transaction that is stored in the application state, this transaction contains additional info like the tax applied and any discounts applied. The service could persist an event with the business logic derived details, such as tax and discounts, or an event that most closely mirrors the input request. The advantage of the former is that the event log contains a more precise record of what was computed at the time the request was received, the advantage with the latter is that it contains only the bare minimum required to recompute the application state, and nothing more. In practice, many systems persist both types of events. Greg Young says that there should be no business logic between your events and your application state.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-4-command-query-responsibility-segregation">Pattern 4: Command Query Responsibility Segregation</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=2611s">Timecode - 43:31</a></p>
<p>Martin warns outright, this is a complex pattern that is more often than not implemented incorrectly, and can cause troubles if so. The idea here is to separate out the write (command) path from the read (query) path of your system. This is particularly useful when you have an application that is read from much more frequently than it is read from, especially if the reads are of a form derived from the write form.</p>

<section id=""><div><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“Bathed in light, the world remains our first and last love.” —Albert Camus</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone writing seriously about utopia in September of 2020 will seem—to be charitable—a little disconnected from reality.</p>
<p>The American West is burning. The Arctic is melting. Populism and authoritarianism are on the rise. Nearly a million people have died from the coronavirus. Economic inequality continues to grow, only accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>If there’s anything like a road to utopia—if we can even begin to entertain such an idea—we don’t seem to be on it. The belief that society’s problems can be solved seems ridiculous when each day brings fresh horrors. Our collective failure to make so much as a dent on climate change, the cancerous spread of polarizing misinformation with its fracturing of society, and the irretrievable damage we are inflicting on the biosphere, only deepen a sense that the best we can hope for now is adaptation and survival in an environment increasingly hostile (physically, psychologically, spiritually) to the individual.</p>
<p>But hope, as “Mad” Max Rockatansky <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaN4sboc7E8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminds us from the other side of collapse</a>, is a mistake, and despair paralyzes. What we need are viable alternatives. Alternatives that go beyond bolt-on fixes to broken systems. Alternatives we can imagine living—and thriving—in. And most importantly, alternatives we can look for in our present and in our past, not in some idealized future.</p>
<p>Utopia is in the air again, though few dare call it by that name. Ideas that would be dismissed just a few short years ago as “utopian”—a word that has been cut down to pejorative status—are entering into the mainstream. Political programs like the Green New Deal promise solutions that could spare us from the worst effects of climate change while stimulating the economy. Universal Basic Income and its brethren suggest how we might mend broken social safety nets and ease economic inequality. But what we lack, and urgently need, is a vision of the world we want to bring into being. That’s all utopianism is: the audacity to imagine the world we want, and then living as though that world were possible.</p>
<p>Metals become malleable when subjected to heat. In higher temperatures, they melt, making it possible to cast existing forms into new shapes. Culture I/O is premised on a belief that under certain conditions, the malleability of our society increases as well. The coming decade, more than any other in recent memory, will be turbulent and heated. In the words of Arundhati Roy: <em>“We can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.”</em> </p>

<li>A society consists of individuals. Only individuals suffer, experience joy, love, longing, pleasure, pain, act with intent, die. They can do so collectively, but always and only as individuals. <strong>In the end, only individuals matter.</strong></li>
<li>This is an ontological position, not a value judgement. A family or society exists only insofar as its individual members exist.</li>
<li>Because of this, we should reject any ideology that stresses the primacy of a group at the expense of individuals.</li>
<li>Similarly, we should reject any ideology that places a system (such as markets) above individuals.</li>
<li>This should not be taken as an endorsement of individualism. Individuals do not exist in isolation. The point is simply that we should always treat individuals as <em>ends</em>, never as <em>means</em>.</li>
<li>Humans are complex, emotional, self-aware animals with a degree of free will—not rational agents, logic machines, or biological algorithms.</li>
<li>Humans are not the only complex, emotional, self-aware animals on this planet.</li>

<ul>
<li>The human brain is the most mysterious and versatile physical structure in the known world. We know more about how the universe came to be than how the brain works.</li>
<li>The nature of the relationship between brain, mind, and consciousness is the greatest scientific question of our time.</li>
<li>Though we are emotional creatures first and foremost, we are wired for reason. Using only his mind and some crude observations, Aristarchus of the Greek island of Samos figured out that the Earth orbits the Sun almost 2,000 years before this became accepted fact. Einstein produced four of his groundbreaking papers in one year spent hunched over a desk in a musty Bern patent office, with reason as his only instrument.</li>
<li>In spite of these impressive abilities, we are extremely susceptible to biases and fallacies in our thinking—and to those who would exploit these biases.</li>
<li>The either/or fallacy is one of the most pernicious of these errors, passed down to us by Aristotle. It suggests that everything must be either this, or that. Good or bad. Nature or nurture. Introvert or extrovert. Liberal or conservative. It is the binary logic of machines applied to an analog world full of semantic nuance, contradiction, and mystery. If we are, on a species-level, in trouble, it is in large part because of our inability to internalize the fact that multiple ideas which seem opposed to each other can simultaneously be true.</li>
<li>This does not mean that truth is relative. It isn’t. Only that out in the world, truth is more complicated than it seems. If we simplify the world in order to function in it, we do so at our peril.</li>

<p><span><em>“The map is not the territory.” —Alfred Korzybski</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Words are not reality—they represent abstractions that allow us to make sense of reality, to think and talk about it.</li>
<li>This is important because it means that words do not and cannot map perfectly to reality, and that different languages—systems of words—can reflect reality in subtly different ways.</li>
<li>Words matter. Words and mind are inextricably linked and together they create the feedback loop that makes reasoning possible.</li>
<li>The abuse of language is a form of psychological abuse. George Orwell memorably took it to task in <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Politics and the English Language</em></a> three quarters of a century ago, but we’ve been at it for much, much longer. What is new is the degree to which words have saturated our lives. Social media and 24 hour news have made it impossible to escape.</li>
<li>Precision and clarity are how we push back against the abuse of language. Because we use words to think, choosing them with care leads to clearer arguments and thoughts. We should always strive to practice good linguistic hygiene, and to use language in good faith—for our own sanity, if nothing else.</li>
<li>Where pushing back is impossible, we must step away. Silence can be a virtue.</li>
<li>The only way to have a productive discussion involving abstractions (democracy, justice, utopia) is to clearly and rigorously define them first. Often we’ll find that the discussion ends up fixating on the definitions of the words themselves. This is a good thing.</li>

<ul>
<li>We are surrounded by and enmeshed in systems.</li>
<li>Thinking in terms of systems helps us to make sense of a chaotic and unpredictable world.</li>
<li>Societies are systems. Culture is a system. Governments, markets, weather, language, and the biosphere are all examples of systems.</li>
<li>Some complex systems are too big and too complicated to think about coherently. We call these types of systems <em><strong>hyperobjects</strong></em>.</li>
<li>Complex systems can be broken down into simpler ones for the purpose of thinking about them.</li>
<li>It’s possible to understand how a system works without being able to make accurate predictions about it. But we should be wary of our tendency to believe that we understand systems which we do not.</li>
<li>It’s impossible to make accurate long-term predictions about most complex systems.</li>
<li>Some systems tend towards stability through self-regulation, while others are inherently unstable.</li>
<li>It’s not necessary to understand how a system works before acting to change it. In fact, history is the story of humans collectively changing or dismantling systems before understanding them—often with serious consequences (like climate). But a system must be understood in order to effectively change it <em>with a specific outcome in mind</em>.</li>
<li>It’s unproductive to approach systems dogmatically. No system is inherently good or bad. But we should evaluate systems, especially those created by humans, based on our convictions about what is desirable and undesirable.</li>
<li>Most complex systems are interwoven with others and cannot be fully understood in isolation.</li>

<h2>In a nutshell<a href="#in-a-nutshell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There exists many Python projects, including some listed below,
whose <strong>primary</strong> goal is to supplement the information
given by Python traceback to make them more useful for <strong>advanced</strong> programmers.
Friendly-traceback is <strong>not</strong> one of these projects.</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be useful for advanced programmers,
it is aimed aimed primarily at beginners and/or at users
who would like to get information about traceback in their own language.
Friendly-traceback can give more detailed information as to
<strong>where</strong> an exception occurred, <strong>what</strong> a given exception means and
<strong>why</strong> it might have occurred (sometimes adding a way to fix it.)</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be used on its own with a specially
designed console, a better option would be to use it together with
GUI-based editors/IDE including Jupyter lab and notebooks.
We explain how to do so later.
For now, we just show one quick example.</p>

<p><em>Parental anxieties can damage kids’ relationship with food</em></p>



<p><em><sub>(The below completed story, assigned to me by <strong>Optimum Wellness</strong>, is posted here with permission from my editor. It’s been held indefinitely as Covid has affected many magazines’ page counts, but I wanted to get it out there as I really enjoyed this one!)</sub> </em></p>







<p>By Sarah Protzman Howlett</p>



<p>As parents, it can be a tall order to foster positive body image and a healthy relationship with food in our kids when both are sore subjects in our own lives. The new book&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parents-Guide-Intuitive-Eating-Healthy/dp/1612439330">A Parent’s Guide to Intuitive Eating</a>” by pediatrician <a href="https://www.doctoryami.com/">Dr. Yami&nbsp;Cazorla-Lancaster</a> helps parents navigate these confusing waters using the principles of intuitive eating, a so-called “anti-diet” that eschews food restrictions. In the book, Dr. Yami outlines five pillars she says will help parents cultivate adventurous, joyful meal times for everyone at the table, no matter what hang-ups lurk in your past.</p>



<p><strong>Honor hunger and satiety</strong></p>



<p>Parents should decide what food to serve and when, Dr. Yami says—and then? <em>Shhhh</em>. “After you’ve presented the food, your job is done,” she says. Steer clear of any goading: <em>Come on, have another bite! Don’t you want more? You didn’t even touch your broccoli. If you want dessert, you have to eat your…</em> are all counterproductive, she says. Instead, let the child know they will never be forced to eat but that they must use manners, perhaps remaining at the table until everyone is done eating. Parents who are fearful their child is too small or too large seem to struggle most with this one, Dr. Yami says: “When a parent is anxious about a kid who is larger or more robust, or is very lean or petite, they’ll start urging a few more bites and so forth,” she says. “In other words, intervening when the child should be using their own intuition.”</p>



<p><strong>Emphasize whole-plant foods</strong></p>



<p>This phrasing intimidates many parents, Dr. Yami says, because it conjures images of salad and little else, when in reality plant-based eating is much broader. Think beyond mere leaves and create meals around the foods kids almost universally love that also happen to be plants: potatoes, corn, fruit, etc. Plant-forward meals decrease the risk of chronic disease and increase longevity, she says, and are packed with fiber and antioxidants. Avoid restrictive diets, especially ones that forbid foods widely considered healthy, she says: “The Paleo diet eliminates beans and whole grains, which are very health promoting and support the gut microbiome,” she says, “and fad diets like Keto can be incredibly dangerous for kids because of the lack of macronutrients. We can have carbs and fat as part of delicious, abundant meals.”</p>



<p><strong>Establish a positive environment</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Yami urges filling your home with health-promoting foods, making sure what’s available matches the messaging: “If you tell your kids to eat fruits and vegetables but there are chips everywhere, you’re not giving the brain and the eyes an opportunity to make those things part of kids’ consciousness,” she says. Further, examine what body-image messages your kids may be absorbing, through TV, social media and films, or hearing talk about dieting or body size—be it yours or someone else’s. “You may be telling your kids ‘all bodies are good bodies’ but have a magazine that says LOSE 10 POUNDS on the cover,” she says. “You put the culture into your child’s brain.”</p>



<p><strong>Be flexible</strong></p>



<p>Parents should feel free to honor the cultural importance of, for instance, cake at birthday parties, candy on Halloween and chocolate bunnies on Easter—again, without additional commentary that can instill guilt. “When they eat their cake, don’t give them the side eye or say something like, ‘I think you’ve had enough,’ ” she says. For older kids, Dr. Yami advises candid conversations about sugar, salt and fat—and how we as humans are naturally driven to eat those things because they taste good. For parents with younger kids, the temptation to forbid sugar can backfire once a child goes to school and sees other kids enjoying such foods in moderation. Denying access to sweets or other foods deemed “bad” can lead kids to hoard food, binge or hide candy wrappers in their pockets, she says.</p>



<div><p><strong>Relax and have fun</strong></p><p>Dr. Yami says too many parents in her practice deal with crushing guilt and shame over any number of parenting issues, but that tensions run highest where food is concerned. “Parents are so anxious, and the dinner table becomes stressful,” she says. “When it comes to food, parents do not need to be saints or be perfect. Their kid is going to be <em>fine</em>. We are not trying to feed them enough broccoli to get into Harvard.” She says that if a parent is getting whole-plant foods into their child’s diet, to not overthink the rest. Pressure and perfectionism zaps all joy from family mealtimes; she says. “Your kids love you, so give yourself space and time to try different things,” she says. “You do not have to get everything right all the time.”</p></div>



<div><p><strong>&gt;&gt; No “bad” foods</strong></p><p>In Dr. Yami’s family, no nosh is forbidden. But this cornerstone of intuitive eating—that no food is banned or off limits—doesn’t ignore the fact that some foods pack more nutrition than others. “I call them ‘health-promoting foods’ and ‘play foods,’ ” she says. “Play foods are fun but are probably more processed, and we won’t eat them all the time.” Regardless of what your kids may hear at school—that certain foods are “good” and others are “bad”—parents who reject this rigid way of thinking about food must say so, and say so often. “You can say, ‘Some foods help us feel better and have more health benefits than other foods, but nothing is off limits,’ ” she says. “That gives kids the ability to keep foods on an even platform.”</p></div>

At Leet Resumes, we write <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">experienced engineers’ resumes for free</a>, so we thought we’d share and compare Google’s advice with our own, show where they mostly line up, and show where your resume needs to appeal to employers beyond Google. Given our focus, we’ll concentrate on how this advice applies to experienced technical or engineering professionals.</p><p>With three exceptions, the Google recruiters’ advice matches up with Leet Resumes’ advice, and I’ll explain why their advice is so very accurate, and also where we differ and why (the Google way is not everybody’s way). Further, we explain our design choices in detail in our <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation%C2%A0">documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/41QpzF22JQx1YWrqtbdI56bA9Tp4VDHJlk6zX3z0Zk1T3PfU-chPyOcDFcCefMOOOIdxjJZOkOktgrpXBtUiitjiiluKsA7BSY0BeOOaccP_D8jWO6hndjFKtUOJDzUojsL0-dCp" alt="Google's resume advice"></p><p>First off, Jeremy and Lizi advise, “Make sure the format is simple and consistent in design, font, sizing, and spacing throughout so that the person reviewing your resume can easily scan and find information quickly.”</p><p>This sounds like obvious advice, but many engineers complicate their resumes with colors, columns, graphics, multiple fonts, font colors, and font sizes, that they put a tremendous burden on the people reading their resumes. Simple is better.</p><p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tv3HpXghtb62OxzGg0kDxdHB9icAzEmefiNvqiu-oRsy-rqXTshmq0a-Bn0L0Ll-mIf-Uxa1EYNyvVHmB2-m0UH-iw3_HaIh_9CNwBbJU-_LWRqK8tuKpdVWcX7Sw98F6Isrndrk" alt="Google's Resume Basics"></p><p>They continue, “Include your contact information and email at the top. You don't have to include objective statements [or] references. Use bullet points with consistent formatting and structure throughout the resume rather than long paragraphs.&nbsp;</p><p>“Keep your resume to… no longer than two pages for engineering roles. And perhaps the most important tip we have overall is to always check for typos.”</p><p>We agree with all of this advice at Leet. Bullet points and quick, scannable text are far superior to long paragraphs. It’s how readers ingest resumes in 2021.</p><p>On resume length, in our <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation%C2%A0">documentation</a>, we advise 1 page for those with 10 years’ or fewer experience, and 2 pages for those with 10 or more years of experience.</p><p>Typos might seem like a small matter, but many engineering managers have learned that engineers who aren’t careful with their resumes, also aren’t careful with their code. Be smart about it and check very carefully.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VFrSANgZ36uEfJ41lzjU8mNBtKwQW9i1lYqONH1QTq51yYw94r6TauDAjsjnJr2QPOZXPeiZTdrHRBrUcjR2NdBvusvD6rDQukbbOElz7FxaIiYwJaMRBtVMIPhZqDEK625_R2hs" alt="Google Resume Basics: Lengths"></p><p>Lizi and Jeremy continue, “It's also critical you list your GitHub profile or other prominent open source work that shows us you're contributing to the open source community, passionate about the work you're doing, and looking to improve your skills.”</p><p>We agree that your Github link should be in your contact information, and that your LinkedIn (which is a subset of your resume info, and therefore extraneous) should not be.</p><p>Jeremy and Lizi further comment that, “Experience should take up the bulk of your resume.”</p><p>Another obvious point, perhaps, but the most popular formats online, including those at the top of Google search results for software engineering resume template, break this good advice. These complex formats often push the experience section into as little as 25% of the available surface area of a resume. Again, simple is better.</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/P5XdrU6yP7ny6VNex_pCz7s3iuLbHuWZFfzvhB9of3mF_LKl9WN4jBKO7wuYoJ8wiMa8KHg8we-irDUWmE0EvBPPCAOZ471Dk7ITzqIttWRxc2n_4J-pZZk0FQcIWNxkXd3h5KVL" alt="Google Resume Advice: Experience"></p><p>The Google duo share: “List everything in reverse chronological order with your most recent experience first. Include your employer, position, and dates employed for all jobs… in the month-year format. Keep your bullet point descriptions concise and clear, and make the most of your space by streamlining bullet points that spill over onto the next line by only one or two words.”</p><p>Again, we agree and the resumes we write for experienced engineers follow these same guidelines. Concise and clear is usually a problem for engineers writing their own resumes, and that’s where Leet can be a big help in cutting out words, phrases, and even whole bullets that don’t advance your story.</p><p>“For each bullet, use action words like created, designed, debugged, negotiated, developed, managed, and so on, so the person reading your resume can easily and quickly understand your skills and experience.”</p><p>At Leet, we go further and suggest that you use success verbs - verbs that show how your work created successes - rather than simply using verbs such as managed or developed, which are more focused on duties and responsibilities instead of outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yXV2gqPytpBnWWAETYkNC0dIysQ4DTUjMzKtasBMyzvIlwAVR_aXM_EVUmNAcLNpXQFJZRlxihRFc91s9HK2o3Zg1exQ9cESP6hEzXFdIUrnSLrggUNPCi74z5QVMTcgJMnU1vHk" alt="null"></p><p>“It's important to focus on the results and impact of your work, so list metrics and examples concisely rather than writing long descriptions. We value data at Google and want to see you know how to apply it when speaking to your accomplishments. Use data and comparisons or averages to provide context.</p><p>“To ensure you focus on results and impact in this section, we recommend using this helpful framework – accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z.”</p><p>Google is exactly right on this advice - use data, numbers, and metrics, to explain your results. Instead of writing that you reduced page load time, write that you reduced page load time from 700 ms to 322 ms. Numbers make your accomplishments seem more real, and are more persuasive.</p><p>Lizi continues, “Let's walk through a few examples for different types of experience.”</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rGmPHOn7Y7NP4NGMbiRYaRw0uhuUtNJ0Pas5lVfhUyu_2jzHHj5g355j45sLsvwepTZRJk52Fb1jIlTfeKxWN0L5g2Uxlfb7TSzSBMR-47glDip-Yn6w-WRp5nKq1C4Fcsb49RTD" alt="Googel Metrics on your resume"></p><p>“If you're applying for technical or engineering roles, this example should be particularly helpful… ‘Increased server query response time by 15% by restructuring API.’</p><p>“This concisely conveys the impact backed up by data and communicates a skill. In this case, it's restructuring an API, but it could be an experience like adding new hardware, algorithmic improvements, caching answers, or implementing machine learning.”</p><p>Three cheers for Google on making this point so effectively.&nbsp; <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume%C2%A0">Your technical resume should include numbers</a>.</p><p>A few more good points from the Google folks before we get into our disagreements.</p><p>“Include any relevant leadership positions, awards, university honors, scholarships, or other types of recognition.”</p><p>Remember, recognition indicates that someone else thought you were good, worthy, and successful. Including these external validations help show that your career progress is already endorsed by others - a good sign for a future boss.</p><p>And they also mention, “If you're applying for technical or engineering roles, be sure to include the programming language you used in bold for each project you include.”</p><p>This is advice unique to Google, and I feel more targeted towards junior engineers, for whom the particular language experience is important in hiring. The further you rise in your engineering career, the more the specifics of language choice and deployment fall away, and the bigger architectural issues come to predominate in any assessment of your capabilities.</p><p>Ok, so we’ve agreed with everything Google has to say, right? They’re flawless, right? Well, not quite. There are a few bits of advice that aren’t effective for candidates who are not applying to Google. Specifically:</p><p>“PDF formatting is preferred.”</p><p>As I’ve shared in my <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/resume-parser-ceos-advice-for-your-resume%C2%A0">mega-interview with the CEOs and technical experts at resume parsing</a> companies, PDFs can sometimes render in a graphical format that evade the comprehension of companies’ HR systems.&nbsp; MS Word, Google Docs, or even .txt should be preferred over PDF.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/h_35s4QCEIIqyHzXasPCxCgdxtH55imC75BRzAa2zNi5pSD7NKiSp_JQA7smxG10Ollge5rr7Gibcckbo6ubCzspbUVqr91HCEq_fGKVRFGxFJsruYYUR66-xqy_2lEzwOoA3-SS" alt="null"></p><p>“List your programming languages at the top of your resume and make sure you're comfortable interviewing in them.”</p><p>In contrast to most other technical resume advice, Google suggests putting your programming languages at the top of your resume. I honestly don’t see how this advice can be realistic for most experienced programmers, and Leet Resumes places your technologies at the bottom of your resume.</p><p>To take just two examples, here are the technologies listed by two Leet Resumes users today:</p><p><u>Example 1</u></p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, Java</p><p>Frameworks/Libraries: Express, NestJS, React, Redux, Cypress, Jest, Selenium, ReactNative, Node.js</p><p><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TypeORM, Mongoose</p><p><strong>Certification:</strong> Certified Scrum Master</p><p><u>Example 2</u></p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, Terraform, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, Bash, CSS</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> AWS Services, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Postgres, Camunda (BPM Engine), Gradle, Maven</p><p><strong>Libraries/Frameworks:</strong> SQLAlchemy, boto3, JUnit, Pytest, Spring/Spring Boot</p><p><strong>Other:</strong> Node.js, SocketCluster, REST APIs, Dreamfactory</p><p>It does not seem possible or realistic that either of these technology professionals could fit their technologies at the top of their resume without breaking the important formatting conventions that both Leet and Google advocate regarding placement of work experience and professional summary.</p><p>And finally, their advice to customize your resume per job simply isn’t accurate, “A big tip here is to read the job description and look at the language it uses. Writing a resume for a specific job description takes a little bit of effort, but it can really help your application stand out. You can even bold and italicize keywords related to the job description to highlight your relevant skills and experience.”</p><p>As with all users, there is a difference between what technical recruiters believe they do, and what they actually do. Given the amount of time spent in reviewing a resume, only the absolutely most relevant keywords are considered - perhaps 2 or 3, sometimes as many as 6.&nbsp; But never, ever dozens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Your Leet resume will list all of the technologies in which you are proficient, and all of your major accomplishments. So if your well-constructed, thorough, thought-through resume doesn’t already have those 2-6 keywords on it, are you really a fit for the job?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s simply unlikely that your primary resume is truly missing a critical keyword that can be added to a secondary resume to catch a recruiter’s eye, and there is therefore no need to customize multiple resumes with keywords.</p><p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this review of the advice Google recruiters have for your technical resume. If you’d like Leet to <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">write your technical resume for free,</a> please sign up.&nbsp; You can also read the stories of other engineers - there’s a reason we can say users love us!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

			<p><b>Scientists from Alfred Wegener Institute: “We need to have a fresh look at the role of the Arctic Ocean.”</b></p>
		

		<p><span>[03. February 2021]&nbsp;</span>
			
			
				<b><p>The Arctic Ocean was covered by up to 900 m thick shelf ice and was filled entirely with freshwater at least twice in the last 150,000 years. This surprising finding, reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature, is the result of long-term research by scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute and the MARUM. With a detailed analysis of the composition of marine deposits, the scientists could demonstrate that the Arctic Ocean as well as the Nordic Seas did not contain sea-salt in at least two glacial periods. Instead, these oceans were filled with large amounts of freshwater under a thick ice sheet. This water could then be released into the North Atlantic in very short periods of time. Such sudden freshwater inputs could explain rapid climate oscillations for which no satisfying explanation had been previously found.</p></b>

			<p>About 60.000 to 70.000 years ago, in a particularly cold part of the last glacial period, large parts of Northern Europe and North America were covered by ice sheets. The European ice sheet spanned a distance of more than 5000 kilometres, from Ireland and Scotland via Scandinavia to the Eastern rim of the Kara Sea (Arctic Ocean). In North America, large parts of what is now known as Canada were buried under two large ice sheets. Greenland and parts of the Bering Sea coastline were glaciated too. What was the ice situation like even further North, in the Arctic Ocean? Was it covered by thick sea-ice, or maybe with the tongues of these vast ice sheets were floating on it, far beyond the North Pole?</p>
<p>Scientific answers to these questions were more or less hypothetical so far. In contrast to deposits on land, where erratic boulders, moraines and glacial valleys are the obvious landmarks of glaciers, only few traces of vast ice shelves had been found so far in the Arctic Ocean. Geoscientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and MARUM Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen have now compiled existing evidence from the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas, and combined it with new data to arrive at a surprising conclusion.</p>
<p>According to their study, the floating parts of the northern ice sheets covered large parts of the Arctic Ocean in the past 150,000 years. Once about 70,000-60,000 years ago and also about 150,000-130,000 years ago. In both periods, freshwater accumulated under the ice, creating a completely fresh Arctic Ocean for thousands of years.</p>

			<p>“These results mean a real change to our understanding of the Arctic Ocean in glacial climates. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a complete freshening of the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas has been considered - happening not just once, but twice,” says the first author, Dr Walter Geibert, geochemist at the Alfred Wegener Institute.</p>

			<h3><span>Thorium is absent in the sediments, so saline water must have been absent</span></h3>
<p>Their finding is based on geological analyses of ten sediment cores from different parts of the Arctic Ocean, Fram Strait and the Nordic Seas. The stacked deposits mirror the climate history of the past glacials. When investigating and comparing the sediment records, the geoscientists found that an important indicator was missing, always in the same two intervals. “In saline sea water, the decay of naturally occurring uranium always results in the production of the isotope thorium-230. This substance accumulates at the sea floor, where it remains detectable for a very long time due to its half-life of 75,000 years,” Walter Geibert explains.</p>
<p>Therefore, geologists often use this thorium-isotope as a natural clock. “Here, its repeated and wide-spread absence is the giveaway that reveals to us what happened. According to our knowledge, the only reasonable explanation for this pattern is that the Arctic Ocean was filled with freshwater twice in its younger history- in frozen and liquid form,” co-author and micropalaeontologist Dr Jutta Wollenburg, also from the AWI, explains. &nbsp;</p>

			<h3><span>A new picture of the Arctic Ocean</span></h3>
<p>How can a large ocean basin, connected by several straits with the North Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, turn entirely fresh? “Such a scenario is perceivable if we realize that in glacial periods, global sea levels were up to 130 m lower than today, and ice masses in the Arctic may have restricted ocean circulation even further,” states co-author Professor Ruediger Stein, geologist at the AWI and the MARUM.</p>
<p>Shallow connections like Bering Strait or the sounds of the Canadian Archipelago were above sea level at the time, cutting off the connection with the Pacific Ocean entirely. In the Nordic Seas, large icebergs or ice sheets extending onto the sea floor restricted the exchange of water masses. The flow of glaciers, ice melt in summer, and rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean kept delivering large amounts of fresh water to the system, at least 1200 cubic kilometres per year. A part of this amount would have been forced via the Nordic Seas through the sparse narrow deeper connections in the Greenland-Scotland Ridge into the North Atlantic, hindering saline water from penetrating further north. This resulted in the freshening of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

			<p>“Once the mechanism of ice barriers failed, heavier saline water could fill the Arctic Ocean again,” Walter Geibert says. “We believe that it could then quickly displace the lighter freshwater, resulting in a sudden discharge of the accumulated amount of freshwater over the shallow southern boundary of the Nordic Seas, the Greenland-Scotland-Ridge, into the North Atlantic.”</p>
<p>A concept that assumes that enormous amounts of freshwater were stored in the Arctic Ocean and available for rapid release would help understanding the connection between a range of past climate fluctuations. It would also offer an explanation for some apparent discrepancies between different ways of reconstructing past sea levels. “The remains of coral reefs have pointed to a somewhat higher sea level in certain cold periods than reconstructions from Antarctic ice cores, or reconstructions from the calcareous shells of small marine organisms, would suggest,” explains Walter Geibert. “If we now accept that freshwater may not only have been stored in solid form on land, but some of it also in liquid form in the ocean, the different sea level reconstructions agree better and we can reconcile the location of the coral reefs with calculations of the freshwater budget.”</p>
<p>Freshwater release from the Arctic Ocean might also serve as an explanation for some abrupt climate change events during the last glacial period. &nbsp;During such events, temperatures in Greenland could rise by 8-10 degree centigrade within a few years, only returning to the original cold glacial temperatures over the course of hundreds or thousands of years. “We see an example here of a past Arctic climate tipping point of the Earth system. Now we need to investigate in more detail how these processes were interconnected, and evaluate how this new concept of the Arctic Ocean helps in closing further gaps in our knowledge, in particular in view of the risks of manmade climate change,” says Walter Geibert.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s evening and I’m listening to some music while I’m casually browsing the web. After a couple of minutes This tweet came about:</p><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Most candidates cannot solve this interview problem:</p><p>🔸 Input: "aaaabbbcca"<br>🔸 Output: [("a", 4), ("b", 3), ("c", 2), ("a", 1)]</p><p>Write a function that converts the input to the output</p><p>I ask it in the screening interview and give it 25 minutes</p><p>How would you solve it?</p></div>— Alexey Grigorev (@Al_Grigor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Al_Grigor/status/1357028887209902088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2021</a></blockquote><p>Since I recently started learning Clojure, and I regularly do 4clojure exercises, this problem seemed intriguing, so I decided to try to solve it immediately. I fired up my REPL, and within several minutes i came up with:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>(</span><span>interleave</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>partition-by</span><span> </span><span>identity</span><span> </span><span>"aaaabbbcca"</span><span>)))</span><span>

</span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>"b"</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span> </span><span>"c"</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Yaay! It works! But it is not exactly what was asked for. Nor is it very ‘clean’, so to say. What bothers me the most in this solution is that i have repetitive code, so I decided to solve that with <code>let</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>partition-by</span><span> </span><span>identity</span><span> </span><span>"aaaabbbcca"</span><span>)]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>interleave</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>))</span><span>

</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Now it’s a little bit better, code-wise, but result is still not exactly right. So I decided to replace <code>interleave</code> with <code>map list</code>, since it gets us to where we need to be:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>partition-by</span><span> </span><span>identity</span><span> </span><span>"aaaabbbcca"</span><span>)]</span><span>

            </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>count</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>((</span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Then I immediately realised, that it can be even better. Instead of repeating <code>map</code> twice in <code>(map str (map first x))</code>, I replaced it with <code>(map (comp str first) x)</code> and it’s little bit cleaner:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2

4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>partition-by</span><span> </span><span>identity</span><span> </span><span>"aaaabbbcca"</span><span>)]</span><span>

              </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>count</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>((</span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>And then i just put everything into a function, since the task was to make a function that can be reused. I was only left with a burden to name this function, which was conveniently named <code>chop-chop</code> :)</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Power cuts have become a common occurrence around here, under the glamorous title of “<a href="https://www.capetown.gov.za/Family%20and%20home/Residential-utility-services/Residential-electricity-services/Load-shedding-and-outages">load-shedding</a>“. The local electrical utility has, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_energy_crisis">some years, and for many historical reasons</a>, experienced periodic trouble meeting the demands placed upon the electricity network. It doesn’t happen all that often, but when it does, my area tends to go dark for about two hours, once or twice a day. This has led to a number of equipment failures; most of my equipment is behind some form of <span>UPS</span>, but most UPSes are designed to bridge less than five minutes of electrical outage, and not two&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>So, I needed something a little more beefy for all my networking and storage equipment. Lockdown&nbsp;project!</p>
<p>After about two months of research (bigger off-the-shelf <span>UPS</span>? Extension packs?), I decided that I could build my own <span>UPS</span> that would last longer and be cheaper than the alternatives available to me. The Tesla Powerwall system has spawned a number of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/nocrf50here">homegrown</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jehugarcia">imitators</a>, and the load-shifting design of the Powerwall met my needs&nbsp;precisely.</p>
<p>Moreover, by building a <span>DC</span> <span>UPS</span>, I could skip the conversion from <span>DC</span> and back to <span>AC</span>, which seems to account for a significant amount of power draw in most off-the-shelf UPSes; since all the essential equipment runs off either 12V (in the case of the network-attached storage/<span>NAS</span> and the network hub) or 24V <span>DC</span> (for the network router), or 5V <span>DC</span> for the Raspberry Pi, there was no need for <span>AC</span> power. The system was originally designed for 12V power, and so I chose a 4S configuration for the batteries, which ended up working well, even with the late addition of 24V output. The necessary&nbsp;components:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lithiumbatterypcb.com/product/4s-or-3s-12v-li-ion-or-lifepo4-battery-smart-bms-with-bluetooth-function-uart-and-rs485-communication-with-60a-to-120a-constant-current/">A battery management system</a> (<span>BMS</span>). This <span>BMS</span> handles the chosen 4S/12V configuration, has very large heat sinks, and is adjustable via Bluetooth. Having an adjustable configuration was important: I wanted to adjust the maximum and minimum battery voltages in order to prolong battery life as long as possible. (I also got the <span>RS485</span> <span>UART</span> adapter, which now reads the <span>BMS</span> state for&nbsp;Prometheus/Grafana.)</li>
<li>An <a href="https://www.communica.co.za/products/psu-swmmc-24v-12-5a"><span>AC</span>/<span>DC</span> adapter</a>, converting from 110/<span>220VAC</span> to <span>24VDC</span>. The one I ended up getting was pretty chunky, accepting a fairly high wattage, and including a fan for when power is drawn. I chose 24V rather than 12V because the LiFePO4 cells operate at 12.7V to 14V, so 14V is needed to ensure that the cells will take power. It was also important to ensure that the adapter couldn’t backfeed into the&nbsp;grid!</li>
<li>2 x <a href="https://www.botshop.co.za/product/300w-step-down-power-module-9a/">9A/300W <span>DC</span> step-down converters</a>, one to convert incoming 24V to a 14V constant charge profile for the battery, and one to regulate outgoing power at a stable 12V for 12V equipment (as the battery voltage could vary between 12.7V for discharged 4S LiFePO4 cells, and 14V for fully charged cells). These were massively overspecced (max current draw by the <span>BMS</span> is 1.2A @ 12V) to ensure good heat&nbsp;performance.</li>
<li>1 x <a href="https://www.botshop.co.za/product/150w-boost-converter-dc-dc-step-up-module/">10A/150W <span>DC</span> step-up converter</a>, to convert from the battery’s 12.7-14V to a stable 24V, for powering 24V equipment. Again, overspecced for those sweet sweet&nbsp;heatsinks.</li>
<li>1 x <a href="http://www.xtcomp.co.za/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=362">3A/5V <span>DC</span>-<span>USB</span> step-down converter</a>. This was to charge cellphones in case of a power cut, but now powers a Raspberry Pi that collects stats from the <span>BMS</span> (and other networking&nbsp;tasks).</li>
<li>Copper wiring, solder, battery cell spacers, wood (for a box — I used meranti, which is sufficiently dense to increase its fire-resistance, at least in theory), connectors, terminal blocks, electrical tape, and other&nbsp;consumables.</li>
<li>And batteries! After much research, I decided to try and find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery">Lithium Ferrite Phosphate</a> (LiFEPO4) cells, which have a similar price point to Lithium Ion cells, but are much safer. They have excellent characteristics for this purpose, most important of which (after safety) is that 4 groups of cells (4S) closely matched my original requirement of a 12V system. I was incredibly lucky to find cells from the wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCehtnVwfWE0_OflP0dCo9pw"><span>DIY</span> Joe</a>, who had bought a large batch for his own&nbsp;projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based mostly on price, I bought 48 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18650">18650</a> 1.5A cells, for a <span>12P4S</span> (each group having 12 cells in parallel, providing 18A, with 4 groups in series) configuration, providing 72A at a nominal 3.3V, for about 230.4Wh. I had measured the power draw of all the devices I planned to run off the <span>UPS</span>, and come up with a maximum draw of 40W. So 230Wh would give me nearly 6 hours of runtime with all devices running at full power (I haven’t done a full load test yet, but in real-world conditions, I’d estimate runtime is closer to <strong>20 hours</strong>). At its worst, load shedding could be 2 hours, 3 times a day, and there is no guarantee that the time between incidents would be sufficient to fully recharge the&nbsp;cells.</p>
<p>I did quite a bit of research into the dynamics of charging LiFePO4 cells; it appears that the best charge profile is to provide constant current (<span>CC</span>) at 18A (the technical term is C/1; C is the amperage of each group of parallel cells, in this case 18A) until the cell group reaches a charge of 3.6V, and then to provide constant voltage (<span>CV</span>) at 3.6V until the battery is pulling C/24 of current, or 0.75A (some sources say you can stuff your cells to the metaphorical gills, until they can’t take more than C/12, or 0.5A, of current; others offer the more conservative cut-off of C/20, or&nbsp;0.9A).</p>
<p>However, I am not trying to saturate my cells: this is a (hopefully) long-lived and large-celled <span>UPS</span>, not a drone that needs as much power as you can cram into it! So I planned to cut off the charge at the relatively conservative 3.5V (I have since reduced this further to 3.45V), and entirely skip the <span>CV</span> step. In principle, increasing the minimum voltage and reducing the maximum voltage should result in vastly increased lifespan for the battery. So I would adjust the minimum voltage (the point at which the <span>BMS</span> refuses to provide any more power from the cells) on the <span>BMS</span> from 2.7V to 3.175V, and decrease the maximum voltage (the charge cutoff) from 3.65V to&nbsp;3.45V.</p>
<p>The rest of the important values work backwards from this: if we want to charge 3.65V at 18A, we need a charger and <span>BMS</span> that can cope with 65.7W; I picked a 300W charger, and a <span>BMS</span> that maxes out at 120A (so about 6.6 times larger than neccessary: the shipping was sufficiently expensive that it made more sense to get the best <span>BMS</span> I&nbsp;could).</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>By early March, I had my cells; I had not yet ordered the <span>BMS</span> or chargers. Of course, at this point, lockdown intervened; I could only order the parts in June! Even if I had ordered in March, it wouldn’t have arrived any sooner than it did, in&nbsp;July.</p>
<p>However, that did at least give me time to unbundle the <span>3P1S</span> units that the batteries arrived in, and repackage them into 4 sets of 12, using battery spacers to keep each set&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>At this stage, I made the biggest mistake of the build: cutting away too much of the existing spot-welded tin strips that connected the three cells together. (Happily by the time I got to the second set of cells, I had learnt my lesson.) Batteries don’t react well to heat, so the best method of wiring up 18650s is to spot weld them with tin strips, which applies a huge amount of heat very quickly. Sadly, I don’t have a spot welder, so it was plain old solder (plus a bit of flux) for me. The remaining tin on the last three sets of batteries was enough to mediate the heat of the solder (and provide a stable base for the solder, so the wires were less likely to disconnect as I progressed and require re-soldering), but the first set, to this day, doesn’t charge quite as well as the other&nbsp;three.</p>

<figcaption>
The repackaged cells; the first set of cells that I opened is on the lower left, and lacks the spot-welded tin on the terminals. I also used red and black insulation tape to mark the positive and negative terminals (as the spacers hide the tiny ridge that is the only other indicator) and to reinforce the existing heat-shrink; the blue insulation tape around the middle of each group (only on the first group in this photo) reinforced the joins on the spacers.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, by mid-June, I was able to place orders for the remaining equipment; most of the items arrived at the end of July. Unfortunately, by this point, I was so eager to get started that photos are few and far in&nbsp;between.</p>
<p>The next step was to wire together the groups of cells into a more permanent 4S configuration. I used fairly thick twisted copper wire as bus bars, with individual strands of copper to each wire, to act as a cheap fuse in case of over-current. (It works quite well; my testing was inadvertent but happily did not set fire to anything, damage any cells, or result in emergency room visits. It also confirmed my fire-proofing safety calculations: well worth the momentary&nbsp;clumsiness!)</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Having wired in the bus bars, I needed to connect the balance cables, which allow the BMs to detect and balance the voltage/charge of each group. Three of the wires go between each group (the white ones), the red and black go at the positive and negative terminal. Since a short-circuit of two 18A cells would be a powerful thing, I added a wooden spacer between the two sets of cells, to ensure that bus bars that should not touch stayed far&nbsp;apart.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Originally, I had arranged the bus bars to ensure that current went in one side (say, top left) and connected to the next cell on the opposite side (bottom right, in this example). This was to ensure that the current went through all the cells approximately&nbsp;evenly.</p>
<p>Later testing suggested that the copper bus bars that I was using weren’t enough to properly balance the batteries (although this may have simply been the use of a single negative wire to the <span>BMS</span>), so I ended up connecting the second row of bus bars, and adding a second set of positive and negative&nbsp;terminals.</p>
<p>In this photo, the terminals have lugs attached; lacking a proper crimping tool for these lugs, I eventually discarded the lugs and switched to using regular terminal blocks, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>About a year ago I quit my job to attempt my startup idea (<a href="https://deadpendency.com/">Deadpendency</a>), writing it in Haskell. One key decision to make was what cloud provider would I go with.</p>

<p>Like many developers, I have a bunch of professional experience developing against Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Haskell community seems to reflect wider industry in that AWS is by far the most popular choice. In fact, myself and a colleague had already managed to get <a href="https://www.rea-group.com/blog/a-haskell-in-prod-journey/">Haskell running in prod on AWS</a> and it was great.</p>

<p>However, I’ve always been in awe of Google products and wanted to try out Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I decided this would be a good opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>tl;dr - Haskell on GCP is great. GCP vs AWS has various trade offs, however I think there are a few reasons why GCP is great for Haskell.</p>

<p>First let’s look at using Haskell on AWS.</p>

<h2 id="aws--haskell">AWS + Haskell</h2>

<h3 id="aws-haskell-library-support">AWS Haskell Library Support</h3>

<p>AWS has the excellent <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka"><code>amazonka</code></a> library developed by Brendan Hay. This is actually a large set of libraries that support the many many AWS services. The bulk of the libraries are generated from AWS service definitions and thus can easily be kept up to date.</p>

<h3 id="aws-docker-options">AWS Docker Options</h3>

<p>Haskell works really well with Docker. You can build executables with <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/haskell/">official Haskell images</a>. Then simply embed them in plain old Debain based containers. AWS has numerous Docker based options and they work great.</p>

<h3 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h3>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> allows you to run a function in the cloud without having to worry about how it is hosted, or how it integrates with other AWS services. With a bit of config you can configure a whole host of integrations or scaling options and AWS will make it happen.</p>

<p>Lambda is somewhat controversial among developers in my experience. It doesn’t always live up to its motto of <code>Run code without thinking about servers or clusters</code>. Nonetheless, I think it does have a good niche and can be very useful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Haskell is not directly supported by Lambda. It does support <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html">custom runtimes</a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hal">there</a> <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/serverless-haskell">are</a> <a href="https://theam.github.io/aws-lambda-haskell-runtime/">tools</a> for using Haskell on Lambda.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I have not actually used these Haskell on Lambda solutions, but I believe they take more manual effort to set up and use. This to my mind takes away a lot of the simplicity benefits of using Lambda.</p>

<h2 id="gcp--haskell">GCP + Haskell</h2>

<h3 id="gcp-haskell-library-support">GCP Haskell Library Support</h3>

<p>Likewise, GCP has the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gogol"><code>gogol</code></a> library developed by Brendan Hay. <code>gogol</code> has the disadvantage that it is a bit less popular (like GCP) than <code>amazonka</code> and is thus a bit less actively maintained. Still, there is nothing preventing you from regenerating the libraries and using them as required. I did this recently to gain support for a new google service.</p>

<p>Overall GCP vs AWS here is mostly moot.</p>

<h3 id="gcp-docker-options">GCP Docker Options</h3>

<p>GCP also has many good solutions with Docker and they work great with Haskell.</p>

<h3 id="google-cloud-run">Google Cloud Run</h3>

<p>The equivalent of AWS Lambda on GCP is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions">cloud functions</a>. Cloud functions has much of the same limitations as Lambda and additionally has no custom runtime concept. Haskell cannot run on cloud functions, so a negative strike there.</p>

<p>However, GCP has another service, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">cloud run</a>, which could be thought of as <code>AWS Lambda for Docker</code> and is a sweet spot for a niche language like Haskell. You use it by providing a docker container that listens on a port for HTTP requests. You can integrate it with other GCP services to automatically make those requests, then your API just needs to decode (with help from <code>gogol</code>) and handle them.</p>

<p>For example in my usage I have a pipeline of cloud run services connected with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">pub sub</a> (similar to AWS kinesis). I do not need any code to have new messages appear as HTTP requests to cloud run.</p>

<p>Additionally, your cloud run services can simply be HTTP APIs, without using any of the integration glue that GCP offers. So it does some of what Lambda does while also being a simple solution to host standalone APIs.</p>

<p>Cloud run is great, especially for niche languages like Haskell. Unlike AWS Lambda Haskell does not become a second class citizen.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-kubernetes">What About Kubernetes?</h4>

<p>Kubernetes sounds cool, but I think it is a complex solution for a complex problem. If you need this complexity Haskell will work nicely, of course. However, I think for most use cases cloud run is the better, simpler choice.</p>

<h3 id="comprehensive-platform-with-vendor-lock-in">Comprehensive Platform (with vendor lock in)</h3>

<p>This one is based on my impressions and I find it hard to include clear examples. Take this with a grain of salt 😉.</p>

<p>GCP more so than AWS seems to focus on fewer, more developed first party products. AWS on the other hand has more products, particularly more managed third party products. As such, on AWS you are probably going to supplement the AWS platform with these third party tools.</p>

<p>Why does this matter to Haskell?</p>

<p>While you are sticking to the core AWS / GCP platform, you know you have excellent library support with <code>amazonka</code> / <code>gogol</code>. When using third party product X, library support can be patchy. GCP helps you avoid this problem with more of a chance of sticking entirely to the GCP platform.</p>

<p>This comes with vendor lock in concerns, but beggars can’t be choosers 😉.</p>

<h3 id="gcp-is-cheap">GCP Is Cheap</h3>

<p>To my mind most Haskell shops are small to medium sized. At this size I think the cost of cloud resources is more of a factor. GCP is cheaper than AWS, particularly for small shops or startups (in my experience).</p>

<p>One reason for this is most of their services include a free tier that you need to exceed before having to pay anything. Cloud run for example, has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing">2 million free requests per month (and other free tier limits you may hit)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="deadpendency-architecture">Deadpendency Architecture</h3>

<p>I am working on chopping out a nice skeleton architecture of how I deploy and use GCP for <a href="https://deadpendency.com/">Deadpendency</a>. I hope this will be valuable to others and lower the barrier of using Haskell on GCP and cloud run. Coming soon™️ 😅.</p>

<h2 id="gcp-downsides">GCP Downsides</h2>

<p>So perhaps at this point you’re really keen to start using Haskell on GCP. There are a couple of downsides to GCP when compared to AWS it is good to be aware of.</p>

<h3 id="deployment-as-code">Deployment As Code</h3>

<p>To me the killer feature of AWS is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation">Cloud Formation</a>. GCP has an equivalent in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager">Cloud Deployment Manager</a>, however it is (or was 1 year ago when I tried it) greatly inferior to cloud formation.</p>

<p>This isn’t the end of the world though. It just means <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">terraform</a> is essential on GCP. Terraform has a learning curve and is another abstraction layer to learn, but does also bring some benefits with the complexity. Additionally, Google and Terraform themselves maintain the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest">terraform google ‘provider’</a> so it is quite high quality and up to date.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-less-popular">It Is Less Popular</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.parkmycloud.com/blog/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-market-share/">GCP is growing faster than AWS</a> in terms of percentage year on year revenue growth. However, <a href="https://www.parkmycloud.com/blog/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-market-share/">AWS is currently 32% of the market, while GCP is only 7%</a>. As Haskellers we know well the costs of using niche languages and products. It is manageable, but you can expect it harder to find answers to your random error message etc.</p>

<p>One nice thing is there are some <a href="https://cloud.google.com/community#home-support">good free channels</a> to get help from GCP employees.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Haskell runs great in Docker and has great library support for AWS and GCP. As such, Haskell can work well on both of them.</p>

<p>However, GCP has a few advantages, in particular cloud run is excellent for hosting APIs or gluing together pipelines with Haskell. I would strongly recommend considering it if you do Haskell, rather than just automatically reaching for AWS 😀.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>tâ€™s 2050 and youâ€™re due for your monthly physical exam. Times have changed, so you no longer have to endure an orifices check, a needle in your vein, and a week of waiting for your blood test results. Instead, the nurse welcomes you with, â€œThe doctor will sniff you now,â€� and takes you into an airtight chamber wired up to a massive computer. As you rest, the volatile molecules you exhale or emit from your body and skin slowly drift into the complex artificial intelligence apparatus, colloquially known as Deep Nose. Behind the scene, Deep Noseâ€™s massive electronic brain starts crunching through the molecules, comparing them to its enormous olfactory database. Once itâ€™s got a noseful, the AI matches your odors to the medical conditions that cause them and generates a printout of your health. Your human doctor goes over the results with you and plans your treatment or adjusts your meds.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s how Alexei Koulakov, a researcher at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cshl.edu/" target="_blank">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a>, who studies how the human olfactory system works, envisions one possible future of our healthcare. A physicist turned neuroscientist, Koulakov is working to understand how humans perceive odors and to classify millions of volatile molecules by their â€œsmellableâ€� properties. He plans to catalogue the existing smells into a comprehensive artificial intelligence network. Once built, Deep Nose will be able to identify the odors of a person or any other olfactory bouquet of interest—for medical or other reasons. â€œIt will be a chip that can diagnose or identify you,â€� Koulakov says. Scent uniquely identifies a person or merchandise, so Deep Nose can also help at the border patrol, sniffing travelers, cargo, or explosives. â€œInstead of presenting passports at the airport, you would just present yourself.â€� And doctorâ€™s visits would become a breeze—literally.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/cshl_767471bfa3f2088e16d8d3594fb77137.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-04 at 2.25.47 AM"><figcaption><span><strong>ODOR &amp; HOOCH: </strong>Peer-reviewed studies show dogs can be trained to detect signature scents of diseases, including cancer and tuberculosis. But in the long run, a â€œsniffingâ€� computer would be more economical and effective. </span><br><span>aswphotos / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure>

<p><span>W</span>hat can oneâ€™s odor tell about oneâ€™s health? Apparently, a lot. â€œThe information that can be picked up from the airborne molecules is amazingly rich,â€� says Dmitry Rinberg, also a former physicist and now a neurobiologist at New York University who collaborates with Koulakov on olfactory research. â€œItâ€™s so informative that you can tell what kind of beer people drank at a bar last night.â€� Odor can reveal other things happening with the body, he adds. â€œSo we are trying to use this information for odor-based diagnostic approaches.â€�</p>
<p>Recent research finds that many diseases, including cancer, tuberculosis, and Parkinsonâ€™s, can manifest themselves through volatile compounds that change the personâ€™s scent. Our bodies release certain metabolites—products of our metabolic activities. Some of these molecules are volatiles and become part of our scent, or â€œodorprint.â€� When we become sick or start developing a disease, our metabolic processes start functioning differently, emitting different volatile molecules or mixtures of them, so our odorprint changes too. â€œThese molecules carry information about our state of health,â€� Koulakov says. For example, patients with Parkinson disease produce an unusually high amount of sebum,<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;a waxy lipid-rich biofluid excreted by the sebaceous glands of the skin, which sensitive noses can detect. Deep Nose could grab this information from the thin air. That could allow physicians to detect disease sooner, easier, and perhaps avoid some invasive diagnostic procedures. â€œIt would essentially revolutionize the diagnostics system,â€� Koulakov says.</p>
<blockquote><em>Deep Nose matches your odors to the medical conditions that cause them.</em></blockquote>
<p>Hippocrates, Galenus, Avicenna, and other physicians of ancient times used their noses as diagnostic tools. A wound with a nasty smell could mean it was infected. And bad breath signaled a host of ailments. Today, however, physicians donâ€™t sniff their patients—because humans generally stink at smelling. In fact, we are worse than our ancestors. Our primate predecessors sported about 850 olfactory receptor types, but we retained only 350 functioning ones, which in various combinations allow us to smell an astronomical amount of odors. (The rest of them simply donâ€™t work. â€œThey are the remnants of our former glory,â€� Koulakov quips.) Meanwhile, dogs have about 850 receptor types and mice about 1,100 or 1,200, so they are capable of discerning a much greater variety of smells—including those produced by the malfunctions of our bodies.
</p>
<p>Scientists now use that animal olfactory wealth to diagnose disease—with some documented success and peer-reviewed studies. Recently, a group of scientists from several research institutions presented their results of training three beagles to sniff patientsâ€™ blood samples and detect lung cancer cells in them with 97 percent accuracy.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;A study published in&nbsp;<em>British Medical Journal</em>&nbsp;stated that dogs were able to detect colorectal cancer by smelling stool.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Another paper in&nbsp;<em>BMC Cancer</em>&nbsp;described dogs smelling out ovarian cancer.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And African giant pouched rats had been taught to work as â€œtuberculosis diagnosticiansâ€� in Sub-Saharan Africa, sniffing sputum samples from patients. Microscope detection accuracy can vary from about 20 to 80 percent. The ratsâ€™ noses helped improve detection by up to 44 percent.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>But animal diagnosticians have their problems. First, they must be trained, and training large numbers of animals that donâ€™t live very long is expensive, time-consuming, and somewhat futile. Plus, every time youâ€™d want to add yet another disease scent to their analytic arsenal, youâ€™d have to train all of them again. â€œThe use of animals for actual diagnostics is very limited,â€� Rinberg says.</p>
<p>That led scientists to ponder the possibility of an electronic nose instead. It would be far more economical to build an artificial sniffer apparatus that wouldnâ€™t die after a few years, with standard software that can be updated regularly across all the board. And thatâ€™s how Koulakov envisions Deep Nose—an electronic olfactory AI that can function as a nose that picks up scents and as a brain that interprets them. That, of course, is no easy feat. Deep Nose is modeled after the neuro-machinery of the human brain, but scientists have yet to figure out how the human brain identifies one scent from another.</p>

<p><span>B</span>iologically, the act of smelling is more complex and less understood than our ability to see. Recognizing a scent is a precise and intricate process in which chemistry, biology, and physics must play together in a synchronized concerto—whether youâ€™re relishing the aroma of a rose or pinching your nose at a pile of dog poop.</p>
<p>Inside your nasal cavity, millions of olfactory neurons are waiting for the next smelly molecule to fly in. These neurons have microscopic finger-like protrusions called cilia, which float in the mucus covering the surface of the nasal epithelium. The neuronsâ€™ other ends, called axons, stretch upward, passing through special passages inside the skull all the way to the brain, leading to the region called the olfactory bulb, named so for its onion-like shape. When molecules fly into our nose, they bind to the cilia, and the neurons send this information to the olfactory bulb, which interprets it, resulting in our sensation of the smell. It would also pass these signals to the olfactory cortex, whose neuro-machinery would determine the quality and the concentration of the smells.</p>

Darker red colors correspond to more activity. </span><br><span>Courtesy of Dr. Hiro Nalkayama, Rinberg Lab, NYU Neuroscience Institute</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some molecules bind to certain receptors but not to others. Depending on the specific combination of receptors the molecules lock onto, we would smell roses or dog poop. But even that seemingly simple molecular handshake remains mysterious. Some scientists believe in the â€œsteric binding theory,â€� which states that the molecules fit receptorsâ€™ distinct physical shapes. Others support the â€œvibrational theoryâ€� that purports that olfactory receptors detect the moleculesâ€™ vibrational frequency and â€œtranslateâ€� them into odors. â€œThe steric theory suggests that there is a binding pocket of a particular shape, and some molecules will fit there, while others may swim away in the mucus,â€� Koulakov says.<br></p>
<p>Regardless of which theory proves correct, Deep Nose builders still face a huge challenge. The nose part, which would mimic the neuronal binding action, will require chemical sensors. These sensors will interact with the flying molecules—whether by binding or a different method—and detect their presence. The sensors will then send electrical signals to the electronic brain—the Deep Nose network that will interpret what molecules have been detected. Koulakov envisions it functioning as a network of multiple layers that will be able to recognize different parts of the molecules and different chemical groups within them—just like different neurons react to the presence of different molecules inside biological brains.</p>
<blockquote><em>Dogs have been taught to smell cancer and rats have been taught to work as â€œtuberculosis diagnosticians.â€�</em></blockquote>
<p>Luckily, researchers can see how that neuronal activity happens inside living brains. Modern technology allows one to peek inside the brain, seeing what olfactory receptors activate in response to what odors. That requires brain surgery and genetic manipulation, so itâ€™s not possible to do in people, but mice and rats can help. Thatâ€™s where Rinbergâ€™s lab comes in. His team uses genetically modified mice whose olfactory neurons are tinted with fluorescent …</p></article></div>

</p></div><h2>Elastic License v2
</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license">Elastic License v2 (ELv2)</a> is a very simple, non-copyleft license, allowing for the right to "use, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works of the software” and has only three high-level limitations. You cannot:
</p><ol><li>Provide the products to others as a managed service&nbsp;</li><li>Circumvent the license key functionality or remove/obscure features protected by license keys&nbsp;</li><li>Remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices</li></ol><p>ELv2 applies to all of Elasticsearch and Kibana. It covers the distribution as well as the source code of all free and paid features.<br></p><p>We share our source code for both free and paid features in the spirit of openness. Unfortunately, our <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">copyrights</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">trademarks</a> have been abused and misused. Our goal with this updated license is to be as permissive as possible while including a minimum set of protections. I hope these protections make sense. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license/faq">See our FAQ</a> for more information about ELv2.
</p><div><p>We created ELv2 to hopefully allow others to adopt it. This is the license we wished was available in 2015 when we were a small company facing <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">misinformation</a>. It incorporates all of our learnings from our experience and others who have made similar changes (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-labs-modules-license-changes/">RedisLabs</a>, <a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2/">TimescaleDB</a>, <a href="https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl">Graylog</a>, etc.). Hopefully we helped a little here. There are many companies out there facing a similar decision. I hope that over time, those of us with similar goals can coalesce around a smaller number of licenses and that ELv2 will be a catalyst for that.</p><p>In that spirit, we worked on ELv2 with <a href="https://heathermeeker.com/about-me/">Heather Meeker</a>, a lawyer who is well known for helping to draft many OSS licenses, including the Mozilla Public License 2.0, as well as helping a number of organizations build similar-in-spirit licenses like the <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license/">Confluent Community License</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">SSPL</a>, and others. We are also reaching out to initiatives like the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/">Polyform Project</a> and <a href="https://faircode.io/">Fair-code</a> as additional efforts to raise awareness of this license and look for ways to promote its wider use.&nbsp;
</p></div><h2>SSPL remains an option for the source code
</h2><div><p>We added <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">SSPL</a>, which is a copyleft license created by <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, as an option to minimize the effect this license change would have on our users. MongoDB is one of the most popular projects out there, used by millions of developers who are happy with SSPL. </p><p>Since we made this announcement, we had many of our users reach out and say that they are thankful we provided this option. Their organizations are already using MongoDB, and this made our license change a non-event for them.</p><p>The SSPL is a licensing option for the source code, as shown below:
</p></div><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd65944c1b54a1e0b/6018987f29a02c49ba1f3e4a/chart-license-update-2021.jpg"></p><p>And to be clear, we are <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/01/20/Righteous-Expedient-Wrong.html">still</a> not claiming that either SSPL or the Elastic License are OSI-approved licenses.
</p><h2>Still no impact to our cloud and on-premises customers&nbsp;
</h2><p>It is important to repeat: there is no impact to any of our Elastic Cloud or self-managed customers. Our customers already use the default distribution under the Elastic License, and their use is governed by the terms of their subscription agreement, which continues to grant them access to additional features, access to support, and other Elastic commitments (for example, IP infringement indemnification) as before.
</p><h2>The path forward
</h2><p>These changes, including making the Elastic License more permissive, are intended to help us focus on building great products and investing in our community. This means building more great features, many of which we will provide for free and which will be developed in the open. But our commitment goes beyond the code. These license changes let us focus on what matters: helping you find success with our products.

<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – February 4th, 2021 – </strong><a href="https://www.cncf.io/">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the graduation of Open Policy Agent (OPA). OPA has demonstrated widespread adoption, an open governance process, feature maturity, and a strong commitment to community, sustainability, and inclusivity to <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">graduate</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">OPA</a> is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack. The project was accepted into the CNCF sandbox in April 2018 and one year later was promoted to incubation. More than 90 individuals from approximately 30 organizations contribute to OPA, and maintainers come from four organizations, including Google, Microsoft, VMware, and Styra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the cloud native ecosystem grows, it’s more important than ever for organizations to have access to policy enforcement tools built for modern cloud native deployments,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Since joining CNCF, OPA has expanded to integrate closer with Kubernetes via the Gatekeeper project but also supports a wide variety of use cases outside of Kubernetes.”</p>



<p>The project has been adopted widely in production by organizations like Goldman Sachs, Netflix, Pinterest, T-Mobile, and <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">many others</a>. According to a <a href="https://blog.openpolicyagent.org/open-policy-agent-survey-summary-spring-2020-adaa46e61f0">recent OPA user survey</a> of more than 150 organizations, 91% indicated they use OPA in some stage of OPA adoption from QA to production. More than half indicated they use OPA for at least two use cases. The most common use cases for OPA are configuration authorization (such as Kubernetes admission control) and API authorization. The project has successfully integrated with several CNCF projects, including Kubernetes, Envoy, CoreDNS, Helm, SPIFFE/SPIRE, and more. It also integrates with Gatekeeper to provide a Kubernetes-native experience for admission policy enforcement and auditing.</p>



<p>“When we started OPA, we knew that policy and authorization were going to become more critical than ever, due to heterogeneous and complex app deployments,” said Torin Sandall, OPA co-founder and VP of Open Source at Styra. “We also knew we’d need the support of the community for integrations, performance, and knowledge-sharing. It’s thanks to this amazing group of folks that OPA today has become a graduated project and the de facto toolset and framework for expressing authorization policy across the stack.”</p>



<p>During its time in the CNCF incubator, OPA underwent two external security audits, the results of which can be found <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf">here </a>and <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/blob/master/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf">here</a>, and OPA completed the SIG-Security <a href="https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/tree/master/assessments/projects/opa">assessment process</a>. The team has defined a <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/SECURITY.md">security vulnerability disclosure process</a> and a security response team, which includes individuals from three current maintainer organizations.</p>



<p>“Thanks to OPA’s streamlined policy language, I can take policies that would otherwise require dozens of lines of code, and instead write them in just five or six lines. This means I was able to—literally overnight—take all of our existing policies and transition them to OPA,” said Joe Searcy, Member of Technical Staff, Distributed Systems at T-Mobile. “OPA policies are significantly faster to create, easier to maintain, and can be applied throughout our stack. We’ve reached the point that anytime, and with any new project, when we think about policy we automatically turn to Open Policy Agent.”</p>



<p>“Extensibility is really important to us, because we knew from the start that we’d be using OPA as part of a larger ecosystem, built into other code,” said Chris Stivers, Principle Engineer, PaaS, at Atlassian. “The community, the integrations, and the performance were what reassured us that OPA would meet our needs at Atlassian.”</p>



<p>To officially graduate from incubating status, the project was certified for <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1768">CII Best Practices Badge</a>, completed security audits and addressed vulnerabilities, defined its own <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md">governance</a>, and adopted the <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">CNCF Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While building Ditto, we've gotten the chance to talk to 200+ teams about what the process of collaborating on copy looks like for them.</p><p>Our key finding? Copy is end-to-end — it exists from the early phases of discovery and design all the way to development.</p><p>This means that working on copy doesn't just involve writers drafting text on their own. It's the back-and-forth between designers and writers about how copy and visuals can work together. It's conversations with PMs to understand the goals of a new feature and what language will help users navigate successfully. It's working with legal to get a particular term approved for use, or talking to brand about how to name a new feature. It's getting copy translated and following up to fix phrases that are too long in another language. It's handing copy off to developers and making sure it gets into production error-free. It's developers sifting through hardcoded strings when copy already in production needs to get updated.</p><p>In other words, the process of getting copy written and in front of users relies on a <em>lot</em> of people.</p><p>On most teams, though, this process is still fragmented and unreliable. And though we're seeing companies realize how impactful copy is on user experience and business goals, most still have a long way to go in embedding copy into their product development workflows.</p><p>In almost all of our conversations, we heard the same challenges come up:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>How do we integrate copy into the design process?</strong></li><li><strong>How do we manage stakeholder feedback and review of copy?</strong></li><li><strong>What's the best way to hand copy off to developers?</strong></li><li><strong>How do we establish lasting copy consistency across our product?</strong></li></ol><p>In this post, we're sharing what we've learned about the state of copy workflows from our conversations: the issues that teams are currently facing and strategies they've come up with for tackling them.</p><p>‍</p><div><p>1. Integrating copy into the design process</p>
</div><p>Copy is as much a part of the user experience as the layout and the visuals. But translating this into your product development process — making sure that copy and visual design evolve together — is tricky. Visuals often get prioritized over copy, and some words inevitably end up getting written last-minute, in a mad dash to replace lingering <em>lorem ipsums.</em></p><p>Part of the reason is that design and copy often don't share a toolset. Designers work in their design tools, but copy can exist in any number of places (think: external copy docs and spreadsheets, design tools, Jira, Slack, email). Between the annotated screenshots being messaged back-and-forth in Slack and copy tables in word documents, copy ends up increasingly detached from its goal of designing for users.<br>‍</p><p><strong>Strategies</strong></p><p>From our conversations, we've learned a few tips for fostering more effective copy-design collaboration:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Think about copy early on.</strong> Copy is an integral part of the user experience and should be part of the decision-making process from the start. This means thinking about copy even when the design problem is still being framed and user goals are still being established. Copy is more than just the words that eventually end up in the design. Understanding what content a user needs to feel reassured or successfully complete a task can inform the structure of a user flow or even highlight UI issues.<br>In practice, this can look like a few different things: Try designing with real content from the very beginning, and consider mapping out the flow and structure of copy <em>before</em> you start on the visuals. If your company has a dedicated content team, make sure they're kept in the loop on upcoming projects, whether that means inviting them to meetings or sending over post-kickoff notes.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Take an overhead view on copy.</strong> As with visual design, successful copy requires thinking about the product as a whole. Consider how the text in one part of the product will interact with copy that already exists elsewhere. Think about how copy for a particular feature fits into the overarching journey of what else a user is reading and experiencing. See if you can reuse copy (more on this below!) to maintain consistency and overall usability across surfaces of the product.</li><li><strong>Make sure the mockups have up-to-date copy.</strong> This ensures that the text and visuals on a design are continuously aligned.</li></ul><p>For teams with dedicated content roles like UX writers and content designers:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Try using collaborative design tools (Figma, Adobe XD, etc.).</strong> Writers will be able to work side-by-side with designers, edit directly in the mockups, try out variations, and view changes in realtime. Just make sure to establish a clear process for how writers should work out of the design files. For example, if a mockup is particularly complex, this could mean creating a separate page in the file just for writers to play around with copy.</li><li><strong>Define a method for giving status updates</strong>. If writers are working directly out of the design file, it can be tricky to know what copy is final and what's not. Try indicating status in the file itself (ex: colored badges), or deciding on one communication tool like Slack.</li><li><strong>Determine what level of content work each project requires.</strong> While copy is important on every project, it'll be more important on some than others. Chances are, content designers will be supporting many teams at once, so prioritization is key. For writers, establish a process for receiving requests for copy help (we've heard Airtable or Google Forms work well!), and feel free to push back on "quick" requests when you don't have the bandwidth. Try building up a database of reusable text (more on this below) so designers can self-serve.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><div><p>2. Managing stakeholder feedback and review</p>
</div><p>Part of what makes collaborating on copy challenging is the number of stakeholders involved — almost every role at a company, from writers and designers to engineers, PMs, and legal, can touch the copy during any one project.</p><p>Compared to traditional content marketing workflows, product copy review is less linear and more iterative, relying on back-and-forth discussions more than explicit approvals. While compliance and brand teams may give one-and-done responses, folks like product owners and engineers are much more likely to give ongoing feedback as the design evolves.</p><p>Even more, every project involves different stakeholders who each have a set of tools they're comfortable with. For every team we talked to, copy review took place in some combination of the following places:</p><ul role="list"><li>Design tools (ex: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Abstract)</li><li>Spreadsheets and documents (ex: Google Sheets, Google Docs, Airtable)</li><li>Communication tools (ex: Slack, email)</li><li>Project management tools (ex: Jira, Trello, Confluence)</li><li>Codebase + code management tools (ex: Github, Bitbucket)</li></ul><p>When some comments are added to Google Docs and others to an email thread, and the copy in mockups differs from that in the spreadsheet, stakeholders don't know where to find the most recent discussions or even version of copy. Tool overload makes it difficult to find alignment and make decisions, ultimately slowing the entire team down.</p><p>Beyond setting up a repeatable process for getting feedback, there are also challenges with getting the right feedback at the right time. Stakeholders (who usually aren't involved from the very beginning of the project) have to get up-to-speed on context — what this copy looks like in the design, where it sits in the UX flow, what the overarching project business and user goals are. Stakeholders also often have the mentality that "anyone can write," which can lead to unsolicited suggestions or unproductive feedback loops.</p><p><strong><br>Strategies</strong></p><p>Here are a few ways we've heard teams combat these issues:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Designate a single source of truth for all the copy in your project, and enforce that!</strong> Make sure it's kept up-to-date with the latest copy so everyone can stay on the same page. Limit all copy-related discussion to this source of truth, and make sure it's easily accessible by stakeholders. It should also allow you to easily track progress, record iterations, and document who's making changes and the rationale behind those decisions.</li><li><strong>Ensure stakeholders get the context they need off-the-bat.</strong> This could mean linking documentation in the request for review, hopping on a brief call to fill them in, or recording a video walkthrough of the flow. Whenever possible, present copy with visual context. It can also be helpful include what stage the copy is at (was it just drafted, or has it already been rewritten and reviewed by three other teams?) so you get the correct level of feedback.</li><li><strong>Build up relationships with stakeholders</strong>. Sync regularly with key stakeholders, and start to understand their challenges and definitions of success. Look for shared goals and opportunities to advocate for copy and its impact on business and user experience across different parts of the company. Whenever possible, measure copy ROI, tie those to business outcomes, and share those wins so stakeholders are more likely to give copy a seat at the table.</li></ul><p>👉 <em>At Ditto, we're helping teams </em><a href="http://bit.ly/ditto-workflow-single-source" target="_blank"><em>create a single source of truth</em></a><em> for all of their product copy.</em></p><p>‍</p><div><p>3.

<![CDATA[Proactive versus Reactive Teams]]>

February 4, 2021 | https://staysaasy.com/management/2021/01/10/proactive-vs-reactive-teams.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://staysaasy.com/management/2021/01/10/proactive-vs-reactive-teams.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most important dimensions on which teams differ is the degree to which they’re proactive vs. reactive.</p>

<p>Proactive teams operate primarily by strategizing, and then methodically executing on their plans. Think of teams such as User Research which conduct research and synthesize it into results, ideally building repeatable frameworks and reusable outputs along the way.</p>

<p>Reactive teams operate by rapidly assessing, deciding, and executing on new needs, typically due to external factors. They often follow playbooks for efficiency purposes, and are skilled at responding rapidly to changing information. They favor quick-thinking and the ability to juggle multiple competing priorities.</p>

<p>At a technology company, Design is the team that I usually think of as the most proactive. There are never really “Design Emergencies,” and even typing that phrase feels weird. Content Marketing is another example – it’s very rare that the business urgently requires a thought leadership piece. On the most reactive end of the spectrum are teams such as Support or Customer Success which need to respond to customers situations. These teams live in reaction-land, and need to quickly think on their feet and contend with unpredictable workloads.</p>

<p>Most teams fall somewhere in the middle. For example, much of the work that a PR team does is proactive, such as placing stories and building industry relationships. But there are also PR emergencies that demand immediate reaction – if your CEO gets indicted, your PR team doesn’t just get to go home at 5pm. Many enterprise SaaS teams such as Revenue Operations also fall in the middle. The day-to-day of a RevOps team consists of many reactive steps to advance ongoing deal cycles, but these teams also do the proactive work of mapping sales territories, setting up Salesforce processes, and more.</p>

<p>The most important factors to consider on the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive spectrum are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reactive work tends to happen right where you make money: making customers happy, selling new deals, or doing damage control (eg, to keep the servers running or combat a PR issue). <em>If you aren’t sufficiently reactive, you will let the business down.</em></li>
  <li>Your ability to scale as a department will largely be driven by proactive steps that you take to add efficiency. <em>If you aren’t sufficiently proactive, you won’t be able to level up and scale.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="should-your-team-be-proactive-or-reactive">Should Your Team Be Proactive or Reactive?</h2>

<p>Given that businesses demand varying levels of reactivity from teams, and that proactively improving processes is how you scale, it’s imperative to know how you should balance your time.</p>

<p>If you’re a Support team and try to dedicate 70% of your Support reps’ time to scaling, you’ll quickly let down your customers. Indexing too hard on proactive work and allowing reactive work to languish leads to the type of leaders who self-brand as “visionaries” with lots of good ideas, but who ultimately fail because they can’t keep the lights on.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your Product Management team spends 70% of its time reacting to the latest customer request, you’ll build a terrible product. This leads to the opposite case – great tactical leaders who get lots of small incremental wins, but who ultimately can’t scale their organizations to the next level of growth because they never identify step-function improvements to their organization.</p>

<p>As a result, the first thing to keep in mind about the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive dimension is that you need to figure out where on the spectrum your team should ideally fall. I’ve made a horrifically ugly graphic below to help illustrate this:</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/proactive_reactive/proactive-reactive.png" alt="The proactive <> reactive spectrum"></p>

<h2 id="establishing-your-spot-on-the-spectrum">Establishing Your Spot on the Spectrum</h2>

<p>Once you know where on the spectrum your team should fall, you need to take practical steps to gain and maintain that position in a scalable way.</p>

<p>For example, product, engineering, and design teams are ideally joined at the hip and operate more like a single function than a set of disparate departments. My favorite example: I view it as one of the key roles of a successful product management function to enable engineering to operate with the right level of proactivity. There are a few ways that this works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By laying out a well-prioritized and explainable roadmap, you buffer engineering and design teams from switching projects all the time when a new customer need or executive opinion arises.</li>
  <li>By working with design to set up a solid product development lifecycle, you prevent engineers from needing to react to changing requirements as features are being built.</li>
  <li>By hiring people with strong communication skills, you can help engineering with communications and more quickly resolve their most painful reactive needs: for example, responding to production incidents or customer questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are a number of different techniques to maintain your desired zone on the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive spectrum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highly reactive teams can add a more proactive muscle by carving out explicit, defensible time for leveling up their operations. For example, establish a single goal per month/quarter (“revamp the performance management and compensation process”) and make sure that you defend this one beachhead vigorously. This proactive time should remain inviolate for everything but the largest emergencies.</li>
  <li>Conversely, proactive teams can use techniques such as on-call rotations to serve as a reactive buffer for an otherwise proactive organization. This prevents ad hoc needs from creating inefficiencies when a team focused on long-term projects constantly has bits and pieces of attention chipped away without a triage process.</li>
  <li>Setting clear expectations can go a long way as well. For example, you should tell a Customer Success Manager, Account Executive, or Site Reliability Engineer that they’ll be expected to work late if an urgent customer issue arises (and of course these teams should be compensated appropriately). By contrast, you should set the expectation with your Product Managers that they can’t react and change course with every new piece of customer feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-spectrum-determines-how-teams-collaborate">The Spectrum Determines How Teams Collaborate</h2>

<p>And finally, once you’ve gotten your own house in order, you should consider the proactive/reactive spectrum in how you work with <em>other</em> teams. Team interactions work best when you understand how other teams operate, and design collaboration accordingly.</p>

<p>The degree to which a team is proactive or reactive will dominate its operating rhythm. For example, if you’re working with a Design team, you should expect them to be highly proactive and have detailed long-term plans. It’s best to get alignment and long-term ownership for what you need done so that they can work it into their multi-quarter or even multi-year vision for the future evolution of your product. Conversely, if you need to work with a Support team, they can probably help you with anything that you need on short notice but will likely not have the ability to commit to multi-year plans the way that a Product or Design team might.</p>

<p>Understanding the dynamics of how teams naturally operate can help big cross-team projects get done more efficiently, which is one of the hardest challenges at a startup. By considering where you need to fall on this spectrum, and defending your place there, you can help your team operate more effectively with minimal drama.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All teams naturally fall on a spectrum of reactive to proactive – you need to understand your position.</li>
  <li>If you’re too reactive, you’ll never level up and scale. If you’re too proactive, you won’t respond sufficiently well to business-critical needs.</li>
  <li>Use techniques like explicit time carve outs (to be more proactive), on-call rotations (to be more reactive), and good expectation setting to defend your spot on the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive continuum.</li>
  <li>For best results, consider other teams’ place on the spectrum when collaborating.</li>
</ul>

The websites capitalize on proper website designs and appearances, making it almost impossible for users to identify them as fake websites.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1" alt="5 Ways To Identify Phishing Or Fake Websites" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=480%2C270&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=133%2C75&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?w=1432&amp;ssl=1 1432w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=480%2C270&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=133%2C75&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?w=1432&amp;ssl=1 1432w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/how-To-Identify-Phishing-Or-Fake-Websites.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Website designers and IT experts have taken a few steps to try and litigate the menaces brought about by fake websites. They have come up with automated detection systems that detect illegitimate websites. </span></p><p><span>However, most of these automated detection systems have proved ineffective as they are susceptible to several obfuscation techniques that fraudsters employ. </span></p><p><span>As a result, the fake website detection capabilities and performances of these systems are highly inefficient. Detecting fake websites, therefore, remains a hornet’s nest yet an achievable endeavor. </span></p><p><span>In this article, I propose some of the five most effective methods that you can use to detect fake websites.</span></p><h2><strong>5 Ways To Identify Phishing Or Fake Websites</strong></h2><h3><b>1. Review the URL</b></h3><p><span>The first vital issue that you should be looking out for in your quest to detect legitimate websites is the website’s address bar. There are several address bar-based features that you should be looking out for. To begin with, the URL of the website. Legitimate website owners will dearly value the security of their clients’ data and will put in place measures to ensure this is achieved. The </span><a href="https://www.cheapsslshop.com/"><span>SSL certificate</span></a><span> ensures that their clients’ communication and servers remain encrypted and out of reach by cybercriminals.</span></p><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?resize=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="Review the URL" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?resize=640%2C400&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>&nbsp;On the other hand, fake websites will not mind their data security and will see no need to install an SSL certificate. The question therefore is: how do you know whether or not a website has the certificate? The answer to that lies in the URL of the website in question. If the website’s address begins with HTTPS, you can be sure that the website is encrypted. If, on the other hand, the URL of the website starts with HTTP, then you have to be wary. You should note that not all HTTP websites are fake, but most of them are. 74% of phishing websites use the HTTPS protocol; this is according to the Research from the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG)</span></p><p><span>Still, on the address bar, you should also check on the availability of a padlock symbol. A secure website will display a small padlock next to the web address. The feature also allows you to find out more details about the website. You can click on the padlock symbol to learn more about the website. The availability of HTTPS does not guarantee that the website is secure and real, but it is a great starting point for detecting a website’s validity.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>2. Check the Reviews</b></h3><p><span>Product reviews and product ratings have proved to be useful tools that support consumer buying decisions. The reviews and ratings are also of great essence to the eCommerce stores as they help them build a reputable and trustworthy brand on the online market. Most reliable and legitimate websites will offer textual reviews of quantitative ratings or a blend of the two.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?resize=640%2C376&amp;ssl=1" alt="Check the Reviews" width="640" height="376" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?resize=640%2C376&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Website reviews are essential information sources to anyone who wants to establish the legitimacy of a website. The reviews are generated by previous clients who have interacted with the websites and know more about the website. Previous clients who have had a wonderful experience with the website will state that in the reviews. Clients who have had a bad experience while interacting with the website will also state that in the reviews. Such a case should be a warning signal that the website could be fake and not what it says.&nbsp; If you meet such reviews, then you better stay safe by not interacting with the website.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It is also worth mentioning that some website owners will manipulate the reviews and customer feedback section so that their website looks legit. If you are not 100% confident with the reviews, then there is no need to share your confidential information with the website. It would help if you also were wary about websites that do not have reviews. There might be a reason as to why the website is hiding the reviews.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Finally, several popular review websites exist that you can visit to find out about the user experiences, scam warnings, and customer service quality. The websites include:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>Tripadvisor</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>Trustpilot</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>Review center</span></li></ul><h3><b>3. Check Content-Type</b></h3><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=640%2C423&amp;ssl=1" alt="Check Content-Type" width="640" height="423" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=640%2C423&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Paying keen attention to how the website content is written could help you detect fake websites. Every computer has a simple dictionary that will help the content creator develop grammatically correct and spelling free content. Additionally, every web browser is built with a spell checker tool; this leaves a website owner without an excuse for creating poorly written content. The presence of errors in content should raise eyebrows. It could be that the content was hastily written with the sole intent of stealing money from unsuspecting website visitors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If a website has grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and broken English, then there are high chances that the website could be fake. No reputable website will ever post poorly written content. A legitimate website will invest heavily in content creation. I advise you not to share your information with a website that has poorly written content. It could be a fake one.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong>4. Use Online Phishing Scanners</strong></h3><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?resize=640%2C371&amp;ssl=1" alt="Use Online Phishing Scanners" width="640" height="371" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?resize=640%2C371&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>There are various phishing detection tools that you can use to detect fake websites. The tools will allow you to scan through a website and determine if the website and its content are genuine. No single tool has been able to give a definitive answer. It is, therefore, important to use multiple tools to build a picture. The tools are explained below.</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><a href="https://support.avg.com/SupportArticleView?l=en&amp;urlname=AVG-Threat-Lab-report-malware"><b>The AVG Threat Labs</b></a><span>–</span> <span>The tool allows you to type in the URL of the website you want to visit. You will then get an instant appraisal of the security of the website. The tool will detect any malware and viruses and report them to you. The presence of malware and viruses is enough to signal that the website could be fake or compromised, and so you should stay away from it.&nbsp;</span></li><li aria-level="1"><a href="https://isithacked.com/"><b>IsItHacked</b></a><span>– This tool will scan a website to detect any possibility that the website might be a phishing threat. It does this by checking the link cloaking, codes, and dubious link formatting. It is hence a great tool that you can use to detect fake websites.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><b>MXToolbox</b><span>– This tool checks various blacklists to identify if a website is in any of them. If the website you are about to visit appears here, then there are high chances that the website has been reported as a phishing or scam website. The best thing to do is to avoid visiting the website.&nbsp;</span></li><li aria-level="1"><b>PhishTank-</b><span> This website contains all the crowdsourced files from the compromised websites on the internet. It also includes a list of websites that have been set up to especially scam and steal information from unsuspecting victims. Once you have submitted a website that you wish to verify, you can track the website through a </span><a href="https://phishtank.com/"><span>PhishTank</span></a><span> account.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h3><b>5. Check the Terms and Condition of the Website</b></h3><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" alt="Check the Terms and Condition of the Website" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Most genuine websites will have real <a href="https://secureblitz.com/how-to-patiently-read-terms-and-conditions-agreement/">terms and conditions</a>. For instance, a legitimate eCommerce website will have a generous refund policy. If a website offers products, yet you cannot find its terms and conditions section, it is possible that the website cannot be trusted. If the eCommerce store explicitly excludes any possibility of a product refund, then you better not engage with such a website. You should also check the warranties for the commodities sold by the merchant. If there are no warranties provided, then there is a chance that the website is selling counterfeit products.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p><span>The number of fake websites and phishing websites has skyrocketed, especially in recent times.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a few last years I’ve been learning programming in various languages, on and off, with more or less success. Some languages that I’ve tried include Python, Java, Haskell and even JavaScript. And of course Clojure. But it has been going slowly, not because those languages (or programming in general) are hard. It’s because I lacked consistency in doing things on regular basis due to lack of time and energy; I’ve often been mentally exhausted at my regular IT work. Here’s how I finally managed to organize myself and actually started getting it!</p><h3 id="ancient-history">Ancient history</h3><p>I’ve been interested in computers for most of my life. It can be shortly described as ‘power user’ e.g. <em>system configuration, setup, various audio/video editing tools…</em>, but I’ve never really took up programming until 2017. (You can read about my contemporary views <a href="https://savo.rocks/posts/an-unexpected-toolbox-for-a-beginner-programmer/" target="_blank">here</a>). Back then I managed to learn some Python syntax, but it all came down to following the materials I have been learning from, and I gave up after some time. In the meantime I have been dabbling with various languages and technologies, but never crossed the chasm to serious work beyond tutorials and books.</p><h3 id="recent-development">Recent development</h3><p>When I wasn’t trying to learn programming I was playing guitar with various bands I had and worked in several companies on various positions in IT departments. Those positions included various tasks such as system administration &amp; maintenance, vendor coordination and even IT support call-center coordination. During that time I still managed to dabble with programming irregularly, mostly with Clojure because I liked how it doesn’t get in my way. It can be set up almost instantly and the syntax is very minimal, which lets me concentrate on shaping my ideas into code. But very often the workload was big enough to keep me from programming constantly, so I didn’t get very far. However, recently I decided to concentrate on programming, as I realized that it brings me much joy, even when I am completely lost in the process, because when I overcome obstacles it feels phenomenal.</p><h3 id="current-situation">Current situation</h3><p>I discovered a one-step-beyond-basics book that suits my needs perfectly: <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dswdcloj3" target="_blank">Web Development with Clojure</a> and bought a copy. I’m getting serious now :) Currently, the book is in beta, but it is expected to be finished very soon. This book shows in detail how to build modern web applications using various Clojure libraries. Clojure is different from other languages in that matter: it doesn’t have a <em>web-app framework</em>. Instead, the programmers combines various libraries which suit their particular needs.</p><h3 id="the-approach">The approach</h3><p>So, how is this time different than any other when I tried to learn programming? Read on.<br></p><ul><li>Walk the unwalked path: This time, instead of just following the book, I decided to explore the documentation of libraries that were introduced, and to try to experiment with them myself. There are often multiple libraries that serve the same purpose, and the author is kind enough to mention them in his book. One such example is two libraries for HTML templating: <a href="https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer" target="_blank">Selmer</a> which uses Django-like syntax, and <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup" target="_blank">Hiccup</a> which converts Clojure vectors to html, so <code>[:h1 "Hello There"]</code> becomes <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello There&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. Hiccup-way seemed more attractive to me, so I decided to write the whole template in in, and I have learned more doing that, than I have ever learned following book-code. I was forced to try various approaches out, read the documentation, ask around online for solutions and in the end I felt I understand what I wrote much better.</li><li>Do things regularly: There is a wise saying which goes something like: <em>it is better to perform average every day, than to be excellent once in a while</em>. OK, it probably sounds better than I wrote it, but the point is there. I try to follow it, and to program every day for 6-8 hours. I realized that sometimes can be difficult to even start, so I start my programming day by doing <u>one</u> <a href="https://www.4clojure.com/" target="_blank">4clojure</a> exercise per day. This helps me to get <em>warmed-up</em> as I can start solving the problem immediately, because the tasks usually require just using the right Clojure function (or combination of functions), so I make sure to search this awesome <a href="https://jafingerhut.github.io/cheatsheet/clojuredocs/cheatsheet-tiptip-cdocs-summary.html" target="_blank">Clojure Cheatsheet</a> for the functions that I’ll use, and usually manage to find them. After that I just open my project, the book and code away!</li><li>Revisit previous chapters: I like to come back a little after some time to re-read previous materials to see if I’ll have new insight and maybe notice something that I missed the first time when I read the chapter. Usually there are <em>a-ha</em> moments, and makes this part very valuable in the process.</li></ul><p>The book guides reader through building a microblogging platform, kind of like a social network, where multiple users can have their message boards and interact with each other, have their feeds, etc. The first few chapters deal with crash-course setting up a page where all the messages are displayed (no multiple users), and the form for entering a message is present, then it moves on to teach about core components of a web app (creating web server, request routing, handling, middleware…), another chapter deals with what <a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> templating library provides, then it moves on to using ClojureScript for SPA approach, which teaches very powerful and modern concepts. I decided to build something like a <em>beer-log</em> application, where I will keep track of craft beers that I’ve tried. I wanted to do something different, rather than following book paren-for-paren. Who knows, maybe my beer app will someday be good as, I don’t know, <a href="https://untappd.com/" target="_blank">Untappd</a> maybe?</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Takeaway Tuesday</strong> on <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3iNJMXP">On Old Age</a></strong> (De Senectute) by <strong><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/cicero-everitt/">Cicero</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cicero">Marcus Tullius Cicero</a></strong>&nbsp;was a Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and writer who tried to uphold republican principles in the final civil wars that destroyed the Roman Republic. His writings include books on rhetoric, orations, philosophical and political treatises, and letters. He is remembered in modern times as the greatest Roman orator.</p><h2>1. Old age is not unique in being burdensome…</h2><blockquote><p>I think, my friends, that you marvel at a thing really far from difficult. <strong>For to those who have not the means within themselves of a virtuous and happy life every age is burdensome</strong>; and, on the other hand, to those who seek all good from themselves nothing can seem evil that the laws of nature inevitably impose. <strong>To this class old age especially belongs, which all men wish to attain and yet reproach when attained; such is the inconsistency and perversity of Folly!</strong></p><p>They say that it stole upon them faster than they had expected. In the first place, who has forced them to form a mistaken judgement? For how much more rapidly does old age steal upon youth than youth upon childhood? And again, how much less burdensome would old age be to them if they were in their eight hundredth rather than in their eightieth year? <strong>In fact, no lapse of time, however long, once it had slipped away, could solace or soothe a foolish old age</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>2. … but it is only praiseworthy if the life preceding it was well spent…</h2><blockquote><p>But bear well in mind that in this entire discussion <strong>I am praising that old age which has its foundation well laid in youth</strong>. Hence it follows— as I once said with the approval of all who heard it— that that old age is wretched which needs to defend itself with words! Nor can wrinkles and grey hair suddenly seize upon influence; <strong>but when the preceding part of life has been nobly spent, old age gathers the fruits of influence at the last</strong>.</p><p>For if the ills of which they complained were the faults of old age, the same ills would befall me and all other old men; but I have known many who were of such a nature that they bore their old age without complaint, who were not unhappy because they had been loosed from the chains of passion, and who were not scorned by their friends. <strong>But as regards all such complaints, the blame rests with character, not with age.</strong> For old men of self-control, who are neither churlish nor ungracious, find old age endurable; while <strong>on the other hand <a href="https://butwhatfor.substack.com/p/invert-always-invert-avoid-failure">perversity and an unkindly disposition render irksome every period of life</a></strong>…</p><p>Undoubtedly, Scipio and Laelius, <strong>the most suitable defenses of old age are the principles and practice of the virtues</strong>, which, if cultivated in every period of life, bring forth wonderful fruits at the close of a long and busy career, not only because they never fail you even at the very end of life—although that is a matter of highest moment—but also <strong>because it is most delightful to have the consciousness of a life well spent and the memory of many deeds worthily performed</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>3. … and the mind and body sufficiently prepared.</h2><blockquote><p><strong>But it is our duty, my young friends, to resist old age</strong>; to compensate for its defects by a watchful care; to fight against it as we would fight against disease; to adopt a regimen of health; to practice moderate exercise; and to take just enough of food and drink to restore our strength and not to overburden it. Nor, indeed, are we to give our attention solely to the body; <strong>much greater care is due to the mind and soul; for they, too, like lamps, grow dim with time, unless we keep them supplied with oil. </strong></p><p>For when Caecilius speaks of " the old fools of the comic stage," he has in mind old men characterized by credulity, forgetfulness, and carelessness, which are faults, not of old age generally, but only of an old age that is drowsy, slothful, and inert. </p></blockquote><h2>4. If prepared in this way, old age contributes more to the world that it’s youth.</h2><blockquote><p>Those, therefore, who allege that old age is devoid of useful activity adduce nothing to the purpose, and are like those who would say that the pilot does nothing in the sailing of the ship, because, while others are climbing the masts, or running about the gangways, or working at the pumps, he sits quietly in the stern and simply holds the tiller. </p><p>He may not be doing what younger members of the crew are doing, but what he does is better and much more important. <strong><a href="https://medium.com/butwhatfor/perseverance-is-great-but-dont-forget-to-prepare-ea8d5fe7e6fb">It is not by muscle, speed, or physical dexterity that great things are achieved, but by reflection, force of character, and judgement</a></strong>; in these qualities old age is usually not only not poorer but is even richer.</p></blockquote><h2>5. Old age should not fear the nearness of death as it is not unique to old age…</h2><blockquote><p><strong>And yet is there anyone so foolish, even though he is young, as to feel absolutely sure that he will be alive when evening comes</strong>? Nay, even youth, much more than old age, is subject to the accident of death; the young fall sick more easily, their sufferings are more intense, and they are cured with greater difficulty. </p><p>Therefore, <strong>few arrive at old age</strong>, and, but for this, life would be lived in better and wiser fashion. For it is in old men that reason and good judgement are found, and had it not been for old men no state would have existed at all.</p><p>But I return to the question of impending death. <strong>What fault is this which you charge against old age, when, as you see, it is one chargeable likewise to youth? </strong>That death is common to every age has been brought home to me by the loss of my dearest son.</p><p>They say, also, that the old man has nothing even to hope for. <strong>Yet he is in better case than the young man</strong>, since what the latter merely hopes for, the former has already attained; <strong>the one wishes to live long, the other has lived long</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>6. … and a life well lived lives well beyond its own years…</h2><blockquote><p>The actor, for instance, to please his audience need not appear in every act to the very end; it is enough if he is approved in the parts in which he plays; and so <strong><a href="https://butwhatfor.substack.com/p/takeaway-tuesday-knowing-history">it is not necessary for the wise man to stay on this mortal stage to the last fall of the curtain</a></strong>. For even if the allotted space of life be short, it is long enough in which to live honorably and well; but if a longer period of years should be granted, one has no more cause to grieve than the farmers have that the pleasant springtime has passed and that summer and autumn have come. </p><p>Would it not have been far better for me to spend a leisured and quiet life, free from toil and strife? <strong>But somehow, my soul was ever on the alert, looking forward to posterity, as if it realized that when it had departed from this life, then at last would it be alive</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>7. … with nothing to regret when its course has been run.</h2><blockquote><p><strong>For what advantage has life—or, rather, what trouble does it not have?</strong> But even grant that it has great advantage, yet undoubtedly it has either satiety or an end. I do not mean to complain of life as many men, and they learned ones, have often done; <strong>nor do I regret that I have lived, since I have so lived that I think I was not born in vain</strong>, and I quit life as if it were an inn, not a home. For Nature has given us an hostelry in which to sojourn, not to abide.</p><p><strong>For as Nature has marked the bounds of everything else, so she has marked the bounds of life</strong>. Moreover, old age is the final scene, as it were, in life’s drama, from which we ought to escape when it grows wearisome, and certainly, when we have had our fill. </p><p>Such, my friends, are my views on old age. <strong>May you both attain it, and thus be able to prove by experience the truth of what you have heard from me</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/">But What For?</a></strong> - Multidisciplinary insights for self development.

      <article>
      

<p>Let me ask you a question: How much value do you think your source code has?</p>

<p>To answer this question, let me take you a few years back, when I worked with a small high tech startup. We were working on a pretty complex augmented reality system spanning all layers from low-level computer vision components to cross-platform mobile and web apps. Especially for the lower-level components, a good amount of research had been involved. We worked closely with an academic institute that specialized in computer vision.</p>

<p>In short, this project wasn’t something that anybody could just easily recreate. So one of the assumptions we had implicitly made was that our source code was one of the company’s major assets.</p>

<p>When we hired a new COO, who had mainly worked at bigger companies before, he was shocked to hear that all our code, communication infrastructure and internal systems were living in the cloud. He argued that we should move to on-premise solutions as soon as possible, partially out of fear of intellectual property theft, partially to appease investors with similar fears.</p>

<p>While I had no say in it, his arguments seemed somewhat unreasonable to me at the time and I couldn’t put my finger on it. But the CTO was on board. So we installed a cheapo server in one of our office’s closets, even though someone had just broken into our building earlier that month. We got rid of GitLab, and moved away from Slack and Trello in favor of an on-prem Jira installation. The whole ordeal took months to complete, and I’m guessing that all things considered, it cost the small company of ~6 people about half a year of development time. There was also the ongoing opportunity cost of no longer being able to use any new tools that involved the cloud.</p>

<p>But the whole thing got me thinking about an interesting question: What would happen if someone just took all our code? Going even further, what would happen if we ourselves just put it all on GitHub, with a permissive license like MIT? Short of making investors think we’re crazy, what direct impact would that have had on the company?</p>

<p>I thought long and hard about these questions, and I think in our situation back then, the answer would have been: absolutely none.</p>

<h2 id="your-source-code-is-worthless">Your source code is worthless</h2>

<p>Let’s face it, we were still a fast-moving startup, even if the above anecdote might give you the opposite picture. Our code was still changing drastically every couple weeks. Changes of the entire architecture or complete re-writes of components were not uncommon, as is usual for some early stage startups. And as you might expect in such a situation, the code wasn’t of the highest quality either: Half the time, the build would be broken. Testing and documentation were basically non-existent. It was unlikely that anyone from outside the team would even have gotten the thing up and running. Even if they did, it would be outdated a moment later.</p>

<p>One of the fears from management was that a big company like Google could take our code and build a competing service. After thinking about this in more detail, the idea now seems laughable to me: They would be much faster just building it themselves from scratch, than trying to understand the crummy code we had hacked together.</p>

<p>But let’s take a step back and assume the opposite for a moment: Beautifully written, clean code with complete test coverage. One-click build process. Exceptionally well-written documentation of the architecture and components. Would this have changed the situation? I really don’t think it would have.</p>

<p>You see, in 2017, there actually was an incident of a high profile source code theft: Panic, a company that makes high quality Mac and iOS software, had the full source code for most of their apps <a href="https://panic.com/blog/stolen-source-code" target="_blank">stolen by hackers</a>. While the attackers demanded a ransom to prevent the public release of the code, Panic refused to pay. They came to the conclusion that the worst thing that could happen would be people building cracked versions of their Apps, full of malware. But that was already happening anyways (as with most software), even before the source code was stolen. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure this was a pretty bad blow for Panic, and I’m in no way arguing that source code theft can’t be damaging. But even Panic says in their blog post that they were not too concerned with competitors using their code either, mainly because it would quickly become outdated:</p>

<p><em>“That source is already missing a ton of fixes and improvements we committed over the last week alone, and six months from now it will be missing major critical new features. In short: it’s old and getting older.”</em></p>

<p>So maybe code by itself is not that valuable, and yet, software companies still have value. If the tangible aspects of the technology, the code and documentation, are not the main assets of a company, what is?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-programming">What is programming</h3>

<p>I couldn’t really wrap my head around the previous question until I stumbled upon a wonderful article, <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf" target="_blank">Programming as Theory Building</a>, written by none other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award" target="_blank">Turing Award</a> winner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur" target="_blank">Peter Naur</a>. If you’ve ever taken any formal computer science classes, you may have already heard his name: He’s the N in BNF, or Backus-Naur form, an important and widely-used notation for describing programming languages.</p>

<p>In the article, Naur describes his view of what programming really is. He argues that the main activity a programmer does is building a theory or model of the problem space in their head:</p>

<p><em>“[…] programming properly should be regarded as an activity by which the programmers form or achieve a certain kind of insight, a theory, of the matters at hand.”</em></p>

<p>He calls this view of programming the <em>“Theory Building View”</em> and puts it in contrast to what he calls the <em>“Production View”</em>, in which <em>“[…] programming is regarded as a production of a program and certain other texts.”</em></p>

<p>Naur argues that the production view, while it is widespread, contradicts many things we observe empirically in software projects. In contrast, the Theory Building View allows us to explain many phenomena, such as the observation I made in this article, that the source code itself holds little to no value.<sup id="fnref:naurwasfaster"><a href="#fn:naurwasfaster">1</a></sup> One of Naur’s main conclusions is that making changes to an existing program (to accommodate changing requirements) is often more costly than writing new code from scratch, at least if done by people from a different team. This is because there are intangible aspects of the model/theory in the programmer’s heads, which can’t be expressed in code and documentation:</p>

<p><em>“A main claim of the Theory Building View of programming is that an essential part of any program, the theory of it, is something that could not be conceivably expressed, but is inextricably bound to human beings.”</em></p>

<p>When a new team obtains the source code, they thus have to first re-build the original theory in their heads, which, Naur argues, can be more work than building their own theory from the ground up.</p>

<p>Naur brings multiple examples of real life product development where teams were asked to modify or extend a program, but couldn’t do it without help from the original development team, or otherwise they would be <em>“destroying its power and simplicity”</em>:</p>

<p><em>“[…] the program text and its documentation has proved insufficient as a carrier of some of the most important design ideas.”</em></p>

<p>Naur further says:</p>

<p><em>“The conclusion seems inescapable that at least with certain kinds of large programs, the continued adaptation, modification, and correction of errors in them, is essentially dependent on a certain kind of knowledge possessed by a group of programmers who are closely and continuously connected with them.”</em></p>

<p>Since this knowledge is inherently intangible, it can’t be communicated through the code or documentation - it has to be experienced anew by each new programmer joining the team. While the previous programmers can help new team members in this task, the code itself and any written documentation is not very useful in this process. What are these intangible elements/aspects?</p>

<h3 id="intangible-aspects-of-software">Intangible aspects of software</h3>

<p>According to Naur, there are three aspects that are difficult or impossible to express in any written form of code or documentation, and yet the original programmer can easily explain them:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> The programmer knows and understands the relationship of the real world problem and the program. They can explain how the details of the problem are mapped into the code and into additional documentation:
<em>“Thus the programmer must be able to explain, for each part of the program text and for each of its overall structural characteristics, what aspect or activity of the world is matched by it.”</em></p>

<p>While I think it’s possible in theory to make this knowledge more tangible through documentation, doing so exhaustively would be wholly impractical. And yet, Naur notes, an exhaustive understanding of the real world problem is necessary to understand the theory of the program:</p>

<p><em>“By far the largest part of the world will of course lie outside the scope of the program text, being irrelevant in the context. However, the decision that a part of the world is relevant can only be made by someone who understands the whole world. This understanding must be contributed by the programmer.”</em></p>

<p>Let me give you an example from my own experience. A few years back, I was working on a project that improved the processes of a production line in a factory. The workers there were still using paper checklists for quality assurance, making the process labor-intense and error prone. We replaced those paper checklists with a mobile app that runs on a tablet. While the app itself was fairly simple, the underlying business processes were complex - multiple different assembly lines and a variety of different machines were …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>At <a href="https://www.escrypt.com/en" rel="noopener">ESCRYPT</a>, we basically design, enable and manage IT security. As security consultants, we are specialized in security strategy, trainings and a variety of other fields within the automotive software domain. We consider ourselves experts in all kinds of testing methods, including functional testing, vulnerability scans, penetration testing, everything from automated testing to manual testing, and of course fuzzing.</p>
<p>In our testing efforts, we like to take a holistic approach, which means that we test electronic control units individually, but also the entire vehicle platform. Our goal is basically to secure the whole ecosystem of a connected car.</p>

<p><em>“In a connected world, cybersecurity is as important for your safety as the brakes” </em><em>– </em>Ralf Speth, CEO Jaguar/Land Rover</p>

<p>When I started with automotive security, we were securing all electronic control units (ECUs) individually. Since then, the complexity and connectivity of vehicles have increased dramatically, creating more opportunities for potential attackers to infiltrate those systems. This change requires a completely different approach and a new set of security skills. To sum up the key developments I have witnessed during my career, I have summarized 5 uncomfortable truths about automotive cybersecurity:</p>

<h2><strong>1. The Titanic Syndrome</strong></h2>
<p>In 2023, there will be 775.000.000 connected cars worldwide. The titanic syndrome states that those who put themselves in danger, will perish. In the development of increasingly software-driven connected vehicles, this means that those car manufacturers (OEMs) who don’t have a security strategy will not survive, as security can be seen as an indispensable foundation of interconnectivity.</p>
<p>However, the main challenge is that security vulnerabilities only become visible to the public when it's already too late. Customers usually don't notice when security is cut for profits (until their car fails them). And this is why there are still so many managers who see security primarily as a cost driver.<span></span></p>
<h3><span>What can you do?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Treat security as a strategic task</li>
<li>Create security awareness throughout the entire company</li>
<li>Enable security orchestration of the whole software development lifecycle</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>2. No Safety without Security</strong></h2>
<p>Cyberattacks on vehicles have increased by a factor of seven over the last four years. Even if only a small number of those attacks are successful, the consequences can be devastating, especially as they are a potential threat to an entire fleet of vehicles.<span></span></p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use original equipment from trusted partners</li>
<li>Consider security during the entire lifecycle</li>
<li>Enable your team (IDS, SOC, Firewall)</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>3. 100% Security is not affordable</strong></h2>
<p>There are 100 million lines of code (LoC) in the new Golf 8. For comparison, in a Boeing 787 there are only 14 Million LoC! Even if your team has an excellent bug detection rate, you will still, almost certainly, miss some bugs or vulnerabilities. The challenge here is balancing the risk and the investment, meaning that you will have to decide how much risk you are willing to take.</p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Segment your car and define safety critical parts</li>
<li>Prioritize your security activities in the important fields<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>Build resilient systems</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>4. Omnipresent Threat</strong></h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Publications/SecuritySituation/SecuritySituation_node.html" rel="noopener">German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)</a>, each day there are 322,000 new malware threats. <span><span>If you don't find those vulnerabilities first, someone else will exploit them. </span></span>The complexity of our systems is increasing dramatically. Since vehicles have quite a long lifecycle, the software complexity will increase even further while the car is on the road. This means that you will need to put in some extra effort to keep your car secure in the long run.</p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Find the right strategy from the beginning</li>
<li>Protect all connected entities</li>
<li>Ensure long-term security&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>5. Impending Sanctions</strong></h2>
<p>It's important to comply with new regulations such as the new<a href="https://www.escrypt.com/sites/default/files/2020-07/ECE-TRANS-WP29-2020-079-Revised-2.pdf" rel="noopener"> UNECE regulations</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/iso-21434-compliance"><span>ISO 21434. </span></a>Even if these norms aren't mandatory yet, OEMs who do not follow the rules will soon be disqualified. As if automotive software wasn’t complicated enough, these norms and regulations increase the complexity even further, which is why many developers perceive them as additional requirements.</p>
<p>Don’t get this wrong, regulations are very important to facilitate the use of effective security measures, but in some cases, they can lead to over-regulation. This means that complying with norms and standards becomes more important than the actual task at hand. Regulations certainly create pressure within the industry, but they can also be an opportunity, for example to convince the upper management to reassess their priorities. Security must come first!</p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire legal experts</li>
<li>Implement standard-compliant security design</li>
<li>Implement a Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“Security is not a product, but a process” - </em>Bruce Schneier, Cryptographer &amp; Security Expert</p>

<p>I'm glad to see that testing methods such as <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/the-magic-behind-feedback-based-fuzzing" rel="noopener">feedback-based fuzzing</a> are emerging as a new standard in the automotive sector. Nevertheless, we need to think about automotive security in a much broader way. The security perspective has to be kept in mind during the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). This includes the management of processes, security strategy and company culture.</p>

		<p>Gasoline and diesel engines, which are powered by fossil fuels, will soon be sidelined by climate change. Instead, new propulsion systems will be required. One fuel with a big potential is hydrogen. Hydrogen vehicles are equipped with a reinforced tank that is fueled at a pressure of 700 bar. This tank feeds a fuel cell, which converts the hydrogen into electricity. This in turn drives an electric motor to propels the vehicle. In the case of passenger cars, this technology is well advanced, with several hundred hydrogen-powered automobiles already in operation on German roads. At the same time, the network of hydrogen stations in Germany is projected to grow from 100 to 400 over the next three years. Yet hydrogen is not currently an option for small vehicles such as electric scooters and motorcycles, since the pressure surge during refilling would be too great. Does this effectively shut out such vehicles from hydrogen technology?</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE: the hydrogen technology for small vehicles</b></h4> 
<p>Not at all! Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have now come up with a hydrogen-based fuel that is ideal for small vehicles: POWERPASTE, which is based on solid magnesium hydride. “POWERPASTE stores hydrogen in a chemical form at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to be then released on demand,” explains Dr. Marcus Vogt, research associate at Fraunhofer IFAM. And given that POWERPASTE only begins to decompose at temperatures of around 250 °C, it remains safe even when an e-scooter stands in the baking sun for hours. Moreover, refueling is extremely simple. Instead of heading to the filling station, riders merely have to replace an empty cartridge with a new one and then refill a tank with mains water. This can be done either at home or underway.</p> 
<p>The starting material of POWERPASTE is magnesium, one of the most abundant elements and, therefore, an easily available raw material. Magnesium powder is combined with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at 350 °C and five to six times atmospheric pressure. An ester and a metal salt are then added in order to form the finished product. Onboard the vehicle, the POWERPASTE is released from a cartridge by means of a plunger. When water is added from an onboard tank, the ensuing reaction generates hydrogen gas in a quantity dynamically adjusted to the actual requirements of the fuel cell. In fact, only half of the hydrogen originates from the POWERPASTE; the rest comes from the added water. “POWERPASTE thus has a huge energy storage density,” says Vogt. “It is substantially higher than that of a 700 bar high-pressure tank. And compared to batteries, it has ten times the energy storage density.” This means that POWERPASTE offers a range comparable to – or even greater than – gasoline. And it also provides a higher range than compressed hydrogen at a pressure of 700 bar.</p> 
<h4><b>Suitable for e-scooters – and other applications as well</b></h4> 
<p>With its huge energy storage density, POWERPASTE is also an interesting option for cars, delivery vehicles and range extenders in battery-powered electric vehicles. Similarly, it could also significantly extend the flight time of large drones, which would thereby be able to fly for several hours rather than a mere 20 minutes. This would be especially useful for survey work, such as the inspection of forestry or power lines. In another kind of application, campers might also use POWERPASTE in a fuel cell to generate electricity to power a coffeemaker or toaster.</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE helps overcome lack of infrastructure</b></h4> 
<p>In addition to providing a high operating range, POWERPASTE has another point in its favor. Unlike gaseous hydrogen, it does not require a costly infrastructure. This makes it ideal for areas lacking such an infrastructure. In places where there are no hydrogen stations, regular filling stations could therefore sell POWERPASTE in cartridges or canisters instead. The paste is fluid and pumpable. It can therefore be supplied by a standard filling line, using relatively inexpensive equipment. Initially, filling stations could supply smaller quantities of POWERPASTE – from a metal drum, for example – and then expand in line with demand. This would require capital expenditure of several tens of thousands of euros. By way of comparison, a filling station to pump hydrogen at high pressure currently costs between one and two million euros for each fuel pump. POWERPASTE is also cheap to transport, since no costly high-pressure tanks are involved nor the use of extremely cold liquid hydrogen.</p> 
<h4><b>Pilot center planned for 2021</b></h4> 
<p>Fraunhofer IFAM is currently building a production plant for POWERPASTE at the Fraunhofer Project Center for Energy Storage and Systems ZESS. Scheduled to go into operation in 2021, this new facility will be able to produce up to four tons of POWERPASTE a year – not only for e-scooters.</p></div></div>]]>

        <p>Data labelling is often the biggest bottleneck in machine learning — finding, managing and labelling vast quantities of data to build a sufficiently performing model can take weeks or months. Active learning lets you train machine learning models with <strong>much</strong> less labelled data. The best AI-driven companies, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBklltKXtDE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=475s">Tesla, already use active learning</a>. We think you should too.</p><h2 id="the-conventional-approach-vs-active-learning-creating-a-spam-filter">The conventional approach vs active learning - creating a spam filter</h2><p>Imagine that you wanted to build a spam filter for your emails. The conventional approach (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">at least since 2002</a>) is to collect a large number of emails, label them as "spam" or "not spam" and then train a machine learning classifier to distinguish between the two classes. The conventional approach assumes all the data is equally valuable, but in most datasets there are class imbalances, noisy data and lots of redundancy.</p><blockquote><strong>The conventional approach wastes time labelling data that doesn't improve your model's performance. And you don't even know if your model is useful until you've finished labelling all the data.</strong></blockquote><p>Humans don't require thousands of randomly labelled examples to learn the difference between spam and legitimate email. If you were teaching a human to solve this task you'd expect to be able to give them a few examples of what you want, have them learn quickly and ask questions when they were unsure.</p><p>Active learning operates using the same intuition, using the model you're training to find and label only the most valuable data.</p><p>In active learning, you first provide a small number of labelled examples. The model is trained on this "seed" dataset. Then, the model "asks questions" by selecting the unlabeled data points it is unsure about, so the human can "answer" the questions by providing labels for those points. The model updates again and the process is repeated until the performance is good enough. <strong>By having the human iteratively teach the model, it's possible to make a better model, in less time, with much less labelled data.</strong></p><p>So how can the model find the next data point that needs labelling? Some commonly used methods are:</p><ol><li>select the data points where the model's predictive distribution has highest entropy</li><li>pick data points where the model's favored prediction is least confident</li><li>train an ensemble of models and focus on the data points where they disagree</li></ol><p>At Humanloop we actually use custom methods that leverage Bayesian deep learning to get better uncertainty estimates.</p><h2 id="three-benefits-of-using-active-learning">Three Benefits of Using Active Learning</h2><h3 id="1-you-spend-less-time-and-money-on-labelling-data">1.

Since data labelling is one of the most expensive parts of training modern machine learning models this should be enough justification on its own!</p><figure><img src="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/learning_curves.png" alt="" srcset="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/learning_curves.png 600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/learning_curves.png 700w"><figcaption>Using active learning gets to higher model accuracies with less labelled data</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-you-get-faster-feedback-on-model-performance">2. You get faster feedback on model performance</h3><p>Usually people label their data <em>before</em> they train any models or get any feedback. Often, it takes days or weeks of iterating on annotation guidelines and re-labelling only to discover that model performance falls far short of what is needed, or different labelled data is required. Since Active Learning trains a model frequently <em>during</em> the data labelling process, it's possible to get feedback and correct issues that might otherwise be discovered much later.</p><h3 id="3-your-model-will-have-higher-final-accuracy">3. Your model will have higher final accuracy</h3><p>People are often surprised that models trained with active learning not only learn faster but can actually converge to a better final model (with less data). We're told so often that more data is better, that it's easy to forget that the quality of the data matters just as much as the quantity. If the dataset contains ambiguous examples which are hard to label accurately this can actually degrade your final model performance.</p><p>The order the model sees examples also matters. There's an entire sub-field of machine learning, called curriculum learning, which studies how you can improve model performance by first teaching about simple concepts before teaching complex ones. &nbsp;Think "Arithmetic before advanced calculus". Active learning naturally enforces a curriculum on your models and helps them achieve better overall performance.</p><h2 id="if-active-learning-is-so-great-then-why-doesn-t-everyone-use-it">If active learning is so great, then why doesn't everyone use it?</h2><p>Most of our tools and processes for building machine learning models weren't designed with Active Learning in mind. There are often different teams of people responsible for data labelling vs model training but active learning requires these processes to be coupled. If you do get these teams to work together, you still need a lot of infrastructure to connect model training to annotation interfaces. Most of the software libraries being used assume all of your data is labelled before you train a model, so to use active learning you have to write a tonne of boiler plate. You also need to figure out how best to host your model, have the model communicate with a team of annotators and update itself as it gets data asynchronously from different annotators.</p><p>On top of this, modern deep learning models are very slow to update, so frequently retraining them from scratch is painful. Nobody wants to label a hundred examples then wait 24 hours for a model to be fully re-trained before labelling the next 100. Deep learning models also tend to have millions or billions of parameters and getting good uncertainty estimates from these models is an open research problem.</p><p>If you read academic papers on active learning, you might think active learning will give you a small saving in labels but for a huge amount of work. The papers are misleading though because they operate on academic datasets that tend to be balanced/clean. They almost always label one example at a time and they forget that not every data-point is equally easy to label. On more realistic problems with large class imbalances, noisy data and variable labelling costs, the benefits can be much bigger than the literature suggests. In some cases there can be a 10x reduction in labelling costs.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-active-learning-today">How to use Active Learning today</h2><figure><img src="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/02/logos-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/logos-1.png 600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/logos-1.png 1000w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/logos-1.png 1600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/logos-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Many of the biggest hurdles to using active learning are just a question of having the right infrastructure. Just as tools like Keras and PyTorch dramatically reduced the pain of deriving gradients, new tools are emerging to make active learning much easier.</p><p>There are open source python libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL">modAL</a> that take away much of the boilerplate. ModAL is built on top of scikit-learn and lets you combine different models with any active learning strategy you like. It takes much of the work out of implementing different uncertainty measures, is open source and modular. The pros of ModAL are the range of methods it provides out of the box and the fact that it's open source. The downside of libraries like modAL is they don't include any annotation interfaces and still leave the work of hosting a model and connecting it to annotation interfaces up to you.</p><p>That brings us to annotation interfaces:</p><p>Probably the most popular tool for individual data scientists is Prodigy. Prodigy is an annotation interface built by the makers of Spacy and so can naturally be combined with their fantastic NLP library to use basic active learning. It's not open-source but you can download it as a pip wheel and install it locally. Whilst Prodigy is a good tool for individuals, it hasn't been designed to support teams of annotators and only implements the most basic forms of Active Learning. To make this work with teams, still requires you to host prodigy yourself and can be a lot of work to set up.</p><p>Labelbox provides interfaces for a variety of image annotations and has recently added support for text as well. Unlike Prodigy, Labelbox has been designed with teams of annotators in mind and has more tools for ensuring that your labels are correct. They don't have any native support for active learning or model training but do allow you to upload predictions from your model to the annotation interface via API. This means that if you have implemented an active learning acquisition function and are training a model, you can set up an active learning loop. Though the most of the work is left to you.</p><h2 id="humanloop">Humanloop</h2><p>We built Humanloop to solve many of the problems of existing tools. Our goal is to make deploying and maintaining natural language models faster and easier than ever before.</p><p>Humanloop provides an annotation interface for NLP tasks that lets you train a model as you annotate and uses active learning out of the box. We support teams of annotators and have incorporated state of the art techniques for active learning and quality assurance. This makes it possible to get real time feedback during training, even when using modern deep models. We also make it easy to deploy to an optimised model run-time immediately after training and to even update your data post deployment.</p><h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2><p>Active Learning:</p><ul><li>reduces how much data you need to label, dramatically reducing one of your biggest costs.</li><li>gives you faster feedback on your model's performance.</li><li>producer higher performing models.</li></ul><p>At Humanloop we think that active learning should be a standard tool for data scientists. We also believe that good tools should make this easy.</p><p>There's more to Humanloop than active learning though. We're building infrastructure for AI models and human teams to work alongside each other so that anyone can quickly augment their team with AI assistance.</p><p>If you're interested in finding out more, send us a message or <a href="https://humanloop.com/demo">book a demo!</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>What we learned about 3D avatars in 7 years of making them</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>Christoph Niemann is an illustrator whose work was featured on over thirty covers of the New Yorker magazine. In the first episode of Netflix's docuseries "Abstract,â€� Niemann introduced a concept called </span><i><span>abstract-o-meter</span></i><span>. It suggests that </span><b>every idea has a </b><b><i>just-right</i></b><b> way to represent it</b><span>. It canâ€™t be too abstract nor too realistic. For example, no one would know that you meant to talk about love if you used a red pixel to represent it. The same thing applies to a realistic drawing of heart, which looks more disgusting rather than lovely. Hence when we talk about love, we use the heart-shaped symbol that everyone is familiar with.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><b>The same concept applies to 3D avatars that we use to represent our identities in virtual worlds and to show our emotions to others</b><span>.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446205-abstract-o-meter-3d-avatars-readyplayerme-wolf3d.png" alt="A scale showing realistic heart, a heart shape, and a red pixel drawings" title="Christoph Niemann's &quot;Abstract-o-meter&quot;"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Abstract-o-meter, Christoph Niemann</span></i></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Abstract 3D avatars are too simple</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>It's hard to show our expressions in games with a simple and abstract visual style. In Minecraft, the avatar's face measures 8x8 pixels. Itâ€™s barely enough room to fit eyes and a mouth â€“ not enough to represent a wide range of emotions. In fact, Minecraft doesn't offer any expressions besides blinking with compatible character skins.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612447071-minecraft-star-wars-avatars-readyplayerme-wolf3d.png" alt="Minecraft Star Wars Sequel Skin Pack" title="Minecraft avatars from Star Wars"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Minecraft Star Wars Sequel Skin Pack (Mojang Studios)</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>Showing your identity in a world made of big pixels isn't a simple task either. You can give someone a general idea of how you look and what colors you like to wear. But it would be hard to distinguish, for example, a black denim jacket from an elegant blazer.</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Hyper-realistic 3D avatars are too realistic</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>On the other side of the spectrum, we have hyper-realistic avatars. In Rogue One, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/movies/how-rogue-one-brought-back-grand-moff-tarkin.html"><span>Disney created a digital version of Wilhuff Tarkin</span></a><span> based on the actor who played him a few decades before â€“ Peter Cushing. This was possible thanks to advanced motion tracking technology and an actor (Guy Henry) who learned how to behave and talk like Cushing.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>The same technique is used in modern AAA games, like Cyberpunk 2077. The challenging part is to make the representation perfect. Otherwise, we experience an effect called the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley"><b>uncanny valley</b></a><span>. If the humanoid character or object doesn't perfectly resemble a human, we tend to have negative emotions. In other words â€“ we are creeped out.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446327-star-wars-rogue-one-tarkin-3d-realistic-avatar-readyplayerme-wolf3d.png" alt="Hyper-realistic model of Tarkin in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story movie" title="Hyper-realistic model of Tarkin in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story movie"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (Lucasfilm)</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>In the movie and gaming industries, studios have access to and can afford advanced tracking solutions. But they also spend thousands of hours on post-processing to make the characters look like real humans. </span><b>For consumers, thereâ€™s no way to use a hyper-realistic avatar based on the userâ€™s appearance. </b><span>Modern games often have advanced character creators, but customization options are limited just to pre-set values and assets.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>These avatars are also not able to represent the playerâ€™s expressions. And there is no affordable face tracking devices available on the mass market that could produce results comparable to the recent Star Wars movies. Not to mention the challenge of rendering super-detailed 3D characters, especially in games like Call of Duty: Warzone with a hundred players on one server.</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>The </b><b><i>just-right</i></b><b> solution for 3D avatars</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>The </span><i><span>just-right</span></i><span> solution for avatars is a simple one. Going back to the uncanny valley concept â€“ it's called a </span><i><span>valley</span></i><span> because we dislike only humanoids that look </span><i><span>almost</span></i><span> like humans. </span><b>But we tend to like </b><b><i>slightly</i></b><b> abstract representations of humans, like cartoon and game characters</b><span>. These avatars are more detailed than the Minecraft ones, making it easier to show one's identity and emotions. On the other hand, they are not too detailed, making it simpler to show basic emotions without creeping someone out. They are also less challenging to render for average hardware, even in large scale games like Fortnite.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446407-fortnite-avatar-battle-royale-game-readyplayer-me-wolf3d.jpeg" alt="3D characters in game Fornite" title="Fortnite from Epic Games"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Fortnite (Epic Games)</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>The current state of consumer technology allows us to use these simpler avatars to have social interactions in the virtual worlds. For example, there are software-based solutions for emulating mouth movement, like </span><a href="https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-lipsync-unity/"><span>Oculus Lipsync</span></a><span>. We can also get a good representation of body movement with the controllers that come with virtual reality headsets available today. This is essential for getting non-verbal communication in virtual worlds right.Â&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Finding the right balance for 3D avatars</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>But there's one more reason why less realistic avatars are </span><i><span>just right</span></i><span>, and we learned it through our companyâ€™s long history of making avatars. When we started Wolf3D seven years ago, we built full-body scanners for creating hyper-realistic human models desired by movie and gaming studios. When Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014, we realized that 3D avatars will play an important role in the future. </span><b>We shifted our focus and decided to make it easy for anyone to create their own 3D avatar</b><span>.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>Our first step in that direction was easy-to-use, egg-shaped face scanners. We shipped them to many places worldwide, including museums in Estonia and Finland, E3 game shows in Las Vegas, and Paramount Studios in Hollywood.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>The next step was to make scanning even more accessible. </span><b>We decided to use the data from tens of thousands of high-resolution scans to build a software-based solution</b><span>. With just fifteen photos and a phone app, anyone could create a realistic 3D model of their face.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446455-egg-face-3d-scanner-readyplayerme-avatars-wolf3d.png" alt="Wolf3D's high-quality 3D face scanner " title="The egg-shaped face scanner from Wolf3D"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Wolf3Dâ€™s egg-shaped scanner</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>At this stage, </span><b>we learned that people didn't want an avatar that looks </b><b><i>exactly</i></b><b> like them â€“ they wanted something more</b><span>. It's like with Instagram profiles â€” no one posts photos of their dirty dishes (please, prove me wrong). Instead, we choose to create an idealistic version of our lives featuring pictures from trips to Bali, plates full of sushi, and selfies from Coachella.</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Where are we now and what's the future of 3D avatars</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>Learning this, </span><b>we set Wolf3D on its current tracks and made a simpler avatar creator based on a single selfie</b><span>. It allows anyone with a camera and access to the Internet to create an idealized, 3D version of themselves. All with the </span><i><span>just-right</span></i><span> balance â€“ not too abstract, not too realistic.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				




<h2>Background</h2>



<p>Interestingly enough, it took me four months to start writing an article about starting things. I’m not kidding:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="556" height="522" src="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png" data-src="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png 556w, https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement-300x282.png 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" srcset="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png 556w, https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement-300x282.png 300w"></figure></div>



<p>I did publish the <a href="https://unstructed.tech/2020/12/11/we-all-come-with-a-bucket-of-sht/">bucket of sh*t one</a> after two months, but this one took a while. Which I think is a perfect starting ground for analyzing what I wanted to write about anyway – why do we keep delaying and procrastinating with stuff. </p>



<p>This article is broken into two parts. In the first part, we will be dealing with all the reasons why we delay, procrastinate and generally avoid starting things. In the second part, we will discuss specific steps that you can (and should) take in order to actually start doing them. Lastly, I will provide a list of resources that you might find useful.</p>



<p>So, let’s start with – WHY.</p>



<h2>Part I – Why?</h2>



<p>Starting this section without referring to one of THE BEST articles I ever read on this subject would be absolutely unfair. It was almost eight years ago that a friend of mine sent me the article that “I just have to read. Immediately!”. <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Procrastinators Procrastinate</a> is, to this day, one of THE MOST influential articles I ever read on the subject. Once you finish this one, I would urge you to go and read that one as well. It is listed in the “Useful Resources” section so you won’t miss it.</p>



<p>Anyway, why do we delay doing things that we want to do? And this can literally be anything – starting those yoga classes, changing a job, writing a graduation thesis, committing to a new diet or, in this specific case – starting an article about starting new things.</p>



<p>Obviously, I can’t speak for everyone out there, but I surely can tell you what my problem is. And, in all honesty, what seems to be a common denominator for all of those that I’ve spoken to. It always boils down to – fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear of the uncertainty. Fear of failing. Fear of being laughed at. Fear of being afraid. Yikes!</p>



<p>Let’s talk fear.</p>



<h3>Fear</h3>



<p>Strictly speaking, what I refer to as “fear” is what my therapist calls “anxiety”. Here’s how he describes it (and I’m paraphrasing, obviously):</p>



<blockquote><p>Anxiety is when you are afraid that there is a lion in the room, even though there isn’t one. Fear is when there actually IS a lion in the room.</p><cite>Source: my therapist</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fear is a really useful emotion. Just stop and think about it. It’s what helped our species survive and evolve enough to argue politics and record TikTok videos. Seriously. Let me quote Wikipedia as well:</p>



<blockquote><p>Fear is an emotion induced by perceived danger or threat, which causes physiological changes and ultimately behavioral changes, such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a certain stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to oneself. The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis.</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Again, think about it. Or, better yet, <span>think of our ancestors. Hundreds of thousand of years ago, if they weren’t able to perceive a danger of being eaten by a lion, I wouldn’t be here writing this and you surely wouldn’t be the one reading it</span>. It’s valid even today – standing on the edge of the cliff, if there weren’t for a fear, you’d have no problem jumping off. Or being hit by a car. My point is – <span>fear is an extremely useful emotion and definitely the one favored by evolution</span>. It helps you survive.</p>



<p>Let me share one anecdote – there was a period in my life when, for whatever the reasons were, I got obsessed with the psychopathy. And I’ve been reading A LOT about it. Yep. It sounds crazy, I know, but there was some reasoning behind it. If you’ve never read anything of the kind, you’re probably thinking of “psychopaths” as a crazy axe swinging murderers who butcher people for fun. Well, sorry to disappoint you but that’s just Hollywood (mostly). Psychopathy, in a very layman’s terms, refers to a different structure of a brain which, among other things, causes a complete lack of empathy. As in – they have no sense of regret. Now, without going into too many details of it, one of the things that psychopaths experience is – lack of fear. They don’t have any sense of fear (or it’s a very very weak one). And you know what the problem is? They have HARD time surviving! Which explains why’s there not that many of them. In order to live long enough to be portrayed in movies, they actually have to LEARN what things are dangerous and what can (and will) kill them. Yep. So, without spending too much time on the topic, I just want to say – be grateful for that sense of fear that you have.</p>



<p>Anyway, let me go back to the original story. Fear and anxiety. So, fear is a useful emotion that helps you survive. But anxiety? Not so much.</p>



<p>Let’s talk anxiety now.</p>



<h3>Anxiety</h3>



<p>Here’s what Wikipedia says on the subject:</p>



<blockquote><p>Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. It includes subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events.</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Looks similar to fear, right? And yet, it’s not. <span>Fear is helpful. Anxiety is rather opposite</span>. Fear is what helps you live to see another day and watch Netflix. Anxiety is what prohibits you from living long, happy and healthy enough to watch all those Netflix shows. <span>Favor the fear, but be careful of anxiety</span>.</p>



<p>From my point of view, and please do take this with outmost grain of salt, but – <span><strong>I believe that <em>one of</em> the main issues is that we confuse anxiety for fear</strong></span>. More specifically, we perceive anxiousness as a fear and, a natural behavioural response is – to get the hell out of that situation. Even if it’s only in our heads, the response is nevertheless the same.</p>



<p>Now, a logical question that follows is – how do you get rid of anxiety? Well, let me burst that bubble immediately – you don’t. I’m not a specialist of any kind but, <span>from my investigation and experience, there’s not a single emotion that you can “get rid off”. What you can (and should) do is – learn the tools of the trade</span>. Learn how to deal with them and, eventually, live with them. Easier said than done, but absolutely doable.</p>



<h3>Tools of the trade</h3>



<p>Let me tell you two more anecdotes. I have no idea why, but I seem to be all about anecdotes today.</p>



<p>I was listening (well, technically I’m re-listening to it almost every day during a workout) to Pavel Tsatsouline talking about muscle hypertrophy. For those who are not familiar with the guy – he’s an amazingly respected fitness instructor who, among other things, “brought” kettlebells to USA. And muscle hypertrophy is, well, the process of growing your muscles really. So, what he was saying is – “when it comes to muscle hypertrophy, we pretty much have no idea what’s really happening. But we do know which buttons to push and we do have the tools of the trade that help us get there”. Hence, <span>we have no clue WHY or HOW the muscles really grow, but we do know how to get them to do so</span>.</p>



<p>Another one is from the book written by Robert C. Martin, famously known (to developers) as Uncle Bob. It’s about agile development. And one thing that I highlighted and that I’m quoting in its original form is – “Some folks think that Agile is about going fast. It’s not. It’s never been about going fast. Agile is about knowing, as early as possible, just how screwed we are.”. </p>



<p>Now, one might wonder, and rightfully so – what the hell am I talking about? And <span>what exactly is a connection between muscle hypertrophy, agile development and dealing with anxiet</span>y, right? Well, let me help you make that connection. Both are amazingly complex processes, for which we mostly have no idea what exactly is happening, but we do have enough data and knowledge to tackle them properly. <span><strong>And that’s exactly how you should tackle any anxiety – by using the battle tested tools of the trade that we have</strong></span>. That’s what the Part II is all about anyway.</p>



<p>I’ll close this section with a quote from Jordan Peterson who happens to be, among other things, a rather famous clinical psychologist. I’m paraphrasing his words: “Do you know how we approach and help people who are extremely anxious? We first explain to them that they will never be ‘free’ of anxiety. They will always remain anxious. But <span>through careful chunking and constant work, we help them get used to that feeling, until it loses its intensity. It’s still there, but it’s not blocking you any more. And that’s how you beat anxiety</span>“.</p>



<h2>Part II – How?</h2>



<p>If you read the Part I, which I hope you did, you probably concluded what I believe is the biggest obstacle to embarking on anything new. If not, well, here’s a quick summary – it’s all about fear. Yep. Whatever the reasoning you come up with, if you dig deep enough, you will end up with some sort of fear. Or, shall I say, anxiety? 🙂</p>



<p>Now, does that make it any easier to deal with? Hell no! Quite the contrary. <span>Starting anything new is HARD</span>. Especially if it’s something that you never did before. Not to mention if you tried and “failed”. Ouch!</p>



<p>So, let me repeat that. <span>Starting anything new is DAMN HARD</span>. Just like growing muscles or starting a new project is. But here’s the most important thing – <span>once we accept that it’s hard and that it’s ok for it to be hard, and trust me, <strong>sometimes acceptance is the hardest part</strong>, we are ready for the next step</span>. And the next step is – using the tools of the trade that were battle tested by many before us.</p>



<h3>Very first step – write it down and let it sink in</h3>



<p>Yep, when it comes to myself, and, I’m sure, for many others, one of the issues is that we want everything at once. Immediately. No time to waste. Or, as we sometimes put it – “I don’t want to half ass something. …</p></div></div>

Exactly why this is happening is unknown.</p>  <p>"We were kind of shocked," said Casiraghi, a postdoctoral researcher in biology at the University of Washington.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He is the lead author of a study published this week <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabe0465">in the journal <em>Science Advances</em></a>, which tracked&nbsp;three Indigenous communities in Argentina, and compared them to&nbsp;students at the University of Washington. The work was led by University of Washington biology professor Horacio de la Iglesia and involved a&nbsp;team of researchers from Yale University and National University of Quilmes in Argentina.</p>  <p>The team fitted participants with wrist monitors akin to sophisticated smart watches, which collected biological sleep data for between one and two lunar cycles&nbsp;(one lunar cycle lasts about 29.5 days.)</p>  <p>A majority of the participants in the study were found to go to bed later and sleep less in the week ahead of a full moon.</p>  <p>"It might be that the biological clock is being delayed in a way that now it's telling you to go to sleep at a later time, but it might also be that for some reason this accumulation of waking time is not as important during certain days of the moon cycles," said&nbsp;Casiraghi.</p>  <h2>Sleep in the real world</h2>  <p>Casiraghi's research supervisor de la Iglesia<strong>&nbsp;</strong>had previously studied how lunar phases are correlated with increased activity in animals, such as crabs and monkeys in Argentina.</p>    <p>That was a springboard to asking: What about humans?</p>  <p>While previous sleep clinic research had&nbsp;investigated connections between lunar cycles and sleep, Casiraghi said&nbsp;those studies were limited by the fact that participants were in an unrealistic, lab-like setting, and results couldn't be easily replicated.</p>  <p>Casiraghi noted past research has established that with greater access to electric light, people tend to go to sleep later into the evening and have shorter nights than those with limited access.</p>  <p>He set out to study this in the real world, tracking the sleep patterns&nbsp;of about 100 participants spread across three Indigenous Toba/Qom communities in Formosa, Argentina.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Leandro Casiraghi, right, and Adán García, one of the Toba field assistants involved in the study.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Germán Joosten)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>One community was urban and had ready access to artificial light; another was rural but had limited access to artificial light; and the third, also rural, had no access to artificial light.</p>  <p>Casiraghi said going into the study, the team assumed if they found any sleep effect linked to lunar phases, the signal would be strongest on the night of a full or new moon, when the moon glow was at its brightest in the middle of the night. The argument would be that the light helped our&nbsp;ancestors see more clearly and stay active later.</p>  <h2>Assumptions eclipsed</h2>  <p>That's also why the team assumed they might find an effect in the groups with no or little access to electric light, because those groups might stand to benefit more from moonlit nights than those with ample access to light in the home.</p>  <p>But two unexpected patterns emerged.</p>  <p>The team found most people across the three groups went to bed later and slept less than usual — not on a full or new moon&nbsp;—&nbsp;but in the three to five days before. The amount of sleep on average varied between 46 and 58 minutes over the course of the lunar cycle. Bedtimes varied by around half an hour.</p>  <p>And sleep cycles of the urban and two rural communities displayed similar rhythm changes in the few days before the full moon, regardless of access to light.</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q17i1srjOqY" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>The urbanites with access to light around the clock went to bed later and slept less on average than either rural community during those days. The rural community with some access to light went to sleep earlier than the urbanites, but later than the light-free rural community, which also slept more than all three.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the main effect was the same. Access to electric light didn't shield groups from the stimulating effects of the moon.</p>  <p>"We went through the data like 10 times to convince us what we were seeing was actually true," said Casiraghi.</p>      <p>The team compared their findings to sleep data gleaned from nearly 500 University of Washington undergraduates&nbsp;in past studies.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The same "striking" correlation between moon phases and sleep patterns was apparent in the undergrads living in post-industrial Seattle as in the Toba/Qom.</p>  <h2>Light not the only driver</h2>  <p>Casiraghi has a theory as to why it would've benefited early humans to stay up later during this time.</p>  <p>In the days before a full moon, the sun sets and a luminous moon takes its place in the sky earlier in the evening than usual.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Casiraghi suggested it could've been adaptive for hunter-gatherer groups to take advantage of the fact that the moonlight "stretched the day," allowing longer periods of activity.&nbsp;Full moons in the middle of the night provided less useful benefit.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This squares with the cultural stories of the Toba/Qom. They said brighter nights around the full moon were traditionally used to safely hunt and fish later into the evening. It was also a time for greater social activity, they say — including romantic trysts between young people.</p>  <p>But Casiraghi admitted this doesn't fully explain what's going on.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/last-full-moon.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/last-full-moon.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/last-full-moon.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/last-full-moon.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/last-full-moon.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/last-full-moon.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>A full moon rises over Calgary as if wedged between city skyscrapers.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Francois Bernier)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>If people living in a big city setting surrounded by television screens, household light sources and light pollution are staying up later ahead of a full moon, the light itself can't be the only driver.</p>  <p>The answer may be hiding in our biology.&nbsp;</p>    <p>On any given night, we tuck in for two reasons: our biological clock tells us to, and we've been awake so long we've reached an energetic limit for the day.</p>  <p>Which of those two is being influenced by the moon —&nbsp;and how the moon is exerting that influence —&nbsp;remains a mystery, said Casiraghi.</p>  <p>"These are the questions we're trying to engage with in the near future."&nbsp;</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written and produced by <a href="https://twitter.com/brycehoye">Bryce Hoye.</a></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p><img src="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/img/sos.png" width="200"></p>
<p>In early 2019, we started visiting campuses across India to recruit the best and brightest minds to ensure LinkedIn, and all the services that make up its complex technology stack, is always available for everyone. This critical function at Linkedin falls under the purview of the Site Engineering team and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) who are Software Engineers specializing in reliability. SREs apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design, development and operation of computer systems: generally, large scale, distributed ones</p>
<p>As we continued on this journey we started getting a lot of questions from these campuses on what exactly the site reliability engineering role entails? And, how could someone learn the skills and the disciplines involved to become a successful site reliability engineer? Fast forward a few months, and a few of these campus students had joined LinkedIn either as interns or as full-time engineers to become a part of the Site Engineering team; we also had a few lateral hires who joined our organization who were not from a traditional SRE background. That's when a few of us got together and started to think about how we can onboard new graduate engineers to the Site Engineering team.</p>
<p>There is a vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web on what the roles and responsibilities of SREs are, how to monitor site health, production incidents, define SLO/SLI etc. But there are very few resources out there guiding someone on the basic skill sets one has to acquire as a beginner. Because of the lack of these resources, we felt that individuals have a tough time getting into open positions in the industry. We created the School Of SRE as a starting point for anyone wanting to build their career as an SRE.</p>
<p>In this course, we are focusing on building strong foundational skills. The course is structured in a way to provide more real life examples and how learning each of these topics can play an important role in day to day SRE life. Currently we are covering the following topics under the School Of SRE:</p>

                <p>After posting about the <a href="http://www.geofcrowl.com/blog/articles/2020/2/13/openstep-user-interface-guidelines/">OpenStep User Interface Guide</a>, I started to wonder how many different human interface guides or software design guides that I could find from the past and present. It doesn’t seem like there’s a good collection of these anywhere on the internet, especially in regard to past software design guides. I think there’s a lot of value in these even outside of just being a historic reference.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>How well is <code>__int128</code> supported, and what are its
properties? A Godbolt-based survey of the Big Four compilers.
Spoiler alert: libc++ thinks it’s integral, libstdc++ thinks it’s integral
only in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode(!), and MSVC thinks it doesn’t exist at all.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Rein Halbersma for alerting me to libstdc++’s different behavior
in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode versus <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-support">Compiler support</h2>



<p>GCC, Clang, and Intel ICC all support a built-in <code>__int128</code> type.
Microsoft MSVC does not support any 128-bit integral type as far as I’m aware.</p>

<p>On GCC, Clang, and ICC, <code>__int128</code> is a token similar to <code>int</code>: you can modify
it with <code>unsigned</code> to produce <code>unsigned __int128</code>. However, all three front-ends
also support the built-in synonyms <code>__int128_t</code> and <code>__uint128_t</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;__int128_t, __int128&gt;);
static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;__uint128_t, unsigned __int128&gt;);
    // PASSES on all three compilers
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both <code>__int128_t</code> and <code>__uint128_t</code> are safe to use in non-type template parameters
and constant expressions, on all compilers that support them.</p>

<h2 id="sneaky-macros">Sneaky macros</h2>

<p>The story on libstdc++ is complicated. Libstdc++ doesn’t do anything special for
<code>__int128</code>, but it does provide <em>macro hooks</em>
(<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/87798f3f2cf97b30e75110b5a8d2964aef62be02/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/std/type_traits#L285-L293">link</a>)
so that for example
<code>__GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0</code> will be treated as an integral type, whatever that macro
expands to. (If it doesn’t expand to anything, it’ll be ignored.)</p>

<p>If you compile with GCC in <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode (for any <code>XX</code>),
<code>__GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0</code> won’t be defined and so libstdc++ will consider
<code>__int128</code> a non-integral type.</p>

<p>But if you compile with GCC in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode (for any <code>XX</code>), then the compiler
will pre-define these two macros:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define __GLIBCXX_BITSIZE_INT_N_0 128
#define __GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0 __int128
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23156">As of July 2016-ish</a>, Clang also
defines these two macros in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode.</p>

<p>By the way, you can use the options <code>-dM -E</code> to view all your compiler’s pre-defined macros:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>clang++ -std=c++17 -dM -E test.cc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The upshot is, if you compile in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ will treat <code>__int128</code> and
<code>unsigned __int128</code> as integral types with the proper numeric limits; but if you
compile in the usual <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ will not do any of that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, libc++ treats <code>__int128</code> as an integer type, full stop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve worked on several projects that compiled with <code>-std=c++17 -D_GNU_SOURCE</code>. That
will give you a lot of GNU library extensions, but it will not give you <code>__int128</code> support.
libstdc++ is looking specifically for the two macros defined above, and <code>-D_GNU_SOURCE</code>
doesn’t enable those macros.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="relationship-to-integer-types-and-intmax_t">Relationship to integer types and <code>intmax_t</code></h2>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;);
    // TRUE on libc++, "it depends" on libstdc++
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>libstdc++ (in standard, non-<code>gnu++XX</code> mode) leaves <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> as <code>false</code>.
This makes a certain amount of sense from the library implementor’s point of view,
because <code>__int128</code> is not one of the <em>standard</em> integral types, and furthermore,
if you <em>call</em> it integral, then you have to face the consequence that <code>intmax_t</code>
(which is 64 bits on every ABI that matters) is kind of lying about being the
“max.”</p>

<p>In <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ makes <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> come out to <code>true</code>,
as described in the previous section on sneaky macros.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, libc++ simply
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxx/blob/aeeba70ab15e1469841c0f3f1f9c78211a541699/include/type_traits#L738-L741">sets</a>
sets <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> to <code>true</code>, unconditionally.</p>

<p>Yes, this means that on libc++ (or on libstdc++ with <code>-std=gnu++17</code>), there exist
integral values that do not fit in <code>intmax_t</code>! (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/lMD4Iu">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In case you’re wondering: libstdc++ in standard C++17 mode considers <code>__int128</code> a “compound” type.
The definition of “compound type” is simply “anything that’s not a fundamental type,”
where “fundamental” encompasses the arithmetic types (both integral and floating-point), <code>void</code>,
and <code>nullptr_t</code>. So for example <code>int*</code> is also a compound type.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="numeric-limits">Numeric limits</h2>

<p>In standard (non-<code>gnu++XX</code>) mode, libstdc++ does not specialize <code>numeric_limits</code> for <code>__int128</code> at all.
This <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/RpaD-7">has the unfortunate effect</a> of</p>

<div><div><pre><code>constexpr __int128 int128_max =
    std::numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::max();
static_assert(int128_max == 0);  // TRUE on libstdc++ in standard mode
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>libc++ (and libstdc++ in <code>gnu++XX</code> mode) provides the appropriate specialization, so that
<code>numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::min()</code> and <code>numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::max()</code>
have the appropriate values instead of zero.</p>

<p>On libc++ <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/ZR_nn6"><code>numeric_limits</code> reports <code>__int128</code> as an integral type</a>,
whereas on libstdc++ in standard mode it doesn’t (again because there is no specialization for
<code>__int128</code> at all).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::numeric_limits&lt;I128&gt;::is_integer);
    // TRUE on libc++, "it depends" on libstdc++
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="signedness">Signedness</h2>

<p>libc++ reports that <code>is_signed_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> and <code>is_unsigned_v&lt;unsigned __int128&gt;</code>.
libstdc++ in standard mode of course denies both, because only arithmetic types can be
signed or unsigned, and libstdc++ denies that <code>__int128</code> is arithmetic.</p>

<p>As for <code>make_signed</code>, libc++ (and libstdc++ in <code>gnu++XX</code> mode) reports what you’d expect —
<code>make_signed&lt;__uint128_t&gt;::type</code> is <code>__int128_t</code>, and <code>make_unsigned&lt;__int128_t&gt;::type</code> is <code>__uint128_t</code>.</p>

<p>Trying to instantiate <code>make_signed&lt;__uint128_t&gt;</code> on libstdc++ in standard mode
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/j7BvKB">results in</a> a hard error which is not SFINAE-friendly.
(It’s undefined behavior to instantiate <code>make_signed</code> of any type which is neither
integral nor an enumeration type.)</p>

<p>Incidentally, today I learned that <code>is_signed_v&lt;float&gt; == true</code> but <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/t6v1CJ"><code>make_signed_t&lt;float&gt;</code>
is a hard error</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>For more on <code>__uint128_t</code> arithmetic, see
<a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/02/13/wide-integer-proof-of-concept/">“The abstraction penalty for wide integer math on x86-64”</a> (2020-02-13).</p>

Typically your computer makes a request for some information and the server responds:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Your computer:</strong> Yo, what's good about this random site learnreact.design?</p><p><strong>The server:</strong> Hang on, let me grab something for you. Beep. Boop.</p></blockquote><p>The main part of the server's response usually includes three items: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p><p>HTML lists the content of a web page and describes its structure. How many headings and paragraphs are there? What images should a user see? Are this button and that textbox contained in the same box?</p><p>Using this information, the browser creates something called... the DOM!</p><div><p><img alt="Introducing the DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Wait a second, the DOM is a ... tree? Yup, a tree! Oddly enough, a lot of things in our computer look like a tree. Let's give our tree friend a nickname... hmm what about Domo?</p><p>Domo works as a model at the prestigious art studio "Web Browser". His job is to pose in front of the artist who paints a portrait (or perhaps millions of portraits).</p><div><p><img alt="Domo at the art studio Web Browser" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>In real life, DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's indeed a model -- a model of the document (aka the web page). It strikes a pose. The browser paints a portrait. The portraits are what we see on a web page: the textboxes, the paragraphs, the images and so on. A developer's job is like that of a director who tells Domo what to wear and what pose to strike. This determines what those portraits look like in the end.</p><p>To check out what the DOM looks like, if you are using a desktop browser, right-click on this very page and choose "Inspect". Can you make sense of what's in the Elements tab?</p><div><p><img alt="Inspect in Chrome" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3><a id="the-dom-api" href="#the-dom-api"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>The DOM API</a></h3><p>We often want a web page to be dynamic and interactive -- that means its content changes from time to time: adding or removing text here and there, showing a modal, or updating a chart based on some new data coming from the server.</p><p>Remember, in order to change what's on a web page, we need to update the DOM. The artist isn't able to paint new portraits until Domo changes to a new pose.</p><p>How would we get Domo to change to a new pose?</p><p>We just talk to him. He listens. Interestingly, Domo's ears happen to have a name: <em>DOM API</em>.</p><div><p><img alt="A developer works with DOM API" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>To manipulate the DOM, a developer would write code in JavaScript which talks to the DOM API, and in turn, updates the content of the web page.</p><h3><a id="the-increasing-complexity" href="#the-increasing-complexity"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>The increasing complexity</a></h3><p><em>Directly</em> talking to Domo has been the standard approach of web development for years, especially when the web content was mostly static. A developer would sprinkle some interactivity on top of the static pages by writing small amount of JavaScript code.</p><p>However, with the emergence of SPAs (Single Page Application) such as Gmail and Google Maps, people started to expect a lot more.

The core idea is based on a simple strategy: divide-and-conquer. If it's difficult to grok a problem all at once, we break it into smaller problems, solve them one at a time and then combine the results.</p><div><p><img alt="React breaks a problem into components" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Building an app in React is almost all about working with components: breaking the app into components, finding the best components for the job, fitting one with another, creating new components from existing ones etc.</p><p>Nowadays, design tools such as Framer and Figma have components too (and symbols in Sketch). They are a lot like React components, except that the latter are more flexible and powerful. In fact, the inspiration of components in design tools came directly from components in software engineering. Once a component is created, we can create multiple instances of it. We can use it to construct other components. If we change a component, everything that includes this component will be updated automatically.</p><p>Components in React have two important properties:</p><ol><li>Components are <em>composable</em>. They are made for reuse. We can make a new component with other components.</li><li>Components are <em>independent</em> of each other. If we change the code in one place, other parts don't break.</li></ol><p>If this sounds abstract to you, don't worry! I'll show you some examples and explain these properties in details soon.</p><h3><a id="declarative-ui" href="#declarative-ui"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Declarative UI</a></h3><h4><a id="imperative-vs-declarative" href="#imperative-vs-declarative"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Imperative vs. declarative</a></h4><p>When directly working with the DOM API, we'd have to specify what element to change at the right time, in the right order. This is equivalent to describing to Domo how to position his head, arms and legs step by step, for each and every portrait.</p><div><p><img alt="Imperative programming" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Heck, this sounds tedious and error-prone! Why can't we just tell Domo <em>what</em> we want instead of <em>how</em> to pose? In fact, this is exactly how to build a UI in React. A developer draws a quick sketch of what he or she wants. React explains it to Domo how to pose.</p><div><p><img alt="Declarative programming in React" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Because the apps we build are dynamic, we often want Domo to change poses fairly quickly.

The traditional way of directly working with the DOM API is imperative, and the React way is declarative.</p><p>Imperative programming emerged from the day when the computers were primitive. People had to instruct them in detail: where to store the numbers, how to multiply etc. But this eventually got unmanageable, people wrote smart software that convert definition of problems into detailed instructions. Declarative programming was born.</p><h4><a id="virtual-dom" href="#virtual-dom"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Virtual DOM</a></h4><p>Besides making the life of a developer easier, declarative programming in React also offers opportunities for performance optimization.</p><p>When React has all the sketches beforehand, he can sort through them, remove any duplication and make sure that Domo and the artist do as little work as possible.</p><div><p><img alt="React diffing with virtual DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>These sketches are called <em>Virtual DOM</em>.

    <p>Lately I have been working on improving texture atlas allocation in WebRender. It isn't an outstanding technical feat, but the journey towards achieving this goal was quite pleasant. </p>
<p>This is a longer version of the piece I published in the <a href="https://mozillagfx.wordpress.com/2021/02/04/improving-texture-atlas-allocation-in-webrender/">mozilla gfx team blog</a> where I focus on the atlas allocation algorithms. In this one I'll go into more details about the process and methodology behind these improvements.</p>
<p>The first part is about the making of guillotiere, a crate that I first released in March 2019. In the second part we'll have a look at more recent work building upon what I did with guillotiere, to improve texture memory usage in WebRender/Firefox.</p>

<p>In order to submit work to the GPU efficiently, WebRender groups as many drawing primitives as it can into what we call batches. A batch is submitted to the GPU as a single drawing command and has a few constraints. for example a batch can only reference a fixed set of resources (such as GPU buffers and textures). So in order to group as many drawing primitives as possible in a single batch we need to place as many drawing parameters as possible in few resources. When rendering text, WebRender pre-renders the glyphs before compositing them on the screen  so this means packing as many pre-rendered glyphs as possible into a single texture, and the same applies for rendering images and various other things.</p>
<p>For a moment let's simplify the case of images and text and assume that it is the same problem: input images (rectangles) of various rectangular sizes that we need to pack into a larger rectangle. This is the job of the texture atlas allocator. Another common name for this is rectangle bin packing.</p>
<p><img alt="Atlas allocation" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/atlas-allocation.svg"></p>
<p>Many in game and web development are used to packing many images into fewer assets. In most cases this can be achieved at build time Which means that the texture atlas allocator only needs to find a good layout for a fixed set of rectangles without supporting dynamic deallocation and allocation within the atlas at run time. I call this "static" atlas allocation as opposed to "dynamic" atlas allocation.</p>
<p>There's a lot more literature out there about static than dynamic atlas allocation. I recommend reading <a href="http://pds25.egloos.com/pds/201504/21/98/RectangleBinPack.pdf"><em>A thousand ways to pack the bin</em></a> which is a very good survey of various static packing algorithms. Dynamic atlas allocation is unfortunately more difficult to implement while keeping good run-time performance. WebRender needs to maintain texture atlases into which items are added and removed over time. In other words we don't have a way around needing dynamic atlas allocation.</p>

<p>A while back, WebRender had a naive implementation of the guillotine algorithm (explained in <a href="http://pds25.egloos.com/pds/201504/21/98/RectangleBinPack.pdf"><em>A thousand ways to pack the bin</em></a>). This algorithm strikes a good compromise between packing quality and implementation complexity.
The main idea behind it can be explained simply: "Maintain a list of free rectangles, find one that can hold your allocation, split the requested allocation size out of it, creating up to two additional rectangles that are added back to the free list.". There is subtlety in which free rectangle to choose and how to split it, but the overall, the algorithm is built upon reassuringly understandable concepts.</p>
<p><img alt="Guillotine allocation steps" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/guillotine-alloc.svg"></p>
<p>Deallocation could simply consist of adding the deallocated rectangle back to the free list, but without some way to merge back neighbor free rectangles, the atlas would quickly get into a fragmented stated with a lot of small free rectangles and can't allocate larger ones anymore.</p>
<p><img alt="Fragmented state" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/fragmented.svg"></p>
<p>To address that, WebRender's implementation would regularly do a O(n²) complexity search to find and merge neighbor free rectangles, which was very slow when dealing with thousands of items. Eventually we stopped using the  guillotine allocator in systems that needed support for deallocation, replacing it with a very simple slab allocator which I'll get back to later in this post.</p>
<p>I wasn't satisfied with moving to a worse allocator because of the run-time defragmentation issue, so as a side project I wrote a guillotine allocator that tracks rectangle splits in a tree in order to find and merge neighbor free rectangle in constant instead of quadratic time. I published it in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/guillotiere">guillotiere</a> crate. I wrote about how it works in details in <a href="https://docs.rs/guillotiere/0.6.0/guillotiere/struct.AtlasAllocator.html">the documentation</a> so I won't go over it here. I'm quite happy about how it turned out, although I haven't pushed to use it in WebRender, mostly because I wanted to first see evidence that it would help and I already had evidence that many other things needed to be worked on.</p>
<h2>Visualizing program state using SVG</h2>
<p>guillotiere lets you dump a visualization of the atlas in SVG format.</p>
<p><img alt="Guillotine allocation visualization" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/guillotine-example-1.svg"></p>
<p>The image above shows the state of the atlas after a few allocations. Allocated space is represented in light blue while free space is in dark gray. It is much easier to work with than a list of coordinates in plain text. It was handy when developing and tuning the algorithm, but also when using it in other projects. While looking at the visual representation of the state animate you quickly develop an intuition of how the algorithm unfolds Concepts that are hard to explain in written form sometimes just "make sense" visually.</p>
<p>Dumping visual representations in a .svg file is not only a powerful tool when exploring problem some spaces, it is also surprisingly simple to do. SVG is a straightforward XML type of format which is annoying to type by hand but effortless to generate with very simple helpers. Here is how it looks using a tiny helper crate called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/svg_fmt">svg_fmt</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>    </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>svg_fmt</span>::<span>*</span><span>;</span><span></span>

</code></pre></div>


<p>So many useful visualizations can be easily built out of simple colored rectangles and text and there's other primitives provided by svg_fmt. Rectangles were all I needed in guillotiere.</p>
<p>You can look at <a href="https://github.com/nical/rust_debug/blob/492600cac47f64bcadaf9ad037ed64c5fecc8e63/svg_fmt/src/svg.rs">how simple the svg_fmt code is</a>. It has become a dependency to most of the things I've worked on lately, including WebRender which uses it to dump visualizations of texture atlases and the render graph.</p>
<p><img alt="Render graph visualization" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/rendergraph.svg"></p>
<p>My hope by now is that if you are working on problems that can be represented in 2D space, I've managed to convince you of how easily you can supplement or break free of reading text in your debugger/terminal. If anything, just <code>println!(r#"&lt;rect x="{}" y="{}" width="{}" height="{}" fill:rgb(100,0,0)" /&gt;""#, x, y, w, h);</code> your way into looking at your algorithms unfolding.</p>
<h2>Making/testing/debugging a small rust crate</h2>
<p>I had a great time writing guillotiere for several reasons. The problem itself had some nice properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a well defined problem with simple input and output data. As a result it is very easy to write unit tests and fuzz the code.</li>
<li>No nebulous design space for fancy abstractions. A retained state, query a size in, get a rectangle out. Simple.</li>
<li>Can be implemented in its own library outside of a big rendering engine, and enjoy fast compile/debug iterations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was the Rust programming language and ecosystem that really made it a such pleasant journey.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping a simple library, creating unit tests, adding dependencies is simple and effortless in Rust. This alone is a huge time saver for me compared to when I would do this sort of thing in C++ (I can only hope that the situation has improved in C++ since). Fellow Rust developers are pretty used to that so let's move on.</p>
<p>I quickly wrote a simple command-line application to interactively play with the packing algorithm.
The application deserializes the state of the atlas from a file, execute a command (for example allocation or deallocation) and serializes back into the file (using the .ron file format). In addition, the command-line application could dump a visualization of the atlas in SVG.</p>
<p>The command-line app was put together very quickly thanks to fantastic pieces of the Rust ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde">serde</a> for serialization/deserialzation,</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/ron">ron</a> providing a nice and readable serialized file format,</li>
<li>and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/clap">clap</a> for parsing command-line arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put together, this gave me an interactive playground to test the algorithm. Playing around in a terminal would look like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ guillotiere init <span>1024</span> <span>1024</span>
$ guillotiere allocate <span>16</span> <span>32</span>
Allocated rectangle r1 of size 16x32 at origin <span>[</span><span>0</span>, <span>0</span><span>]</span>
$ guillotiere allocate <span>200</span> <span>100</span> --svg <span>01</span>.svg
Allocated rectangle r2 of size 200x100 at origin <span>[</span><span>16</span>, <span>0</span><span>]</span>
$ guillotiere deallocate r1 --svg <span>02</span>.svg

etc...
</code></pre></div>


<p>At any time in that sequence of commands I can open the <code>atlas.ron</code> file and read the state of the atlas as if I was in a debugger, can also copy it around to save the state in a way that almost feels as powerful as using <a href="https://rr-project.org/">record-and-replay debugging</a>.</p>
<h2>Fuzzing</h2>
<p>I mentioned fuzzing earlier. <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz">Cargo fuzz</a> is a joy and I really recommend using it whenever possible. It's very easy to setup, I wouldn't necessarily run it on every push, but every once in a while to find some bugs and/or get a bit of confidence about the robustness of your code. It's great. It has plenty of well written <a href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/">documentation</a> so I won't go into details here. I'll just mention that it's a very well made piece of Rust's ecosystem that contributes to the greatness of the whole in my opinion.</p>

<p>Fast forward the end of 2020. Ah 2020.</p>
<p>I was investigating further improvements to draw call batching and texture upload overhead which are big performance bottlenecks on low end Intel GPUs, especially on Windows.</p>
<p>Gathering some statistics about what causes new batches to be generated shows that it is often happening when multiple primitives use the same shader but are …</p></div></div>

<p>I recently lost access to a free email account I’ve had since before I can remember (though only temporarily, thank the lord). When it happened, I instantly became effectively uncontactable by a large portion of humanity. My own temporary disappearance from reality started me to thinking about how we can reuse existing infrastructure to store contact information in a durable and highly available way.</p>

<h2 id="searching-for-a-solution">Searching for a solution</h2>

<p>My requirements for a durable contact storage solution are (in no particular order):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Public: No authentication shoudl be required to read someone’s contact information.</li>
  <li>Globally accessible: Anyone should be able to read the information at any time, from anywhere</li>
  <li>Highly available: It should (almost) never go down. One company going bankrupt or changing strategic direction shouldn’t kill it.</li>
  <li>Censorship resistant: It should only be possible to take down records with a court order. Corporate censorship should be impossible, or at least historically infrequent.</li>
  <li>Cheap: But not free! Free services come with few no guarantees, and even fewer rights for their users.</li>
  <li>Low maintenance: User only needs to get involved when the data needs to change. No operational burden</li>
  <li>Easy to use: Clients should be able to read information trivially.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a lot of services that check some of these boxes. Twitter for instance does pretty well, but fails badly on 3, 4 &amp; 5. This is where most services fall down, so I focused there. After pondering this for a while, I realized that we’ve already got a great solution that checks all the boxes: DNS.</p>

<h3 id="highly-available">Highly available</h3>

<p>There are many services that are highly available in the technical sense, meaning they rarely crash, but suffer from economic risk. The ultimate crash is the business that provides the service going bankrupt or changing strategic direction. DNS doesn’t suffer from the same economic risk that centralized services do because there are many, many independent registrars and DNS service providers out there.</p>

<h3 id="censorship-resistance">Censorship resistance</h3>

<p>I would argue that DNS registries are censorship <em>resistant</em> based on the historical record. Whatever you think about the situation, the fact is Parler the application got vaporized in a day, but Parler.com is still registered. The Pirate Bay is one of the most taken down sites in history, and thepiratebay.org is still registered.</p>

<h3 id="cheap">Cheap</h3>

<p>This one is easy. There are loads of registrars that sell a variety of gTLD subdomains, complete with DNS service, for less than $10 per year. Enough said.</p>

<h3 id="easy-to-use">Easy to use</h3>

<p>DNS does so well on the other requirements, it’s a shame that we’d have to use some arcane protocol to query it. Oh wait…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl -s -H 'accept: application/dns-json' 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=landshark.io&amp;type=TXT'  | jq -r .Answer[].data

"v=me; email=alan.gibson@gmail.com"
"v=me; twitter=handheld"
"v=me; blog=https://landshark.io"
"v=me; gravatar=https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/123456"
"v=me; bitcoin=123456789"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>DNS over HTTP (DoH) means DNS is now trivially easy to query and hard to snoop on. Not too shabby.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-way">A better way</h3>

<p>On the Internet, I’m alan.gibson@gmail.com, as well as twitter.com/handheld, news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alangibson, and so many more. Wouldn’t it be alot simpler if  we used DNS TXT records to store all those various identifiers in one place so that you could find me anywhere just by knowing that I’m landshark.io?</p>

<p>Sounds like a pretty slick solution to me. What do you think? <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26024845">Discussion is happening in this Hacker News thread.</a></p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-78a04d1642024dbcaa69"><div><p><strong>Chapter One: The Creation of Today’s Internet and the Needs of Tomorrow’s</strong></p><p>One of the neat things about the internet is who created it, why, and how.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, the foundation of today’s internet was built through a variety of consortiums and informal working groups composed of government research labs, public universities and independent technologists. These typically not-for-profit collectives typically focused on establishing common standards that would help them share information from one server to another (i.e. messages or files), and in doing so, make it easier to collaborate on future technologies, projects and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet’s quirky provenance is responsible for many of its best modern attributes. Today, everyone can create content on the internet, everyone is technically capable of accessing everything on the internet, and every web page on the internet can connect to another without the user needing to change browser, device or client. This flexibility, interoperability and universality isn’t by decree - there’s no Head of the Internet mandating the right to create, host or access/connect to a website.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, this is a byproduct of the internet’s open standards, programming, markup languages and so on. These ensure that a user doesn’t need to pay for a web browser or to load a website, nor does the owner of a website need to pay for the code used by their website. Services like Zoom also work because they leverage actively maintained standards that are free to use and designed to support any device. Every device maker needs to support these standards in order to have happy customers. Some of us now recoil against aggressive data collection, ad insertions and tracking, but this is partly because we don’t <em>need</em> to give these up. The use of standards, such as HTML, means that browser extensions can block ads or tracking. We may be willing to give up data for a free service, but the Internet’s makeup means we don’t have to.</p><p>The benefits here are hard to overstate. But just imagine, for example, how the internet might differ if it had been created by multinational media conglomerates in order to sell things, serve ads or harvest user data for profits. Downloading a .JPG could cost money, with a .PNG costing 50% more. Teleconferencing software might have required the use of a broadband operator’s app or portal (e.g. Welcome to your Xfinity Browser™, click here for Xfinitybook™ or XfinityCalls™ powered by Zoom™). Websites might only work in Internet Explorer <em>or</em> Chrome - and need to pay a given browser an annual fee for the privilege. Or maybe users would need to pay their broadband provider extra fees to read certain programming languages or use a given web technology (“This website requires Xfinity Premium with 3D Rendering”). Regardless of the specific differences, it’s likely internet penetration would be lower, as would usage and associated commerce.</p><p>The web’s cross-platform, standards-based and non-profit origins are inseparable from the internet’s rapid growth, the trillions of dollars in companies that have been founded over the past 30 years, and the positive societal impact of these companies (e.g. a drop in the cost and increase in the quality of communications, the reduction in gatekeeper power, lowered transaction fees, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s heavily conglomerated internet giants remain mindful of the fact that open APIs, common standards, exportable data, etc., all help grow both the internet technology acceptance model and, in most cases, their own bottom lines. But these companies are less concerned with how the overall market grows than their share and control of this growth. Technology companies, almost by definition, prefer that the market build on top of or through them than have new entrants build around or in competition with them. As a result, the same companies that emerged thanks to openness tend to reject these principles where they might undermine their strategic position.</p><p>This isn’t an unusual disposition for a for-profit company, but the implications are particularly powerful in digital markets. In the offline world, free market economics enable robust competition that typically delivers the best products, variety and prices for consumers, and moderates the power of the strongest market players (if only due to diseconomies of scale). Online, incredibly powerful network effects and zero-cost marginal revenues/distribution has enabled dominant platforms to push back against the open nature of the internet, forcing consumers and creators to use them as universal intermediaries, and subduing standard market forces.</p><p>Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet. The terms used for this future vary and the degree to which you believe in one label or vision is not particularly relevant. And the technologies to design, enable and support the fullest version of this are as far from the capabilities of 2021 as the 1990s Internet is from us today. But what matters is that a growing share of our time will be spent within virtual spaces and with virtual goods — for education, work, health, politics and leisure. Sometimes these spaces and goods will be purely virtual, other times virtual twins of physical ones, and sometimes augmented reality. For related reasons, a growing percentage of our income will be spent on virtual assets, goods, experiences — many of which we’ll be able to sell, trade, share, use or improve. And of course, enormous new industries, marketplaces and resources will emerge to enable these opportunities, with novel types of labor, skills, professions and certifications invented to serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no way for this future to be developed as the original internet was. The US government and public research institutions led the development of the information superhighway in part because few in private businesses understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but also because these non-profits were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources and ambitions to build it. Conversely, all of today’s mega-tech companies are deep believers in this future internet, and are best positioned (via resources and talent) to build it.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important impediment today is Apple. Although no company has done more to propel the last 15 years of the internet, its policies are unlikely to produce the most prosperous overall ecosystem and do not lay a strong groundwork for the “next Internet”. Instead, Apple is inhibiting this future Internet. And it does so via tolls, controls, and technologies that not only deny what made and still makes the open web so powerful, but also prevents competition, and prioritize Apple’s own profits.</p><p><span><strong>Chapter Two: There’s Apple, then GAFM</strong></span></p><p>Apple’s adverse effects stem from three interconnected and increasingly powerful elements.</p><p>First, Apple believes it knows better than consumers, the developer community, and the market at large. This includes which technologies should be adopted by the internet community, the role of user agency (and the extent to which users are capable of informed consent), and common business practices around user data, privacy and security.</p><p>This disposition led Apple to limit the role of the marketplace <em>on its </em>device (something the company did not do for the Mac). Specifically, Apple mandates that on its devices:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>All applications would need to be distributed by the Apple App Store, and could not be directly downloaded from the app maker or a third party app store</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the App Store would need to be approved by Apple, and approval would be contingent upon an extensive list of policies and requirements</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the Apple App Store would need to conform with the App Store’s billing policies, which typically meant that Apple was the exclusive in-app biller for iOS applications</p></li></ol><p>These three layers are technically different — the ability to use an operating system driver has nothing to do with the ability to distribute an app to the consumer or charge for them for a given piece of content or function. However, Apple’s iOS devices forced them together. If a developer wants to make an app, they need access to native drivers. And if a developer wants access to native drivers, their apps need to be distributed by the App Store. And if they want to use the App Store, they must adhere to Apple’s policies, which means using Apple’s billing systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple’s control and integration allowed it to offer a best-in-class mobile experience that also helped repel the most pernicious aspects of the online world; onboard and engage less technically savvy users; and develop a richly monetized app ecosystem. This, in turn, led to unprecedented success. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/8/18/app-stores">Today, the iPhone has 66% market share in the United States, 75% of U.S. App Store revenues, and over 80% of time spent on the mobile internet</a> (iOS’s share of physical e-commerce transactions is likely somewhere in the middle of this range). And this dominance is also growing. Eighty percent of U.S. teenagers have iPhones and the device held 90% of smartphone activations in the week after Christmas 2020.</p><p>While Apple’s closed approach is why the company’s products are so successful, the enormity of this success is what makes this approach so problematic. There is no proprietary, closed system that affects more lives on a daily basis than that of iOS. Due to this fact, Apple has become a de facto regulator for the internet; a single for-profit body that wields enormous soft, hard, and even accidental power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are almost no large companies in the world that can live without a mobile app (these apps are …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

                <h3>My Most Productive Project Stack</h3>
                
            </p>

            <p>I have started literally hundreds of side projects and never finished any that had any sort of substance. The
projects I tend to be most successful with finishing are those I can complete in one sitting or at most one weekend
(I have made A LOT of telegram bots).</p>
<p>However, I recently <em>actually</em> finished a side project that took me multiple months… and I think i’ll be
able to do it again. By seeing a project through to completion, I learnt a lot about keeping myself motivated and,
perhaps more importantly, which tools <em>stayed (mostly) out of the way</em> to enable me to focus on the idea rather than
battling with errors.</p>
<p>This blog post is going to focus on the stack I used, and I will write another on how I launched sponsorasong and what I
learnt.</p>

<p>I have done my fair share of fundraising over the past century or so. The current options of fundraising platforms are a
little mechanical, and I felt there was a room for a little gamification (and fun).</p>
<p><a href="https://sponsorasong.com/">https://sponsorasong.com</a> is an idea I have had in my head for a long time. The concept is a fairly simple one. Here’s an
excerpt from the Product hunt launch Post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sponsor a song is a fun, new and exciting way to fundraise.</p>
<p>Those who are completing an event create a Spotify playlist and commit to listen to it
whilst they complete the event. Each person who donates gets to select one song to add
to the fundraiser’s playlist. Will you be kind and add a motivational track that you
know will help your friend hit a Personal Best or will you scheme with others to ensure
they have to listen to baby shark on repeat for the entirety of a marathon?</p>
<p>The choice is yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t be a good “founder” (I dislike this term for myself but am unsure how else to refer to myself)
if I didn’t use this as an opportunity to try and drive you to the site so if the above
does sound interesting, please check it out <a href="https://sponsorasong.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>When selecting items for the tech stack I prioritised for rapid development, speed of deployment and ease of
maintenance. I landed on the following items, and I’ll talk through why I think each of them was a great choice and why
I’ll pick them again in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nextjs.org/">next.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vercel.com/">vercel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare workers and CDN</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Relational Database Service</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nextjs">Next.js</h2>
<p>next.js is the “app” framework I have been looking for for a long time. I’m a backend engineer by trade, and find
frontend development pretty challenging due to the speed at which the space moves and CORS issues amongst other things.
If you have even basic React knowledge, after a quick tour of the docs, next.js makes development rapid.</p>
<p>Next.js has a hot reload server all ready to go, and every change you make is instantly shown in the browser. It comes
with an opinionated project structure, handles routing for you and more importantly for me
includes the ability to write server side code right next to your client side code and pass it as props.</p>
<p>The below code is enough to make a http call on the server, get the response, pass it to the frontend and display it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>function</span> <span>Page</span>({<span>data</span>}) {
    <span>return</span> (
        &lt;<span>div</span>&gt;
            {<span>data</span>}
        &lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
    )
}

<span>// This gets called on every request
</span><span></span><span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getServerSideProps</span>() {
    <span>// Fetch data from external API
</span><span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span>(<span>`https://.../data`</span>)
    <span>const</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>res</span>.<span>json</span>()

    <span>// Pass data to the page via props
</span><span></span>    <span>return</span> {<span>props</span><span>:</span> {<span>data</span>}}
}

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>Page</span>

</code></pre></div><p>This allowed me to prototype and iterate really quickly. Previously I have used Create React App and then built a separate
backend using Go or Node and switched between the code bases depending on which piece I was working on.</p>
<p>The only challenged I faced with next was when I tried to introduce some client side libraries. Next.js sometimes blurs
what is going to be executed in the frontend and what will be Server Side rendered and can make debugging issues tricky.
This could very well be due to my lack of expertise in this space though.</p>
<h2 id="vercel">Vercel</h2>
<p><a href="https://mattjamesboyle.com/posts/productive-start-up-stack/vercel.com">Vercel</a> used to be called zeit.co and before that it was now.sh. I have used it over the years to deploy static
sites (this blog was previously hosted there, its now on Cloudflare workers). However, when starting a next.js project it
pushes you towards using Vercel to deployment as it  will “just work”. To get the project deploying using Vercel,
according to the docs, you simply need to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sign up to Vercel.</li>
<li>After signing up, you’ll arrive on the “Import Project” page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket).</li>
<li>Once that’s set up, click “Import Project From …” and import your Next.js app. It auto-detects that your app is using Next.js and sets up the build configuration for you. No need to change anything — everything should work just fine!</li>
<li>After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience it really is that simple.</p>
<p>Once setup, everytime I pushed to master, a minute or 2 later my code changes were reflected on my domain. This is a really
powerful and rapid workflow, much better than anything else I have used before (which usually involved deploying multiple
containers with NGINX in front of them).</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare-workers--cdn">Cloudflare Workers &amp; CDN</h2>
<p>I’m sure you are not surprised to see Cloudflare here. I use Cloudflare for all my domain management and get page rules,
HTTPS, caching, DDOS protection and analytics for very little effort. As well as this, I used <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare workers</a>
to schedule some code I wrote to check which campaigns need to be marked as closed and update their status in the Database.
I used the Hello World template from <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/starters">here</a> and then just set up a
cron to execute the code daily in the dashboard. Wrangler made development of this very simple and was much easier than
having to set up a crontab on a linux box or deploying a cronjob to a kubernetes instance (again, how I have done this
previously).</p>
<h2 id="stripe">Stripe</h2>
<p>I needed a means to take payments, and I had some experience using Stripe. However, even if I didn’t, it is so easy to get
going and they provide so many different examples, it will be my go to for every side project.  For next.js, there is even
<a href="https://vercel.com/guides/getting-started-with-nextjs-typescript-stripe">this</a> fantastic guide to getting it all hooked up!</p>
<p>As well as helping you capture transactions easily, Stripe also provides a great dashboard for managing payouts,refunds,
disputes etc. For a lot of use cases, this means you won’t need to build out a back office system which is a huge time saver!
Up to now, the Stripe dashboard has fulfilled all my needs and I have no plans to build anything custom. I am interested
to see how long this remains the case though as I develop more complex features.</p>
<h2 id="amazon-relational-database-service">Amazon Relational Database Service</h2>
<p>I’m not sure Amazon is the cheapest or the most user friendly way to create a database, but I have experience using it and
I think one key takeaway for me for rapid development is to <em>use what you know</em>. I’m currently using the AWS free tier  Postgres
db  and with my current throughput I won’t need to upgrade anytime soon. When developing locally, I use docker-compose and
a postgres image.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The above tools helped me developer <a href="https://sponsorasong.com/">sponsor a song</a> in record time (for me) and stay motivated as I got to spend most of my time
developing features rather than battling tools. I would use all the above mentioned tools again (and intend to!).</p>
<p>I intend to write a follow-up post with how I launched the project and how it went in the next coming days.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>[TL;DR: I have an idea; not sure what to do next; guide on metrics to set in order to achieve a seed round or Series A.]</p> <h3 id="0-getting-started">0: Getting Started</h3> <p>Say you're working on a project somewhere. It might not even be a company. Nobody cares about what you're doing. How the heck will this turn into Stripe, for chrissake? "Get more users", they say. "Get revenue", they say.</p> <p>But what does that even <em>mean</em>? That sounds vague, big, ominous, and unquantifiable. And the other games, like improving <em>just a little bit</em> at getting your boss to like you or answering email feel <em>very</em> achievable. Very clear what to do next.</p> <p>The reason there aren't more startups is because it's a weird game to play. The differential in scores is giant, and the next action to take unclear. And especially when starting, <em>it's all headwind</em>. There is no inertia of success. It's really not clear what to do if you want to start SpaceX. Elon's score on the leaderboard is so large it feels useless to play the game.</p> <p>I’ve found it most useful to turn this challenge into something that feels achievable. To work as expediently as possible to get to a point where you're performing for <em>real, paying users</em> instead of your local friends, Boss, or whatever.</p> <p>This is a playbook for how to get started with very bite-sized, achievable steps. (BTW, this blog post has been implemented into software! Try out <a href="https://pioneer.app/launcher">Pioneer Launcher</a>.)</p> <h3 id="week-1-10-friends">Week #1: 10 Friends</h3> <p>Building SpaceX feels infinitely far away. But everything big starts small. Just focus on showing your product to 10 people this week. Just ten. This can be in the real world, over Zoom, whatever. Distant cousins or friends. Ten people, that is all. In the ever-connected era of the Internet, this should be very doable. Focus on the amount of interaction you have with them, not just hitting the number.</p> <p>You want these 10 people to be your base. Your core. You'll be using them as motivational fuel over the next few weeks. So make sure they really care about what you're building.</p> <p>Open iMessage. Start scrolling down. Send invites to whoever is recent. Think of yourself as planning a small party, but on the Internet instead of a bar.</p> <h3 id="week-2-100-chats">Week #2: 100 Chats</h3> <p>This is the most important step. Let's imagine the above took a week. I would then try to get to 100 users by the end of this month.</p> <p>You don't have to <em>meet</em> these people. You just need to get 100 people chatting with you. A WhatsApp group that's filled with excitable users who adore your product. If you did 10 users last week, just step it up to 20, 30, then 40 over the next 3 weeks.</p> <p>It'll get easier as you go along, both due to viral referrals and because you'll have an audience to perform for. Something to show people. That alone will give you motivational fuel.</p> <p>This, in my opinion, is the key step. Once you build your own club of 100 truly delighted customers, the feedback loop will kick in. You'll want to perform for them.</p> <h3 id="week-5-1000-revenue">Week #5: $1,000 Revenue</h3> <p>Now that you've gotten to 100 users, you might want to think about getting to $1,000 <em>dollars</em> in revenue. This shouldn't be too hard.</p> <p>All you need to do is 20% of your users (let's imagine 80% refuse) to pay you $50. Twenty people, fifty dollars. Talk to them. Figure out what they'll pay for. Build that. (It helps that you first focused on getting them to love you, they'll be more responsive.)</p> <p>You have a 100 users. Assuredly you can ask all of them this week?</p> <h3 id="week-6-10000-arr">Week #6: $10,000 ARR</h3> <p>Now that you've gotten to $1,000 in revenue, it's time to get to $10,000 in ARR. This may sound large, but it's a forgiving metric. ARR stands for annual recurring revenue, and it really only means that you need to get those same 20 people paying you $50, but each month. (These numbers are just defaults. You should be adjusting. It might be only 5 users paying you $200 a month, or 1,000 paying you $1 a month.)</p> <p>Do what makes sense to you, but make the goal achievable for yourself. Play a game you can win.</p> <p>If you make it this far quickly, we'll gladly fund you. We'll incorporate your company, fly you out to Silicon Valley, the whole shebang. (I can't blindly commit to this, obviously! But the odds are very, very high.)</p> <hr> <p>Concluding: just try and build a club of 100 people in WhatsApp in the next 30 days. Forget SpaceX, forget Stripe, or Airbnb. Get 100 loving users in a chatroom, and everything else will follow. If you need an extra jolt, check out <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a>.

  	<div><p>A <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter">bitonic sorting network</a> lays out <em>a sequence of compare-and swap operations</em> that, when applied to an array of sortable elements, sorts these elements.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://poniesandlight.co.uk/img/bitonic_merge_sort/strip.png" alt="Major steps in bitonic merge sort" title="Major steps in bitonic merge sort">
<figcaption>
    <strong>Fig. 0:</strong> Major steps of a bitonic merge sorting network applied to 1024 sortable elements.<p>The pixels in the final square are sorted by brightness, left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="why-bitonic-merge-sort">Why Bitonic Merge Sort?&nbsp;<a href="#why-bitonic-merge-sort"></a></h2>
<p>The beauty of this algorithm is that it maps really well onto parallel hardware, such as a GPU, where it has constant and relatively low performance complexity <span>\(  O(\log^2(n)) \)</span>. That is to say: It's <strong>quite fast</strong>. The implementation I'm discussing here was able to sort 1M random ints in 4ms. Compared to the 40ms I measured for C++'s <code>std::sort</code>, that's a 10x speedup! On top of that, for a given number of sortable elements, it will always take the same amount of time to complete.</p>
<p>When the algorithm executes, each worker thread performs one single operation for every pair of sortable elements: compare-and-swap. But how to choose the correct pairings for sortable elements? This is where the algorithm's complexity is buried.</p>
<h2 id="constructing-a-bitonic-sorting-network">Constructing a Bitonic Sorting Network&nbsp;<a href="#constructing-a-bitonic-sorting-network"></a></h2>
<p>First, let's look at a diagram of a relatively small sorting network, say, for 16 sortable elements. The diagram is for the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter#Alternative_representation">alternative representation of a bitonic sorting network</a>, as I found it on wikipedia. I prefer this version because it is slightly simpler: all worker threads use the same direction for their compare-and-swap operations.</p>
</div>
<figure>
<img src="https://poniesandlight.co.uk/img/bitonic_merge_sort/bitonic_sort.svg">
<figcaption>
	    <p><strong>Fig.1:</strong> Sorting diagram for 16 sortable elements<br>Horizontal lines represent array indices into our array of sortable elements, each vertical line represents one worker thread performing a compare-and-swap operation.
	    </p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<div>
<p>In the diagram, each worker thread is drawn as a vertical line, with the start- and endpoints marking the indices of the current pair of sortable elements. All coloured blocks which are in the same column form a step, wich can be executed in parallel. We can see from the diagram that the number of threads per step is constant, and that it is always <code>n/2</code>, with <code>n</code> being the number of sortable elements.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to figuring out sort index pairs for each worker thread based on each thread's execution step and thread number, lets take a step back, look at the diagram through squinted eyes and see if some patters emerge if we group similar looking blocks together.</p>
<h2 id="we-can-point-out-some-macro-patterns">We can point out some macro patterns:&nbsp;<a href="#we-can-point-out-some-macro-patterns"></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Green block: doubles in height until it reaches total number of
elements. Let's call such a block <strong>flip</strong></li>
<li>Yellow block: after each green block, there is a cascade of yellow
blocks, each half the previous height, until its height spans only
two sortable elements. Let's call such a block <strong>disperse</strong></li>
<li>Blocks are <strong>periodic</strong> within their column.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can write the following pseudo-code:</p>
</div>
<div>
		
	
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4

</span><span>8
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> n <span>=</span> <span>16</span>; <span>// n is our total number of sortable elements, must be power of 2

    do_flip(h);

        do_disperse(hh);
    }
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><h2 id="look-at-inner-patterns">Look at inner patterns:&nbsp;<a href="#look-at-inner-patterns"></a></h2>
<p>Looking at the diagram again, we see that each of the two block types, green and yellow, follow distinct patterns for how each worker thread grabs pairs of sortable elements:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://poniesandlight.co.uk/img/bitonic_merge_sort/bitonic_sort_non_repeating.svg" alt="Diagram BMS non-repeating" title="Diagram BMS non-repeating">
<figcaption>
    While worker thread lines inside green ("flip") blocks start at full height and converge towards the centre, in yellow ("disperse") blocks they start at half height, and then shift down. We also note that the only variable controlling the pattern is the overall height <code>h</code> of a yellow or green block.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can therefore split the problem in two:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find rule to calculate pairs for green (“flip”) block based on height <code>h</code>.</li>
<li>Find rule to calculate pairs for yellow (“disperse”) block based on height <code>h</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="index-pairs-for-flip-green-blocks">Index pairs for “flip” (green) blocks&nbsp;<a href="#index-pairs-for-flip-green-blocks"></a></h2>
<p>Let's enumerate sortable element index pairs from our green blocks, and label them <span>\(  T_{0\dots t} \)</span>, where <span>\(  t \)</span> represents the worker thread index to which a sortable element index pair is assigned to:</p>
<p><span>\(  \begin{align*} h = 2 &amp;: T_0 [0:1] \\  h = 4 &amp;: T_0 [0:3], T_1[1:2]\\ h = 8 &amp;: T_0 [0:7], T_1 [1:6], T_2 [2:5], T_3 [3:4]\\ \end{align*} \)</span></p>
<p>We see that we can form pairs of indices based on the following rule:</p>
<p><span>\(  T_t = [ t : h-t-1], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,h/2 \)</span></p>
<h2 id="index-pairs-for-disperse-yellow-blocks">Index pairs for “disperse” (yellow) blocks&nbsp;<a href="#index-pairs-for-disperse-yellow-blocks"></a></h2>
<p>Similarly, if we enumerate index pairs for yellow blocks we get</p>
<p><span>\(  \begin{align*} h = 2 &amp;: T_0 [0:1] \\  h = 4 &amp;: T_0 [0:2], T_1[1:3]\\ h = 8 &amp;: T_0 [0:4], T_1 [1:5], T_2 [2:6], T_3 [3:7]\\ \end{align*} \)</span></p>
<p>We see that we can form pairs of indices based on the following rule:</p>
<p><span>\(  T_t = [t : t + h/2], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,h/2 \)</span></p>
<h2 id="rules-for-rows-of-blocks">Rules for rows of blocks&nbsp;<a href="#rules-for-rows-of-blocks"></a></h2>
<p>Now, let's look at the diagram again.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://poniesandlight.co.uk/img/bitonic_merge_sort/bitonic_sort.svg" alt="Diagram BMS" title="Diagram BMS">
<figcaption>
    <strong>Fig. 3:</strong> <br>Our original diagram
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We notice that both green and yellow blocks repeat vertically until they fill out the full height of their column. We can model this repetition as a combination of modulo (the pattern is the same <em>within</em> a block) and an <span>integer-division based offset</span><span>: basically, for the offset, we quantize the <code>t</code> signal at <code>h</code>-resolution</span>.</p>
<p>As a first step, we make sure both rules for green and yellow blocks are contained within their respective height, <span>\(  h \)</span>. Note that we define these rules now for the total number of sortable elements, <span>\(  n \)</span> instead of the earlier <span>\(  h \)</span>. Instead of using <span>\(  t \)</span> “unbounded”, we introduce a new term around <span>\(  t \)</span>:</p>
</div>
<div>
		
	
<p><span>\(  T_t = [ q + (t\bmod \frac{h}{2}) : q + h-(t \bmod \frac{h}{2})-1], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,n/2 \)</span></p>
</div>
<div>
		
	
<p><span>\(  T_t = [ q + (t \bmod \frac{h}{2}) : q + (t \bmod \frac{h}{2}) + \frac{h}{2}], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,n/2 \)</span></p>
<p>What does the new term <span>\(  (t \bmod \frac{h}{2}) \)</span> do? It limits the output for the term for any given <span>\(  t \)</span> to <span>\(  0,\dots,h/2 \)</span>, something you will recognise as a condition for our earlier rules.</p>
<p>You will also have noted that both rules introduced a new variable <span>\(  q \)</span>, which represents the offset. We can express <span>\(  q \)</span> fully as a function of <span>\(  h \)</span> and <span>\(  t \)</span>:</p>
</div>
<div>
	
<p><span>\(  q = \lfloor{ (\frac{2t}{h}) } * h \)</span></p>
<p>In pseudo-code, this translates to:</p>

<p>In order to test these little formulas, and becasue I thought it would generate some nice visuals, I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/tgfrerer/b11221e91793a4361d41a8550916722f">a little C program</a> which, when given a count of sortable elements, prints a diagram, and index pairs for each step of the resulting sorting network.</p>

<p>Now that we have a reliable and tested method to generate index pairs, we can take a stab at implementing the algorithm using Vulkan Compute.</p>
<p>In Vulkan, compute tasks require us to bind a compute pipeline - which is thankfully very simple and takes a single compute shader. We'll get to the code for the compute shader in a little bit, but for now, let's look at what we need to specify in order to dispatch a compute command:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="c"><span>// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>vkCmdDispatch</span>(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    groupCountX,
    uint32_t                                    groupCountY,
    uint32_t                                    groupCountZ);
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>We need to find the group counts in <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> dimension for our dispatch command. Since we want each compute command to execute <span>one step of our bitonic sorting grid</span><span> (that's one vertical slice)</span>, let's stick to a one-dimensional invocation: I'm setting <code>groupCountY = 1</code> and <code>groupCountZ = 1</code>, since these values must be at minimum 1.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-set-for-groupcountx">What do we set for <code>groupCountX</code>?&nbsp;<a href="#what-do-we-set-for-groupcountx"></a></h2>
<p>Well, this will depend on the size of our workgroup, and the total number of sortable elements. Let's say we have <span>\(  n=16 \)</span> sortable elements. This means, we will need <span>\(  \frac{n}{2} = 8 \)</span> worker threads. Let's say each workgroup contains 8 worker threads, this means we would need to call our dispatch with a <code>groupCountX</code> of 1.</p>
</div>
<div>
	
<p>Every invocation triggers one workgroup of thread workers. In shade code, we can specify how many threads we want to have per work-group, by specifying <code>local_size_x</code>, and in this particular case, we would choose 8.</p>

This depicted that early humans must have been using animal skins to wrap themselves in the still warm hides.

Then they discovered that by drying the animal skin in sun and using salt to dehydrate, the natural rotting process of animal skin stopped. Once the skin is dried, they transformed it into clothing, shelters, and footwear.</p><p>Learn more about the origins of leather <span><a href="http://www.all-about-leather.co.uk/what-is-leather/where-does-leather-come-from.htm"><b>here</b></a></span>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="230a4e2" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="c1e8de3" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="9d58faf" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>The Rich History of Leather</h3></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="976a119" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="f4dab9f" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="9c0661f" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="892" height="787" src="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg" alt="Leather History" loading="lazy" srcset="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg 892w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-300x265.jpg 300w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-768x678.jpg 768w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-600x529.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22892%22%20height%3D%22787%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20892%20787%22%3E%3Cfilter%20id%3D%22b%22%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur%20stdDeviation%3D%2212%22%20%2F%3E%3C%2Ffilter%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23a4a4a4%22%20d%3D%22M0%200h892v783H0z%22%2F%3E%3Cg%20filter%3D%22url(%23b)%22%20transform%3D%22translate(1.7%201.7)%20scale(3.48438)%22%20fill-opacity%3D%22.5%22%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23fff%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22rotate(-91.2%20170.4%2041.6)%20scale(20.11624%20212.13655)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23797979%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22matrix(78.64675%202.45608%20-2.79717%2089.569%20110.5%2097)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23dadada%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22rotate(-102.6%20149.9%20-74.2)%20scale(64.09721%2043.26718)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23dbdbdb%22%20cy%3D%22179%22%20rx%3D%2218%22%20ry%3D%22225%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-src="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg" data-srcset="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg 892w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-300x265.jpg 300w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-768x678.jpg 768w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-600x529.jpg 600w"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="f130238" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="39134aa" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="1d912fa" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>The discovery of leather is known to be one of the earliest founds of man in history.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So I gambled…</p><p>I hoped Apple would do the right thing by developers who paid for access to the Developer Transition Kit (DTK) to get the first Apple Silicon Macs, but I was wrong and I lost.</p><blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE - 6 Feb 2020:</strong> Apple has responded to feedback from me and other disgruntled developers and so I didn’t lose as much as I thought. Apple is now giving US $500 credit, which is what developers in the US paid for the DTK, and they are extending the time limit to the end of the year. I am quite certain they will release a desktop M1 Mac before then, so I will get credit for most of the cost of the DTK (after exchange rate losses) and I will be able to use the credit towards a Mac that I want.</p><p>Thanks Apple for listening and reacting.</p></blockquote><hr><p>I paid Apple AU $779 for a year’s lease on a DTK which was effectively a Mac mini with an iPad CPU.
I also had to buy a monitor to use with it.</p><p>That was in June 2020.</p><p>In November 2020, the M1 was released which made the A14Z based DTK totally irrelevant for testing or development, so the lease effectively only lasted for 5 months. At that I was luckier than many devs as a lot of these DTK machines started failing at around the 4 month mark.</p><ul><li>I kept Apple’s secrets.</li><li>I tested their hardware and software.</li><li>I filed bug reports, a couple of which even got acknowledged.</li></ul><p>And in return, I get asked to send back the DTK some months early for which I will get the princely reward of US $200 credit.</p><p>When Apple switched over to Intel CPUs, they gave the DTK buyers a free computer when they returned the DTK, but of course Apple wasn’t a trillion dollar company back then so they could afford to be generous. (How does one indicate heavy sarcasm in text?)</p><p>I don’t want a laptop, I want a desktop Mac, so there is nothing to spend my $200 credit on yet, but as a final sting in the tail, Apple has decreed that the credit expires at the end of May 2021. There is no guarantee that there will be desktop Mac to buy before then. Only Apple knows that and they have made me cynical enough to consider that they might decide not to release any new Macs until after these credits expire.</p><p>I realize that Apple made no commitment to do anything after the DTK program was over, but history indicated they would.</p><p>The smallness of the credit and the short time limit on it seem unnecessarily petty and punitive, especially when the people they are punishing are the ones that add so much value to the Apple platforms.</p><p>Assuming I have to get a laptop, I will want a high-powered one as it will have to be able to run Xcode. Apple’s flagship developer tool is famously demanding.</p><ul><li><p>In the US, the one I want costs US $1,899</p></li><li><p>Here in Australia, it is AU $2,899 - 1.53 times the US price.</p></li></ul><p>The US$200 credit will use the exchange rate at 23 December 2020, which for USD - AUD was 1.3218 which is significantly lower than the ratio in Apple’s pricing between the two countries.</p><p>This means that I will get AU $264.36 for my credit, which is 9% of the cost of the computer to replace it, even though that is not the computer I actually want.</p><p>Financially, I would have been much better off waiting until the M1s were released. But Apple needed the early machines tested, so they suckered us in and then slapped us in the face.</p><p>I wonder how Tim Cook and the others can stand up again and again and say that they value their developers. Does that not make them feel ashamed? Or maybe they struggle not to laugh while saying it?</p><p>Thanks Apple.</p><p>And good luck finding suckers to test your next round of new hardware.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>While Tinybird is not a log analysis tool per se, it’s a tool that you can use as the foundation to analyze logs-like datasets at scale. Here you’ll learn:</p> <ul> <li>how to use it to analyze NGINX logs</li> <li>how to publish your SQL queries as API endpoints to be used in other tools</li> <li>and how to model your data sources and endpoints to make it 10X faster.</li> </ul> <p>An NGINX log looks like this:</p>  <p>It’s not a CSV file but a “space separated file” so in principle Tinybird wouldn’t load it because we just support CSV files. But if we analyze the file using our <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html">CLI tool</a>:</p>  <p>The delimiter is guessed so it can be loaded.</p>  <p>The format looks like this:</p>  <p>We need to transform it to something useful. To transform data we use a pipe.</p>  <p>Now let’s query the new pipe:</p>  <p>You could now publish an endpoint:</p>  <p>So far so good. But what happens when you have millions of entries a day, the generated endpoints wouldn’t be as fast as needed. For example, for endpoints serving real time dashboards, where the user can pick different date ranges, add filters and so on, waiting for more than a second is not the best solution. So there is an easy solution: generate views as data arrives.</p> <p>So, let’s create a Materialized view (MV from now on) for the previous endpoint:</p>  <p>There are many things to notice:</p> <ul> <li>The materialized view SQL is almost the same than the endpoint but instead of count it uses countState and the same for avg. Those -State modifiers are needed when pushing data to a MV. The datasource where the MV pushes the data has two columns with a special data type to store those <code>-State</code></li> <li>The Engine is not the regular MergeTree, it’s an <code>AggregatingMergeTree</code> that tells ClickHouse to aggregate columns on merge operations (executed periodically, you don’t need to worry about that)</li> <li>The sorting key tells ClickHouse which column we are grouping by</li> </ul> <p>We push the files</p>  <p>We use <code>--push-deps</code> to upload all the dependencies and <code>--populate</code> to fill the materialized view with the data already in <code>log_transform</code></p> <p>Now we check the amount of rows in that table:</p>  <p>If we push new data with new IP addresses, the amount of rows will rise but, comparing the amount of rows in the original table with the MV datasource, you can understand why it is going to be faster. And the good thing - this table is updated when you push new data, it does not need to be recalculated.</p>  <p>The last thing is to change the endpoint to use the new table</p>   <p>Let’s test the endpoint and compare with the old one</p>  <p>Both are really fast but the last one is one order of magnitude faster.</p> <p>You could create MV for any case you can think of, for example:</p> <ul> <li>unique ip addreeses by day: <code>select toDate(time) day, uniqState(ip_address) uniq_ip from log_transform group by day</code></li> <li>percentile 95 of payload size per hour: <code>select toStartOfHour(time) hour, quantileState(0.95)(ip_address) q95 from log_transform group by hour</code></li> <li>requests per month: <code>select toStartOfMonth(time) month, countState() requests_count from log_transform group by month</code></li> </ul> <p>Materialized views are a really powerful feature specially when you are creating real time endpoints.</p> <p>We created a <a href="https://github.com/tinybirdco/log_parsing_template">github repo</a> with the data project so you can reproduce the post commands in your Tinybird account and start analysing your own logs.</p> </div>  </article>  </div> </div></div>]]>

        <p><em>Most of the time, a backend is just a layer between APIs and a database. Using the Postgrest project and
                some SQL we will build a backend without any Java, Golang, C# etc…</em></p>
        <p><em>For this Demo, we will build a chat application with channels, messages, users and user profiles.</em>
        </p>
        <p><code>March 02,2020</code></p>
        <h2 id="firstadatabase">First, a database</h2>
        <p>Database, an essential tool for every project on the web. Relationnal databases are not new… almost 50 years
            !
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database</a>
        </p>
        <p>With stored procedures, views, user management, roles and a query langage we all know we can do whatever we
            want on our data. With frameworks, ORM and other tools that makes great integration between Object langages
            and Relational Databases we spend most of time using them to access data in a simple way, so simple that we
            can do directly with SQL.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">https://www.postgresql.org/</a> is a very popular open source database
            system, so let's go with it.</p>
        <p>Now our docker-compose file starts with : </p>
        <pre><code>version: '3'
        services:
          db:
            image: postgres
            ports:
              - "5432:5432"
            environment:
              POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
        </code></pre>
        <h2 id="anauthenticationserverkeycloakwithpleaseopenit">An authentication server : keycloak with please-open.it
        </h2>
        <p>Go to <a href="https://console.please-open.it/">https://console.please-open.it</a> and subscribe to a free
            keycloak realm. It is the easiest way to start.</p>
        <p>This realm will provide JWT tokens we need to authenticate users on our DB. JWT tokens are signed with a
            private key. We need to retreive a public key in order to verify token signature.
            Go to "realm settings", "keys", and get the public key for RSA RS256 algorithm.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/public_key.png" alt="public_key"></p>
        <p>This key is in PEM format. For postgrest, we need it in JWK.
            A simple tool online can do it for you : <a href="https://8gwifi.org/jwkconvertfunctions.jsp">https://8gwifi.org/jwkconvertfunctions.jsp</a></p>
        <p>Add "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----" and "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" delimiters, paste your key and transform it
            to JWK.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/pem_to_jwk.png" alt="pem to jwk"></p>
        <h3 id="createaclient">Create a client</h3>
        <p>A client for a web frontend is needed, to get an access<em>token after login. Go to "clients" and create a
                new one. This client in this example is named "frontend". Choose access type "public", and define the
                redirect</em>uri to "https://playground.please-open.it/" for now.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/new_client.png" alt="new client"></p>
        <h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
        <p>Go to "roles" tab in the client, we need only 2 roles : standard and admin. Create them, after we will
            associate to users.
            <img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/roles.png" alt="roles"></p>
        <h3 id="users">Users</h3>
        <p>2 users "standard" and 1 "admin". </p>
        <p>After creating a user, remove all "required user actions", go to "credentials" and attribute a new password.
            In "Role Mappings", select your client "frontend" and add a "standard", or "admin" role.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/role_mapping.png" alt="add roles"></p>
        <h3 id="webapplication">Web application</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to obtain a token, is your (playground)[https://playground.please-open.it]. An opensource web
            application, oauth2 client for keycloak and token introspection.
            In "parameters", put your realm id and client id. Now we are ready to retreive a new token. Click on
            "login", enter a user credentials and the redirect will do the job.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/login.png" alt="login"></p>
        <p>An access_token is retreived and decoded. The base64 encoded will be used later, in each api call.</p>
        <h2 id="restapispostgrest">REST APIs : postgrest</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational<em>state</em>transfer</a>
        </p>
        <p><a href="http://postgrest.org/en/v6.0/">Postgrest</a> is a standalone app with a web server, turning a
            database directly into a RESTful API. Sometimes the only way we are using ORM for.</p>
        <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
        <p>Authentication is ensured by JWT tokens. Postgrest verifies the signature with the given key (using
            "PGRST<em>JWT</em>SECRET" variable), then get a role in the token's payload.</p>

        <p>An anonymous role gives access to data without any authentication. We gives to postgrest a name of an
            anonymous role. By using this, all resources granted to this role will be accessible without a token.</p>

        <p>Go to <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/">https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/</a> and open "Live

        <p>Only select is permitted on web_anon.</p>
        <p>Now we register a new role "standard" which corresponds to the role we created previously in keycloak.
            With the configuration, postgrest will check in JWT token at resource<em>access.frontend.roles[0] value is

        <p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24965293">ranted on HN </a>the other day about Google Meet's user interface gore.</p><blockquote>Aside: Imagine you’re driving down the road and you need to make a right turn. Well, for some reason the steering wheel is stowed away and disappeared! You need to hover your hand around the center console in a specific area to be able to expose it. Out comes the steering wheel and now you can make a right turn.<p>Google UX/UI team: Please fucking make the mute/unmute button visible at all times.</p></blockquote><p>Seems like someone at Google read the comment and the bottom bar is now always visible. It used to autohide after 3 seconds and it was one of the most infuriating things about Google Meet.</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png" alt="Google Meet UI Screenshot showing the bottom bar with Mute/Unmute button always visible." srcset="https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 600w, https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1000w, https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1600w, https://neil.computer/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1918w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bottom bar with the Mute button is always visible now.</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing if you're muted or unmuted is probably the number 1 most important interface element of any A/V conference application. What's more surprising is that are other icons on the top-right corner that are always visible. So, someone at Google UX/UI team thought that the mute button is less important and the whole bottom bar must autohide to clear the clutter. Ooofff.

We've just seen exactly that.</p><blockquote>Isn't this sort of a Fizz Buzz for a UX/UI design professional? I don't mean to demean anyone, but I see this sort of a thing literally everywhere. Hiding important and absolutely <em>crucial</em> information (that can make or break your product) in the name of minimalism. Coming out of a company that has one of the highest hiring bars for software engineering, and yet, their products have such an awful UX/UI. This isn't an exception, it is a pattern.</blockquote><p>What do you know!? The exact shitty Google Meet pattern is repeated by UX/UI team at Microsoft! It's as if they're copying UX/UI without thinking for themselves.</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2021/02/teams.gif" alt="Video showing Microsoft Teams webapp autohiding Mute/Unmute controls"><figcaption>Microsoft Teams - Autohiding the most important controls.</figcaption></figure><p>After a few seconds, the control bar disappears, but the left-hand side panel is always visible.

From the ground up, from fundamentals, from axioms of human behavior, from analytical standpoint, with experimental insights, and then a mandatory - "Aesthetics is secondary" course. If your knee-jerk reaction to what I just said is "But, Aesthetics sells." - yes it does, if you're selling trinkets and wind-catchers at a tourist shop. Not for business critical applications.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>UX/UI professionals need to study deeply how humans and machines interact. I remember referencing the classic High Performance HMI book many years ago in engineering college. Obviously nuclear powerplant operators and their interface needs are not exactly the same as a corporate manager trying to make a funny joke out of "Oh, I was on mute.", but I think there is some value in atleast understanding the methodologies and formalisms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering">Engineering rigor and systems engineering</a> approach can be applied to many other fields.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA">ReCAPTCHA</a> is often the first tool that many webmasters reach for when confronted with the need to stop spam and automated malicious traffic from harming their services. In this post I explain several reasons why ReCAPTCHA is usually not the best solution to use for this purpose, as it is often unnecessary, inconveniences users, and subjects users to intensive tracking and fingerprinting that they are not able to opt-out of. Several alternative solutions to ReCAPTCHA for various threat models are presented as well as best practices for implementing captchas in general. <br></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="436" height="119" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png" alt="" srcset="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png 436w, https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-300x82.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"><figcaption>The face of evil</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>ReCAPTCHA is yet another free-of-charge product offered benevolently by Google for any webmaster to implement within their own services. How does ReCAPTCHA differentiate legitimate human users from bots? ReCAPTCHA relies extensively on user fingerprinting, putting emphasis on the question of “Which human is this user?” rather than the ordinary “Is this user human?”. It’s worth noting how much easier it is to successfully solve ReCAPTCHAs when the user is logged into their Google account, thus allowing Google to associate their actions with their real identity. A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/9vmsyp/google_recaptchas_targeting_firefox_and_other/">similar effect</a> is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20147015">often reported</a> for users of non-Google browsers, who notice ReCAPTCHAs take more time to complete in Firefox over Chrome. This is in-line with <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-mozilla-vp-says-google-intentionally-damaged-firefox/">many other anti-competitive techniques</a> that Google has used over the years to help grow their market share.</p>



<p>Although determining
exactly how ReCAPTCHA works is very difficult, with Google not only
heavily obfuscating its JavaScript, but also implementing an entire
VM in JavaScript with its own bytecode language, there have still
been many attempts to reverse-engineer some of the client-side code,
as well as to theorize about how the server-side logic operates.
<a href="https://github.com/toogle/InsideReCaptcha">Initial attempts</a>
at reverse-engineering ReCAPTCHA show copious amounts of information
belong collected, including but not limited to: plugins, user agent,
IP address, screen resolution, execution times, timezone, language,
click/keyboard/touch information within the frame of the captcha,
test results of many browser-specific functions and CSS evaluation,
information about canvas element rendering, and cookies, including
those affiliated with your Google account that were placed within the
last 6 months.</p>



<p>There is a good reason why ReCAPTCHA uses the google.com domain instead of one specific to ReCAPTCHA. This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google’s other services, which most users use. ReCAPTCHA collects enough information that it could reliably de-anonymize many users that simply wish to prove that they are Not A Robot. As JavaScript is now required to even view a ReCAPTCHA, even a user running software such as TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) may find themselves giving away more information than they intend to, for example if they have resized their browser window (which is discouraged for exactly this reason).</p>



<p>Correspondingly, webmasters that use Google’s ReCAPTCHA on their websites must link to both Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Privacy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en">Terms</a> pages (included in the form by default in a small 8px style that makes them appear unclickable). Although Google used to have its own privacy and terms pages for ReCAPTCHA, these links are no longer specific to ReCAPTCHA, but rather are the privacy and terms pages for all users of Google services in general, regardless of which service is being used, or if the user has (or even wants) a Google account to begin with. Therefore accepting these terms (implicitly, by attempting to prove you are Not A Robot) grants Google permission to do <strong>everything</strong> that they do to their regular users of their services to you, and little information is available as to what specifically is done (GDPR is likely to be unhelpful here, given ReCAPTCHA’s spam-stopping purpose). Not only are the unhelpful links in the ReCAPTCHA box never opened by users, but there is also no Google logo or visual reference to indicate that ReCAPTCHA is a Google service, so many users have zero indication that they have just consented to all of Google’s tracking just because they tried to leave feedback or create a ticket on your website. If you thought you could use the Internet without using Google’s services, try using the Internet without filling out a single ReCAPTCHA, which for some users is required to pay their bills, file their taxes, and sometimes even use Government websites (if you somehow manage this, next try never sending email to Gmail/Gsuite addresses or using Google APIs for a more exciting challenge). Good luck.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that caring about user privacy to this extent is likely to be outside of the scope of concern for most websites. Many websites are already so tightly coupled to Google’s services (commonly including Google analytics, Google ads, Google APIs, Google tag manager, Google static resources, Google OAuth, Google Compute Engine, and many others) that the addition of a Google captcha appears negligible. With that said, different websites have different values and different users, and many do not want to require users to agree to Google’s tracking and labor for basic usage. The level of centralization that ReCAPTCHA forces is not good for anyone except Google.</p>



<p>Apart from the privacy implications of ReCAPTCHA usage, the actual captcha is very tedious for many classes of users, sometimes becoming so difficult that users find themselves unable to to complete the captcha at all. <a href="https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/286">Users hate ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8yezeq/fuck_recaptcha/">They</a> <a href="https://devrant.com/rants/1754031/fuck-recaptcha-fuck-google-for-making-recaptcha-fuck-it-dont-be-evil-my-foot">really</a> <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-select-all-images-with-a-street-sign-recaptcha-is-a-godless-creation-of-evil.1410504/">hate</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19059390">ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://recaptcha.sucks/">ReCAPTCHA</a> <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2019/04/make-recaptchas-im-not-a-robot-accurate">is</a> <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/recaptcha-is-uxs-worst-nightmare-c28b7341e88a">so</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/9haexn/googles_recaptcha_needs_to_be_fucking_made_illegal/">hated</a> that <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">some websites</a> have a profit model of charging users $20 annually to disable ReCAPTCHA, which <strong>thousands </strong>of users pay for. If this sounds like a great new business model to you and now you want to add ReCAPTCHAs to every page of your website to attempt to maximize profit, I will find you. And I will force you to complete a ReCAPTCHA every time you want food or water until you die from malnutrition after the first week. I have read countless posts from users that became so frustrated with a service that used excessive ReCAPTCHAs that they swore to never use the offending website again. These are often intelligent users with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#version-2-are-you-a-robot">no disabilities</a> who are simply tired of being treated like dirt and wasting their time. Be kind to your users and help minimize the amount of ReCAPTCHAS that they have to solve just to be allowed to use the Internet.</p>



<p>ReCAPTCHAs become significantly more difficult if the user attempts to ‘opt-out’ of Google’s services and tracking by using software that hinders it, such as VPNs, TBB, and many anti-tracking browser addons and modifications. To demonstrate what is meant by ‘very tedious’, below is a real-time recording of myself solving a single ReCAPTCHA using TBB:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-1.webm"></video><figcaption>Spambots are known to give up when forced to be patient</figcaption></figure>



<p>I got lucky and only needed to complete two challenges. Sometimes there are ten or more. Watching the above video, you might think to yourself “I knew the tor network was slow, but I didn’t know it was <em>that</em> slow!”. You would be correct to take note of this discrepancy. If we open up the web developer console, we can see that the HTTP requests for new captcha images only take a few hundred milliseconds. Despite this, Google’s heavily-obfuscated JavaScript intentionally delays the appearance of the new images by several seconds every time, which I’m sure has something to do with the fact that bots give up when forced to wait, probably. This is not a nice way to treat users that don’t want to perform unpaid labor and be fingerprinted by Google. Keep in mind that the above video demonstrates one of the worst possible cases of ReCAPTCHA UX (which some <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/31088-morecaptcha/code">userscripts</a> may improve), and that the average user has a significantly quicker experience, providing that they are not attempting to thwart any of Google’s tracking and don’t make many mistakes.</p>



<p>In addition to this tediousness, the actual labor that the user is performing is directly used to benefit Google. Worry not however, as Google is eager to brag about the selfless humanitarianism that you’re engaging in by choosing ReCAPTCHA, stating the following on their main ReCAPTCHA <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/">page</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Hundreds of millions of captchas are solved by people every day. ReCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by channeling the time spent solving captchas into digitizing text, annotating images, building machine learning datasets.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This
is certainly a very rosy way of convincing
you to feel good about forcing
your users to engage in unpaid labor that directly benefits the
world’s most powerful surveillance corporation. ReCAPTCHA
is free for a reason.</p>



<p>Lastly, ReCAPTCHA is popular. Very popular. While this brings some advantages, it also means that there’s significant efforts to break ReCAPTCHA, and those efforts all potentially affect your website, with your captcha implementation being perfectly identical to a million others. As a result of this, there have been <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf">many</a> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/wangz3/publications/ccs18.pdf">papers</a> <a href="https://uncaptcha.cs.umd.edu/papers/uncaptcha_woot17.pdf">published</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha">that</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2">break</a> <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6368/eaag2612">ReCAPTCHA</a> over the years, generally with Google making modifications to improve their captcha afterwards. There have also been <a href="https://2captcha.com/">paid-for</a> <a href="https://www.deathbycaptcha.com/">services</a> that use human labor to solve captchas on behalf of a paying client for less than a cent each. For a modern and user-friendly example of bypassing ReCAPTCHA, see Buster. <a href="https://github.com/dessant/buster">Buster</a> is a modern browser extension (Firefox+Chrome+Opera) which helps you to solve difficult captchas by completing reCAPTCHA audio challenges for you by using speech recognition.</p>











<p>Before implementing a captcha, it’s worth considering if one is
necessary to begin with. To help with evaluating this proposition,
consider if your threat model is concerned over <em>customized</em> or
<em>uncustomized</em> spam. Uncustomized spam is pervasive across many
Internet protocols, and you will encounter it quickly after enabling
HTTP, SSH, or …</p></div></div>

		<p>Gasoline and diesel engines, which are powered by fossil fuels, will soon be sidelined by climate change. Instead, new propulsion systems will be required. One fuel with a big potential is hydrogen. Hydrogen vehicles are equipped with a reinforced tank that is fueled at a pressure of 700 bar. This tank feeds a fuel cell, which converts the hydrogen into electricity. This in turn drives an electric motor to propels the vehicle. In the case of passenger cars, this technology is well advanced, with several hundred hydrogen-powered automobiles already in operation on German roads. At the same time, the network of hydrogen stations in Germany is projected to grow from 100 to 400 over the next three years. Yet hydrogen is not currently an option for small vehicles such as electric scooters and motorcycles, since the pressure surge during refilling would be too great. Does this effectively shut out such vehicles from hydrogen technology?</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE: the hydrogen technology for small vehicles</b></h4> 
<p>Not at all! Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have now come up with a hydrogen-based fuel that is ideal for small vehicles: POWERPASTE, which is based on solid magnesium hydride. “POWERPASTE stores hydrogen in a chemical form at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to be then released on demand,” explains Dr. Marcus Vogt, research associate at Fraunhofer IFAM. And given that POWERPASTE only begins to decompose at temperatures of around 250 °C, it remains safe even when an e-scooter stands in the baking sun for hours. Moreover, refueling is extremely simple. Instead of heading to the filling station, riders merely have to replace an empty cartridge with a new one and then refill a tank with mains water. This can be done either at home or underway.</p> 
<p>The starting material of POWERPASTE is magnesium, one of the most abundant elements and, therefore, an easily available raw material. Magnesium powder is combined with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at 350 °C and five to six times atmospheric pressure. An ester and a metal salt are then added in order to form the finished product. Onboard the vehicle, the POWERPASTE is released from a cartridge by means of a plunger. When water is added from an onboard tank, the ensuing reaction generates hydrogen gas in a quantity dynamically adjusted to the actual requirements of the fuel cell. In fact, only half of the hydrogen originates from the POWERPASTE; the rest comes from the added water. “POWERPASTE thus has a huge energy storage density,” says Vogt. “It is substantially higher than that of a 700 bar high-pressure tank. And compared to batteries, it has ten times the energy storage density.” This means that POWERPASTE offers a range comparable to – or even greater than – gasoline. And it also provides a higher range than compressed hydrogen at a pressure of 700 bar.</p> 
<h4><b>Suitable for e-scooters – and other applications as well</b></h4> 
<p>With its huge energy storage density, POWERPASTE is also an interesting option for cars, delivery vehicles and range extenders in battery-powered electric vehicles. Similarly, it could also significantly extend the flight time of large drones, which would thereby be able to fly for several hours rather than a mere 20 minutes. This would be especially useful for survey work, such as the inspection of forestry or power lines. In another kind of application, campers might also use POWERPASTE in a fuel cell to generate electricity to power a coffeemaker or toaster.</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE helps overcome lack of infrastructure</b></h4> 
<p>In addition to providing a high operating range, POWERPASTE has another point in its favor. Unlike gaseous hydrogen, it does not require a costly infrastructure. This makes it ideal for areas lacking such an infrastructure. In places where there are no hydrogen stations, regular filling stations could therefore sell POWERPASTE in cartridges or canisters instead. The paste is fluid and pumpable. It can therefore be supplied by a standard filling line, using relatively inexpensive equipment. Initially, filling stations could supply smaller quantities of POWERPASTE – from a metal drum, for example – and then expand in line with demand. This would require capital expenditure of several tens of thousands of euros. By way of comparison, a filling station to pump hydrogen at high pressure currently costs between one and two million euros for each fuel pump. POWERPASTE is also cheap to transport, since no costly high-pressure tanks are involved nor the use of extremely cold liquid hydrogen.</p> 
<h4><b>Pilot center planned for 2021</b></h4> 
<p>Fraunhofer IFAM is currently building a production plant for POWERPASTE at the Fraunhofer Project Center for Energy Storage and Systems ZESS. Scheduled to go into operation in 2021, this new facility will be able to produce up to four tons of POWERPASTE a year – not only for e-scooters.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may have stumbled upon this page after visiting <a href="https://privanote.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PrivaNote (privanote.xyz)</a>.</p><p>PrivaNote is an offline first, end-to-end encrypted note taking solution. It's one of the first applications built on top of Portabella and serves as a reference for other developers looking to build their own apps.</p><p>PrivaNote is <a href="https://github.com/portabellainc/privanote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a> so please take a look at the source code if anything is unclear. We've also released a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privanote-extension/bmpjebghajghighjhanphoekfenjkeao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome extension</a> and a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/privanote-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox addon</a> to help you take notes as seamlessly as possible.</p><p>With that said, let's dive into how we built this!</p><h3>Overview<a href="#overview" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>PrivaNote is a <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a> application with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TailwindCSS</a> to make it look pretty. The editor is a reasonably customised <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slate</a> instance. Setting up these components to play nicely is a breeze thanks to modern tooling.</p><p>Without setting up the encrypted backup PrivaNote will write to your browsers IndexedDB or LocalStorage. After setting up and initialising your Portabella configuration it will read and write from there.</p><h3>Scaffolding out application<a href="#scaffolding-out-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Our initialisation script looked a little like this:</p><p>We took a lot of inspiration for our editor from one of the examples the <a href="https://github.com/udecode/slate-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slate-plugins</a> library provides.</p><h3>Reading/writing notes from/to IndexedDB<a href="#readingwriting-notes-fromto-indexeddb" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>After scaffolding our application we needed to ensure it's offline first. That means we should be able to use it without an internet connection and without Portabella. For this we leveraged the <a href="https://github.com/localForage/localForage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">localForage</a> library. It tries to use IndexedDB and then falls back to LocalStorage if the browser doesn't have it.</p><p>We could have written this layer ourselves but it just made sense to bring in a dependency to make sure we didn't mess anything up.</p><p>To read all of our notes it looks a bit like this:</p><p>Creating a note is as easy as:</p><p>We won't show you the delete operation because, well, you get the gist.</p><h3>Reading/writing notes from/to Portabella<a href="#readingwriting-notes-fromto-portabella" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Setting up our Portabella integration is a little trickier. We have a few additional constraints here, we need to:</p><ul><li>save Portabella config in our local database</li><li>check if they have Portabella config before falling back to the local database storage</li><li>prompt users to setup their Portabella integration (after 10 seconds to not be annoying).</li></ul><p>Let's cover reading and writing data before we get to the administrative tasks. Writing a note to Portabella leveraging the <a href="https://github.com/portabellainc/privanote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@portabella/sdk</a> is as easy as:</p><p>Reading all our notes (when we refresh the page for example looks like):</p><p>The SDK takes care of decrypting everything for us so we don't need to worry about getting data we can't read.</p><h3>Prompting for Portabella credentials<a href="#prompting-for-portabella-credentials" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Before we can do the above operations we need to ensure we actually have Portabella config so we can initialise the SDK and make requests.</p><p>To do this we want to prompt the user to setup their integration after 10 seconds on PrivaNote. Additionally we don't want to prompt them again if they've already said yes (or no).</p><p>Our React <code>useEffect</code> hook looks a bit like this:</p><p>Doing it this way allows for a seamless end user experience.</p><h3>Packaging it as a browser extension<a href="#packaging-it-as-a-browser-extension" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The final piece of the puzzle is packaging up the Next.js application for use as a browser extension. Having to manually open privanote.xyz everytime you want to take notes is a bit cumbersome, so the idea is to override the "new tab" page of your browser. That means pressing CMD (or CTRL) + N will open up PrivaNote, allowing you to jott down thoughts without thinking twice about it.</p><p>Here's our script we used to do this:</p><p>The most interesting lines are the ones that contain <code>_next</code> and <code>next</code>. Chrome won't let browser extensions import JavaScript files that start with an underscore. So trying to add a <code>&lt;script src="/_next/a.js" /&gt;</code> tag won't work out of the box, we need to replace <code>_next</code> with <code>next</code> (or any string you prefer). The <code>sed</code> command shown here works on Mac OS but you might have to fiddle with it if you're using a different OS.</p><h3>Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Thanks for taking the time to checkout this tutorial, as we said PrivaNote is one of the first applications built on top of Portabella so we'll continue to improve documentation and APIs as we go and discover what's useful to people.</p><p>If you have any questions feel free to reach on Twitter to us <a href="https://twitter.com/portabellaio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@portabellaio</a> or via email <a href="mailto:hello@portabella.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hello@portabella.io</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>1. Close your business while it’s working</strong></p>

<p>I opened my first business right out of high school. I had a few thousand dollars saved up and I wanted to start a business. I found a tiny office space on a busy road and shook hands with the landlord. My Dad helped me make a sign using a piece of wood and a vinyl sticker. I purchased two computer systems and set them up on folding tables. I purchased a desk and a chair and put those in the back of my space, like a small used car salesman. Suddenly, I was selling custom built computer systems using off the shelf parts.</p>

<p>A few months later I got a call from my high school. I told the caller what I was up to and he informed me that the school would receive a small grant because I was working in the industry I had aspired to less than a year after graduation.</p>

<p>Then, I fell in love. No, that’s not right, I was in love before I had even started this. But, the conversation had turned to marriage and children. The business was working okay, but I didn’t think I was doing well enough to support a family. I needed a real job making real money. After working in the store for just nine months, I applied at a local tech company and walked away from my little business.</p>

<p>Three months later I would hire an accountant to do my taxes. I handed him a shoe box full of receipts and invoices and let him figure it out. When he handed me my first <em>Schedule C</em> I nearly hit the floor. I was showing a business loss that was more money than I had ever imagined. He explained that I would be able to write this loss off, in parts, over the next seven years.</p>

<p>But, remember, I had come into this business with only a few thousand dollars. If I had <em>lost</em> that kind of money, I had also <em>made</em> that money to lose. If I were paying attention, I think the business would have been profitable. But, I wasn’t paying attention, and the business had closed months ago.</p>

<p><strong>2. Get a cease and desist from your own employer</strong></p>

<p>Remember that Tech job I landed to make real money? Turns out, that was a good move. The company I joined was Iomega and they were roaring. They had recently released the Zip drive and had gone from 100k in annual revenue to a two billion dollar company. With that kind of growth, money and promotions were all around me. I loved the job and the people I was working with. I was climbing the corporate ladder and loving it.</p>

<p>Iomega also made the higher end Jaz drive, and all of us had one (or two) on our desks. Some of my co-workers were complaining about a problem though. The Jaz drive would spin-down, after two minutes or so, to conserve energy. The next time you accessed the drive, it took 20 or 30 seconds for it to spin up.</p>

<p>I had access to an internal engineering manual for the drive, so I dived in. I concluded that the drives were designed to spin down mostly to save energy. Based on the numbers I had, I figured they would last more than 10 years, even if they were running 24/7. But, there was no way to configure them to stay spinning. The sleep was built into the firmware of the drive itself.</p>

<p>That’s when I got the idea for my first Shareware program. It was a simple Windows utility that I called JazAwake. It would write a tiny file to the Jaz drive every 60 seconds and then delete it. The file was just big enough that it would flush it to disk. Because the drive was being written too every minute or so, it would no longer spin down.</p>

<p>The program was popular both inside the company and out. All of my co-workers were using it and people were starting to pay to register it.</p>

<p>Then I got a letter from one of the lawyers at Iomega. It was addressed to my software company. It was a cease and desist asking me to stop using the Jaz trademark and remove JazAwake from the Internet. At first, I laughed. How can you remove a piece of software from the Internet? That’s impossible. But, nothing short of that would stop them from suing me.</p>

<p>Luckily, they didn’t realize I also worked there, or I imagine I would have lost my job too.</p>

<p>I went to work creating my own cease and desist letter explaining what I had done and started mailing them to every organization that had written about or linked to my software. I had to send these letters to over a hundred different companies. I went back and forth with the lawyers at Iomega for about 6 months and when they could no longer find the software online, they were satisfied.</p>

<p>I stayed at Iomega for a couple more years and I created another popular Shareware program called ButtonWiz. When Iomega started to lose steam, I left for a smaller company.</p>

<p><strong>3. Close your side business and focus on the promise of becoming CEO</strong></p>

<p>I got a job at a small technology company that served only about 100 customers. But, the owner had created something useful and he was making enough money to pay for himself and another employee. He didn’t want to make too much profit, because that meant paying more taxes and quarterly tax paperwork. He would watch the books so that his profit was less than $4k per year. If we had made too much money for the year, by October or November, he would spend some of it on new things we needed for the office or employee bonuses. It worked out really well.</p>

<p>The owner was getting up there in age and he figured he would like to retire in another 10 years or so. None of his family was interested in the business he had built and he had no real plan to exit. So, he had the idea that he would hand the business to me at some point and I would continue to pay him well into retirement. He purchased a life insurance policy and set me as the beneficiary. If he died before he was able to retire, I could pay his family and continue to run the business.</p>

<p>ButtonWiz continued to get more and more popular and was now bringing in a few hundred dollars a month. One day the boss suggested that I stop working on my side projects and double-down at the office. So, I shelved work on ButtonWiz and let it wither away over the next few years while I focused on the company I worked for.</p>

<p>Now eight years into my Career here, the company had grown from the two of us to around ten employees. Among those employees a few family members had been introduced, but I was still employee number two. Then the boss dropped a bomb that didn’t completely surprise me. There were people in the family showing interest now and he had decided to keep the business in the family. I can’t blame him. One of the reasons I’ve always wanted to build a business is to support my family and, if it’s really successful, more of those around me. But, suddenly, my career felt like another job, so I started to look elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>4. Break Googles TOS and accidentally commit click fraud while your at it</strong></p>

<p>Growing more and more frustrated with the stress of my job, I started to run. I would run at a park by my office every day on my lunch break. I also started watching my weight and I started writing software again.</p>

<p>I had tried a bunch of calorie trackers but logging all the specific foods I ate was too much for me. I decided to create a calorie tracker that was fast. I would just enter the number of calories I ate and the web app would timestamp them. No more looking up foods.</p>

<p>At the top of the app I created a search box and I pointed that to a webview that opened to Google. I modified the search a little by adding the word “calories” to the end of it. That way, I could search for something like “pizza” and it would return a set of results for “pizza calories”, often with the actual number of calories right there at the top. I also signed up for Google advertising and embedded a mobile ad unit on the page. I released it for the iPhone and published it free on the web app directory on Apple.com (the App Store didn’t exist yet).</p>

<p>The money started rolling in. Lots of users were downloading the app and using it and the ad revenue was crazy high. It made a ton of money for a couple weeks and then I started looking at my ad click rates. They were astronomical. In fact, my click through rate was so high, it had to be an error. I started digging in.</p>

<p>What I found is that the search box and the ad unit were in close proximity to each other and users were accidentally clicking on the ad when they were trying to enter calorie counts. Oops.</p>

<p>I adjusted the placement of the two UI elements to be far apart. While I was doing that, I found a piece of information in Google’s Terms of Service that said you weren’t allowed to alter the search term a user entered. I was relying on Google for all my income here, so I also updated my search box so that it didn’t add the word “calories”, even though it made the search results significantly less relevant. Hopefully users would learn to do that themselves.</p>

<p>When I released the new version, as you might expect, the ad revenue tanked. Nearly all of the advertising clicks were users clicking by mistake.</p>

<p><strong>5. Write a book about a platform that changes a lot</strong></p>

<p>Since I was writing software again, I decided to give Facebook Apps a try. The app setup process was complex and confusing so I started to take detailed notes. After creating a “Hello World” app, I followed my instructions again and repeated the process for something more interesting. I refined my notes as I went, creating several test apps along the way. When I got done, I realized I had enough information to teach other developers how to do this. At the time, the Facebook documentation was sparse and hard to find. I had learned most of it by trial and error. I was also interested in trying self publishing. So, I decided I would spend the next weekend formatting this into a small book and self-publishing it on Amazon.</p>

<p>The book was selling a few copies a week and was getting great reviews.</p>

<p>About three months later, the book suddenly started to get bad reviews. I opened the book and followed it myself. Facebook had updated the process and things were different now. I made new notes and figured out the new process and …</p></div></div>
