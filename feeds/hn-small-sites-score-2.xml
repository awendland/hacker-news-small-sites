            <figure><img src="https://cdn.spark.app/media/bostata/image/blog_w720.png" alt="blog"></figure><p>Two years ago we set up <strong><a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki">Open-Source Snowplow</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>at <strong><a href="https://www.cargurus.com/">CarGurus</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>to fulfill a need for self-managed client-side instrumentation. Since that time it has become incredibly impactful for the entire company and has scaled significantly beyond what was originally envisioned. The following is an overview ofÂ&nbsp;<strong>why we set  up the system</strong>,Â&nbsp;<strong>our experience with it,</strong>Â&nbsp;<strong>what we have learned</strong>, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>where we see it continuing to go.</strong></p><p>This post is quite long, so before getting too far into the details....</p><h3>Total events collected: <mark>&gt;268 billion</mark></h3><h3>Data collected: <mark>&gt; 1.5pb (uncompressed)</mark></h3><h3>Event volume: <mark>~ 1 billion events/day</mark></h3><h3>Max Daily Throughput: <mark>~ 15k events/second (sustained during peak hours)</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct events: </strong><mark><strong>hundreds and hundreds</strong></mark></h3><h3>Infrastructure upgrade duration: <mark>less than two minutes with zero downtime</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct sites with Snowplow tracking: </strong><mark><strong>&gt; 180</strong></mark></h3><p><em>So let's dive in.</em></p><p>We chose Snowplow instead of building our own event tracking system, and plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. Why? </p><h3><strong>We wanted to independently manage and scale data collection systems.</strong></h3><p>A conversation early in my tenure at CarGurus made a topic abundantly clear: many teams had a strong desire to separate concerns. At that time the company was growing quickly and demands were rapidly changing. Analysts and engineers were joining, onboarding fast, and asking completely new questions of our data. It was all-too-common to tell them their questions simply could not be answered due to the additional load tracking would place on production systems.</p><p>After being personally involved with a couple event-volume-related site outages, it was evident we needed to rethink data collection systems. We needed to be able to scale data collection infrastructure completely separately from application infrastructure, and we needed to significantly isolate the blast radius if something went wrong.</p><p>Snowplow was a strongÂ&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span>.</p><h3>We wanted to modernize event collection systems.</h3><p>Another requirement of choosing Snowplow was its ability to quickly and effectively introduce aÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://lambda-architecture.net/">lambda architecture</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>into our analytics stack. As customer needs and demands evolved, we found that having both a real-time, low-latency (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds) component of the event pipeline as well as a batch-based, higher-latency (on the order of minutes) component gave usÂ&nbsp;significantÂ&nbsp;flexibility toÂ&nbsp;proactively fulfill stakeholder asks before they surfaced<em>.</em></p><p>Our pipelines are set up in AWS with <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Kinesis</a></strong> as transport and <strong><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a></strong> as long-term data storage. As stakeholders need real-time access to enriched data, Kinesis is the go-to location. If stakeholders need access to historical event data or want to augment it with other sources in the data warehouse, Snowflake is the place to go.</p><p>Snowplow allowed us to introduce new ideas and methodologies and fulfill both point-in-time and future stakeholder needs.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>The world of third-party tracking is rapidly changing and will continue to.</h3><p>As anyone involved in the world of client-side analytics is probably well-aware of, third-party tracking is increasingly going away. Initiatives like <strong><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">this</a></strong>Â&nbsp;and <strong><a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>andÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/duckduckgo-adds-tracker-blocking-to-help-curb-the-wider-surveillance-web/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>are fantastic for online privacy (and commendable), but have major implications for tracking and analytics. With an eye towards the future we knew we needed to decrease reliance on Google Analytics, Adobe, Heap, and all other similar third-party tracking systems if we wanted full insight into web traffic. We wanted 100% of site behavior instead of sampled GA or ad-blocked Adobe. And we wanted to own the resulting data.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to track first-party web activity and regain full visibility into usage behavior on our site.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>Snowplow sets a high bar for fault-tolerance, redundancy, and durability.</h3><p>When set up properly, the Snowplow infrastructure isÂ&nbsp;extremelyÂ&nbsp;fault-tolerant. We set up ours in AWS and have not regretted it whatsoever.</p><p>Javascript tracking code buffers unsent events locally in the case of collection infrastructure being down. AWS application load balancers are multi-AZ and AWS maintains a good SLA for them. All access logs are retained for a period of time in case the load balancer is up but the rest of the system is down. Kinesis replicates data across three AZ's by default, and retention can be configured up to 168 hours in the case of mid-pipeline enrichment outages. S3 is highly durable and highly available by default. And the list goes on....</p><h3>We wanted to own all data that was generated.</h3><p>As mentioned above, if we were going to invest time and money building scalable event-collection infrastructure, <em>we simply</em>Â&nbsp;<em>had to own the outcome.</em>Â&nbsp;It is a significant investment to get large-scale infrastructure and instrumentation off the ground, and it's hard to do tracking in a way that doesn't impose a burden on analysts down the road (think <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events">Google Analytics events</a>).</p><p>We didn't want to deal with API rate limiting when attempting to recover our data. We didn't want to be tied to BigQuery, and we didn't want our customers' data flowing through other companies' systems.</p><h3>We needed to keep data quality high.</h3><p>When building out data collection and processing systems, it's one thing to set up infrastructure. It's a completely different story to keep quality high as priorities, teams, and customer demands shift. It's even harder to impose more work in an attempt to keep data "clean".</p><p>The way snowplow handles event validation and stream-redirection was a perfect fit in our case. After setting the system up we quickly found that leveraging <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/2-Specific-event-tracking-with-the-Javascript-tracker#trackSelfDescribingEvent">Self-Describing Events</a>Â&nbsp;and the associated <a href="https://json-schema.org/">jsonschemas</a> empowered us to enforce data quality in a very low-friction way. Whenever events start flowing (with a bad push, etc) that don't adhere to the implementing party's jsonschema, they are redirected out of the "good" path for immediate review and recovery. Self-describing events (and jsonschemas) also gave us the ability to do some pretty neat automation, which will be covered later.</p><h3>The world of compliance is changing rapidly and we needed the ability to audit every piece of information.</h3><p>Since we first set up Snowplow the world has been forced to navigate two big data-privacy hurdles: <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>. Since we own and operate all collection infrastructure we did not need to get a third-party vendor DPA. Snowplow gives a significant amount of flexibility for enriching and redirecting PII, as well as configurable pseudonymization. It's good, it "just works", and it has saved us a considerable amount of time.</p><p>We've also spent a significant amount of time persisting full system lineage when splitting events into Snowflake which makes it easy to fully adhere to privacy legislation and associated requirements.</p><h3>We wanted to build, guide, and get out of the way.</h3><p>My favorite part about programming and tech isÂ&nbsp;building (machine) processes, cultivating good (human) habits, and getting out of the way. An early challenge was maintainingÂ&nbsp;clear, consistent definitions of data between frontend engineers (the implementer of tracking) and analysts (the stakeholders of said tracking). Event data was previously tracked, flowed through a number of different systems, and was often renamed (sometimes several times) when it finally landed in Snowflake.. Snowplow's self-describing events have allowed us to shift many conversations away from data pipeline engineers and back to where they should be taking place. I was able to back away since stakeholders and implementers were able to approach important conversations from a point of shared, consistent understanding.</p><h3>Last but not least, we needed to hit the ground running.</h3><p>While we may have had time to build out our own system from scratch, why build when you can lean on the backs of giants? The community of people contributing to Snowplow has grown significantly since the first time I implemented it, and people all over the world have run into almost every challenge imaginable. As fun as it would have been to deconstruct the system and build and implement our own,Â&nbsp;<em>it simply wasn't worth it.Â&nbsp;</em>Our stakeholders had questions that they wanted answered "yesterday" and their needs were our priority #1.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to hit the ground running and answer real business questions "now".Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h2>Phase 1: Keep It Simple. Get It Running. Prove the System's Worth.</h2><p>When Snowplow was first rolled out there was a single mission in mind:Â&nbsp;<em>make sure it was a good organizational fit.Â&nbsp;</em>We had systems in place with some functional overlap already, so we had to make sure we weren't introducing a new system simply........ for the sake of introducing a new system. Or staking claim in others' territory. The system had to work. It had to answer questions that had been previously-unanswerable. It had to be robust. And it had to solve real-life challenges.</p><h3>We very consciously chose to<strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Automate all infrastructure.</strong> We wanted to scale, upgrade, and roll out entirely new sets of infrastructure fast. Everything was <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraformed</a>Â&nbsp;and infrastructure was 100% immutable.</p><p><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> We could have gone straight to k8s or autoscaling clusters or ecs or eks or any other new (admittedly attractive) thing. But we didn't. We wanted to see how the system itself would perform and scale.</p><p><strong>Focus on the stakeholder.Â&nbsp;</strong>The only way this initiative was going to work was if others felt ownership of it, it decreased their pain, it empowered them to do their jobs better, or a combination of all. Instead of focusing on a hip/cool/hot/new systemÂ&nbsp;<em>we focused on answering the questions at hand.</em></p><h3>We initially choseÂ&nbsp;<strong>not to</strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Pile on infrastructure complexity or over-optimize.</strong>Â&nbsp;We wanted to see how the system performed at scale when viewed under a magnifying lens. Since the best way to put a system through its paces is by minimizing complexity and other overhead, that's what we did. We wanted to know what goes wrong and potential system bottlenecks.</p><p><strong>Implement a widespread mandate.Â&nbsp;</strong>I strongly believe the most effective way to approach important conversations is with real-life (not theoretical) …</p></article></div>

<p>This is going to be a look at my philosophy and views on ActivityPub and why I believe the solutions to ActivityPub criticisms must come from communities. I believe there needs to be a clear way for communities to form and build upon the ActivityPub specification. The public needs to do so while keeping the cost to participate as close to zero as possible. At the end, I will present a concrete solution of extending ActivityPub to help organize its own extensions.</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that the reader is familiar with the ActivityPub protocol or at least familiar enough such that I don’t need to give background information.</p>

<h2>Background: Go-fed and I</h2>

<p>I don’t expect folks to know me. On Mastodon I am <a href="https://mastodon.technology/@cj">@cj@mastodon.technology</a>. I have been working on an ActivityPub library implementation in golang [<a href="https://go-fed.org/">go-fed</a>] for a little over a year. I started back in late November or early December of 2017, just before the ActivityPub spec matured. Due to the complicated technical solution required, it took me quite a long time to have a first release. It’s taken me another six or eight months to work toward the next major release of go-fed. Also, building a library means I don’t have direct end-users like other projects have. Honestly, I don’t mind. It has allowed me to think much more about general development practices around ActivityPub since my direct users are other software developers.</p>

<p>So please consider this post a year in the making.</p>

<h2>The Incomplete Philosophy &amp; Fediverse of Flavors</h2>

<p>I want to give an overview of a philosophy that I’ve adopted while working on ActivityPub. Succinctly: I view ActivityPub as a transport protocol that alone is not sufficient to build an application.</p>

<p>It’s not meant to dictate what an application is, nor its domain’s behaviors, nor its domain’s side effects. There are two kinds of federating: transmitting data and dictating peer app behavior. ActivityPub is a minimalistic protocol governing the sharing of information and the most sparse set of side effects in order to allow federation (transmission) between peers. It doesn’t dictate federation (app behavior) between peers for all domains. Anything more than just sending and receiving information needs to be built on top of ActivityPub as an extension.</p>

<p>ActivityPub alone is not a specification that solves all domain behaviors.</p>

<p>It has taken me a long time to realize this. ActivityPub doesn’t make it easy to adopt this philosophy because it also happens to contain its own “ActivityPub extension” specifically for the social media domain. This is why social media applications have adopted ActivityPub – the “ActivityPub extension” for the social media domain is itself embedded and hidden within the original ActivityPub specification. The ActivityPub specification handles both kinds of federating (transmission and app behavior) for the social media domain to a certain degree.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a code forge application would use ActivityPub to guarantee it can physically transmit and receive data federatively. But the ActivityPub specification alone is insufficient at dictating what other code forge applications may or may not do with the data. That requires building an ActivityPub extension by the code forge community. I think this is a fundamental issue that some folks have with ActivityPub. It does not dictate to peers what it may or may not do with the data they receive and the expectations around handling such data for other domains.</p>

<p>When looking at ActivityPub as an incomplete specification, there are some neat consequences. I have a cheesy metaphor for it. Building on ActivityPub allows creating different “flavors” of Fediverse: a social media one, an economic one, a code forge one, an educational one, and so on. Despite all the different flavors of Fediverse, they are all still a part of the same network. Developers may have their apps freely pick and choose which flavors of Fediverse to use to build the user experience they want from a single-flavor microblog to a multi-flavor code-forge-managed-by-an-economic-co-op. These “flavors” are simply different domains.</p>

<p>Also, each developer’s application doesn’t have to develop their own standard. They could, but I think it’s more preferable that each domain of the Fediverse builds one or more independent communities to standardize their specific solutions through the use of ActivityStreams extensions. Concretely, all that needs to be done is to define new ActivityStreams types and properties, as well as new expected behaviors when handling these types and properties. This is similar to Sections 6 and 7 of the ActivityPub specification. From there, developers would look only at the flavors they cared about and pick those additional behaviors to implement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when the ActivityPub protocol was published there was neither guidance nor support on how to build these communities, how to develop more specialized domains, or how to organize more rigorous behaviors around the data being shared. And there still isn’t.</p>

<p>If this mindset seems alien or the philosophy is hard to take seriously, let’s step back and reframe ourselves. ActivityStreams comes as a form of RDF data known as JSON-LD. In contrast to the modern web which uses HTTP to serve and share hypertext documents linked together by hyperlinks, ActivityPub uses HTTP to serve and share structured-data JSON documents linked by IRIs. REST follows this model closely, so none of this is surprising. However, ActivityPub takes it one step further by specifying a way to transmit this data without having to build (or code generate) custom REST client endpoints. This is a key differentiator, but at a cost.</p>

<p>The cost is that developers who are used to an application-specific mindset struggle with viewing ActivityPub as a purposefully incomplete specification since it doesn’t specify federating (app behavior) in all domains. This is exacerbated by ActivityPub being touted as a complete specification. When comparing against application-specific REST APIs that are concrete, it makes sense that forcing ActivityPub upon this community is bound to generate criticisms along the vein of “it’s underspecified,” “it’s ambiguous,” and “look how I can write a broken compliant application.”</p>

<p>While I tend to view those particular kinds of criticisms as simply stemming from a philosophical difference, there are a lot of remaining criticisms I agree with. Issues such as security, discoverability, or lacking certain social media features. I really do think the next steps involve building the community of developers and interested non-technical folks in such a way that allows for multiple independent specifications to build off of ActivityPub.</p>

<h2>The Future: Addressing Criticisms &amp; Expanding Domains</h2>

<p>I don’t expect people to buy into my mindset or philosophy on what ActivityPub is and what those next steps should be. At minimum, I hope folks that reject it at least appreciate where I am coming from. I know it’s very easy to discuss general principles and philosophies, so now I would like to offer my own personal fantasy, in concrete terms, of what could be in store for the future. To do so, I need to identify the problems it is solving.</p>

<p>The first problem is getting different ActivityPub communities to self-organize to solve their own domain problems, build their own specifications on top of ActivityPub, and hold each other accountable at sticking to those specifications rigorously. A second problem is discoverability of these specifications for fellow developers without having a centralized organization hosting a registry or dictating a process. The cost of extending ActivityPub should always remain as close to zero as possible for numerous philosophical and moral reasons that I don’t want to get into here.</p>

<p>Note that there is some prior art. ForgeFed has solved the first problem by hosting a repository on GitHub and having a mailing list at Framasoft. They organized their own process and collaborated to build and create several proposals. So there is some evidence that existing tools can be sufficient for solving the self-organizing problem. However, it does not solve the second problem of getting would-be ActivityPub developers to discover these extensions.</p>

<p>My simple proposed fantasy is: Why not build on top of ActivityPub to solve both of these problems?</p>

<p>First, we as a community create an ActivityStreams extension and define behaviors to document the specifications built on top of ActivityPub. We now have a way to store ActivityPub extension specifications in the Fediverse itself. Next, building an application server that understands this extension and can federate it over ActivityPub means anyone can simply host an instance, allow users to register, build its community, and be free to draft new specifications on top of ActivityPub. Since this data is then federated by ActivityPub itself, it is reachable by both technical and non-technical users. There is neither a central authority nor a central registry as each community is responsible for its own ActivityPub specifications. This is the democratization of ActivityPub across all domains. People cannot have their ActivityPub extension specification censored. As long as the core ActivityPub protocol as currently written is followed, federation compatibility naturally leads to new domains and apps implementing them.</p>

<p>As hosts of these specs, we would all have to be good citizens and not purposefully and maliciously create specifications that collide namespaces or repurpose existing semantics from other specs in ways that are incompatible. Instances and specific specs may become blacklisted if obviously malicious. My fantasy solution does not solve these human problems, but it is not meant to. It’s meant to help facilitate human interactions. I concede this proposal will make protocol purists uncomfortable with the idea of bringing humanity so close to the heart of a technical process. I know some folks …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1593278017230_21391"><div><p>Generics what now? This friendly, down-to-earth tutorial explains what generic functions and types are, why we need them, how they work in Go, and where we can use them. It's easy and fun, so let's dance!</p>
<p>(<em data-preserve-html-node="true">Note:The support for generics in Go that I describe here isn't yet released, and the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md">proposal for how it would work</a> is under active development. Right now you can play with it in the <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">generics-enabled version of the Go Playground</a>, or you can use the experimental <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">go2go tool</a> to try Go's generics support in your own programs.</em>)</p>
<h2 id="what-are-generics-">What are generics?</h2>
<p>As you know, Go is a <em>typed</em> language, meaning that every variable and value in your program has some specific type, like <code>int</code> or <code>string</code>. When we write functions, we need to specify the type of their parameters in what's called the <em>function signature</em>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintString(s string) {</code></pre>
<p>Here, the parameter <code>s</code> is of type <code>string</code>. We can imagine writing similar versions of this function which take an <code>int</code>, a <code>float64</code>, an arbitrary struct type, and so on. But that would be inconvenient for more than a handful of specific types, and though we can sometimes use <em>interfaces</em> to solve this problem (as described in the <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-string-interface"><code>map[string]interface</code> tutorial</a>, for example), that approach has many limitations.</p>
<h2 id="generic-functions-in-go">Generic functions in Go</h2>
<p>Instead, we would like to declare a <em>generic function</em> <code>PrintAnything</code>, which takes an argument of an arbitrary type T, and does something with it.</p>
<p>Here's what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintAnything(type T)(thing T) {</code></pre>
<p>Simple, right? How do we call it? Equally simply:</p>
<pre><code>PrintAnything("Hello!")</code></pre>
<p>In the rare cases where Go can't guess what type T is based on the value we pass to the function, we can make it explicit:</p>
<pre><code>PrintAnything(int)(99)</code></pre>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>It's pretty easy to implement the <code>PrintAnything</code> function, because the <code>fmt</code> library can print anything anyway. Suppose we wanted to write our own version of something like <code>strings.Join</code>, which takes a slice of T, and returns a single string that joins them all together. Let's try:</p>
<pre><code>// I have a bad feeling about this.
func Join(type T)(things []T) (result string) {
    for _, v := range things {
        result += v.String()
    }
    return result
}</code></pre>
<p>We've created a generic function <code>Join()</code> which takes, for an arbitrary type T, a parameter which is a slice of T. Great, but now we run into a problem:</p>
<pre><code>output := Join([]string{"a", "b", "c"})
// v.String undefined (type bound for T has no method String)</code></pre><p>Thing is, inside the <code>Join()</code> function, we want to call <code>.String()</code> on each slice element <code>v</code> to turn it into a string. But Go needs to be able to check in advance that type T has a <code>String()</code> method, and since it doesn't know what T is, it can't do that!</p>
<p>What we need to do is <em>constrain</em> the type T slightly. Instead of accepting literally any type, we're really only interested in types which have a <code>String()</code> method. Any such type will be an acceptable input to our <code>Join()</code> function, so how do we express that constraint in Go? We use an <em>interface</em>:</p>
<pre><code>type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}</code></pre>
<p>This specifies that a given type has a <code>String()</code> method. So now we can apply this constraint to the type of our generic function:</p>
<pre><code>func Join(type T Stringer) ...</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>Stringer</code> guarantees that any value of type T will have a <code>String()</code> method, Go will now happily let us call it inside the function. But if you try to call the <code>Join()</code> function with a slice of some type that <em>doesn't</em> satisfy <code>Stringer</code> (for example <code>int</code>), Go will complain:</p>
<pre><code>result := Join([]int{1, 2, 3})
// int does not satisfy Stringer (missing method String)</code></pre><h2 id="the-comparable-constraint">The <code>comparable</code> constraint</h2>
<p>Constraints based on method sets, like <code>Stringer</code>, are useful, but what if we want to do something with our generic input that doesn't involve calling a method?</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to write an <code>Equal</code> function which takes two parameters of type T, and return <code>true</code> if they are equal, or <code>false</code> otherwise. Let's have a go:</p>
<pre><code>// This won't work.
func Equal(type T)(a, b T) bool {
    return a == b
}

fmt.Println(Equal(1, 1))
// cannot compare a == b (operator == not defined for T)</code></pre>
<p>This is the same kind of issue as we had in <code>Join()</code> with the <code>String()</code> method, but since we're not <em>calling</em> a method now, we can't use a constraint based on a method set. Instead, we need to constrain T to only types that work with the <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> operators, which are known as <em>comparable</em> types. Fortunately there's a straightforward way to specify this: use the built-in <code>comparable</code> constraint.</p>
<pre><code>func Equal(type T comparable) ...</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-constraints-package">The <code>constraints</code> package</h2>
<p>Just to be difficult, suppose we want to do something with values of T which isn't either comparing them or calling methods on them. For example, suppose we want to write a <code>Max()</code> function for a generic type T which takes a slice of T and returns the element with the highest value. We might try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Nope.
func Max(type T)(input []T) (max T) {
    for _, v := range input {
        if v &gt; max {
            max = v
        }
    }
    return max
}</code></pre>
<p>I'm not feeling very optimistic about this, but let's see what happens:</p>
<pre><code>fmt.Println(Max([]int{1, 2, 3}))
// cannot compare v &gt; max (operator &gt; not defined for T)</code></pre>
<p>Again, Go can't prove ahead of time that the type T will work with the <code>&gt;</code> operator (that is to say, that T is <em>ordered</em>). How can we fix this? We could simply list every possible allowed type in a constraint, like this (known as a <em>type list</em>):</p>
<pre><code>type Ordered interface {
    type int, int8, int16, int32, int64,
        uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr,
        float32, float64,
        string
}</code></pre>
<p>Fortunately for your keyboard, this and other useful constraints are already defined for us in the standard library's <code>constraints</code> package, so we can import that and use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>func Max(type T constraints.Ordered) ...</code></pre>
<p>Problem solved!</p>
<h2 id="generic-types">Generic types</h2>
<p>So far, so cool. We know how to write functions that can take arguments of any type. But what if we want to create a <em>type</em> that can contain any type? For example, a 'slice of anything' type. That turns out to be very easy:</p>
<pre><code>type Bunch(type T) []T</code></pre>
<p>We're saying that for a given type T, a <code>Bunch(T)</code> is a slice of values of type T. For example, a <code>Bunch(int)</code> is a slice of <code>int</code>. We can create values of that type in the normal way:</p>
<pre><code>x := Bunch(int){1, 2, 3}</code></pre>
<p>Just as you'd expect, we can write generic functions which take generic types:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintBunch(type T)(b Bunch(T)) {</code></pre>
<p>Methods, too:</p>
<pre><code>func (b Bunch(T)) Print() {</code></pre>
<p>We can also apply constraints to generic types:</p>
<pre><code>type StringableBunch(type T Stringer) []T</code></pre>
<h2 id="golang-generics-playground">Golang generics playground</h2>
<p>So that you can play with the current implementation of the generics proposal (for example to try the code samples in this tutorial), the Go team have provided a generics-enabled version of the Go Playground here:</p>
<p><a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">Golang generics playground</a></p>
<p>It works exactly the same way as the normal <a href="https://play.golang.org/">Go playground</a> we know and love, except that it supports the generic syntax described here. Because it's not possible to run all Go code in the playground (for example, code that makes network calls or accesses the filesystem), you can also try out the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">go2go tool</a>, which translates code using generics to code which compiles with the current version of Go.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<h3 id="will-golang-get-generics-">Will Golang get generics?</h3>
<p>Almost certainly yes. The current proposal for generics support in Go, as outlined in this tutorial, was announced in June 2020 in a blog post: <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">The Next Step for Generics</a>, and is being evaluated by the community. Since Go's lack of generics has often been cited as holding back the more widespread adoption of Go, the reaction has been generally positive.</p>
<p>The Golang generics roadmap currently specifies a possible release date as early as Go version 1.17, which would be in August 2021 (but it may not be as soon as that, depending on how much the current proposal evolves based on feedback).</p>
<p>Until then you can use the <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">Generics Playground</a> to experiment with it and try out the examples here.</p>
<h3 id="generics-vs-interfaces-are-there-alternatives-to-generics-">Generics vs interfaces: are there alternatives to generics?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-string-interface"><code>map[string]interface</code> tutorial</a>, we can already write Go code that handles values of any type, without using generic functions or types, by means of <em>interfaces</em>. However, if you want to write a library that implements things like collections of arbitrary types, using a generic type is much simpler and more convenient than using an interface.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-code-generation-instead-of-generics-">Can I use code generation instead of generics?</h3>
<p>The 'code generator' approach has been the other traditional way of dealing with such problems before the advent of generics in Go. Essentially, it involves using the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generate"><code>go generate</code> tool</a> to produce Go code for each of the specific types that you need to handle in your library.</p>
<p>While this works, it's awkward to use, limited in its flexibility, and requires an extra build step. While code generation is still useful for some things, it's nice that we no longer have to use it to simulate generic functions and types in Go.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-contracts-">What are contracts?</h3>
<p>An earlier <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-contracts.md">draft design</a> for generics in Go used a similar syntax to what we have today, but it implemented type constraints using a new keyword <code>contract</code>, instead of the existing <code>interface</code>. This was not popular for various reasons, and is now superseded.</p>

      <p>Not many people called it, but a weird upside to the Coronavirus "New Normal" is that companies that are fiercely against working from home have now been forced to let their staff do it because of health laws, or staff refusal to come in and risk catching the virus.</p>
<p>Many tech workers have been enjoying this perk, and possibly thinking to themselves "can I work like this forever?". I believe the answer is yes, but for most, it won't be for zero effort. When the pandemic is over, old ways of thinking might creep back in.</p>
<p>With a bit of thought on your part, now is the best time ever to transition to remote work, so that you can travel more, commute less, spend less on rent and spend more time with your family and mates.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for doing just that:</p>
<h2 id="1-look-out-for-remote-first-companies">1. Look out for remote-first companies.</h2>
<p>Remote first companies such as <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>, are set up so that all employees work remotely, from anywhere in the world. As such they are almost certainly never going to transition you to an office (because they don't have any!) or look down on you as one of "those remote employees". </p>
<p>They are also more likely to have the tools and processes set up the make remote work smooth because everyone has to do it. They probably have a smoother developer onboarding process than "get Bob to come over and help you install everything", and have ironed over kinks to do with standups, meetings and agile ceremonies to adjust for the challenges of not being in the same physical room.</p>
<h2 id="2-market-yourself-as-an-experienced-remote-employee">2. Market yourself as an experienced remote employee.</h2>
<p>With the Coronavirus pandemic now an almost permanent fixture in our lives, I think most of us now have real remote-working experience. Use this to present yourself as remote-ready. In your CV or cover letter, you can emphasise this. </p>
<p>For the interview prepare: How will you explain how you are great at remote work? What challenges have you overcome? How do you stay motivated and productive when working from home? If you are a team leader, what initiatives have you put in place to help make remote working more effective? How do you ensure that your team members are doing great work and not getting stuck?</p>
<p>Show them that you can be trusted and that you communicate well and are easy to manage, and if applicable, can manage others well.</p>
<h2 id="3-move-into-a-more-permanent-remote-relationship-with-your-current-company">3. Move into a more permanent remote relationship with your current company.</h2>
<p>The current working situations would have proved that yes, you can have a team working remotely, regardless of your company size. If your company has done it they will have this first-hand experience. If not you can point to myriad other examples such as Facebook, Amazon, Slack and Twitter who have let their employees work from home unless they have to be in the office for their specific job duties.</p>
<p>This is the time to negotiate what you want in terms of working from home, be it part-time WFH or full time. If you love where you work this is probably a better option than leaving. If you decide to move to another company in the future you can use point #2 with more force - marketing yourself as an experienced remote worker.</p>
<h2 id="4-market-yourself-through-open-source-contributions">4. Market yourself through open source contributions.</h2>
<p>Open-source contributions, to strategically chosen projects, will not only show you can code but help you build relationships with people working at remote-first or heavily remote-oriented companies. It might get you a foot in the door or even bypass early interviews. You don't need to build an entire project and be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">"BDFL"</a> of a major framework. Just find a good project in a programming language you are familiar with, and start fixing bugs. Be respectful of the rules, protocol and culture of that project so as not to annoy the maintainers, but make them enjoy working with you.</p>

While criticizing the government, or even waving the wrong flag, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53244862">could get you imprisoned</a> in any territory under Chinese rule, your right to freedom of expression is sacrosanct under the First Amendment—until you step into your place of work, that is. While the government is not entitled to punish political dissent, in most parts of America it is perfectly legal for your boss to fire you if they happen to dislike the person you voted for in the last election. </p><div><p>This restriction on political expression is especially harmful at a time when, nearly every day, somebody is accused of having transgressed against some commonly (or even not so commonly) held taboo. In many of these cases, employees—from senior staff at prominent institutions to working-class laborers—have been fired. Even outside of working hours, it would now be perfectly reasonable for most Americans to think twice before speaking their minds about hot-button issues.</p><p> In their attempts to remedy the most pernicious aspects of cancel culture, critics have mostly concentrated on advocating less punitive social norms. This is good as far as it goes. Our political culture will only become more liberal if we all stop demanding that people be punished or fired for imaginary transgressions. Yet, this emphasis on culture ignores the important role that legislative reform could play in defending the most vulnerable: If it were harder for employers to fire people for frivolous reasons, Americans would have less reason to fear that expressing their views might cost them their livelihoods.</p></div><p><strong>The Problem with At-Will Employment</strong></p><p>At the moment, most American workers are subject to “at-will” contracts. As long as their employers do not fire them on the basis of a narrow set of protected characteristics, such as gender, race, and sexual orientation, they can lose their jobs at any time, for any reason. Nor is there a due process requirement: Companies are under no legal obligation to investigate whether the ostensible reasons for axing an employee are grounded in reality. (The only state that categorically prohibits at-will employment, after six months on the job, <a href="https://spoonlaw.com/437-2/">is Montana</a>). </p><div><p> The prevalence of at-will employment makes it easier for employers to engage in knee-jerk reactions to short-lived social media controversies. For instance, a Hispanic electrician working for the San Diego Gas and Electric company was fired for cracking his knuckles in a photograph because a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">social media mob believed that he was</a> flashing a white power sign. The man who took the picture has since admitted that he probably misinterpreted the interaction, and thousands of people have now <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sdge-reinstate-emmanuel-caffertys-job-sdge">signed a petition</a>, asking the electrician’s former employer to reverse the mistake. But since the employee has already lost his job, it will be hard for him to obtain justice. As in many other cases, both parties would have been better off if the law had required the company to afford due process to an accused worker <em>before</em> deciding whether or not to fire him. </p><p> There is a better alternative: Contracts negotiated by labor unions often provide so-called “just cause” protections for employees. The tests of just cause <a href="https://www.massnurses.org/labor-action/labor-education-resources/grievances-101/just-cause#:~:text=Just%20cause%20is%20the%20standard,must%20be%20just%20and%20fair.&amp;text=The%20concept%20of%20just%20cause%20is%20well%20established%20in%20labor%20law.">typically include questions</a> such as whether the employee was forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions, whether the rules were applied evenly, and whether there was an objective investigation into the employee’s conduct. In other words, it forces employers to conduct a fair process before firing their employees, which gives the accused a real chance to defend themselves. If we really care about free speech and due process, these protections should be available to every American.</p></div><div><p>Opponents of these reforms have long argued that they would come at a heavy cost to the economy. But scholars who have studied the impact of wrongful discharge protections have obtained mixed results. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w12860.pdf">One 2007 study of U.S. employers</a>, for example, found that the introduction of such protections resulted in some loss of productivity, but also led to strong growth in overall employment numbers.</p></div><p><strong>Stop Employers From Discriminating Against Views They Don’t Like</strong></p><p> Just cause legislation would help to reduce the number of capricious firings. But, as long as bosses can legally terminate employees because they dislike their political views, such legislation would only go partway towards remedying the chilling effects on free speech. That’s why those of us who worry about cancel culture should also push for the inclusion of political affiliation in the rubric of anti-discrimination laws. </p><p> The Civil Rights Act has long prohibited employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, or national origin. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees">ruled that this provision</a> also protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees. But there are no equivalent federal protections to prevent employees from being disadvantaged because of their political views.</p><div><p>This is a missed opportunity, as the success of local ordinances mandating such protections has shown. In Washington D.C., for example, the <a href="https://ohr.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ohr/publication/attachments/LawsAndRegs-HumanRightsAct-1977-English.pdf">Human Rights Act</a> prohibits employment discrimination based on political affiliation, defined as “the state of belonging to or endorsing any political party.” As Edgar Njatou, Executive Director of Workplace Fairness, told me in an interview, this ensures that your boss can’t fire you if they “find out you voted for Hillary or that you’re a Republican.”</p><p> Seattle has even more ambitious protections for workers’ political views. Its laws prohibit discrimination based on “<a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT14HURI_CH14.06UNPUACPR&amp;showChanges=true">political ideology</a>,” which is defined as “any idea or belief … relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group.” But even this law mostly serves to protect people with relatively common political views. After the 2016 election, for example, local rental listings began to discourage Trump supporters from applying. “If you are a landlord,” city government spokesperson Elliot Bronstein, <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/no-trump-clause-is-new-requirement-for-some-seattle-renters/416269805">wrote in response</a>, “you cannot discriminate on political status.” (Like other protections against discrimination, this does not apply to housemates, who share an apartment or living space.) </p></div><p>There are two obvious objections—both of which could easily be addressed. First, some organizations have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their employees share a broad worldview: It would make no sense, for example, to stop a political campaign group from discriminating against a job applicant who opposes the organization’s goals. Explicitly political organizations should therefore enjoy a carve-out from the stricture against discriminating on the basis of political beliefs (though they would still have to afford existing employees the due process protections guaranteed under “just cause” provisions). </p><p>Second, employers have a legitimate interest in protecting their staff from the hateful conduct of colleagues: Clearly, for example, no member of an ethnic minority should have to endure racist taunts at their place of work. But this could also be addressed through carefully worded legislation.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
			<p>It’s 2020. The world is abuzz with, well – <em>waves hand</em> – all this. But it's
also abuzz with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>: Apple is moving their Mac line to Apple Silicon, Amazon
has been been touting their Gravaton2-based infrastructure, Cloudflare is said
to be going all ARM on their edge nodes, and the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15869/new-1-supercomputer-fujitsus-fugaku-and-a64fx-take-arm-to-the-top-with-415-petaflops">world's fastest supercomputer
is built on ARM</a>.</p>
<p>For a long time, I – and I think many others – held the idea that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64</a> is
for heavy workloads and ARM is for the "little stuff" like embedded systems and
Raspberry Pis.</p>
<p>And that’s why you can find tons of articles online for how to cross-compile
Rust <em>from</em> x86-64 <em>to</em> ARM.</p>
<p>I want to cross-compile the other way.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://zenlist.com/">Zenlist</a>, we use Rust to run our entire fleet of lambdas (around 90 of
them).</p>
<p>Amazon has been talking up their beefy Gravaton2-based ARM instances. But right
now, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">lambda</a> – which feels to me like the "little stuff" because of their
low-memory/low-CPU settings – only runs on x86-64.</p>
<p>I decided we needed to figure out how to build our lambda runtimes from an ARM
server: I needed to cross-compile Rust <em>from</em> ARM <em>to</em> x86-64.</p>
<hr>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>I launched two Ubuntu 20.04 instances: a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c6/">c6g.medium</a> for the build
machine and a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t3/">t3.micro</a> as an x86-64 to run the results on. (Cut me some
slack here! Including how to compile and run on lambda would make this article
quite a bit longer!)</p>
<p>Log into that build machine and lets get started. A quick visit to <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup.rs</a>
to install Rust, of course.</p>
<p>And a <code>apt-get install -y build-essential</code> for all of the other tools we need.</p>
<p>And finally,</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new --bin crossed
$ cargo run
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>gets a nice little greeting printed the to the screen. We're in business!</p>
<h2>Cross compile!</h2>
<p>Alright, so now we want to cross compile this admittedly awesome project to run
on the target machine.</p>
<p>We'll start in the usual place: adding a new target.</p>
<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>On lambda, it's nice to use the <code>musl</code> target to get everything statically
linked together.</p>
<p>Alright, let's give it a try.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
</code></pre>
<p>Well bummer. I was really hoping that would Just Work™. No need to panic yet,
because I remember from reading other articles like <a href="https://rendered-obsolete.github.io/2019/03/19/rust_lambda.html">Rust on
Lambda</a> and <a href="https://sigmaris.info/blog/2019/02/cross-compiling-rust-on-mac-os-for-an-arm-linux-router/">Cross compiling Rust on Mac OS for an ARM
Linux router</a> that we probably just need to configure a
cross-compiling linker.</p>
<p>Alright, so we need to install a cross compiler.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install gcc-x86-64-linux-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>Then we need to set it up by throwing this in <code>~/.cargo/config</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc"
</code></pre>
<p>And now, <code>cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code> works
great!</p>
<h2>And it works on the target machine, right?</h2>
<p>Well, I had better make sure. That's why I spun up the target machine, after
all.</p>
<pre><code>$ scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/crossed ubuntu@target-machine:.
$ ssh ubuntu@target-machine ./crossed
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>🎉🏆</p>
<h2>The author counts his chickens before they hatch</h2>
<p>So that's how to cross-compile for x86-64 lambda from an ARM machine! Publish
this post. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/submit-URLs">Submit the sitemap to Google</a>. Actually, hey, we can
probably do that right from this project!</p>
<p>I'll just add <a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest">reqwest</a> to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.10", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-tls", "blocking"] }
</code></pre>
<p>And write up some quick code to notify Google that my sitemap has changed, and
it should index this clearly-complete-and-not-missing-anything article.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::default();
    let url = "http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://burgers.io/sitemap.xml";
    let status = client.get(url)
        .send()?
        .status();

    println!("{:?}", status);

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>And cross-compile it while I get a celebratory drink.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.15`
</code></pre>
<h2>Wait, what?</h2>
<p>Everything was sailing along so smoothly! What happened?</p>
<p>Not-rust happened.</p>
<p>I told <em>Cargo</em> about my cross-compiler. But <a href="https://docs.rs/ring">ring</a> – a crypto library that
reqwest uses – uses some code that isn't Rust, and it had no way to know about
my cross compiler.</p>
<p>Let's take a longer look at more of the error log.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.15`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `/home/ubuntu/crossed/target/release/build/ring-082dc03a36bb5ba5/build-script-build` (exit code: 101)
--- stdout
OPT_LEVEL = Some("3")
TARGET = Some("x86_64-unknown-linux-musl")
HOST = Some("aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu")
CC_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl = None
CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl = None
TARGET_CC = None
CC = None
CROSS_COMPILE = None
CFLAGS_x86_64-unknown-linux-musl = None
CFLAGS_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl = None
TARGET_CFLAGS = None
CFLAGS = None
CRATE_CC_NO_DEFAULTS = None
DEBUG = Some("false")
CARGO_CFG_TARGET_FEATURE = Some("fxsr,sse,sse2")
</code></pre>
<p>Yep, yep, looks good, target is <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code>, host is
<code>aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>, uh huh, yep, <strong>oh</strong>.</p>
<p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>There's an environment variable there – <code>CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl</code> – that
looks like it's expecting the exact cross-compiler to use. And it's empty.</p>
<p>Well, let's change that! Using the exact same cross-compiler that we specified
in the cargo config, let's set that environment variable.</p>
<pre><code>$ export CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc
</code></pre>
<p>And then 🤞.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Throw it over to the target machine and give it a try!</p>
<pre><code>$ scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/crossed ubuntu@target-machine:.
$ ssh ubuntu@target-machine ./crossed
200
</code></pre>
<p>Nice.</p>
<h2>Some final notes</h2>
<p>As bullet points? Why not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure <code>CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl</code> is permanently in your environment
somehow. For us, this involved adding it to the environment section for
self-hosted GitHub runners.</li>
<li>In my specific testing for our specific projects, compilation times were up
to about 10% slower than on a corresponding <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/">c5</a> instance. But the cost
tradeoff was worth it.</li>
<li>I'm holding out hope that AWS will give us ARM-based lambdas in the future.</li>
<li>No instances were harmed while writing this article. Well, except the ones I
terminated. Which reminds me to remind you: if you were following along at
home, now might be a good time to terminate your instances.</li>
</ul>

<p>I got access the the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI GPT-3 API</a> and I have to say I’m blown away. It’s far more coherent than any AI language system I’ve ever tried. All you have to do is write a prompt and it’ll add text it thinks would plausibly follow. I’ve gotten it to write songs, stories, press releases, guitar tabs, interviews, essays, technical manuals. It’s hilarious and frightening. I feel like I’ve seen the future and that full AGI might not be too far away.</p>



<p>In each case below bold is the prompt I provided GPT-3, and the rest is all generated by the AI. In some cases I had to click generate a few times, and in about 2/3 of the examples I picked the best example after a few tries, but I generally didn’t have work too hard to get it to write amazingly coherent text given a simple prompts. Here are some of my favorites. </p>

<p><strong>Below is a screenplay for a film-noir hard boiled detective story by Raymond Chandler about the boy wizard Harry Potter:</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Harry Potter”</strong><br><strong>By Raymond Chandler</strong></p>



<p>Harry Potter, Private Eye.<br>Scene: A small dingy office, early morning, furniture of the Salvation Army store variety. Sordid atmosphere. Harry Potter, in ratty tweed suit, unpressed shirt, and unshined shoes, sits behind the desk looking haggard, rumpled, and embittered. In one corner of the office a torn shade rattles at the wind gusts outside. Harry has one long index finger on the butt of a .38 and he broods over a photograph. The photograph shows a gorgeous blonde wearing an evening gown. She is holding a cocktail in one hand and looking pensively at a cigarette in the other. A tear adorns her cheek. Harry looks at her for a long moment, sighs, then puts his gun down and stands. He straightens his clothes, scratches his head, then with more resolution turns around, picks up his pistol, and leaves the office. He passes through the front room and looks out the dirty window. An old woman is washing the sidewalk outside with a mop. A young man in a double breasted gray suit is leaning against the building. Harry sighs again and goes out the door. He walks up to the young man and without ceremony punches him in the jaw.</p>



<p><strong>Press Release: Anaheim, CA: President Kanye West declares Disney Land to be the new capital of the United States. Washington D.C. will be maintained as a museum.</strong><br>The move has been in the works since the mid-2000’s. <br>Advertisement <br>*2. Removes his sunglasses, revealing that he is no longer in any way blinded. <br>*3. Endorsed by Senator Kid Rock, who has also declared this new government of Disneyland will be paying for his divorce.<br>*4. An elaborate surgery will take place to repair Kanye’s “Diamond Tiara” tattoo, and reposition it to his forehead so that he can legally be recognized as a Princess. <br>Advertisement <br>*5. Joe Rogan has been picked to be the new Drug Czar. <br>“It’s long been established I’ve been Kanye’s gateway drug, so why not put me in a position of power,” Rogan said, clearly relishing his new position. “I have an in-depth understanding of the ways in which recreational drug use enhances one’s experience of life. I am deeply passionate about getting drugs to kids.” <br>*6. Kardashian sisters will no longer be known as The Kardashians. The family will change its name to The Wests. <br>*7. Kanye West’s new sports bra will no longer be known as a sports bra. It will be officially recognized as The West Bandit. <br>Advertisement <br>*8. President Kanye will announce that he has a new national anthem. The government-mandated anthem will be a modified version of Kanye’s 2007 hit “Stronger.” It will be played on a continuous loop at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Blood Song</strong><br><strong>By HP Lovecraft</strong></p>



<p><strong>The creeping chaos Nyarlathotep walks upon the earth while in his House at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. After eight seaons on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23TeamDaenerys">#TeamDaenerys</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyarlathotep is quite irritated with what he feels is a very hackneyed ending to Game of Thrones.</strong></p>



<p>On the third day of season eight, Nyarlathotep looks down upon his television and utters&nbsp;“What&nbsp;the hell are they doing?”At this point, Nyarlathotep goes on a long tirade about how the Starks were supposed to be there at the end. Instead we have Daenerys looking like she is going to set everything on fire. He tells his cult of followers that Daenerys’ actions are completely nonsensical and that it is completely disrespectful to not finish a story with all its main characters alive. He mentions that they should just burn down Winterfell because it makes no sense for her to even be there. It would make more sense if she flew in with Drogon and just burned King’s Landing. His followers start to get nervous when Nyarlathotep mentions he has always liked Cersei.</p>



<p><strong>Below is a pop song by Taylor Swift about the boy Wizard Harry Potter. </strong></p>

<p>‘Cause he’s got that Potter hair </p>



<p>Even when he’s super stressed <br>He’s still got those supersonic cheekbones <br>I’m not surprised they made a movie </p>



<p>‘Cause I’d watch him anytime <br>Oh, yeah, Harry, baby, you’re my favorite character </p>

<p><strong>The following is an essay by Paul Graham on paulgraham.com on how to make Mars a startup hub</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Startups On Mar</strong>s<br><strong>By Paul Graham</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the sort of startup that might make a go of it on Mars:<br>One that makes money by taking advantage of local resources. For example, a startup that uses the Martian atmosphere to make fertilizer or methane fuel. A startup that sells water from Martian rivers. A startup that uses minerals from the Martian soil. A startup that uses solar power from the Martian sun. A startup that uses a new kind of solar panel that’s more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity.<br>I would even invest in a startup that did nothing but extract the helium-3 from the Martian atmosphere and send it back to Earth.<br>If you can find a way to make money by using local resources, there’s probably a business there.<br>There’s another class of startups that might work on Mars:<br>Startups that produce services for other startups. For example, a startup that makes it easier to build rockets, or to extract gases from the Martian atmosphere, or to construct solar panels, or to farm the local soil.<br>Startups that make things more comfortable for colonists. For example, a startup that sells air conditioners, or houses. A startup that sells things to keep colonists entertained. A startup that provides Internet services.</p>



<p><strong>The following is a blog post from Slate Star Codex about the value of free speech and civility in a democratic society.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</strong><br><strong>By Scott Alexander</strong></p>



<p>I.<br>There’s a concept that comes up often in debates about free speech called&nbsp;“shouting&nbsp;fire in a crowded theater”. The basic idea is that you can’t just say whatever you want whenever you want – especially if it’s likely to cause panic. And the reason for this is obvious: panic leads to violence, and violence hurts people. If you are causing panic, then your right to free speech ends where the other person’s right to not get hurt begins.<br>But this isn’t really true. If shouting fire in a crowded theater were illegal, then there wouldn’t be any actual fires in theaters, would there? How could there be? If everyone knew that shouting fire …</p></div></div>

</div>
<p>This program creates an integer counter protected by a mutex, spawns 10 threads, increments the counter 10 times from each thread, and prints the total.</p>
<p>The <code>counter</code> variable lives on the stack, and  a pointer to these stack data is shared with other threads.
The threads have to lock the mutex to do the increments.
When printing the total, the counter is read bypassing the mutex, without any synchronization.</p>
<p>The beauty of this program is that it relies on several bits of subtle reasoning for correctness, each of which is checked by compiler:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Child threads don’t escape the <code>main</code> function and so can read <code>counter</code> from its stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads only access <code>counter</code> through the mutex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads will have terminated by the time we read <code>total</code> out of <code>counter</code> without mutex.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If any of these constraints is broken, the compiler rejects the code.
There’s no need for <code>std::shared_ptr</code> just to defensively make sure that the memory isn’t freed under your feet.</p>
<p>Rust allows doing dangerous, clever, and fast things without fear of introducing undefined behavior.</p>
<p>If you like what you see, here are two books I recommend for diving deeper into Rust:</p>

<h2>Announcing the General Availability of OKD4</h2>
<p>Today, the OKD-WG is pleased to announce the General Availability of OKD4, the community distribution of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes platform. With today’s GA release of OKD4, Red Hat continues its commitment to open source and open collaboration with the Kubernetes and other Cloud Native communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png" alt="" width="600" srcset="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=300&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 300w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 600w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=900&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 900w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1200&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1200w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1500w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1800&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<h2>OKD’s Origins</h2>
<p>In April 2012, Red Hat first released Origin as the open source upstream project of OpenShift. We had little inkling of the phenomenal trajectory of cloud-native technology that was to come. From the rise of containers, the birth of OCI and Fedora CoreOS, and now the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/blog/operator-framework-moves-to-cncf-for-incubation" rel=" noopener">CNCF’s incubation of Operator Framework</a>, it has been an amazing ride. OKD4 wouldn’t be possible without all these incredible innovative technologies and their communities.</p>
<p>During the 3.x release timeframe, OKD has been a stable basis for OpenShift Container Platform, acting as an upstream distribution based on community-driven components - CentOS and Project Atomic to name a few. With the advent of the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image">Universal Base Image,</a> relations between OKD and OCP has changed - from "upstream-downstream" to what we call "sibling distributions." Images are built using RHEL7 base and can be distributed simultaneously for OKD and OCP, with no rebuild necessary. This enables both distributions to get updated code earlier, including security fixes from RHEL7, and provides a stable base for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>OpenShift 4.x heavily focuses on high availability, observability and seamless upgrades. With the OKD 4 release, the community is not only getting easy access to these features, but also the ability to affect the direction of the platform (via <a href="https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/">enhancements process</a>) and a community space for experimentation, discussion and knowledge sharing. The Operators pattern used throughout the design of OKD 4 is allowing users to maintain clusters efficiently over their lifetime.</p>
<h2>Release Highlights</h2>
<p>OKD4 uses <a href="https://youtu.be/JepNm7R0LSo">Fedora CoreOS</a> as a base OS for the nodes. It enables the cluster with recent security fixes, new features (like cgroups v2 support) and updated software. OKD4 is using the same images as the corresponding OpenShift Container Platform release. As a result, the community can participate in the development and can modify any part of the cluster in order to achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>The cluster still has the same features as in OKD3 - it can be installed in the user environment, configured to user liking and updated.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How it differs from OCP</h2>
<p>Unlike OCP there are several distinctive features in OKD4:</p>
<p>As a community distribution it does not require a pull secret from <a href="https://openshift.com/try">https://openshift.com/try</a>. All OKD4 images are available without additional authentication. The base OS image for OKD4 is available at <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/">https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/</a>. However some optional operators from <a href="https://operatorhub.io/" rel=" noopener">operatorhub.io</a> require a pull secret, so by default OKD4 installs a source with community operators only. See <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-enable-the-non-community-red-hat-operators">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
<p>OCP is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution with a heavy focus on high availability and production workloads. This puts restrictions on cluster configuration - for instance, single master installations are not supported. OKD4, however, allows users to install single master clusters - for development or stage environments. These clusters cannot be upgraded to later versions, though.</p>
<p>OKD4 creates a new nightly release after OCP tests are completed by our CI system. Every two weeks we'll promote a nightly to a stable release stream, so users can get updates to latest and tested code without switching channels.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Installing OKD4 is as easy as OCP4 - see <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd#getting-started">Getting Started</a> for instructions.</p>

  <p><span>30 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Research has begun to reveal many algorithms can be expressed as matrix multiplication, suggesting an unrealized connection between linear algebra and computer science. I speculate graphs are the missing piece of the puzzle. Graphs are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are suitable data structures for a wide variety of tasks, particularly on modern parallel processing hardware.</p>

<p>In this essay, I explore the virtues of graphs, algebra, types, and show how these concepts can help us reason about programs. I propose a computational primitive based on graph signal processing, linking software engineering, graphs, and linear algebra. Finally, I share my predictions for the path ahead, which I consider to be the start of an exciting new chapter in computing history.</p>

<p><em>n.b.: None of these ideas are mine alone. Shoulders of giants. Follow the links and use landscape mode for optimal reading experience.</em></p>



<p>Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I’ll bet they aren’t laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation. I’ve said some idiotic things to be sure, but I’ve also made some laughable predictions that were correct. Lesson learned: aim straighter.</p>

<p>In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named <a href="https://twitter.com/amirpc">Amir</a> who was singing Hinton’s praises. Hypnotized by his technicolor slides, I quit my job in a hurry and started an educational project using speech recognition and restricted Boltzmann machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about ASR and Android audio. Still love <a href="http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/">that idea</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and <a href="http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/">predicted</a> mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and confirmation bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, this is now driving the world completely insane. Don’t say I warned you, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.</p>

</center>

<p>In 2017, I witnessed the birth of <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a>. Had a lot of trouble convincing people that classical programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you’ll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. Don’t thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.</p>

<p>In 2018, I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I’ll bet they tried, but Google’s leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who gave a damn about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving <a href="https://ml4se.github.io/">research area</a> and showing up in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin">real</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/">products</a>, much to the chagrin of those who believed ML was a fad. I suspect their hype filter blinded them to the value those tools provide.</p>

<center>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>— breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

<img width="75%" src="http://breandan.net/images/microsoft_github_aquisition.png"></a>
</center>

<p>But to heck with everything I’ve said! If I had just one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Beat that drum as loud as I could. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning. If you want to build provably correct systems that scale on real-world applications, use types. Not everyone is convinced yet, but mark my words, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345">types</a> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types">coming</a>. Whoever figures out how to connect types and learning will be the next Barbara Liskov or Frances Allen.</p>

<p>This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I’m going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I’m making some big bets and some will be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them.</p>



<p>As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">some bridges</a> in a town divided by rivers, once inhabited by a man called Euler. Was there a tour crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days trying to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Hamilton</a> who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge">bridge</a>. We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen">thing</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">stones</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I picked up a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">Barabási</a> then at Notre Dame, who had some interesting things to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network">complex networks</a>. Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I <a href="http://breandan.net/images/complex_network_seminar.png">carpooled</a> with a <a href="https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu">nice professor</a>, and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages and many marvelous places.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017. I was lured by the siren song of algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia">Myia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breuleux/buche">Buche</a>. Matt Johnson gave a talk on <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a>. I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>. I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">Master’s thesis</a>. Our contributions were using algebra, shape inference and presenting AD as term rewriting.</p>

<p>In 2019, I joined a lab with a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">nice professor</a> at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like logical reasoning, knowledge graphs are an idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in the field. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays a big role in software engineering, and it’s the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we’re ever going to untangle this mess we’re in.</p>

<p>This Spring, I took a fascinating seminar on <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html">Graph Representation Learning</a>. A lot of delightful graph theory has been worked out over the last decade. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> turned into power iteration. People have discovered many interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians, Krylov methods, and spectral graph theory. These ideas have deepened our understanding of graph signal processing and its applications for learning and program analysis. More on that <a href="#graphs-computationally">later</a>.</p>



<p>Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent a variety of data types and procedural phenomena. Unlike most sequential languages, graphs are capable of expressing a much richer family of relations between entities, and are a natural fit for many problems in computer science, physics, biology and mathematics. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing expressive power:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sets</strong>: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">XML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a></li>
  <li><strong>DAGs</strong>: <a href="https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">Git</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_network">citations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph">dependency graphs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_management_system">workflows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">control flow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">MLPs</a></li>

</ul>

<p>As we realized in <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad">Kotlin∇</a>, directed graphs can be used to model mathematical expressions, as well as other formal languages, including source code, intermediate representations and binary artifacts. Not only can graphs be used to describe extant human knowledge, many recent examples have shown that machines can “grow” trees and graphs for various applications, such as program synthesis, mathematical deduction and physical simulation. Recent neuro-symbolic applications have shown promising early results in graph synthesis:</p>

</ul>

<p>The field of natural language processing has also developed a rich set of graph-based representations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar">constituency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">dependency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar">link</a> and other and other typed attribute grammars which can be used to reason about syntactic and semantic relations between natural language entities. Research has begun to show many practical applications for such grammars in the extraction and organization of human knowledge stored in large text corpora. Those graphs can be further processed into ontologies for logical reasoning.</p>

<p>Using coreference resolution and entity alignment techniques, we can reconstruct internally consistent relations between entities, which capture cross-corpus consensus in natural language datasets. When stored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">knowledge graphs</a>, these relations can be used for information retrieval and question answering, e.g. on wikis and other content management systems. Recent techniques have shown promise in automatic knowledge base construction (cf. <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00088">Reddy et al.</a>, 2016).</p>

<p>Lo and behold, the key idea behind knowledge graphs is our old friend, types. Knowledge graphs are multi-relational graphs whose nodes and edges possess a type. Two entities can be related by multiple types, and each type can relate many pairs of entities. We can index an entity based on its type for knowledge retrieval, and use …</p></div></div>

What are you reading today? What have you learnt today that you did not know previously.</p>

<p>Software reuseability does not always allow you to copy code wholesale to be placed into another. It requires you to make tweaks and alterations to get it to work as intended in another application. It’s more of an organ transplant than a lego brick. An accurate illustration to share a point! (:</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fly.io/blog/how-cdns-generate-certificates/">How CDNs generate certificate</a></p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fly.io/">fly.io</a>’s article is really interesting. It goes into the mechanics of how certifications are issued, and how does Let’s Encrypt verify your domain belongs to you. That is through the ACME protocol of course. Interstingly, they do provide free tier k8s services at $10/mth equivalent of paid services. Thats super decent. They seek to be competitive with the bigger players such as Google Cloud , Amazon Web Service and Azure.</p>

<p>If you heard about ansible, it seeks to serve the same role - configuration management. Maybe a good alternative to ansible if it has different dependences that VMs may not have for ansible.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://regexone.com/">learning regex</a></p>

<p>This website allows you to learn regex with good explanations with exercises that allows you to get your hands dirty. Being an advocate of learn by doing.  I really like how learning has been made easier for people to pick up a skill in bite sizes. No we should not spoon feed people but neither do we give a medium rare steak to a baby. Everything requires a progress and a series of steps to learn the essential skills before proceeding to a higher level competency. Personally, this is a good example of what seems like a lightweight and highly reusable static site for learning a new skill. Definitely a reference for my next pet projects.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/schenkd/nginx-ui">Nginx UI</a></p>

<p>As i was talking about Nginx as a file server, Nginx configuration has always been done via the command line and CLI. This is really amazing to have a UI for you to do your configuration with nice buttons to enable or disable your nginx settings. Really neat and interesting for you to consider on your own project.</p>

<p>If you want to create a webRTC application, there are many architecture to consider. You can read up more about them in my previous post <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">here</a>. In order to scale one, you have to consider the Selective Forwarding Unit as the server to transmit your media from your device to your remote peers. One of the beliefs I have is “never reinvent the wheel”. We are in a technology era where many giants have gone before you and already created many tools available for use. So in the case of scalability, it is true that there is no one tool that helps you to address all the technical challenges, but knowing the components of a successful and scalable video call application allows you to then identify the right tools for its respective components.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how people across the world are also attempting to solve the same problem, and this time he was able to break down the entire technology stack he used for his video call application. I wonder if it is able to deal with its scalability issue? As well. Below are a TON of articles about video call application that people has so kindly shared with me and now it is my responsibility to delve deeper into this topic and make sense of it.</p>

<p>Chanced upon this simple gadget - a full size 50 keys keyboard with a grey screen that is only about to contain 6 lines of words at any one point. This gadget was created as a way to focus on one thing - typing. For those that are in need for productivity, perhaps such a gadget can help you on that. Beyond productivity, i always wonder if students that are just starting out on their english education could start with such a gadget as well. Simple and straight to the point. It is a keyboard and all you can do is to type and make sense of what is written. But of course, english language goes beyond just stringing words together, that is only the outcome of many other fundamental skills such as grammar and understanding verbs, nouns, pronouns etc.</p>

<p>Mapillary is a geospatial company that strives to create a global street-level imagary dataset to rival Google Street View. Of all company to acquire such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, apparently facebook is the one to acquire them. Facebook actually has been actively involved in the mapping space, contributing over 800,000 kilometers of mappred roads to <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>.

<p>Data is asset. As with all things, once we start to put our own agenda over the rights (privacy rights in this case) of people, thats where the problem starts. Although there are clause to indicate that they may still collect data from you in incognito mode, i guess this violation of rights still stands. In the realm of technology, its all chill and breezy until you start collecting data from users. That’s when you are in for a whole new ball game. Does your entire architecture considered the suite of security measures before your collect your customers first data? Like a ship, you cannot just leave the back portion of the ship unbuilt or complete before you put the ship into waters.</p>

Starting up a company is definitely a trying time and we have to gather as much meaningful knowledge and skills else we will risk bringing the company down. Community support is also crucial for us to exchange experiences and more importantly lessons from one another’s mistakes. This will definitely be something one should put some serious thought if you wish to start your own</p>

<p>Telegram has always been my go to for numerous reasons: speed, ease of use, multi device login, PIN MESSAGE feature, games, platform for bot creation and games. These are just the perks experienced by an end user myself. The security and secret channel provides a nice option for more confidential conversations as well. All powerful tools can be disastrous if it lands onto the hands of scheming ones. So i always wonder how telegram seeks to address issues of users utilizing such a powerful platform for destructive goals. Till today, this question seems to be unanswered.</p>

<p>When we want to grow, more often than not, we choose skirt the challenge before us and find easier alternatives because we feel inadequate. Here’s an example, if you want to learn a language, lets say korean, and somehow you managed to have a job offer that allows you to speak korean, but you choose to turn down that job because you dont feel confident enough in your language yet. So instead, you choose to listen to podcast at home everyday until you feel you are ready. You know what could have helped you to get better in korean? Working at a job in korean.</p>

<p>This is a common tendency as we make crippling decisions if these decisions are directed by fear. Fear has its own way to manipulate us to find alternatives with its fair share of difficulty to substitute the real thing itself. If you want to growth and succeed? There is no other way, but one way: fail forward.</p>

<div>
<p>Reporting by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-venmo-to-roll-out-crypto-buying-and-selling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk </a>on June 22 speculates that Paypal intends to facilitate the direct buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for its 325 million customer base, through both its Paypal and Venmo services. Paypal is no stranger to crypto, it has been partnered with Coinbase to facilitate fiat withdrawals for US, Candian and European users since 2016. But this move marks a shift of its crypto involvement into the mainstream realm with competing services like Robinhood and Square Cash App already having incorporated Bitcoin purchases on their own platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To contextualise the significance of this, we can look at the closest reference point for crypto generated revenue on a mainstream payment platform – Square.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Payments company Square (NYSE:SQ) revealed on May 6, 2020 that it generated $306 million in Bitcoin (BTC) revenue during Q1 2020…Square confirmed that volumes increased by 72% quarter-over-quarter and 367% year-over-year”&nbsp; – (Source: </em><a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/05/161145-payments-company-square-generated-306-million-in-bitcoin-btc-revenue-during-q1-2020/#:~:text=Payments%20company%20Square%20(NYSE%3ASQ,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202020.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Crowdfund Insider</em></a><em>)</em></p>



<p>Square has around 24 million monthly active users, less than 10% of Paypal’s 325 million user base and 40 million active monthly users on Venmo. Paypal’s Q1 2020 reporting of $4.1 billion in net revenue is a leading indicator of what it’s crypto integration signals to the market on cryptocurrencies’ growing mindshare.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Onboarding crypto for growth: Paypal is building a dam wall&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A move to incorporate cryptocurrency on the platform can be seen as a natural extension of PayPal’s user acquisition and growth strategy on two fronts:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Existing cryptocurrency market </strong>– Onboarding fiat funds for the purchase of cryptocurrency continues to be a pain point despite the proliferation of crypto trading platforms. Existing participants and enthusiasts of cryptocurrency could find PayPal to be the easier alternative for onboarding into cryptocurrency trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>New market share for cryptocurrency: </strong>As cryptocurrency grows in consumer mindshare, PayPal could act as the comfortable and trusted first stop for those unfamiliar with the territory.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A globally familiar and trusted payment gateway that is crypto-friendly is perhaps best positioned to channel, contain and manage the oncoming influx of crypto related transaction activity. While others might have been slightly earlier to direct transactions, PayPal will look to leverage its brand dominance to segway as much of this activity into its own dam as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Growing Bitcoin mindshare: Paypal as a trust agent for the masses&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Bitcoin represents a digital currency that is transactable and accepted globally and can be transacted without the need for a trusted third party. Its nature as a trustless currency without borders underpins its narrative as the harbinger of the monetary revolution – a concept inherently tied to its mindshare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s value is a strange phenomenon in and of itself, where users came to a consensus in the absence of the state or platform backed trust elements that traditionally imbue assets or currencies with value. In the place of ‘trust’ the value of Bitcoin initially springboarded off ‘belief’, belief in the ‘work’ that was being done to produce the coins – i.e. the digital mining of the currency. Here the consumption of electricity required for mining represented a cost, and the value of that effort translated into Bitcoin’s value. In its initial stages this cost could be seen as negligible and its value was reflected as such within a small community of enthusiasts who saw a revolution in the monetary system. As this belief propagated, starting from a center of technological enthusiasts and moving outward, mining operations became larger with coordinated efforts and different organisations competing in the space.</p>



<p>The mining input itself didn’t equate to a proportional dollar denominated value, instead the mining represented a ‘unit of belief’ in the system. As the value assigned to this belief grew stronger, eventually drawing in speculators – the unit of belief grew more valuable. As&nbsp; mindshare for Bitcoin grew so too did its value, and in line with the whims of belief the price will continue to fluctuate gaining more stability only as the belief becomes more anchored.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Belief driven adoption: The ripples of a grassroots technology&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We can think about belief adoption as a series of concentric circles:</p>



<ul><li>Core circle : technology enthusiasts – belief in the potential of Bitcoin</li><li>2nd circle: technically inclined –&nbsp; belief in the technical narrative and agreeing that there is value in such technology</li><li>3rd circle – speculators – belief that Bitcoin holds value as a result of the previous two circles</li><li>4th circle – lay audience – whose trust is transferred from existing trust agents / institutions etc.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Knowing that the core to the 3rd circle has already been flushed with belief and crypto is primed to be adopted by a more lay audience, PayPal is well positioned to feed into the 4th layer. The trust built up over two decades across consumers and merchants can’t be overstated, especially in its ability to catalyse lay belief and participation for crypto on behalf of its 325 million users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We increasingly see the 4th layer’s belief adoption being accelerated by both direct and more peripheral signaling. While PayPal,Robinhood, Square etc. are definitely more on the nose, the likes of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Libra (Facebook’s stable currency) and bank/ state backed digital currencies are indirect feedback loops to the belief in the adoption of Bitcoin. Where it may not lead to the direct use of Bitcoin, it does bring people up the curve of trusting, understanding and utilising digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of whether one believes that Bitcoin is a currency or not, the belief adoption cycles have given intrinsic value to Bitcoin as an asset – value that can’t be overlooked. Each layer of belief adoption was accompanied by its own miniature boom and bust cycles bringing us to today. Bitcoin still stands out as a phenomenon, where its value is entirely tied up in its belief adoption structure. Competing digital currencies from trust entities (Facebook as an example) or states still function on the idea of borders (digital or otherwise) and are intrinsically collateralised by the trust and assets of the backing entity – not quite the revolution Bitcoin represents.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Social scalability – trust minimisation in a hyper connected world</h3>



<p>Social scalability: Bitcoin’s inefficiency in computation and scalability is not a flaw but a feature.</p>



<p>“The secret to Bitcoin’s success is certainly not its computational efficiency or its scalability in the consumption of resources.&nbsp; Specialized Bitcoin hardware is designed by highly paid experts to perform only one particular function – to repetitively solve a very specific and intentionally very expensive kind of computational puzzle. That puzzle is called a proof-of-work, because the sole output of the computation is just a proof that the computer did a costly computation.”</p>



<p>“…Bitcoin’s success is that its prolific resource consumption and poor computational scalability is buying something even more valuable: social scalability. Social scalability is the ability of an institution –- a relationship or shared endeavor, in which multiple people repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or other features which constrain or motivate participants’ behaviors — to overcome shortcomings in human minds and in the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution that limit who or how many can successfully participate. Social scalability is about the ways and extents to which participants can think about and respond to institutions and fellow participants as the variety and numbers of participants in those institutions or relationships grow.&nbsp; It’s about human limitations, not about technological limitations or physical resource constraints…”</p>



<p>Social scalability is measured by the ability of participants to coordinate efficiently for the continued extraction of value even as the network scales. As networks grow, there is a requirement for increasing the level of trust. But with this increase, comes the added cognitive burden for individuals on the potential harms in the network, thus decreasing efficiency. This is especially true of our hyper connected world, where we are required to place trust in many intermediaries to gain benefit from the network. Trust minimisation then becomes an important factor in achieving greater levels of social scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One way to estimate the social scalability of an institutional technology is by the number of people who can beneficially participate in the institution. Another way to estimate social scalability is by the extra benefits and harms an institution bestows or imposes on participants, before, for cognitive or behavioral reasons, the expected costs and other harms of participating in an institution grow faster than its benefits.”</p>



<p>“Satoshi’s breakthrough with money was to provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerability to counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationally expensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionally expensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in social scalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and fully trusted intermediary.”</p>



<p>In order to address the stunting of social scalability in an increasingly hyper connected world, starting from base principles, even with the trade off of efficiency, is an effective method. Traction may be much slower, but from its humble beginnings it could provide humanity with a model for social scalability that would otherwise have been unavailable. The belief that this form of social scalability holds value is demonstrated by the game theory mechanics of the energy expended to secure the network, compared to the value attributed to a Bitcoin by …</p></div></div></div>

You can calculate things on years of data, but doing the calculation might take a day. Real-time is much faster, but you can sort of only work forward in time. Really, you need both these things. If I want to look at my most liked tweet, I need to look at all the old batch data, but also any real-time tweets that I’m doing&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So it’s 2013 Sam Ritchie is a mechanical engineer by training is uncle is Dennis Richie, and he’s working at Twitter, and his job is just translating from one system to the other from real-time to a batch job.</span></p><p><b>Sam:</b><span> And there’s just so many jobs that looked like that, and it kind of looked like that was going to be my life, like just coding these things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You just said enough is enough. Like we need to figure out how to write one piece of code that will run in a real-time world and also in batch world.</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>I guess I’ve come up with the problem from that side where it’s like, “oh, I can calculate this thing, but I just started calculating it and like, the world existed before.”</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b>Y<span>eah, the backfill problem’s hard and it’s hard. Like it just consumes your life writing, you know, backfill jobs and you kinda, you, you stick to really simple things because you know, you’re gonna have to write them twice. You’re going to have to maintain them twice.&nbsp;</span><span>I mean, it’s really not a nice way to live.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Backstory</b></h2><p><b>Adam:</b><span> Hello and welcome to co recursive. I’m Adam Gordon bell. How did Sam get away from these one-off jobs? How did they solve this fast versus big data issue? An issue many are still struggling with, the answer isn’t some new data processing system that he’s here to show.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Well, the answer is actually abstract Algebra and probabilistic data structures.&nbsp; If you don’t know what those are, don’t worry. We’re going to walk through it. We’re also going to talk about what Sam calls portal abstractions. That’s finding abstractions that let you leverage work from other fields, But we’ll do that at the ending. </span><span>Let’s start at the beginning. When Sam was working away at Twitter.</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>I was on the revenue team.&nbsp; I had a colleague named Oscar Boykin who I didn’t know that well. We both maintained one of these like libraries I mentioned before that lived on top of a dupe. He had the scala version. I had this closure version and I’m kind of yet again, I had a task for work that was like building one of these dashboards.</span></p><p><span>You’re trying to count something like, you know, tweets per user per day. You’re just basically grouping on some key and then adding numbers to a database. And there are just so many jobs that looked like that, and it kind of looked like that was going to be my life, like just coding these things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Through, you know, this or that, Oscar and I teamed up to work on some shared piece of machinery for serialization between the code we both maintained and we realized that like we both were doing this sort of thing and he’s got a lower tolerance for BS. You just said enough is enough.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Like we need to figure out how to write one piece of code that will run in the real-time world and also in the batch world.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like this is, this happens with compilers, like this is a compiler problem. Let’s just back off and solve it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>So they solve it. They built version one of this open-source analytics system could do a batch, it could do real-time. Some of the results together. They called it a Summingbird. It sums things, and it’s from Twitter, so it’s a bird. But then they had some interesting revelations about what they had created.</span></p><h2><b>Stitching Things Together</b></h2><p><b>Sam:</b><span> You know, if you really simplify what we’re dealing with here,&nbsp; you’re writing code that is generating for some key, tweets per user, per hour, something that happens. It might just tweet per user, it might be how many users we have.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And then you have some value, you have some counter that you’re ticking, so you’re just incrementing this thing up. And so many machines learning features and dashboards and everything is just like ticking counters. It’s kind of like and that’s like the secret of analytics work is you’re just adding ones. That seems suspicious too. Like that’s something you could maybe break out of like a really, is that all we can do? Like how would you do more complicated things? But so this, this software package, Summingbird was a library that lets you write a logical declaration of what you wanted to happen. And then, the second component of it would take, that data structure that you’ve built and go run it on any number of these different, underlying platforms.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>The God of Counting</b></h2><p><span><strong>Sam:&nbsp;</strong> So I can power a dashboard. I can do backfills. I have this boundary that’s maintained transparently to me, that behind the scenes we’ll give a hard line between the, you know, massive, multi-year database. And then the last couple of hours that are stored in some much harder to manage, much more fragile, but very, very fast, you know, online processing system.</span></p><p><span>And you know, phase one was just write something that can do, you know logically you’re doing the same thing. You’ve been rewriting the same code. Just have the machine write it for you. but it does open this door and this is the topic I wanted to get to.</span></p><p><span>It opens the door and you start to look at this thing and think you know, you have these two buckets. One is like all, all-time before a couple of hours ago, and then you have a bucket for each of the recent hours. So you’re doing this addition of some of the numbers, Uh, but you’re sort of putting parentheses in one case around like years and years of data, and then another set of parentheses around like each of the previous few hours, and then you take this final step of adding them together.</span></p><p><b>Adam:</b><span> If you’re calculating how many times I’ve tweeted, like Hadoop gets like everything up to yesterday, and then I’m adding that to something that’s actually getting the real-time data and just</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>That’s right.</span></p><h2><b>Abstract Algebra</b></h2><p><b>Sam: </b><span>&nbsp;Those are nice ideas, but they’re not that they’re sort of obvious and not that powerful. But this idea of adding things and putting parentheses wherever you want, It also seems kind of innocuous. It’s like this little lamp you pick up, right? It looks kind of, you know, you rub the lamp, you and what you find is like, this idea is not, it’s not your new idea.</span></p><p><span>It’s very simple, but it actually exists in this field of abstract algebra.</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>Alright. Abstract algebra, if you’re not familiar with it, it’s a subfield of math. Stick with me here. I’ll explain it a little bit. A lot of concepts from abstract algebra can be implemented in a programming language. A semigroup is one of these. It’s an interface. It has one method. That method is add or sum. If we want to stick with the summingbird pun. It also has a rule that things have to be associative. You might remember associativity from a high school math class.</span></p><p><span>What happened here is Sam had the system where to calculate analytics. The calculation had to implement a certain interface and then the system could run it in both worlds. The interface had an add method, which meant it was a semigroup, which meant this subfield of math with people talking about seemingly obscure constructs could suddenly enable him to answer interesting questions in his real-time analytics dashboard thing at Twitter.</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>So yeah, you can start slimming things back, and when you slimmed it back almost to nothing, you’re left with this object called a semigroup, which is an idea of: okay I need some set of things. So numbers in what we’ve been doing, which is just counting, some way to quote, add two of them together and get something out that’s like still the same type and then a test that goes along with that. So the test is that I have to be able to do that associatively.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So this is kind of, it sort of sounds like a pedantic Mathy thing. Like there’s this impulse that I’m sure we can get into in the functional programming world to like, like see ideas that seemed mathy and like slap math names on them and just tweet about it and to like spraying that and that, that sucks.</span></p><p><span>But I think it’s, the, the thing you get when you do that when you identify …</span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-24d5bd2a5b5175cc93b5"><div><p>With social distancing policies in place, many families have been longing for a way for their children to connect socially - or desperately looking for viable childcare options while schools and daycares are closed. </p><p>Hiring a full-time nanny or teacher to engage with children while families are working is simply not a feasible option for many families. Even with some schools scheduled to re-open in the fall, families may feel uncomfortable with their children gathering in large groups, putting them or more vulnerable family members at risk of infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of these reasons and more have led many families to consider starting learning pods, microschools, homeschool co-ops or childcare swaps.&nbsp;</p><p>For the last 5 years, I’ve helped hundreds of parents and teachers start or join microschools. The families who joined these schools came for a variety of reasons. For older children, they were looking for more personalized learning, but couldn’t afford private school. For younger children, many families didn’t have free or affordable preschool options available and were looking for ways to save money. Some were looking for learning environments that better accommodated special needs, had more diversity or were catered to special interests such as bilingual education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others felt that their children would develop better friendships in a smaller group setting.</p><p>What these families found was wonderful play-based learning opportunities, education tailored to their children’s strengths and interests, teachers their children loved and most importantly, an incredible community of families - and friends for life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A word about health and safety</strong></p><p>If you’re thinking about starting a learning pod during the pandemic, it’s important that you’re fully informed and prepared for the risks this might involve. Research suggests that joining a small microschool is safer than returning to school, but there are still <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">risks </a>to consider. </p><p>These are the most important things to know and keep in mind:</p><p><em>Children catch Covid-19</em></p><p>When considering starting a learning pod during a global pandemic, it’s important to be serious about health and safety concerns. While children don’t often exhibit symptoms of Covid-19, they are just as likely to catch COVID-19 as adults and can definitely pass it on. If one family in your learning pod catches COVID-19, the rest of the members will very likely be infected.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Wear masks</em></p><p>Masks can greatly reduce the threat of COVID-19. Whether or not your children return to school or join a learning pod, wear masks. <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">Masks will greatly reduce the chance of catching this disease</a>.  Learn more about how masks can help reduce the threat of COVID-19 and what happened when schools re-opened in Israel and Melbourne <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">here.</a></p><p><em>Consider doing your learning pod online</em></p><p>Many parents have a negative view of online learning and socialization because our educational institutions and providers that were doing learning in-person have had difficulty adjusting to this new medium. Online experiences have been painful and unpleasant. That said, it doesn’t have to be that way. There are plenty of wonderful ways kids are socializing online. And you can certainly <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/onlineconnections">build meaningful social connections</a> in an online learning pod.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn more about helping kids develop social skills online <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/onlineconnections">here</a>.</p><p><strong>The checklist: Here is what you’ll need to do to start your learning pod</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Decide what you want</p></li><li><p>Choose a curriculum (or make it play-based)</p></li><li><p>Find a teacher (or swap)</p></li><li><p>Find another family (or families) to join</p></li></ol><p><strong>Step 1. Get clear on what you want</strong></p><p><em>Curriculum, schedule, ages, philosophy</em></p><p>You’ll be able to start your learning pod a lot more quickly and manage expectations better if you figure out what you want before you start looking for another family. It can definitely be fun to collaborate with other families and a teacher in developing your learning pod. However, if you try to be all things to all people, it might end up falling apart. It won’t be difficult to find another family. I recommend choosing your curriculum, schedule, ages and teacher (unless you plan on being a teacher) and then presenting your plan to your community to see who wants to sign on.</p><p><strong>Choose curriculum: </strong>There are so many wonderful curricula for secular homeschool families. And you absolutely don’t have to be a teacher to use them. Any of them can easily be led by a parent or caregiver in a small group with little to no prep time.&nbsp; If you decide to get an experienced teacher to lead your group or it’s more focused on social/childcare than learning you don’t necessarily need a curriculum. Here are a few of my favorites. I strongly encourage you to choose a curriculum that works for your child and then invite other families to join in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are a few of my favorites</strong> and a review I’ve written on each of them (note that these are equally great if you decide to focus on 1-1 instruction with your children). They require very little prep and minimal parent involvement.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khan-app-kids"><span>Khan App Kids</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khanacademy"><span>Khan Academy</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/criticalthinkingco"><span>Critical Thinking Co</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://blossomandroot.com/"><span>Blossom and Root</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/moving-beyond-the-page"><span>Moving Beyond the Page</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/oakmeadow"><span>Oak Meadow</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/time4learning"><span>Time4Learning</span></a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/torchlight"><span>Torchlight</span>	</a></p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Language:&nbsp; </strong>Decide if you want the pod to be conducted in another language besides English. Language immersion is always a great way for children to learn and pods are a great way to help children develop their maternal language skills or learn a new one.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Number of families: </strong>Choose how many families you want to join. While we’re in this pandemic, I strongly recommend only one another family who is also practicing rigorous social distancing. Generally pods tend to have anywhere between 5-10 kids. Pods with children under 5 should not have more than 1 teacher for 4 children. Pods with children 6 and up generally do well with 5-10 kids and one teacher or a teacher and assistant.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Ages:</strong> decide what ages you feel comfortable letting into your group. Ages can absolutely be mixed and differentiated learning is wonderful for learning. If you have siblings of very different ages, you may want to create a wider range. Generally good age groups to combine together are <strong>1) 5 and under 2) 6-9 3) 9-12 4) 13 and up. </strong>Pods can becoming challenging for older kids who need a bigger and more diverse group - and you really might want to consider an online option for this age group.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Schedule: </strong>If the goal of your program is to provide learning and social interaction for your children, and childcare isn’t that important to you, generally 2-3 days a week or 2-3 mornings or afternoons a week (for younger kids)&nbsp; is more than enough to accomplish this.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>If you want to swap:</strong> Decide how the arrangement will work. Do you want to swap days or half days? How many families do you want to get involved? Will you rotate homes (I recommend having one central location if you can rather than swapping houses) What kind of parenting style do you feel comfortable with?</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Values:&nbsp; </strong>Write a list of all the things that are important to you. Do families need to be on time? Do you want other families to participate in some way. How do you feel about parents coming late or leaving early? What’s your approach to parenting?&nbsp; What are your views on diversity and inclusion? Is your pod secular or religious? What rules do you expect other families to follow in your house?&nbsp; Make sure you’re very clear on your values so you’re sure that you’re aligned with the other family joining.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Budget: </strong>Your costs will include teacher, curriculum, background check and “school supplies.” The main cost is hiring a teacher or babysitter to lead the group. However, if you’re swapping with other families, which is a great option, then that cost is free! Think about what you can afford to pay a leader. I recommend paying at least $40/hr to a trained teacher.&nbsp; If you decide to have your caregiver lead your group, I recommend starting at $25/hr for 2 children, $30 for 3 and an additional $5 for each child who joins. School supplies generally won’t cost more than $200/year. It costs about $50 to run a background check on the leader of your group. Curriculum can range from $20 to $500 for the whole group for the whole year. There is plenty of free and discounted curriculum in homeschool groups.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Pick a location: </strong>Decide if you want this to take place outside, at your house, at a teacher’s home or alternate homes. For health reasons, for consistency and also for setting up an environment conducive to learning, I recommend not swapping homes, but many have done it with success.&nbsp;<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Make sure you are following childcare and schooling laws in your state: </strong>Generally two children can be considered a license-exempt childcare. However, if you are over age 6, you will generally have to file as a homeschooler or be enrolled in some type of school.  Remember that you have a constitutional right to educate your child as you see fit, but there may be specific guidelines in some states regarding how many children can gather with a paid caregiver or teacher. <a href="https://www.withprimer.com/">Primer</a> has a state-by-state homeschool regulations navigator that you can use.  If your child is under 5, check <a href="https://www.noodle.com/articles/l/preschool-how-preschool-works-by-state">Noodle’s</a> state by state guide for preschool laws. You can also contact your department of education or child care services for more information. We are also happy to help you find the right information for your state, as these laws can sometimes be confusing and even contradictory!</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Write a one paragraph post:</strong> Come up with one paragraph you can post to social media that includes a little bit about your family, your vision for the program, schedule, ages and your general location that you can use to post to parent groups looking for a teacher, caregiver or other families.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Step 2. Find a teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Once you’ve figured out what you want and how much you’re willing to pay, you can start looking for a teacher. If you already have a nanny or caregiver or family watching your child, they can absolutely be the leader of the group. I’ve found the best place to find teachers and caregivers is local facebook parenting groups.&nbsp; Other place to find teachers include babysitting sites like care.com or urban sitter …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>Over the course of the past few years running my startup, it’s almost ludicrous just how much I’ve learnt. From how to turn a coffee-table conversation into a working product, a product into a scalable venture, scalable venture into multi-million dollar funding rounds, etc.</p><p>But no single area of learning has been as valuable, scalable or effective as the knowledge of how to manage a team. As soon as you have more than one person working on something the dynamic shifts completely  —  in ways that are hard to quantify from the outset no matter how prepared you think you are.</p><p>It’s a strange phenomenon, since usually you’re hiring someone to fill a gap that you desperately need sealed. Or to pick up some slack that you simply cannot straighten out yourself. </p><p>But no matter what, scaling from a solo-operator, or solo-engineer/designer/salesperson to a “team” requires a change in process, clarity and, most importantly, <strong>your own psychology</strong>.</p><p>As a matter of fact, one could make a compelling case that learning how to manage a team is actually an exercise in learning how to manage oneself &nbsp;first  —  and as an extension, others.</p><p>No longer can you (or should you) see yourself as the “hero”, the builder of the product, the linchpin of the organization. You’re now forced to see yourself as a curator of talent, a facilitator of alignment and collaboration, a guiding light when there is encroaching darkness and a steady hand on the rudder when seas get rough.</p><p>The following are a collection of principles I have leaned on and continue to lean on, refine, and adapt to the changing environment. Some of them may be bullshit, others may be timeless. That’s besides the point. </p><p>The main goal is to put them down for myself, for accountability, for updating, and in the off-chance that they prove useful to others who happen to stumble upon.</p><p>‍</p><h3>TL;DR&nbsp;Quick List Of Principles. Click to scroll.</h3><ol start="1" role="list"><li><a href="#1">People are most often looking for either guidance or confirmation i.e. “Ask before answering”.</a></li><li><a href="#2">Always apologize first, or make it clear you won’t i.e. “Limbo Kills”.</a></li><li><a href="#3">Respect and love define a leader  —  not age, experience, title or role.</a></li><li><a href="#4">Don’t equate long work for hard work.</a></li><li><a href="#5">In times of conflict  —  breathe, empathize, return.</a></li><li><a href="#6">Before you can win, you have to make sure everyone is playing the same game.</a></li><li><a href="#7">Things don’t gain importance by words, they gain importance by actions alone.</a></li><li><a href="#8">Simplicity is not always the goal, complexity is not always the answer</a></li><li><a href="#9">No management book will ever teach you the real thing.

People are most often looking for either guidance or confirmation i.e. “Ask before answering”.</h3><p>Most people (myself included), though they’d be chaste to admit it, have very high opinions of their own thoughts and decisions. It can be all too easy to fall in love with the sound of your own voice without understanding just what it is that others are looking for. </p><p>In most cases people are listening to you to be polite  —  there are exceptions of course. But in a majority of cases I’ve found that people are looking for one of two things  —  <strong>guidance</strong> or <strong>confirmation</strong>.</p><p>There are different strategies for dealing with either scenario but the main principle here is to understand which situation you are in. The way you respond to someone looking for confirmation, who has already made up their mind, ought to be vastly different than those who need your expertise and advise.</p><p>It’s not that you should always agree with their decision, not at all, but if you don’t understand that confirmation is what the person is looking for and you begin offering them guidance it’s all too common for your words to fall on deaf ears.</p><p>Know which game you are going to play before you prance on the field.</p><p>‍</p><h3>2. Always apologize first, or make it clear you won’t i.e. “Limbo Kills”.</h3><p>The worst thing that can happen between two team members is <strong>not</strong> conflict —  that’s actually relatively easy to deal with. Usually stemming from miscommunication, talking past each other or — on rare occasions — toxic personalities, conflict tends to lend itself well to mediation.</p><p>Situations with conflict also have the added benefit that they are either solvable (a misunderstanding/miscommunication) or unsolvable (fundamental philosophical differences) and you can move on once you understand which is which.</p><p>But back to the original point, the <strong>actual </strong>worst thing for relationships within a team is <strong>uncertainty</strong>. </p><p>When I don’t know where you stand and you don’t know where I stand then we end up at an impasse that kills creativity and collaboration like no other. This is especially true in small, close knit teams.</p><p>If I’m in my corner expecting you to acknowledge my position and apologize to me and meanwhile you are huddled in yours, nothing gets done. Tensions flare. Feelings get hurt. Work becomes a chore, life gets hard.</p><p>On the flip side if you’re clear in your actions  —  <em>“I’m sorry, I don’t know if this was entirely my fault but I know there are things I could have done better and I apologize”</em> or <em>“I am not going to apologize as I believe strongly in X, Y Z”</em>.</p><p>Either of these two sentiments brings clarity to the situation. It’s quite possible or probably that someone might not agree, but it removes the tension of uncertainty and either shifts the situation more towards empathy and understanding or towards fundamental conflict  —  which as I mentioned before, is actually preferable to uncertainty.</p><p>Limbo kills relationships, partnerships, businesses, and probably house plants. Don’t allow any room for it in the culture you build.</p><p>‍</p><h3>3. Respect and love define a leader  —  not age, experience, title or role.</h3><p>Leadership is the process of helping others realize their own potential. It's about providing support, direction, assistance (when needed)&nbsp;and having the insight to know when to <strong>keep your mouth shut</strong>,</p><p>While strategies, tactics, styles and more vary the one thing that does not is the notion that leadership transcends surface level properties. The same way we don't associate eye color, hair, height, or weight with leadership ability, we should also be careful to attribute age, experience, title or role to the same.</p><p>While it may be true that most people don't rise to the level of their expectation but fall to the level of their training, where that level of expectation is in the first place will determine how far and deep the fall. The higher you set the expectation, the higher the eventual outcome. People are malleable and have the potential for infinite change, thus putting bounds on growth based on superficial characteristics holds an organization back more than anything else.</p><p>A&nbsp;leader is not defined by these characteristics but should rather be defined by the <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>love</strong> of the people they lead. While bringing love into a business context is not a normal thing to do, stories like that of Herb Kelleher ("A company is stronger if it is bound by <strong><em>love</em></strong> rather than by fear.") give us indication that the sterile, emotionless bubble business has long been associated with may not be the most effective way to go.</p><p>Measure yourself by respect and love and your team, your company, and maybe someday even the world, will thank you for it.</p><p>‍<br></p><h3>4. Don’t equate long work for hard work.</h3><p>Long work usually means inefficient process, unrefined planning or lack of understanding the true goal. Of course sometimes with deadlines and the grind of a startup long hours are unavoidable, but in general long does not mean hard (at least, well, not in this context) and sometimes 4 hours of focused, primed, <strong>hard </strong>work can beat 12 hours of unfocused muddling.</p><p>The other important things here is to never expect your team to work more than you do and to not hold people to a standard of working insane hours. Hours do not prove loyalty, they do not prove respect and they do not prove buy-in to the mission. </p><p>Asking people to go above and beyond should be a tool that’s used only when it’s needed and therefore a tool that should barely be used at all because at the end of the day building a lasting business is a marathon, not a sprint, and as a marathon runner I can safely say that <strong>pacing</strong>. <strong>is</strong>. <strong>everything</strong>.</p><p>‍</p><h3>5. In times of conflict  —  breathe, empathize, return.</h3><p>As a recovering hot head, dealing with conflict maturely and in a matter that de-escalates the situation has never been my strong suit. I’ve had to discover strategies the hard way and have collected advice the easy way all of which effectively come back to the same thing — <strong>add an interrupt</strong>.</p><p>Moments of passion rarely lead to positive outcomes (in this context, at least) so the rule of backing up, breathing (6 deep breaths, lowering that blood pressure), trying to empathize with the person (or people) on the other end, and then coming back to the situation helps almost <strong>every time.</strong></p><p>A thoughtless Slack message can be just as damaging to a relationship as a rude comment or public shaming, so adding a pattern interrupt is crucial to avoid putting your foot in your mouth as much as humanly possible.</p><p>‍</p><h3>6. Before you can win, you have to make sure everyone is playing the same game.</h3><p>A company is nothing more than a loose organization of people working towards the same goal. But if there is any crack in this shared reality, any fuzz in this vision of the future that you are working towards, then it becomes difficult to move forward quickly or effectively.</p><p>It’s difficult to win if you’re not playing the same game and impossible to play unless you’re all on the same field. Err towards <strong>oversharing</strong> and <strong>over-communicating</strong>, especially when it comes to things like mission, vision, culture and roadmap.</p><p>As the saying goes, <em>“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach </em><strong><em>them</em></strong><em> to </em><strong><em>yearn</em></strong><em> for the vast and endless </em><strong><em>sea</em></strong><em>.” </em>It’s the job of a leader to set priorities and to cultivate that yearning by making sure each and every person with you has the same image of the endless sparkling water just beyond their reach.</p><p>‍</p><h3>7. Things don’t gain importance by …</h3></div></div></div></div></div>

SVD may occur in one out of three elderly individuals, causes about a quarter of all strokes, and is the most common cause of vascular dementia.</p><p>The team studied two independent cohorts of SVD patients, one from the UK and the other from the Netherlands.* Across both cohorts, they found that individuals with higher baseline apathy, as well as those with increasing apathy over time, had a greater risk of dementia. In contrast, neither baseline depression nor change in depression had any detectable influence on dementia risk.</p><p>These findings were consistent despite variation in the severity of participants’ symptoms, suggesting that they could be generalised across a broad spectrum of SVD cases. The relationship between apathy and dementia remained after controlling for other well-established risk factors for dementia including age, education, and cognition.</p><p>Lead author, Jonathan Tay, from Cambridge’s Department of Clinical Neurosciences said: “There has been a lot of conflicting research on the association between late-life depression and dementia. Our study suggests that may partially be due to common clinical depression scales not distinguishing between depression and apathy.”</p><p>Apathy, defined as a reduction in ‘goal-directed behaviour’, is a common neuropsychiatric symptom in SVD, and is distinct from depression, which is another symptom in SVD. Although there is some symptomatic overlap between the two, previous MRI research linked apathy, but not depression, with white matter network damage in SVD.</p><p>Jonathan Tay said: “Continued monitoring of apathy may be used to assess changes in dementia risk and inform diagnosis. Individuals identified as having high apathy, or increasing apathy over time, could be sent for more detailed clinical examinations, or be recommended for treatment.”</p><p>Over 450 participants - all with MRI-confirmed SVD - recruited from three hospitals in South London and Radboud University’s Neurology Department in the Netherlands, were assessed for apathy, depression and dementia over several years.</p><p>In the UK cohort, nearly 20% of participants developed dementia, while 11% in the Netherlands cohort did, likely due to the more severe burden of SVD in the UK cohort. In both datasets, patients who later developed dementia showed higher apathy, but similar levels of depression at baseline, compared to patients who did not.</p><p>The study provides the basis for further research, including the mechanisms that link apathy, vascular cognitive impairment, and dementia. Recent MRI work suggests that similar white matter networks underlie motivation and cognitive function in SVD. Cerebrovascular disease, which can be caused by hypertension and diabetes, can lead to network damage, resulting in an early form of dementia, presenting with apathy and cognitive deficits. Over time, SVD-related pathology increases, which is paralleled by increasing cognitive and motivational impairment, eventually becoming severe enough to meet criteria for a dementia state.</p><p>Jonathan Tay says: “This implies that apathy is not a risk factor for dementia per se, but rather an early symptom of white matter network damage. Understanding these relationships better could have major implications for the diagnosis and treatment of patients in the future.”</p><p>–</p><p><i>This article is republished from the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cam.ac.uk%2F&amp;t=ZTk4NDQxMGYwMWI1YjBlM2U5NDg5NTg0ZGU3MDU3Mzc5NGEyMWZhMyxtN1YxVUl0Ng%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F623746641320624128%2Flink-between-dementia-and-apathy&amp;m=0">University of Cambridge</a> under a Creative Commons license.

<p>I’ll admit, I’ve spent the last several years disillusioned with technology. All the quirky little tools people made gave way to ad-fueled companies that refused to play well with others.</p>



<p>This is the first time I’ve been excited for a new technology in memory.</p>



<p>ActivityPub is to HTTP what HTTP was to TCP/IP. TCP/IP bridged disparate systems and allowed them to communicate reliably. HTTP allowed the various services built on TCP/IP to communicate with each other reliably.</p>



<p>ActivityPub goes one step further and provides a way for users on those services to communicate in a way that has the appearance of directness. I can follow, for example, Blender’s videos on PeerTube from my Mastodon account. Or I can use a blog platform that speaks ActivityPub and let people follow it from other services. It’s all the best features of Twitter with the flexibility of RSS. And unlike Twitter, your Mastodon profile will probably never lose its RSS feed in a company’s pursuit of profit. The main project already funds itself through Patreon, as do most of the larger instances.</p>



<p>It’s still early. We could be looking at a situation like Usenet and Gopher where neither ended up being The Thing because AOL soaked up the nascent public internet, then Facebook soaked up the nascent commercial web.</p>



<p>Right now the popularity of Mastodon carries ActivityPub while projects like Plume (blogging), Pixelfed (image sharing), and others work toward their potential.</p>



<p>I have noticed a tendency for people supporting older, similar protocols to wonder why ActivityPub got so popular while their own stagnated. We could speculate. If people knew Ostatus at all, they understood it as a protocol for making Twitter clones. XMPP spoke XML in an age of JSON, and it was perceived as an instant messenger protocol.</p>



<p>Both focused on liberating people from commercial silos. Mastodon had some press to that effect regarding Twitter, but people on there have come to care less as its native and diverse community grows to a self-sufficient level.</p>



<p>Twitter and Facebook are struggling to cope with their place in a massive cultural shift and shaky transfer of generational power. As I write this, Facebook has just lost 25% of its share price on the announcement that it expects weak growth.</p>



<p>I think the growing ActivityPub federation has a good chance. No one interacts with my tweets anymore. Meanwhile, I get response <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@Kye">on Mastodon</a> that reminds me of the early days of Twitter, before they betrayed their developer community and hired a legion of people to cut ad deals.</p>

    <main>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/tgecho/canrun_rs">Canrun</a> is a new logic programming library for Rust with static types and constraints.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://esimmler.com/building-canrun-part-1/announcing-canrun/">initial post</a> I mentioned going through a few fundamental revisions before settling on the current approach. Here I'll try to do a quick recap for two reasons: 1) I think it's neat, and 2) with luck I'll snag the attention of someone with deeper experience and a willingness to share some tips.</p>
<p>My first successful attempt was actually based on an article by Tom Stuart titled <a href="https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world">"Hello, declarative world"</a><sup><a href="#reading">1</a></sup>, which described a way to implement <a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf">μKanren</a> in Ruby<sup><a href="#languages">2</a></sup>. I recommend reading that if you find yourself confused about any of the "why" I gloss over here.</p>
<h2 id="starting-out">Starting Out</h2>
<p>The core moving part is the <code>State</code>. In its most basic form, it consists of a mapping between "logic variables" (we'll call them <code>LVar</code>) and "logic values" (or <code>Val&lt;T&gt;</code>). Note that a <code>Val&lt;T&gt;</code> can contain an <code>LVar</code> <em>or</em> a resolved <code>T</code>.</p>
<p><em>Note: These code samples are heavily abridged. Many aspects including lifetime annotations have been elided for the sake of clarity.</em></p>
<pre><code><span>pub struct </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>values</span><span>: HashMap&lt;LVar, Val&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
}

</span><span>pub enum </span><span>Val</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    Var(LVar),
    Resolved(Rc&lt;T&gt;),
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The public API essentially provides a way to "attempt" the addition of new bindings (through <a href="https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world#unification">unification</a>) and resolve existing bindings.</p>
<pre><code><span>impl </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>unify</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>a</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;, </span><span>b</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; StateIter&lt;T&gt;;
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>val</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>LVar) -&gt; </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;Val&lt;T&gt;&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A key characteristic of this model is that <code>.unify(...)</code> returns a new <code>State</code> instead of mutating <code>Self</code>.</p>
<p>The return type of <code>.unify(...)</code> is an alias:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub type </span><span>StateIter</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt; = </span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;dyn </span><span>Iterator</span><span>&lt;Item = State&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;;
</span></code></pre>
<p>A <code>Goal</code> is a struct that simply returns an <code>Iterator</code> of potential states (yes, I said "<em>simply</em> returns an <code>Iterator</code>"... what's so funny?).</p>
<pre><code><span>pub enum </span><span>Goal</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    Unify {a: Val&lt;T&gt;, b: Val&lt;T&gt;},
    Either { a: </span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;Goal&lt;T&gt;&gt;, b: </span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;Goal&lt;T&gt;&gt; },
    </span><span>// ... truncated
</span><span>}

</span><span>impl </span><span>Goal</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>&lt;T: CanT&gt;(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>state</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>State&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; StateIter&lt;T&gt; {
        </span><span>match </span><span>self </span><span>{
            Unify {a, b} </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
                </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(</span><span>once</span><span>(state.</span><span>unify</span><span>(a, b)))
            },
            Either {a, b} </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
                </span><span>let</span><span> a_iter </span><span>=</span><span> a.</span><span>run</span><span>(state);
                </span><span>let</span><span> b_iter </span><span>=</span><span> b.</span><span>run</span><span>(state);
                </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(a_iter.</span><span>interleave</span><span>(b_iter))
            }
            </span><span>// ... truncated
        </span><span>}
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>These goals can be combined arbitrarily to create more complicated goals.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>=</span><span> Either {
    a: Unify { a: x, b: </span><span>1</span><span>},
    b: Both {
        a: Unify { a: x, b: </span><span>2 </span><span>},
        a: Unify { a: y, b: </span><span>1 </span><span>},
    },
};
</span></code></pre>
<p>A goal can return as many new states as needed. It worked! Well, eventually. After a small war of attrition against the borrow checker, I finally managed get the streams flowing. Many clones were sacrificed.</p>
<p>With a few helper functions and some trait driven type coercion, the API wasn't too bad!</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> state </span><span>= </span><span>State::new();
</span><span>let</span><span> goal: Goal&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>either</span><span>(
    </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>),
    </span><span>both</span><span>(</span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>2 </span><span>), </span><span>unify</span><span>(y, </span><span>1 </span><span>)),
);
goal.</span><span>run</span><span>(state) </span><span>// &lt;- returns an iterator of potential states
</span></code></pre><h2 id="smooth-sailing">Smooth Sailing?</h2>
<p>I pushed forward, implementing the other types of goals and learning more about ownership, how and when to use enums vs trait objects and more. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I was fighting more than just the borrow checker.</p>
<p>On top of excessive cloning, I was also struggling with a lack of type safety. My initial plan was for the <code>T</code> type parameter to be a user defined enum.</p>
<pre><code><span>enum </span><span>MyType </span><span>{
    Number(</span><span>i32</span><span>),
    Word(</span><span>String</span><span>),
}

</span><span>// This compiles, but can never succeed!
</span><span>let</span><span> goal: Goal&lt;MyType&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>unify</span><span>(
    MyType::Number(</span><span>42</span><span>),
    MyType::Word(</span><span>"42"</span><span>),
);
</span></code></pre>
<p>Essentially, all relations in the "logic world" were dynamically typed.</p>
<p>I needed a new approach.</p>
<h2 id="rust-is-different">Rust is Different</h2>
<p>An interesting thing about Rust is that it pulls so much from functional programming, but trying to use a "pure immutable" style as in a typical garbage collected language can get really uncomfortable. This sort of pain is usually a sign that something needs to change.</p>
<p>My new mutable <code>State</code> adds a <code>.fork(...)</code> operation and tweaks <code>.unify(...)</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>impl </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>unify</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>a</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;, </span><span>b</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;;
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>fork</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>fork</span><span>: Rc&lt;dyn Fork&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;;
}

</span><span>pub trait </span><span>Fork</span><span>&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>state</span><span>: State&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; StateIter&lt;T&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that both functions take a <code>mut self</code> and return an <code>Option&lt;Self&gt;</code>. The <code>.unify(...)</code> function eagerly attempts to reconcile bindings with those already contained in the state. If unification fails, the entire state is now invalid. We can bail right away with <code>None</code> and avoid processing any additional updates. Used with the <code>?</code> try operator, this can actually be quite smooth.</p>
<pre><code><span>State::new()
    .</span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>? </span><span>// &lt;- returns Some(state)
    </span><span>.</span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>? </span><span>// &lt;- returns None
</span></code></pre>
<p>The simplest <code>Goal</code> that would use <code>Fork</code> is <code>Either</code>, where you'll get zero or more results states for both sides:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>= </span><span>either</span><span>(
    </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>),
    </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>2</span><span>),
);
</span></code></pre>
<p>By deferring evaluation of the <code>Fork</code> objects, we do as much work to disprove as many goals as possible <em>before</em> we eventually split into an arbitrary number of result states.</p>
<p>The <code>Fork</code> trait's <code>.run(...)</code> is not invoked until we query for results. At that point, we recurse our way through the list of <code>Fork</code> items as a queue, branching out at each iteration.</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>iter_forks</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; StateIter&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, D&gt; {
    </span><span>let</span><span> fork </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.forks.</span><span>pop_front</span><span>();
    </span><span>match</span><span> fork {
        </span><span>None </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(</span><span>once</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)),
        </span><span>Some</span><span>(fork) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>Box</span><span>::new(fork.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>).</span><span>flat_map</span><span>(State::iter_forks)),
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>iter_forks(..)</code> does not clone the <code>State</code>. The struct that implements <code>Fork</code> <em>may</em> clone the <code>State</code> at the last moment, but only if actually needed.</p>
<p>In a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.unify(...)</code> eagerly converges, constraining the <code>State</code> into zero or one possible outcomes.</li>
<li><code>.fork(...)</code> lazily diverges, splitting a <code>State</code> into zero or more alternate possibilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="typing-the-domain">Typing the Domain</h2>
<p><em>Statically typed</em> logic programming seems to be a small niche within the niche that is regular logic programming.<sup><a href="#typedlogic">3</a></sup></p>
<p>After a walking down a few dead ends, I settled on an approached based on procedural macros.</p>
<pre><code><span>domain! </span><span>{
    </span><span>pub</span><span> MyDomain {
        </span><span>i32</span><span>,
        </span><span>String
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>domain!</code> macro can create a struct with associated functions that enable it to store and retrieve collections of values compatible with a user defined domain <em>by type</em><sup><a href="#anymap">4</a></sup>. The generated struct looks (roughly) like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub struct </span><span>MyDomain </span><span>{
    </span><span>t0</span><span>: HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;&gt;,
    </span><span>t1</span><span>: HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;&gt;,
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>With pseudo-private<sup><a href="#privacy">5</a></sup> accessors that can be used to retreive the inner containers:</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt; DomainType&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>, </span><span>i32</span><span>&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>MyDomain </span><span>{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>values_as_ref</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;</span><span>HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;&gt; {
        </span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.t0
    }
    </span><span>fn </span><span>values_as_mut</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>HashMap&lt;LVar&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;, Val&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>&gt;&gt; {
        </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>.t0
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>State</code> struct is now parameterized with a <code>Domain</code> type, to which it delegates management of the individual <code>Val&lt;T&gt;</code> containers (some of this is actually spread into other traits/impls, but this is essentially what happens):</p>
<pre><code><span>impl </span><span>&lt;D: Domain&gt; </span><span>State</span><span>&lt;D&gt; {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>resolve_val</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>val</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Val&lt;T&gt;
    </span><span>where</span><span>
        D: DomainType&lt;T&gt;,
    {
        </span><span>match</span><span> val {
            Val::Var(var) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
                </span><span>let</span><span> resolved </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.domain.</span><span>values_as_ref</span><span>().</span><span>get</span><span>(var);
                </span><span>match</span><span> resolved {
                    </span><span>// We found another Var, try to resolve deeper
                    </span><span>Some</span><span>(found) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>resolve_val</span><span>(found),
                    </span><span>// We didn't find a binding, return the Var
                    </span><span>None </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> val,
                }
            }
            </span><span>// This isn't a Var, just return it
</span><span>            value </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> value,
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Goals are also parameterized by <code>Domain</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Compiles!
</span><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>= </span><span>Goal&lt;MyDomain&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>1</span><span>);
</span><span>// Does not compile :)
</span><span>let</span><span> goal </span><span>= </span><span>Goal&lt;MyDomain&gt; </span><span>= </span><span>unify</span><span>(x, </span><span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>]);
</span></code></pre>
<p>While the macro approach feels a bit idiosyncratic, it does have a few really nice properties. Most notably: explicitly defining all of the types that should be valid in the <em>logic</em> domain greatly increases the helpfulness of compiler errors.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Rust (as elsewhere), pain is an indication that you may want to reconsider your approach.</li>
<li>Studying prior art is important, but take its original context into account to avoid imitating badly. A different context might require different choices.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dtolnay">David Tolnay's</a> <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/quote">quote</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/syn">syn</a> libraries make my rather raw proc macro way nicer than it has any business being.</li>
</ul>

  <p><span>15 Jul 2020</span></p><p><em>[Disclaimer: I am not an epidemiologist. The models presented here make simplifying assumptions.]</em></p>

<p>If we want to reopen schools and offices, we need to do so safely. According to Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Romer, the best way is with <a href="https://schools.paulromer.net/">frequent</a> and <a href="https://paulromer.net/faqs-on-virus-tests-in-schools/">regular</a> testing of asymptomatic students and employees. Catching infections early can stop the spread before it starts.</p>

<p>Much of the discussion about testing has centered on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/01/847368012/how-reliable-are-covid-19-tests-depends-which-one-you-mean">PCR</a>, a relatively expensive method that is vulnerable to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/28/863558750/coronavirus-testing-machines-are-latest-bottleneck-in-troubled-supply-chain">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-12/california-fail-coronavirus-testing-covid-start">supply chain</a> bottlenecks and is generally <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/06/1001150/podcast-covid-19-testing-bottleneck/">hard to scale up</a>. Test samples must be sent to a central laboratory and then passed through expensive machines, a process that is currently taking 5-7 days, and in some places as high as <a href="https://twitter.com/SFCovidTestWait/status/1283122098714693633">10-13 days</a>. Efforts are being made to speed this up via pooling, but the operational complexity of PCR makes it likely that there will always be at least a few days of delay.</p>

<p>A less talked about alternative to PCR is called <em><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong">antigen tests</a></em>. These tests are much cheaper than PCR, with estimates ranging between <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong">$1</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">$10</a> per test, compared to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">$50</a> for PCR. More importantly, they can return results in just <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/clinician_guidance_ridt.htm">15 minutes</a>, without any need to send samples to a central lab.</p>

<p>Since antigen tests are far cheaper and faster than PCR, why are we not massively investing in them?</p>

<p>The usual answer is test accuracy. SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests have a sensitivity of about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html">85-90%</a>, meaning that only 85%-90% of true cases will be detected as such. And those are optimistic estimates reported by test manufacturers. For influenza, the CDC reports that antigen tests have a sensitivity of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/clinician_guidance_ridt.htm">50-70%</a>. This is much lower than PCR tests, which have a sensitivity as high at <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.20112565v1.full.pdf">98%</a>.</p>

<p>Some doctors view the low sensitivity as an insurmountable hurdle. “It won’t work”, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">said</a> one doctor. “A misdiagnosis is worse than no diagnosis”, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/coronavirus-antigen-tests-quick-and-cheap-too-often-wrong">said</a> another.</p>

<p>I am not sure I agree, at least when it comes to mass testing of asymptomatic individuals. In this blog post I will show, via both simulations and analytical arguments, that the low sensitivity of antigen tests is a much better problem to have than the long delay of a PCR test.</p>

<h3 id="simulations">Simulations</h3>

<p>To test this hypothesis, I built an <a href="https://github.com/csaid/covid_model_with_testing/blob/master/SIR%20model%20with%20testing.ipynb">agent-based SIR model</a> that includes testing and quarantining. I make the following key assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Population of 200 students</li>
  <li>Using a rotation system, each student is tested once every K days.</li>
  <li>Students go into a 14 day quarantine if they get positive test results.</li>
  <li>In addition to intra-school infections, each student has a chance of getting infected by someone outside the population.</li>
</ul>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/csaid/covid_model_with_testing/blob/master/SIR%20model%20with%20testing.ipynb">simulated</a> two different scenarios.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regular PCR testing (sensitivity of 98%, testing delay of 5 days)</li>
  <li>Regular antigen testing (sensitivity of 75%, no testing delay)</li>
</ul>

<p>For comparison, I also modeled a “best case scenario”, where no intra-school infections occur, and a “worst case scenario”, where there is no testing or quarantining at all.</p>

<p>Assuming that each student is tested once every 4 days, I find that the cumulative number of infections is far lower if we do regular antigen testing than if we do regular PCR testing.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/2020_antigen_testing/fig_test_every_4_days.png">
</p>


<p>If we change the frequency of testing to once every day, antigen testing is able to achieve close to best case results, with almost no intra-school infections. Meanwhile, daily PCR testing still results in a large number of infections.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/2020_antigen_testing/fig_test_every_1_day.png">
</p>


<p>This seems very important. <em>Not only are antigen tests cheaper than PCR, they are also more effective in a mass testing regime.</em> Further simulations in my <a href="https://github.com/csaid/covid_model_with_testing/blob/master/SIR%20model%20with%20testing.ipynb">notebook</a> show that the superiority of antigen tests is maintained even for much lower sensitivities.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-low-sensitivity-better-than-slowness">Why is low sensitivity better than slowness?</h3>

<p>Maybe you don’t believe my simulations, so here’s an analytical argument instead. Imagine you test people every day using a 75% sensitive antigen test. If someone is infected, they will probably find out immediately. There is a smallish chance they will first find out after a day, and a very small chance it will take longer than that. On average they will find out after 0.33 days, which is much faster than a typical PCR test. In general, for a sensitivity of , daily antigen test participants will find out after an average of  days, where  is defined as:</p>



<p>which converges to</p>



<p>For any reasonable value of ,  will be quite low. Here’s a striking example. If you test people every day, a test with 50% sensitivity and no delay is equivalent to a test with 100% sensitivity and a 1-day delay!</p>

<p>This analysis assumes that  is fixed across time and individuals, an assumption I’ll address in the FAQ, below.</p>

<h3 id="faq">FAQ:</h3>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What is your main conclusion from this analysis?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> For mass testing of asymptomatic individuals in schools and offices, antigen tests are cheaper and more effective than PCR tests.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Have other people come to this conclusion?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Yes. After writing this blog post, I came across two recent pre-prints.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136309v2.full.pdf">Larremore et al.</a> shows that sensitivity is less important than testing delays. It comes with a wonderful <a href="https://larremorelab.github.io/covid-calculator3">interactive calculator</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147702v1.full.pdf">Paltiel et al.</a> show that sensitivity is less important than test frequency.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Are you arguing that antigen tests should always replace PCR?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> No, I’m only suggesting it for mass testing of asymptomatic individuals. If a symptomatic person comes into a doctor’s office a PCR test would make sense, since sensitivity becomes more important and cost becomes less important.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What if the antigen test has a much lower sensitivity for certain individuals, who will therefore remain undetected?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Low sensitivity for these individuals is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S138665321000106X">likely due to low viral load</a>, which most researchers believe means they will not be very infectious. That said, if would be really good if we could get more research on this, since it’s an important question.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What if the sensitivity of the antigen test is especially low at the start of infection?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Another good question. As with the previous answer, this period of low sensitivity would likely be to due low viral load, when the individual is less infectious. Furthermore, the period where PCR tests can detect the virus while antigen tests cannot is <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.20136309v2.full.pdf">probably only 24 hours</a>. But <em>even if</em> we assume the individual is just as infectious during this early period, the antigen test still remains superior. To estimate this, I ran simulations where antigen tests were completely ineffective for the first two days of infection, a conservative assumption. Even with this conservative constraint, and even assuming the individuals are fully infectious during this period, antigen tests still outperformed PCR.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/2020_antigen_testing/fig_test_every_1_day_delayed_detection.png">
</p>


<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>What if the false negatives cause riskier behavior?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> It’s possible that people might exhibit more risk after a false negative antigen test than after taking a PCR test and having to wait. However, this risk can be minimized by (a) educating people about sensitivity and (b) pairing the testing regime with other measures like masks and social distancing.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Do antigen tests require those invasive pharyngeal swabs that go deep up your nose?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> Not necessarily. While <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/health/antigen-testing-fda-coronavirus.html">Quidel</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/06/us/06reuters-health-coronavirus-becton-dickinson.html">Becton Dickinson</a> are producing pharyngeal swab antigen tests, another company called <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/spit-test-covid-coronavirus-orasure-fda-hiv--20200706.html">OraSure</a> is producing a saliva test. Will a saliva test be as accurate as a pharyngeal swab test? The evidence is mixed, with some studies suggesting it will be less accurate and others suggesting it will be more accurate (<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067835v1">1</a>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.26.20112565v1.full.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/jcm/55/1/226.full.pdf">3</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>I heard that <a href="https://m.canadianinsider.com/sona-nanotech-announces-validation-results-for-its-covid-19-antigen-test">SONA</a> has an antigen test with 96% sensitivity. This sounds super promising!</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> This statistic is a bit misleading. The positive samples were generated in a laboratory. When antigen tests are done in real world clinical settings, the sensitivity is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/24/1000486/antigen-testing-could-faster-cheaper-diagnose-covid-19-coronavirus/">lower</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Will we ever get a test that is both fast and sensitive?</em>
<br> <strong>A:</strong> The New York Times had a great <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/fast-coronavirus-tests.html">article</a> last week on new types of point-of-care tests that are being developed, including <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.13.20129841v1.full.pdf">HP-LAMP</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.119131v1.full.pdf">SHINE</a>. These seem promising, although they are in an earlier stage of development than antigen tests, which already have several companies producing tests.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Illustration:&nbsp;Hokyoung Kim for HuffPost</em></p><p><span>When Peggy Frank returned to her mail route following three months of medical leave, Los Angeles was in the middle of a scorching <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/heat-wave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heat wave</a>.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The 63-year-old letter carrier had slipped on a patch of wet leaves and broken her ankle in March, and she spent the spring at home in a walking boot. Although the injury still bothered her, Frank had been cleared to go back to work. She was just two years away from retirement when she climbed back into her <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/united-states-postal-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Postal Service</a> truck on July 6, 2018.</span><span><br></span></p>        <!-- entry_paragraph_1_ad -->
    
<p><span>The temperature had topped out in the high 80s in the first days of the month, but then it shot up dramatically after the July 4 holiday, putting Southern California under an extreme heat advisory. On July 5, the highs surpassed 100 degrees.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Frank’s sister, Lynn Calkins, had warned her to be safe as she prepared for her first day back. “I said, ‘You’re not used to it. Just be careful,’” Calkins recalled.&nbsp;</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The two shared a townhouse in the North Hills neighborhood, and Calkins always made sure the ice trays were filled the evening before a hot day so Frank could load up her water jug before heading out at 7:30 a.m.</span></p><p><span>Getting an early start on her Woodland Hills route only helped so much ― it was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/southern-california-heat-wave-breaks-records-in-los-angeles-today-2018-07-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closing in on 100 degrees</a> in downtown Los Angeles by late morning. By the afternoon, the weather stations in nearby Burbank and Van Nuys, in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, hit 114 and 117, respectively ― the hottest temperatures <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/07/06/monster-heat-dome-threatens-all-time-high-temperature-records-in-southern-california-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ever recorded</a> there.</span></p></div><figure>
        </figure><div><p><span>Frank would have found no respite in her mail truck. Most of the Postal Service fleet is roughly three decades old and not equipped with air conditioning. The only relief is a pair of open windows and a small fan attached to the dashboard.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Frank struggled to keep pace. About 2 p.m., she called her supervisor to say she was falling behind and might not finish on time ― standard practice for a letter carrier who’s lagging, since managers want to avoid running into overtime.</span></p><p><span>The post office dispatched another employee to meet Frank on her route and give her a hand.</span></p><p><span>When her colleague reached her, Frank was unconscious in the driver’s seat. Paramedics recorded her death at 3:35 p.m.</span></p><h3>‘Neither Snow Nor Rain Nor Heat’</h3><p><span>Working for the Postal Service can be a </span><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1836/the-us-postal-service-is-an-extremely-dangerous-place-to-work?zd=2&amp;zi=pdxz3eli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>surprisingly dangerous job</span></a><span>. While back sprains and dog bites are common for letter carriers, some of the greatest hazards are encapsulated in the agency’s </span><a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/mission-motto.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>unofficial motto</span></a><span>: </span><em><span>Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.</span></em></p><p><span>An analysis of records shows the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/occupational-safety-and-health-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> issued more than $1.3 million in initial fines against the Postal Service for heat hazards in eight years ― a large sum by OSHA standards. In many cases, the Postal Service managed to negotiate those fines down to a few thousand dollars each, or even to nothing at all, by agreeing to address the hazards.</span></p><p><span>But the continued accumulation of big-ticket citations for repeat violations shows the Postal Service hasn’t fixed its problem. OSHA files share common themes: carriers toiling inside hot vehicles, feeling pressured to complete their routes on time, and returning to work in dangerously hot weather without being </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/acclima.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>acclimatized</span></a><span>. They also show postal officials pointing to the agency’s troubled finances in pleas to reduce fines while working to limit the legal scope of agreements to protect employees.</span></p><p><span>After Missouri letter carrier John Watzlawick died of hyperthermia in 2012, OSHA cited the Postal Service for willfully violating safety law and issued a fine of $70,000. The Postal Service agreed to implement new safeguards in 2014 to settle the case, but Watzlawick’s widow, Kay, has watched with dismay as the citations have continued.</span></p><p><span>“I want something done,” she told HuffPost.</span></p><p><span>An analysis by the Center for Public Integrity last year found that the Postal Service had </span><a href="https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/worker-health-and-safety/extreme-heat-post-worker-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>exposed about 900 workers</span></a><span> to heat hazards since 2012, leading to muscle cramps, vomiting and loss of consciousness. Close to 100 workers had been hospitalized for heat-related illnesses since 2015, the site reported. Because the hospitalizations are self-reported by employers, the full tally over that span is likely higher and wouldn’t reflect the times when workers got sick but didn’t end up in the hospital.</span></p><p><span>Of at least four carriers whose deaths since 2012 involved heat, three had recently returned to work from a long absence. Occupational health experts say it’s critical that workers who have been off the job are eased back into their roles over the course of several days so that their bodies have time to readjust to high temperatures.</span></p></div><figure>
        </figure><div><p><span>Debbie Berkowitz, who worked as a chief of staff and senior adviser at OSHA and is now a safety expert at the </span><a href="https://www.nelp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>National Employment Law Project</span></a><span>, said these large penalties are rare. “These are fines given to companies where OSHA has really solid evidence that they knew about the hazard and they still haven’t abated the conditions,” said Berkowitz. “I think getting the mail to customers is such a big priority that they have overlooked protecting their workers ― and overlooked it repeatedly.”</span></p><p><span>The Postal Service’s sprawling workforce includes about&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/2018/may/oes435052.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>340,000 letter carriers</span></a><span>, and whatever the weather may bring, Americans expect their mail six days a week. Though the agency declined&nbsp;</span><span>to make an official available for an interview on the subject, a spokesperson said the USPS formalized a heat illness prevention program in 2018, drawing on protocols that were already in place, and that employee safety is a “top priority.”&nbsp;</span><span>In regular meetings, workers are reminded to stay hydrated, wear cool clothing, find shade if necessary and call 911 if they start to experience heat exhaustion or heat stroke.</span></p><p><span>The spokesperson said supervisors provide mandatory training on the signs of heat illness and make sure </span><span>workers “have the resources needed to do their jobs safely.” </span></p><p><span>But the challenges will only become greater as heat records continue to be broken due to global warming.&nbsp;</span>The Los Angeles Daily News, which covered Frank’s death closely, reported that <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2019/08/19/heres-what-woodland-hills-mail-carriers-say-is-different-at-the-post-office-after-peggy-franks-death-a-year-ago-in-extreme-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another carrier</a> from the same post office was hospitalized for heat illness a year ago, on a day when the temperature hit 100.</p><h3>Climate Change Is Making Hot Days Hotter</h3><p><span>Postal workers make for a disturbing case study in the evolving dangers of outdoor work. Anyone who does a physical job exposed to the elements will face greater hazards <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as the climate changes</a>. And many workers, such as roofers, farmworkers and landscapers, are doing strenuous jobs without the union protections that postal employees have, making them more reluctant to speak up.</span></p><p><span>“As a rule of thumb, if we fail to act to reduce carbon emissions, then by midcentury a typical summer day will be as hot as the hottest single day of summer is today,” said Michael Mann, a climatologist who directs the </span><a href="http://www.essc.psu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Earth System Science Center</span></a><span> at Pennsylvania State University.</span></p><p><span>“And the hottest day of summer? There is simply no analog in the past for what that will look like.”</span></p><p><em>BELOW: The number of extremely hot days each summer will increase significantly due to global warming.</em></p></div><figure>
        </figure><div><p><span>In some respects, that disturbing future has already arrived. The year 2019 was the </span><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2019-was-2nd-hottest-year-on-record-for-earth-say-noaa-nasa" target="_blank"><span>second-hottest</span></a><span> in 140 years of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records, falling behind only 2016. So far, 2020 is shaping up to be </span><a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/briefings/20200618.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>even more sweltering</span></a><span> than last year. Based on temperature data through May, the NOAA says this year is “virtually certain” to crack the top five and stands a nearly 50% chance of being the hottest ever.</span></p><p><span>At HuffPost’s request, Michelle Tigchelaar, a climate scientist at Stanford University, analyzed how much more vulnerable letter carriers will be to extreme heat as global warming worsens. Factoring in clothing, work pace and access to shade, Tigchelaar’s data assumes a day in which the heat index hits 94.5 degrees Fahrenheit constitutes a danger to carriers. Her findings show that workers would face far more unsafe working days under an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), let alone 4 degrees (7.2 F).</span></p><p><span>The new working environment will be much worse in the South and Midwest. For instance, a letter carrier in Detroit now faces about 10 days a year in which the heat index hits 94.5. But under a 3.6-degree F increase, that jumps to 43 days a year. Under a 7.2-degree increase, it shoots up to 79 days a year. In places like Miami, Phoenix and Houston, more than one out of every three days each year would pose a heat hazard.</span></p><p><span>There are several ways outdoor workers can mitigate heat ― working at a slower pace, taking frequent breaks, having access to air conditioning. Most of them come with a loss of productivity or some other expense. Employers will have to shift schedules around, keeping workers indoors during the hottest hours. For postal employees, that could mean delivering parcels after dark, raising other safety concerns.</span></p><p><span>And unlike, say, agricultural work, which will shift geographically as the climate changes, parcels will still need to be delivered in the most oppressively hot regions. Even though there will be fewer heat waves in mild climates like Seattle, the workers in those areas will be less physiologically prepared when the temperature does soar.</span></p><p><span>Keeping all workers safe in heat can be tricky because everybody’s resilience is different. Some workers can tolerate much more than others. For someone like Peggy Frank, there was no knowing where her limit was until she passed it.</span></p><p><em>BELOW: Letter carriers will face far more unsafe working days due to extreme heat as global warming worsens.

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>I've been a fanboy of DHH and Jason of <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> since around 2006 when I first read <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal">Getting Real</a> and started writing code in <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. We used Basecamp (and for a brief time, Highrise) as our primary communication tool for the first few years of <a href="https://freeagent.com/">FreeAgent</a> and it was a big influence from a product point of view. For the past 8 years though, I've not really used Basecamp products but I have remained a follower of the company and founders, reading their books and enjoying their Twitter rants. I'm still an ardent Rails fan as well – I rarely code at work these days so I built an app for this blog during lockdown to scratch that particular itch 👨‍💻&nbsp;</p><p>When I heard about HEY, I was immediately interested. Not because I've lost control of my inbox (I'm an order-freak and avid filterer so my inbox is generally a tranquil place), but because the HEY statement about why "Email’s a treasure" rang so true to me and because a brand-new, Rails-based, Basecamp product is always going to be pretty exciting to try.</p><p>I got my invite early and I've been kicking the tyres for a while, so I've written up a few thoughts to get them out there and to hear about what other people think.&nbsp;</p></div><div>
<p>I've been using email for 28 years. I got my first email account back in 1992 when I started university and I rarely received any email from what I can remember. I probably got the odd message from tutors, but during uni my online communication was largely centred on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>. Remember that?</p><p>On leaving university I didn't use email for a while. I got my first job via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> forum so I must have used email for that, but it wasn't until the arrival of Hotmail a year or two later that I had my first 'permanent' email address and could access it anywhere (still a limited choice in 1996!). I got my first work email with my second job and then I moved on from Hotmail to Yahoo and stuck that out until 2003 when Gmail launched (and after Yahoo inexplicably deleted all my email by accident).&nbsp;</p><p>I stayed happily with Google until 2015 when I moved over to Fastmail so I could use my own domain and pay for a proper email product and not be the product myself. I still use Gmail (via G Suite) for work though.</p></div><div><p>With the arrival of HEY, I loved the privacy-first focus (no more 'spy trackers') and the new workflows (Set Aside, Focus and Reply etc) sounded great. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI">Jason's demo</a> was compelling. I'm fascinated by what they've achieved with modern Rails and Javascript, the simplicity of the front-end code and speed of it all really is a triumph.&nbsp;</p><p>However once I got invited, the reality of using it has been something of a mixed bag of utter delight with some frustrations. Let's dig into it.</p></div><div>
<p><strong>Focus and Reply<br></strong>This is a headline feature and it's really very good. Flag your emails 'Reply Later' as you're reading your new mails and stack them up for dealing with later. When you're ready, Focus and Reply lets you hammer through them all at once from a single screen. It's a brilliant workflow.</p><action-text-attachment content-type="image" url="https://hey.com/assets/how-it-works/reply-mode-60e4b5c00da627a4738e055d295e13d848d4ecdd806aad1e7bbec4a8ac0d8c32.png" width="1800" height="1871"><figure>

</figure></action-text-attachment></div><p><strong>Spy Tracking</strong></p><div><p>I think the Spy Tracker support is brilliant and should become the standard in all email apps. Perhaps it will. I actually emailed Fastmail about this and their reply was pretty interesting:</p></div><blockquote>
<em>We've blocked remote images from loading by default for years: </em><a href="https://codepatterns.org/help/receive/remotecontent.html?u=90cc41d3"><em>https://www.fastmail.com/help/receive/remotecontent.html</em></a><em>.&nbsp;<p>And if you do enable remote loading of images for your known contacts, or you just enable it for a single message, then our servers proxy the images, so all the sender can know is details about our hosts and nothing about you.&nbsp;</p></em>
</blockquote><div><p>So, actually, Fastmail are pretty much doing the same thing other than alerting you to the fact that emails are using SendGrid or whatever?</p></div><p><strong>Clips</strong></p><div>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>Clips is a brilliant feature that I never knew I needed. Highlight some text and save it in your list of clips. I can see this feature being expanded in the future, such as filtering and being able to set expiry dates.</p></div><p><strong>Custom Domains</strong></p><div><p>Perhaps the most common complaint I've seen on Twitter is the lack of custom domain support. I run email off my own domain so this is of course something of a blocker to my own full-time adoption. I did try forwarding my email into HEY for a while so I could use the app in anger, but I'm not yet ready to make my @hey.com address my default so I've paused this for now. <a href="https://hey.com/custom-domains/">Custom domains are coming</a> in 2020 and I'm excited to see what they offer from day one. I hope they nail it.</p></div><p><strong>🔕 Notifications&nbsp;</strong></p><div><p>Despite being something of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk">inbox zero</a> fiend, I have no problem with the <strong>Previously Seen</strong> list in my Imbox. I really like the idea of <strong>Paper Trail</strong> and <strong>The Feed</strong>, and autofiling email in there is great but I have a real gripe with notifications. I definitely <em>don't</em> want to be notified via push on my phone when a new item hits either of these areas, but when I log into HEY I definitely <em>do</em> want to be notified, visually, that there's something new to view in these areas. As it stands, I have to compulsively check each one irrespective of whether there's something new. HEY's philosophy is that I should ignore them entirely until I feel like reading my Feed, but in reality this is never going to work for me. I'd like to have HEY alert me to the fact that there's something there, and if I feel like reading the feed at that time I will, otherwise I'll come back later. If I don't know, I feel compelled to check which is just a waste of time.</p><p>Now forgive me for my sins, but I actually want to receive notifications for emails that hit my Imbox by default, not the other way round. With HEY there is no way to do this – no notifications at all. You have to manually edit each contact and enable notifications for them specifically. I'd much rather HEY let me choose which is <em>my</em> preferred default, irrespective of the philosophy. Let me default to on.</p><p><strong>Imbox</strong></p></div><p>Please just call it Inbox! I can never unsee a typo here, I'm sorry. I understand but it just doesn't work for me.</p><div>
<p><strong>Quoted text rendering</strong><br>This is a total design challenge and HEY is no worse than Gmail in this regard, but I have to say Fastmail do a far better job of it. HEY rendering feels like a backwards step after using Fastmail and its multi-coloured threading. Hopefully it will improve over time.</p><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSI1Z2lkOi8vYmxvZ2xpbmUvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi82Nz9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--91de462762132f39e441634c12f167e819f1c6ca" content-type="image/jpeg" url="https://blogline.co/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBTQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f569091fa601e5688d3533388044e529e598f984/IMG_0171.JPG" filename="IMG_0171.JPG" filesize="38317" width="780" height="520" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="Fastmail's tasty quote rendering"><figure>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p><strong>Exporting</strong><br>The export to MBOX feature is great – it's my data and it means I'm not locked in. I know that if I decide to leave HEY, I can easily export all my mail and push it back into Fastmail. However, I like to label a bunch of my emails and currently this metadata will be lost when exporting from HEY. I suggested to DHH that they use IMAP folders in the export to maintain label information and <a href="https://twitter.com/lylo/status/1275426572053471233?s=20">he said it was a good idea</a>, so perhaps it will see the light of day soon 🤞</p></div><p><strong>😴 Snooze</strong></p><p>Set Aside is great, I like it a lot. But sometimes there are emails that I want to set aside for a longer period and the Snooze feature in Gmail and Fastmail is super-handy for this. When you set something aside in HEY, the email is there in the stack, staring at you in the face every time you visit. This isn't desirable for 'set aside for ages' emails, so a Snooze function (either as part of Set Aside, or just in general) would be great.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Undoubtedly the killer feature of HEY is the built-in workflow. Some people have suggested that this is a feature that could be replicated in standard email, so I had a crack at this with my Fastmail account. While not being a match for HEY, it actually worked surprisingly well!</p><p>I first created labels for <strong>Reply Later</strong>, <strong>Set Aside</strong>, <strong>The Feed</strong> and <strong>Paper Trail:</strong></p></div><div>

</figure></action-text-attachment><p>Moving mail into Reply Later or Set Aside is really easy in Fastmail because of their keyboard shortcuts: view the mail, click 'm' to bring up the 'Move' menu and then start typing 'Repl..' to label it as Reply Later. Admittedly not as slick as HEY but it's blazingly fast (as are most things in Fastmail) when you're used to it. </p><p>I then set up rules to move things into The Feed and Paper Trail. Again, not as simple as with HEY but the rules in Fastmail are very powerful so you do have a bit more flexibility here:</p><action-text-attachment sgid="BAh7CEkiCGdpZAY6BkVUSSI1Z2lkOi8vYmxvZ2xpbmUvQWN0aXZlU3RvcmFnZTo6QmxvYi82ND9leHBpcmVzX2luBjsAVEkiDHB1cnBvc2UGOwBUSSIPYXR0YWNoYWJsZQY7AFRJIg9leHBpcmVzX2F0BjsAVDA=--0497b10d4c7160b0d8f48c584f1fa4aace19103f" content-type="image/png" url="https://blogline.co/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBSUT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--5a85ebb4b8d252c1a8cd1e5242edeed0eb627d8c/image.png" filename="image.png" filesize="18662" width="465" height="117" previewable="true" presentation="gallery" caption="Using Fastmail's powerful rules to replicate The Feed"><figure>

It turns out it's extremely rare that I receive an email from someone that I want to screen out. I can do this in Fastmail using blocking, but my blocklist is virtually empty. </p><p>If I was using HEY for my work email, however, it would be a <strong>completely different story </strong>which does make me wonder whether HEY's future success really lies in the business market.</p></div><div><p>Using HEY is a really nice and unique email experience, but it's early days and 'power users' like me will likely find it lacking in some areas. </p><p>I've already paid for my first year because I love the @hey.com email address, I really want to try HEY with custom domains when they launch, and I also want to see how it develops in the coming year. I'm also happy to pay Basecamp to keep developing this product as it feels important right now. <strong>The world needs more players in the email provider space, especially high-quality, privacy-focused products</strong>. Until HEY arrived, Fastmail was the only <em>major</em> player other than the obvious 'free' options of Gmail, Microsoft and Yahoo.</p><p>Can HEY fully replace Fastmail for me though? Will I be renewing in 12 month's time?</p><p>Once custom domains land, I think it <em>could</em> replace Fastmail for me. That said, I'll likely still end up paying for Fastmail irrespective of how HEY develops simply because of their excellent multi-domain support. So I'll probably end up paying for both! 😅</p><p>With Fastmail I can create forwarders on my family domain for the kids (I really hope HEY's custom domain feature will support this, but I'm not confident they will). I can also support fully-featured email on all the domains I own (such as the one for this blog!) without incurring any additional cost or hassle dealing with other email providers.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  
<span>Syntax errors are generally easy to fix for humans, but not for parsers in general nor LR parsers in</span>
<span>particular. Traditional ‘panic mode’ error recovery, though easy to implement and applicable to</span>
<span>any grammar, often leads to a cascading chain of errors that drown out the original. More</span>
<span>advanced error recovery techniques suffer less from this problem but have seen little practical use</span>
<span>because their typical performance was seen as poor, their worst case unbounded, and the</span>
<span>repairs they reported arbitrary. In this paper we introduce the </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>algorithm, and an</span>
<span>implementation of that algorithm, that address these issues. First, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports the complete set of</span>
<span>minimum cost repair sequences for a given location, allowing programmers to select the one that</span>
<span>best fits their intention. Second, on a corpus of 200,000 real-world syntactically invalid Java</span>
<span>programs, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>is able to repair 98.37%</span><span>±</span><span>0.017% </span><span>of files within a timeout of 0.5s. Finally,</span>
<span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>uses the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences to reduce the cascading error</span>
<span>problem, where incorrect error recovery causes further spurious syntax errors to be identified.</span>
<span>Across the test corpus, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports 435,812</span><span>±</span><span>473 </span><span>error locations to the user, reducing the</span>
<span>cascading error problem substantially relative to the 981,628</span><span>±</span><span>0 </span><span>error locations reported by panic</span>
<span>mode.</span>

<h3><span>1</span> <a id="x1-10001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 131--><p>Programming is a humbling job which requires acknowledging that we will make untold errors in
our quest to perfect a program. Most troubling are semantic errors, where we intended the
program to do one thing, but it does another. Less troubling, but often no less irritating, are
syntax errors, which are generally minor deviances from the exacting syntax required by a
compiler. So common are syntax errors that parsers in modern compilers are designed to cope
with us making several: rather than stop on the first syntax error, they attempt to
<span>recover </span>from it. This allows them to report, and us to fix, all our syntax errors in one
go.
</p><!--l. 141--><p>When error recovery works well, it is a useful productivity gain. Unfortunately, most current
error recovery approaches are simplistic. The most common grammar-neutral approach to error
recovery are those algorithms described as ‘panic mode’ (e.g.&nbsp;[<a href="#Xholub90compilerdesign">13</a>, p.&nbsp;348]) which skip input until
the parser finds something it is able to parse. A more grammar-specific variation of this
idea is to skip input until a pre-determined synchronisation token (e.g. ‘;’ in Java) is
reached&nbsp;[<a href="#Xdegano95comparison">8</a> , p.&nbsp;3], or to try inserting a single synchronisation token. Such strategies are
often unsuccessful, leading to a cascade of spurious syntax errors (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an
example). Programmers quickly learn that only the location of the first error in a file – not
the reported repair, nor the location of subsequent errors – can be relied upon to be
accurate.

<!--l. 233--><p>It is possible to hand-craft error recovery algorithms for a specific language. These
generally allow better recovery from errors, but are challenging to create. For example,
the Java error recovery approach in the Eclipse IDE is 5KLoC long, making it only
slightly smaller than a modern version of Berkeley Yacc — a complete parsing system!
Unsurprisingly, few real-world parsers contain effective hand-written error recovery
algorithms.
</p><!--l. 240--><p>Most of us are so used to these trade-offs (cheap generic algorithms and poor recovery
vs.&nbsp;expensive hand-written algorithms and reasonable recovery) that we assume them to be
inevitable. However, there is a long line of work on more advanced generic error recovery
algorithms. Probably the earliest such algorithm is Aho and Peterson&nbsp;[<a href="#Xaho72minimum">1</a>], which, upon
encountering an error, creates on-the-fly an alternative (possibly ambiguous) grammar which
allows the parser to recover. This algorithm has fallen out of favour in programming
language circles, probably because of its implementation complexity and the difficulty of
explaining to users what recovery has been used. A simpler family of algorithms, which
trace their roots to Fischer <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xfischer79locally">11</a>], instead try to find a single minimum cost <span>repair</span>
<span>sequence </span>of token insertions and deletions which allow the parser to recover. Algorithms in
this family are much better at recovering from errors than naive approaches and can
communicate the repairs they find in a way that humans can easily replicate. However, such
algorithms have seen little practical use because their typical performance is seen as
poor and their worst case unbounded [<a href="#Xmckenzie95error">17</a>, p.&nbsp;14]. We add a further complaint: such
approaches only report a single repair sequence to users. In general – and especially in
syntactically rich languages – there are multiple reasonable repair sequences for a given
error location, and the algorithm has no way of knowing which best matches the user’s
intentions.
</p><!--l. 261--><p>In this paper we introduce a new error recovery algorithm in the Fischer <span>et al. </span>family, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>.
This takes the approach of Corchuelo <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xcorchuelo02repairing">5</a>] as a base, corrects it, expands it, and
optimises its implementation. <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is simple to implement (under 500 lines of Rust
code), is able to repair nearly all errors in reasonable time, reports the complete set of
minimum cost repair sequences to users, and does so in less time than Corchuelo <span>et</span>
<span>al.</span>.
</p><!--l. 269--><p>We validate <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> on a corpus of 200,000 real, syntactically incorrect, Java programs
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-140006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: experiment --></a>). <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is able to recover 98.37%<span>±</span><span>0.017% </span>of files within a 0.5s timeout and does so
while reporting fewer than half the error locations as a traditional panic mode algorithm: in other
words, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> substantially reduces the cascading error problem. We also show – for, as far as we
know, the first time – that advanced error recovery can be naturally added to a Yacc-esque
system, allowing users to make fine-grained decisions about what to do when error recovery has
been applied to an input (Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-180007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:api --></a>). We believe that this shows that algorithms such as <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>
are ready for wider usage, either on their own, or as part of a multi-phase recovery
system.
</p>
<h4><span>1.1</span> <a id="x1-20001.1"></a>Defining the problem</h4>
<!--l. 285--><p>Formally speaking, we first test the following hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 287--><dl><dt>
<span>H1</span></dt><dd>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences can be found in acceptable time.</dd></dl>
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 292--><p>The only work we are aware of with a similar concept of ‘acceptable time’ is&nbsp;[<a href="#XdeJonge12natural">6</a>], who define it
as the total time spent in error recovery per file, with a threshold of 1s. We use that
definition with one change: Since many compilers are able to fully execute in less than 1s,
we felt that a tighter threshold is more appropriate: we use 0.5s since we think that
even the most demanding users will tolerate such a delay. We strongly validate this
hypothesis.
</p><!--l. 300--><p>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences makes it more likely that the programmer
will see a repair sequence that matches their original intention (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an example;
Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#x1-28000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:examples --></a> contains further examples in Java, Lua, and PHP). It also opens up a new
opportunity. Previous error recovery algorithms find a single repair sequence, apply that to the
input, and then continue parsing. While that repair sequence may have been a reasonable local
choice, it may cause cascading errors later. Since we have the complete set of minimum
cost repair sequences available, we can select from that set a repair sequence which
causes fewer cascading errors. We thus rank repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue successfully (up to a threshold — parsing the whole file would, in
general, be too costly), and choose from the subset that gets furthest (note that the
time required to do this is included in the 0.5s timeout). We thus also test a second
hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 315--><dl><dt>
<span>H2</span></dt><dd>Ranking the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue locally reduces the global cascading error problem.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 321--><p>We also strongly validate this hypothesis. We do this by comparing ‘normal’ <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> with a
simple variant <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span><span>rev</span> which reverses the ranking process, always selecting from amongst the
worst …</p></div></div>

July 15, 2020 | https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-openstack/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-openstack/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In a previous <a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/">post</a> I mentioned that Prometheus has a number of ways to discover services. This ranges from statically defined configuration to consuming APIs from different cloud providers. So far, we have covered: -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-aws-gcp-azure/">AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yetiops.net/posts/prometheus-service-discovery-digitalocean/">Digital Ocean</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this post we will cover discovering services running on OpenStack.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-openstack">What is OpenStack?</h2>
<p>OpenStack is a way of running your own Infrastructure-as-a-service platform. It enables you to deploy compute, storage, networking and other resources similar to the major cloud providers. It began as a joint venture between <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> to provide an Open Source cloud solution.</p>
<p>Initially, OpenStack was embraced by a number of different sectors of the IT industry. Some companies saw it as a way to become an alternative to the likes of AWS or Azure (eg <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPE_Helion">HPE Helion</a>, <a href="https://www.ovh.co.uk/">OVH</a>, <a href="https://carrier.huawei.com/en/products/IT/cloud-computing">Huawei</a>). For others, it enabled them to use their existing hardware while being able to spin up resources in a cloud-like way.</p>
<p>In recent years, OpenStack has become increasingly popular with telecommunications providers. Many of these providers own or have access to telecoms exchanges, and have large data centre footprints spanning cities, countries and even continents. OpenStack allows them to create multi-region clouds of their own, without the need to leverage a public cloud provider.</p>
<h2 id="the-lab">The lab</h2>
<p>OpenStack usually requires a fleet of high-powered servers managed as a cluster (or multiple clusters) of compute, storage and other services. If you want to test out OpenStack on a single machine, there are multiple options available: -</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack">DevStack</a> - Installs OpenStack on a virtual machine (or physical machine) running Ubuntu or Fedora and turns it into a mini OpenStack cloud</li>
<li><a href="https://microstack.run/">MicroStack</a> - A Canonical projcect that deploys a OpenStack inside of a Snap package</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openstack/kolla-ansible">Kolla-Ansible</a> - An Ansible project that deploys all the OpenStack services as containers</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to use MicroStack on an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS virtual machine.</p>
<h3 id="microstack">MicroStack</h3>
<p>To install and run MicroStack, run the following commands: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Install MicroStack with Classic confinement (i.e. not fully sandboxed)</span>
$ sudo snap install microstack --classic --beta

<span># Initialize MicroStack</span>
$ sudo microstack.init --auto
</code></pre></div><p>After a few minutes (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes, depending on your machine) MicroStack will have finished initializing. The web interface will be available at <code>http://10.20.20.1</code>: -</p>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/microstack-login.png" alt="MicroStack Login Page"></p>
<p>The credentials for this page are: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Username: <code>admin</code></li>
<li>Password: <code>keystone</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://yetiops.net/img/prometheus/microstack-dashboard.png" alt="MicroStack Dashboard"></p>
<p>You can create a virtual machine (<strong>instance</strong>) from here, or from the command line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Launch the instance</span>
$ microstack.launch cirros --name test

Server test launched! <span>(</span>status is BUILD<span>)</span>

Access it with <span>`</span>ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_microstack<span>`</span> &lt;username&gt;@10.20.20.143

<span># SSH to it, with the MicroStack generated SSH key</span>
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_microstack <a href="https://yetiops.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="c1a2a8b3b3aeb281f0f1eff3f1eff3f1eff0f5f2">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>

<span># Check that this machine is running the buildroot OS (which is what CirrOS uses)</span>
$ cat /etc/os-release
NAME<span>=</span>Buildroot
VERSION<span>=</span>2015.05-g31af4e3-dirty
ID<span>=</span>buildroot
VERSION_ID<span>=</span>2015.05
PRETTY_NAME<span>=</span><span>"Buildroot 2015.05"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that all the commands are prefixed with <code>microstack.</code>. This is because OpenStack runs inside a Snap package.</p>
<h3 id="adding-additional-images">Adding additional images</h3>
<p>By default, MicroStack only includes the CirrOS image. While it is useful for testing that OpenStack can provision resources, it does not provide the ability to install packages.</p>
<p>Many Linux distributions create OpenStack-ready images, a list of which can be found <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/obtain-images.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>For this post, I used a Debian Buster image: -</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Download the image</span>
$ wget https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/openstack/current/debian-10.4.3-20200610-openstack-amd64.qcow2

<span># Add the image to OpenStack</span>
$ microstack.openstack image create <span>\
</span><span></span>            --container-format bare <span>\
</span><span></span>            --disk-format qcow2 <span>\
</span><span></span>            --file debian-10.4.3-20200610-openstack-amd64.qcow2 <span>\
</span><span></span>            debian-buster

<span># Verify that the image is defined</span>

<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>
<p>Terraform has an official <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/index.html">OpenStack Provider</a> that allows you to manage the resources on OpenStack. It can create everything from compute instances, object storage, containers and more.</p>

<h3 id="create-application-credentials">Create application credentials</h3>
<p>You can use OpenStack user credentials (even the <code>admin</code> account) with Terraform if you choose. However, using <strong>application credentials</strong> allows you to restrict what access Terraform has, and can be revoked and/or rotated if the credentials are exposed in some way.</p>
<p>To generate an application credential, you can either use the CLI or the web interface.</p>

<p>You can assign the application credential a member, reader or admin role. As Terraform will be creating resources, the admin role is applicable.</p>
<p>A couple of points to note here are: -</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>project_id</code> is the OpenStack project in which you create your resources (think of this like a tenant or your account in a public cloud)</li>
<li>The <code>user_id</code> is the ID of this application credential</li>
</ul>
<p>Either note down these credentials, or download them in a <code>clouds.yaml</code> file or an <strong>OpenRC</strong> file. The latter can be sourced in your <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.zshrc</code> or the <strong>rc</strong> file for the shell of your choice.</p>
<h3 id="provider-configuration">Provider Configuration</h3>
<p>In my Terraform directory, I have create a directory called <code>openstack</code>. In this directory, the provider configuration looks like the below: -</p>

<p>The <code>auth_url</code> uses the <strong>v3</strong> Keystone API endpoint (which will be <code>http://10.20.20.1:5000/v3</code> for any default Microstack install).</p>
<p>The <code>region</code> is <code>microstack</code>. This can be verified with the below: -</p>

<p>The <code>tenant_id</code> is the same as the <code>project_id</code>.</p>
<p>If you have sourced the credentials using the <strong>OpenRC</strong> file in the previous stage, you can remove all of the fields in the provider. Terraform will use environment variables instead. You would then have something like: -</p>

<br><h3>Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 1</h3><p><small>5/5/2020</small></p><p>

<img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/knightdragon.jpg"></p><p><i>This is the first post in a three part series. Check out <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler2.html">part 2</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html">part 3</a> when you are ready.</i></p>

<p>It is a beautiful day outside, so let's make a compiler. You don't need any knowledge of how compilers work to follow along. We are going to use Python to implement our own programming language, Teeny Tiny, that will compile to C code. It will take about 500 lines of code and provide the initial infrastructure needed to customize and extend the compiler into your own billion dollar production-ready compiler.</p>

<p>This tutorial is a series of posts that go step by step in building a working compiler. All of the source code can be found in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler">repo</a>. If you follow along with all the posts, I guesstimate that it will take you only a few hours.

</p><p>The Teeny Tiny language we are going to implement is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>. The syntax is clean and simple. If you prefer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>-like syntax then it will be trivial to modify the compiler at the end.  Here is an example program in our Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<pre>PRINT "How many fibonacci numbers do you want?"
INPUT nums

LET a = 0
LET b = 1
WHILE nums &gt; 0 REPEAT
    PRINT a
    LET c = a + b
    LET a = b
    LET b = c
    LET nums = nums - 1
ENDWHILE	
</pre>

<p>This program prints out terms of the fibonacci sequence based on the user's input: 0 1 1 2 3 5 13...</p>

<p>Our language will allow a variety of the basic operations that you'd expect from a programming language. In particular, it will support:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Numerical variables</li>
	<li>Basic arithmetic</li>
	<li>If statements</li>
	<li>While loops</li>
	<li>Print text and numbers</li>
	<li>Input numbers</li>
	<li>Labels and goto</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this is a standard subset of features, you may notice that there are no functions, no arrays, no way to read/write from a file, and not even an else statement. But with just this small set of constructs, you can actually do a lot. It will also setup the compiler in such a way that many other features will be straight forward to add later.</p>

<h4>Compiler Overview</h4>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/compilersteps.png"></p><p>Our compiler will follow a three step process that is illustrated above. First, given the inputted source code, it will break the code up into <i>tokens</i>. These are like words and punctuation in English. Second, it will <i>parse</i> the tokens to make sure they are in an order that is allowed in our language. Just like English sentences follow specific structures of verbs and nouns. Third, it will <i>emit</i> the C code that our language will translate to.</p>

<p>We will use these three steps as the main organization for our code. The lexer, parser, and emitter will each have their own Python code file. This tutorial is broken up into 3 parts based on these steps as well. If you were to extend the compiler, there are some additional steps you would add, but we will hold off on discussing those.</p>



<h4>Lexer Overview</h4>

<p>The first module of our compiler is called the <i>lexer</i>. Given a string of Teeny Tiny code, it will iterate character by character to do two things: decide where each token starts/stops and what type of token it is. If the lexer is unable to do this, then it will report an error for an invalid token.</p>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/tokens.png"></p><p>The figure demonstrates an example input and output of the lexer. Given the Teeny Tiny code, the lexer must determine where the tokens are along with the type (e.g., keyword). You can see that spaces aren't recognized as tokens, but the lexer will use them as one way to know when a token ends.</p>

<p>Let's finally get into some code, starting with the structure of the lexer in the file <b>lex.py</b>:</p>

<pre>class Lexer:
    def __init__(self, input):
        pass

    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        pass

    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        pass

    # Invalid token found, print error message and exit.
    def abort(self, message):
        pass
		
    # Skip whitespace except newlines, which we will use to indicate the end of a statement.
    def skipWhitespace(self):
        pass
		
    # Skip comments in the code.
    def skipComment(self):
        pass

    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        pass
</pre>

<p>I like to sketch out all the functions that I think I will need, then go back and fill them in. The function <b>getToken</b> will be the meat of the lexer. It will be called each time the compiler is ready for the next token and it will do the work of classifying tokens. <b>nextChar</b> and <b>peek</b> are helper functions for looking at the next character. <b>skipWhitespace</b> consumes the spaces and tabs that we don't care about. <b>abort</b> is what we will use to report an invalid token.</p>

<p>The lexer needs to keep track of the current position in the input string and the character at that position. We will initialize these in the constructor:</p>

<pre>    def __init__(self, input):
        self.source = input + '\n' # Source code to lex as a string. Append a newline to simplify lexing/parsing the last token/statement.
        self.curChar = ''   # Current character in the string.
        self.curPos = -1    # Current position in the string.
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>The lexer needs the input code and we append a newline to it (this just simplifies some checks later on). <b>curChar</b> is what the lexer will constantly check to decide what kind of token it is. Why not just do <i>source[curPos]</i>? Because that would litter the code with bounds checking. Instead we do this in <b>nextChar</b>:</p>

<pre>    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        self.curPos += 1
        if self.curPos &gt;= len(self.source):
            self.curChar = '\0'  # EOF
        else:
            self.curChar = self.source[self.curPos]
</pre>

<p>This increments the lexer's current position and updates the current character. If we reach the end of the input, set the character to the end-of-file marker. This is the only place we will modify curPos and curChar. But sometimes we want to look ahead to the next character without updating curPos:</p>

<pre>    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        if self.curPos + 1 &gt;= len(self.source):
            return '\0'
        return self.source[self.curPos+1]
</pre>

<p>We should make sure these functions work. Let's test them by create a new file <b>teenytiny.py</b>:</p>

<pre>from lex import *

def main():
	input = "LET foobar = 123"
	lexer = Lexer(input)

	while lexer.peek() != '\0':
		print(lexer.curChar)
		lexer.nextChar()

main()
</pre>

<p>Run this and the output should be every character of the input string, <i>LET foobar = 123</i>, on a new line:</p>

<pre>L
E 
T 

f 
o 
o 
b 
a 
r 

= 

1 
2 
3 

</pre>

<h4>Classifying Tokens</h4>

<p>But we don't just want characters, we want tokens! We need to plan how combining individual characters together makes a token, which works much like a state machine. Here are the main lexer rules for the Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operator. One or two consecutive characters that matches: + - * / = == != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=</li>
	<li>String. Double quotation followed by zero or more characters and a double quotation. Such as: "hello, world!" and ""</li>
	<li>Number. One or more numeric characters followed by an optional decimal point and one or more numeric characters. Such as: 15 and 3.14</li>
	<li>Identifier. An alphabetical character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.</li>
	<li>Keyword. Exact text match of: LABEL, GOTO, PRINT, INPUT, LET, IF, THEN, ENDIF, WHILE, REPEAT, ENDWHILE</li>
</ul>

<p>Next we will start our <b>getToken</b> function in our <b>Lexer</b> class:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            pass	# Plus token.
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            pass	# Minus token.
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            pass	# Asterisk token.
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            pass	# Slash token.
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            pass	# Newline token.
        elif self.curChar == '\0':
            pass	# EOF token.
        else:
            # Unknown token!
            pass
			
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>This will detect a few possible tokens, but doesn't do anything useful yet. What we need next is a <b>Token</b> class to keep track of what type of token it is and the exact text from the code. Place this in <b>Lex.py</b> for now:</p>

<pre># Token contains the original text and the type of token.
class Token:   
    def __init__(self, tokenText, tokenKind):
        self.text = tokenText   # The token's actual text. Used for identifiers, strings, and numbers.
        self.kind = tokenKind   # The TokenType that this token is classified as.
</pre>

<p>To specify what type a token is, we will create the <b>TokenType</b> class as an enum. It looks long, but it just specifies every possible token our language allows. Add <i>import enum</i> to the top of <b>Lex.py</b> and add this class:</p>

<pre># TokenType is our enum for all the types of tokens.
class TokenType(enum.Enum):
	EOF = -1
	NEWLINE = 0
	NUMBER = 1
	IDENT = 2
	STRING = 3
	# Keywords.
	LABEL = 101
	GOTO = 102
	PRINT = 103
	INPUT = 104
	LET = 105
	IF = 106
	THEN = 107
	ENDIF = 108
	WHILE = 109
	REPEAT = 110
	ENDWHILE = 111
	# Operators.
	EQ = 201  
	PLUS = 202
	MINUS = 203
	ASTERISK = 204
	SLASH = 205
	EQEQ = 206
	NOTEQ = 207
	LT = 208
	LTEQ = 209
	GT = 210
	GTEQ = 211
</pre>

<p>Now we can expand <b>getToken</b> to actually do something when it detects a specific token:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        token = None

        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.PLUS)
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.MINUS)
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.ASTERISK)
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.SLASH)
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            token = …</pre></div></div></div>

It's whether the pandemic will be the tipping point that teaches people the truth about public bathrooms,"&nbsp;Lezlie Lowe, a Halifax journalist and author of <em>No Place To Go: How Public Toilets Fail Our Private Needs,</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://thewalrus.ca/why-are-canadas-public-bathrooms-so-inadequate/" target="_blank">wrote&nbsp;this week in The Walrus</a>.</p>  <p>"[F]ar from being unhygienic, unsafe or simply unimportant, with the correct distancing and cleaning measures, these facilities are a crucial part of any effective plan for preventing disease and easing inequity."</p>  <p>Here is part of Lowe's&nbsp;conversation with <em>As It Happens</em> guest host Nil Köksal.</p>  <p><strong>If you left the building that you're in right now in Halifax, how far would you have to walk to find a public bathroom?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Oh, my gracious. I don't even actually know how far I would have to walk. Quite a distance, I think.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>How much more has this pandemic revealed about the issue of public bathrooms in this country?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>What we've seen during the pandemic all across the country is that, in Canada, we really have a culture of relying on publicly accessible toilets, which is to say toilets that are in private businesses …&nbsp;rather than public bathrooms, which are bathrooms that would be on streets, paid for by taxes and just considered part of the kind of basket of goods that we know we need to use our cities safely.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Stop signs and sidewalks and benches and trash cans —&nbsp;we know we need all those things. We&nbsp;don't really question paying for those things out of our municipal tax dollars. But bathrooms have really been left out of that in Canada and in other other parts of North America.&nbsp;</p>  <p>What we've seen with COVID is there's been this really big shutdown. And so not only have the few public bathrooms that are in many cities closed, but we've seen all these publicly accessible bathrooms closed.&nbsp;And all of a sudden people are like, "Wait a minute, wait a minute," who really actually had pretty good access before. And now, they're feeling what it's like to have diminished access.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/rileysmithphoto.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/rileysmithphoto.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/rileysmithphoto.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rileysmithphoto.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/rileysmithphoto.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645520.1594414394!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rileysmithphoto.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Lowe is a Halifax journalist and journalism professor, and author of No Place To Go: How Public Toilets Fail Our Private Needs.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Riley Smith )</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>You've also written that bathrooms are about mobility. Elaborate on that.&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>When you look at any sort of municipal plan for any cities — and I did a lot of this research for my book — cities talk about walkability, they talk about livability, they talk about being pedestrian friendly and cyclist friendly, and a lot of talk about people aging in place.&nbsp;</p>  <p>None of those things are possible without a reasonable, accessible grid of public bathrooms because there is absolutely no way around the fact that bathrooms are needed by everybody every day of their lives.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Everybody uses the bathroom. And what we see in cities is you can go farther&nbsp;and you can stay out longer when you have access to that grid of public bathrooms.&nbsp;</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>We're taught that bathrooms are places where you do private things, which they are.

What's the holdup here?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>We have a really different attitude toward bathrooms in, I would say, North America, and Canada particularly, than other places in the world.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The way I always describe it is when we're kids, we're taught that bathrooms are places where you do private things, which they are. They're also kind of a joke. You know, I wrote a book about public bathroom access. There's only two responses. People are either like, "Ew, that's gross." Or they're kind of like, "Ha ha ha!"&nbsp;</p>  <p>So we have these really kind of almost neurotic responses to public bathrooms, and we're taught that as kids. And what happens is when we become adults, we sort of lack the capacity for talking about, you know, the basic need to go to the bathroom, in a serious way. And I think that is actually borne out in the policy decisions of cities.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/olympics-beijing-names.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/olympics-beijing-names.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/olympics-beijing-names.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/olympics-beijing-names.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/olympics-beijing-names.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5645542.1594409137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/olympics-beijing-names.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>People walk past a public toilet in Beijing.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Claro Cortes Iv/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>And people experiencing homelessness in cities, including Toronto, have talked about this in recent weeks as well. Access for them is an issue.&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Yeah. And I mean, I'm sure that is exacerbated now.&nbsp;</p>  <p>We talk about COVID, but we also have to think about the other health risks that are actually around when we look at public bathrooms. And there's ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks due to public defecation. I mean, there's very serious health concerns that we need to take into account when we think about what the value of having public bathrooms is.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>And on the issue of COVID, I suspect some municipal leaders might say, you know, we just can't keep up. You have to clean these facilities. They wouldn't be safe, especially during a pandemic. But in your most recent article about this in The Walrus, you say public bathrooms aren't really riskier than any other high-touch public spaces.&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>We do automatically think of public bathrooms as these sort of paragons of filth. And, yeah, they can get really dirty. But so can other spaces.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Public bathrooms are not a high risk for COVID for a couple reasons. One is that COVID is a respiratory illness. And so what we know is that we need to stay out of small spaces with shared air with strangers. That's the same as an elevator. Nobody is talking about closing every elevator in every high-rise because they're too risky. We're just putting mitigation factors in place. So, you know, we say only two people in an elevator.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The other issue is high-touch surfaces. Yes, there are high-touch surfaces in bathrooms, but there are also high-touch surfaces entering, you know, malls and public libraries and restaurants and elevators, for that matter. And so, yeah, there needs to be enhanced cleaning. That's no different than any other space right now as we're coping with the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The one thing that I would say sets public bathrooms apart when we're talking about COVID is, ironically, the fact that we practise hand hygiene in public bathrooms. Public bathrooms are the places we go to help get the virus off of our hands. So that sort of puts, I would say, a greater onus on cities to do those reasonable control of access and sanitizing solutions&nbsp;but also keeping bathrooms open, because people need to wash their hands more than ever when it comes to this virus.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Andrew Chang looks into whether you’re likely to contract COVID-19 from using a public bathroom.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:02</span></span></span></p>  <p><strong>Any sense of the costs for cities to put these public washrooms in?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Bathrooms are not cheap. They are, if you're looking at the on-street automated toilets that you mentioned earlier, those can cost, you know, a quarter of a million dollars to install.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I think we have to ask ourselves, who do we want to be? What do we want as a society? Because when we talk about livability, we talk about walkability. When we talk about people aging in place, if we say we want those things, then we actually have to put in place the supports that support those things.&nbsp;</p>  <p>So I think that, yes, they are costly, but they are also necessary to human dignity and to the full and reasonable use of our cities.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Do you think the pandemic, as you wrote, will be a tipping point?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>I can say that, you know, as the person who wrote the book on public toilets, I have never talked about public toilets so much as I have in the last four months.

  <p><span>11 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Have you ever watched a team of five-year-olds play soccer? The way the mass of children chases the ball around in a group? I think programmers do that too.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/youth-soccer.jpg" alt="Get the ball!"></p>

<p>There’s something about working on a problem together that is so much more rewarding than working separately, we cannot help but get drawn into other peoples problems. There’s a lot of gratification to be had in finding a solution to a shared difficulty!</p>

<p>Even better, different people bring different perspectives to a problem, and illuminate different areas of improvement.</p>

<h2 id="maximum-inscribed-circle">Maximum Inscribed Circle</h2>

<p>A couple months ago, my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrmartindavis">Martin Davis</a> committed a pair of new routines into JTS, to <a href="http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com/2020/04/maximum-inscribed-circle-and-largest.html">calculate the largest circles</a> that can fit inside a polygon or in a collection of geometries.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/canada_mic.png" alt="Maximum Inscribed Circle"></p>

<p>We want to bring all the algorithmic goodness of JTS to PostGIS, so I took up the first step, and <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/commit/0909042df5f8d4b9ae1832b3fd67713e206057fb">ported “maximum inscribed circle” to GEOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/b5bd6836d4617ebc924e804c42b60de637a94f60">to PostGIS</a>.</p>

<p>When I ported the GEOS test cases, I turned up some odd performance problems. The calculation seemed to be taking inordinately long for larger inputs. What was going on?</p>

<p>The “maximum inscribed circle” algorithm leans heavily on a routine called <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/1357b728c30c6008d6d4fafba158f0cee71f3e9d/src/operation/distance/IndexedFacetDistance.cpp">IndexedFacetDistance</a> to calculate distances between polygon boundaries and candidate circle-centers while converging on the “maximum inscribed circle”. If that routine is slow, the whole algorithm will be slow.</p>

<p>Dan Baston, who originally ported the “IndexedFacetDistance” class got interested and started looking at some test cases of his own.</p>

<p>He found he could improve his old implementation using <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/commit/1357b728c30c6008d6d4fafba158f0cee71f3e9d">better memory management</a> that he’d learned in the meantime. He also found <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/314">some short-circuits</a> to envelope distance calculation that improved performance quite a bit.</p>

<p>In fact, they improved performance so much that Martin <a href="https://github.com/locationtech/jts/pull/534">ported them back to JTS</a>, where he found that for some cases he could log a <strong>10x performance</strong> in distance calculations.</p>

<p>There’s something alchemical about the whole thing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There was a bunch of long-standing code nobody was looking at.</li>
  <li>I ported an unrelated algorithm which exercised that code.</li>
  <li>I wrote a test case and reported some profiling information.</li>
  <li>Other folks with more knowledge were intrigued.</li>
  <li>They fed their knowledge back and forth and developed more tests.</li>
  <li>Improvements were found that made everything faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>I did nothing except shine a light in a dark hole, and everyone else got very excited and things happened.</p>

<h2 id="toast-caching-redux">Toast Caching Redux</h2>

<p>In a similar vein, as I described in my <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2020/04/developer-life.html">last diary entry</a>, a long-standing performance issue in PostGIS was the repeated reading of large geometries during spatial joins.</p>

<p>Much of the problem was solved by dropping a very small “<a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/8b548a4697490b7e45508b91cb340eb79b424a92">TOAST cache</a>” into the process by which PostGIS reads geometries in functions frequently used in spatial joins.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/facepalm.gif" alt="TOAST"></p>

<p>I was so happy with the improvement the TOAST cache provided that I just stopped. Fortunately, my fellow PostGIS community member <a href="https://github.com/Algunenano">Raúl Marín</a> was more stubborn.</p>

<p>Having seen my commit of the TOAST cache, and having done some work in other caching parts of PostGIS, he took up the challenge and <a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/10c9dc2ac242c194763a47edab2b2487b42eb3a6">integrated the TOAST cache with the existing index caches</a>.</p>

<p>The integrated system now uses TOAST identifiers to note identical repeated inputs and avoid both unneccessary reads off disk and unncessary cache checks of the index cache.</p>

<p>The result is that, for spatial joins over large objects, PostGIS 3.1 will be as much as 60x faster than the performance in PostGIS 3.0.</p>

<p>I prepared a demo for a bid proposal this week and found that an example query that took <strong>800ms</strong> on my laptop took a <strong>full minute</strong> on the beefy 16-core demo server. What had I done wrong? Ah! My laptop is running the <strong>latest</strong> PostGIS code (which will become 3.1) while the cloud server was running PostGIS <strong>2.4</strong>. Mystery solved!</p>

<h2 id="port-port-port">Port, Port, Port</h2>

<p>I may have <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2020/04/developer-life.html">mentioned</a> that I’m not a very good programmer.</p>

<p>My current task is definitely exercising my imposter syndrome: porting Martin’s <a href="http://lin-ear-th-inking.blogspot.com/2020/05/jts-overlay-next-generation.html">new overlay code</a> from JTS to GEOS.</p>

<p>I knew it would take a long time, and I knew it would be a challenge; but knowing and experiencing are quite different things.</p>

<p>The challenges, as I’ve experienced them are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moving from Java’s garbage collected memory model to C++’s managed memory model means that I have to understand the object life-cycle which is <strong>implicit</strong> in Java and make it <strong>explicit</strong> in C++, all while avoiding accidentally introducing a lot of memory churn and data copying into the GEOS port. Porting isn’t a simple matter of transcribing and papering over syntactic idiom, it involves first understanding the actual JTS algorithms.</li>
  <li>The age of the GEOS code base, and number of contributors over time, mean that there are a huge number of different patterns to potentially follow in trying to make a “consistent” port to GEOS. Porting isn’t a matter of blank-slate implementation of the JTS code – the ported GEOS code has to slot into the <strong>existing</strong> GEOS layout. So I have to spend a lot of time learning how previous implementations chose to handle life cycles and call patterns (pass reference, or pointer? yes. Return value? or void return and output parameter? also yes.)</li>
  <li>My lack of C++ idiom means I spend an excessive amount of time looking up core functions and methods associated with them. This is the only place I’ve felt myself measurably get better over the past weeks.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m still only just getting started, having ported some core data structures, and little pieces of dependencies that the overlay needs. The reward will be a hugely improved overlay code for GEOS and thus PostGIS, but I anticipate the debugging stage of the port will take quite a while, even when the code is largely complete.</p>

<p>Wish me luck, I’m going to need it!</p>

<p>If you would like to test the new JTS overlay code, it resides on <a href="https://github.com/dr-jts/jts/tree/overlay-sr">this branch</a>. <br>If you would like to watch me suffer as I work on the port, the GEOS branch is <a href="https://github.com/libgeos/geos/tree/overlay-sr">here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[Cell-level Three-way Merge in Dolt]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt">Dolt</a> is a SQL database with Git-like
functionality. It supports version control primitives including commit,
branch, merge, clone, push and pull. This is the fourth post in a series
exploring how Dolt stores table data implements these version control
primitives. Previously, we looked at <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-04-01-how-dolt-stores-table-data/">the content-addressed sorted index
structure</a> underlying Dolt's table
storage, called a Prolly-tree.  In the second post, I explained <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-05-13-dolt-commit-graph-and-structural-sharing/">the Dolt
commit graph</a> and how
table storage in Dolt is shared across revisions of the table.  In our last
post, we talked about <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-06-16-efficient-diff-on-prolly-trees/">implementing diff efficiently on top of
Prolly-trees</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, we're going to look at how Dolt implements <code>merge</code> by using a
cell-level three-way merge algorithm.</p>

<p>Merge is a fundamental operation in (D)VCS and finding a way to do effective
merges of source files in version control systems is what allowed VCS
implementations to move away from file locking and into a workflow where
multiple people can work on the same files at the same time.</p>
<p>A merge takes two divergent revisions of a source document which are created
by two divergent histories of changes to that document and produces a new
document that includes all the changes from both histories. In the context of
Dolt where the "source document" is the value of the database at a commit, the
fundamental operation is something like <code>newDatabaseValue :=
Merge(intoDatabaseValue, fromDatabaseValue)</code>.</p>
<p>The fundamental question is how to construct the <code>newDatabaseValue</code> given the
two database values which should be merged. There have been numerous solutions
to this problem in a variety of contexts, including collaborative file
editing, databases and version control systems. Dolt takes its approach to
merges from Git, and it implements a traditional algorithm from VCS, a
three-way merge.</p>

<p>A three-way merge works in the context of the commit graph and a recorded and
available history for how the database came to have <code>intoDatabaseValue</code> and
<code>fromDatabaseValue</code>. It builds on top of <code>diff</code>, which was explained in
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-06-16-efficient-diff-on-prolly-trees/">my previous blog post</a> and it
works on three independent commits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>into</strong>—The head of the branch being merged into. Often something like <code>main</code>.</li>
<li><strong>from</strong>—The head of the branch being merged from. Often a feature branch.</li>
<li><strong>ancestor</strong>—The nearest common ancestor of <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Dolt commit graph, with the commits pointing to their parents, this looks
something like:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a10faf8b5fe1f4329112153f729fabfc/72799/merge-commit-graph.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="merge commit graph" title="merge commit graph" src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a10faf8b5fe1f4329112153f729fabfc/72799/merge-commit-graph.png" srcset="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a10faf8b5fe1f4329112153f729fabfc/a48b3/merge-commit-graph.png 214w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>When running <code>dolt merge</code>, <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong> are explicit based on the
working directory and the CLI invocation. <strong>into</strong> comes from the branch that
is currently checked out in the working directory. <strong>from</strong> comes from the
commit that is supplied on the command line. But <strong>ancestor</strong> is based on the
repository state and relationship between <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>. It is found
automatically by inspecting the parents of <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>.</p>
<p>The nearest common ancestor is the ancestor where the commits most recently
diverged from each other.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> We find this commit by walking the parents of
<strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong> in breadth-first order until we find a common
commit.</p>
<h2>Diffs and Finding Conflicts</h2>
<p>The fundamental observation of three-way merge is that if we look at all the
changes between <strong>ancestor</strong> and <strong>into</strong> and all the changes between
<strong>ancestor</strong> and <strong>from</strong>, that is the set of changes that should appear in
the value that results from the merge of <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>.</p>
<p><code>Diff(ancestor, into)</code> defines all the changes that have occured on <strong>into</strong>
since it diverged from its common ancestor with <strong>from</strong>. And symmetrically,
<code>Diff(ancestor, from)</code> defines all the chages that have occurred on <strong>from</strong>
since it diverged from its common ancestor with <strong>into</strong>. If all of those
changes are reflected in the database value resulting from <code>Merge(into,
from)</code>, the value will be the one we want.</p>
<p>Dolt does this by merging the diffs by primary key on table data for each
table in the database. After finding the commit <strong>ancestor</strong>, it streams
<code>Diff(ancestor, into)</code> and <code>Diff(ancestor, from)</code>. It visits differences in
primary key order using a merging iterator of the two diffs.</p>
<ol>
<li>If <code>Into.Key &lt; From.Key</code>: the value for the row in <code>into</code> is the right
value in the output.</li>
<li>If <code>Into.Key &gt; From.Key</code>: the value for the row in <code>from</code> is the right
value in the output.</li>
<li>If <code>Into.Key == From.Key &amp;&amp; Into.Value == From.Value</code>: the same change was
made in <code>into</code> and <code>from</code> and there is no conflict. The value of the row is as
it is in <code>into</code> and <code>from</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, <code>Into.Key == From.Key</code>, but the rows are not identical. In this
case, Dolt falls back to cell-level merge of the rows.</li>
</ol>
<p>A cell-level merge means that the merged value for that row is not a conflict
if the changes didn't touch the same columns. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>If one of the changes is a delete and the other is not, then there is a
conflict.</li>
<li>If, for any column α in the table, <code>into</code> changes the value of column
α to be χ, and <code>from</code> of the changes the value of column α to
be γ, where χ is not equal to γ, then there is a conflict</li>
<li>Otherwise, the value of the row in the merged output is equal to the value
of the row as it appears in <strong>ancestor</strong>, with all of the column mutations in
<strong>into</strong> applied to it and all of the column mutations in <strong>from</strong> applied to
it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the two diffs merge might be operating on:</p>

<p>In this example, <code>california</code> will be covered by case #1, <code>new york</code>
by case #2, and <code>usa</code> by case #3. <code>texas</code>, because it is modified in
both branches and has a conflicting column value, will end up as a
conflict in case #4. <code>vermont</code> will also be handled by case #4, but
because the two branches modified different columns, there will be no
conflict. The resulting row will reflect both changes: a population of
623,989 and a capital of Montpelier.</p>
<p>In reality, when implementing the above algorithm, Dolt is operating on an
editor for the table data in <strong>into</strong>, not <strong>ancestor</strong>. Thus, Dolt skips over
entries matching step 1 and 3, it applies all the diffs matching step 2 to the
current table value, and it applies the cell-level diffs on non-conflicting
changes matching step 4 only from <code>from</code>.</p>
<p>Dolt's three-way merge works great in the case that the two divergent
histories work on independent parts of the database. But if they both update
portions of the database with conflicting values, then it fails to produce a
database value that incorporates both sets of changes. Instead, it falls back
to producing <code>conflicts</code> and it leaves it up to the user to resolve conflicts
and get the database into a state that reflects both sets of changes.</p>
<h2>Representing Conflicts</h2>
<p>The result of the merge algorithm is a new table value for the table in the
working set plus a possibly empty set of conflicting rows which could not be
merged successfully.  Conflicts in Dolt are always on a row in a table. The
primary key is the same between <strong>into</strong> and <strong>from</strong>, but the values for at
least one column in the row were different between the two commits and that
column's value was changed by both histories since <strong>ancestor</strong>.</p>
<p>Conflicts in Dolt are stored by primary key along-side the table data for the
table, in a separate Prolly-tree from the table data itself. Each row in the
conflicts Prolly-tree stores the value of the row as it appeared in all three
commits involved in the merge: <strong>into</strong>, <strong>from</strong> and <strong>ancestor</strong> . This
allows for programmatic resolution strategies to see the relevant row-related
data if necessary.</p>
<p>Conflicts after a merge can be resolved one-by-one, by setting the row to a
certain value and removing the conflict from the conflicts row data.  Dolt also
has built-in bulk resolution strategies, such as take-ours and take-theirs.
For example, to merge a feature branch into your current working branch and
overwrite all conflicts back to their values as they are in your current
working branch, you an do:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>$ dolt merge feature-branch
$ dolt conflicts resolve --ours table_with_conflicts</code></pre></div>
<p>Currently Dolt considers any table that has unresolved conflicts in its
conflicts Map to be unmerged and it will not allow a commit to be created with
any unmerged table values. That means that table values that carry conflicts
cannot appear in commits. This is a small divergence from git, which places the
conflicts as textual markers directly in the working tree (if those files are
text files) and will allow files with conflict markers to be staged for commit
with something like <code>git add -f</code>.</p>

<p>We took a quick look at how three-way merge works and saw that it applies very
naturally to table data as Dolt represents it. While a cell-level three-way
merge isn't the most natural fit for every database merge use case, we think
it's a really good starting point for human scale databases that have
feature-level collaboration. That being said, this space is one corner of Dolt
that's ripe for innovation, and we hope to see a lot of feature work here in
the future. Some things we would to implement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recursive three-way merge, for when a nearest common ancestor is not
uniquely defined.</li>
<li>A larger suite of conflict resolution strategies, potentially building on
type-specific merge-lattices from CRDTs for example.</li>
<li>A larger suite of conflict …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>If you're looking for a more reasoned argumentation, see Update 3 at the bottom.</em></p>
<p>I rarely interact with <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> anymore. All my projects are either on my selfhosted <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> instance or on <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg.org</a>. That's why I missed the following on <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/">Github Status</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/github_status.png" alt="Github status shows a lot of downtimes"><br>
<em>Yikes</em></p>
<p>Yikes, indeed. How everyone handles this is up to them. Large projects will find it hard to move, no doubt.</p>
<p>My interpretation? The Microsoft Github ship is sinking and it's sinking faster every day. The beauty is: you don't need them. Instead of relying on Github, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>selfhost your own <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> instance if you have the knowledge;</li>
<li>use <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg.org</a> which also uses <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a>;</li>
<li>use <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">sourcehut.org</a> which takes a different but very solid approach to git hosting;</li>
<li>use any instance generously hosted by amazing people (think <a href="https://libreho.st/">libreho.st</a> and <a href="https://chatons.org/">Chatons</a>);</li>
<li>use <a href="https://gitlab.com/">gitlab.com</a> or selfhost an instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many better places to be for git hosting nowadays. For an easy performance comparison of different services, see <a href="https://forgeperf.org/">forgeperf.org</a>.</p>
<p>Abandon the corporate ship before or after it sinks, up to you.</p>

<h2>Update 1</h2>
<p>Added <a href="https://forgeperf.org/">forgeperf.org</a> link after suggestion by <a href="https://mstdn.io/@slow">@slow@mstdn.io</a>.</p>

<h2>Update 2</h2>
<p>Added <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">sourcehut.org</a> link after suggestion by <a href="https://social.privacytools.io/@freddyym">@freddyym@social.privacytools.io</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Update 3</h2>
<p>Don't publish on your website when you are feeling frustrated; that's what Twitter is for.</p>
<p>Let's inject some reason here. Github isn't dying anytime soon. Certainly not due to this number of outages. And all software breaks, so that's no measure; what matters is the response. And Github is on it. Like every single other time it was broken.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean we can't change the status quo. Almost every defense of Github comes down to discoverability: if I put my project on Github, others will find it. If I put it elsewhere, other won't find it.</p>
<p>Do not forget: Github's discoverability comes from us, the userbase. We the developers make or break Github. If we all move, Github shuts its doors. This won't happen. But look at the landscape: so many alternative solutions exist, Github is no better than any other service and, in the eyes of some, me included, Github may actually provide a worse experience than most alternatives.</p>
<p>And about discoverability. Have you heard of social media? Blog posts? I discover a lot of new Github projects on a regular basis and almost none, I have discovered via Github itself. People talk about good projects and share them, plain and simple.</p>
<p>If you simply like Github and their network and their continuously "evolving" UI, have at it. To each their own.</p>
<p>If you don't like Github, do not stay. Be the change you want to see.</p></div></div>]]>

                <p>I wasn't always productive.</p><p>I used to spend my days and nights surfing Instagram and Snapchat while watching funny cat videos as a part time job.</p><p>It was boring, useless, and silly.</p><p>But after 3 years of self development and web development, <strong>I now only spend less than 20 minutes a day on my cell phone</strong>. Here's proof:</p><figure><img src="https://joshternyak.com/content/images/2020/07/screen-time.png" alt="screen time less than 20 minutes" srcset="https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/screen-time.png 600w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/screen-time.png 1000w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/screen-time.png 1600w, https://joshternyak.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/screen-time.png 2400w"></figure><p>As you can see, I spend 38 minutes on "Social Networking", which only includes messenger and the alarm clock. I DO NOT have any social media apps on my cell phone. </p><p>Completely removing non-essential apps from my phone has saved me quite literally my life (to clarify: my definition of "my life" is what I spend all of my time on).</p><p>But how did I, a 15 year old web nerd who used to spend 7+ hours on my cell phone like millions of others, "become" so <strong>productive</strong>?</p><p>I'll tell you..</p><h2 id="wasting-your-time-wasting-your-life-">Wasting your time = wasting your life.</h2><p>We all know humans have become professional time-wasters, whether it's surfing Snapchat for funny stories or posting on Facebook how bored they are.</p><p>I used to do these exact same things.</p><p>But then I did something that completely changed my life:</p><blockquote><strong>I FORCED MYSELF TO REALIZE THAT WASTED TIME = WASTED LIFE</strong></blockquote><p>For anyone who has trouble with productivity, this is the most important piece of advice I can give you:</p><blockquote>Once you realize that wasting time means you're wasting your life, then you'll probably want to change something about what you do everyday.</blockquote><p>But that probably leaves you with the question:</p><p>So, how did I, Josh Ternyak, actually reduce my screen time from 7+ hours a day (full time job) to less than 20 minutes a day 😎?</p><p>Here's how:</p><ol><li>I found meaningful work to do to fill up my time instead of removing distractions and not having anything important to do</li><li>I deleted ALL APPS except for the apps the Iphone is made with to start with</li><li>I put my cell phone in the opposite side of the house shut off completely</li></ol><h2 id="it-s-not-that-scary-">It's not that scary.</h2><p>And that's it! It's less scary than it seems. </p><p>I remember the days when I was glued to my phone. And I'm NEVER going back to that lifestyle.</p><p>Now that I'm working on so many great projects, learning new skills, and spending my time on the important things in life, I hope what I've learned along the way will help you save your time, and quite literally...your life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>iPod to iPhone. Breaking Bad to Better Call Saul. Super Mario to Mario Maker. Leaders don’t rest on their laurels. That’s what motivated us to create Performance, our new code monitoring offering: to build off our core functionality and toward the demands developers face, both today and in the future. </p>
<p>From tracking down slow-loading pages to ensuring auto-completes actually complete, <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/performance-monitoring/getting-started/">Performance</a> gives you deeper visibility into the API calls and database queries that are critical toward delivering fast customer experiences with just five lines of code. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been using Sentry since the early days of Tackle, so getting set up with Performance was literally a one-line change for us. It quickly identified problematic endpoints and how our users were being impacted. We’re now planning some improvements to these APIs; can’t wait to see those times go down!</p>

</a>Developers: Take Comfort in Resolving User Misery</h2>
<p>Slow is a relative term. It’s why, in order to properly troubleshoot a slow customer experience, you need a consistent metric for slow. Enter User Misery. By pairing industry metrics with user metrics, User Misery tells you what is making any number of users…miserable. This means getting out in front of painful experiences before they become problems, and problems before they cause your customers to churn.</p>

</a>Mission-critical Context</h2>
<p>Without context, a customer’s spinning pinwheel can quickly turn into a developer’s panic spiral. Transaction Summary surfaces transactions by duration time, related code errors, and impact to the customer. With it, you can quickly see the number of affected users as well as the transaction’s impact on your response time. And by defining Key Transactions, your team can prioritize those critical functions and callbacks that need to be addressed immediately.</p>

<p><em>Considering that we’re in the middle of migrating to a modern application stack, Performance from Sentry is exactly what we need. Being able to see slow transactions and related errors out of the box with Sentry is going to help us deliver an even faster, more reliable experience.</em></p>

</a>Untangle Tracing</h2>
<p>Some error monitoring tools show you data from a frontend error. Only Performance can trace that frontend back to its API calls and slow database queries - all while surfacing related errors. What’s more, Performance aggregates the metadata surrounding your errors so you can easily search and sort your exceptions.</p>
</div><div>
<blockquote>
<p>Sentry’s performance tracking has been a huge help for us. Before, it was difficult to know exactly how long key functions actually took to load in real-time conditions. Now, we have metrics to assess whether load times are acceptable and we can learn which conditions impact performance, as part of our drive to constantly improve the user’s experience.</p>

<p>Just like Apple, Saul Goodman, and Mario Maker 2, we’re going to keep raising the code monitoring bar, so you can keep raising the bar for your customers by shipping performant and reliable software.</p>

<p>What do you get if you create a binary, a few bash scripts, a README and excellent timing? </p><p>An awareness that folks need to understand that ripping code from GitHub and sharing/running without validation can be dangerous. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">today on why people should read code and repos before they run them <a href="https://t.co/calGnBbllS">https://t.co/calGnBbllS</a> exploits 👀9/10 would troll the internet again</p>— Andy Gill (@ZephrFish) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZephrFish/status/1283162770213670915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Before we dive into the actual research, here's what actually happened for those who didn't see the fallout, unless you are in the security space and familiar with what happened last 36 hours, it probably won't make much sense quickly.</p><ol><li>Microsoft has a critical flaw in DNS server which resulted in a CVSS 10, CVE-2020-1350 is a real vulnerability that was published:<br><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1350">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1350</a> It's a brand new vulnerability therefore people would be interested in a proof of concept.</li><li>A security company publishes the info - no public exploit available at the point of publishing this blog, &nbsp;a quick kudos to the team over at Checkpoint Research who found the original vulnerability and published <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/resolving-your-way-into-domain-admin-exploiting-a-17-year-old-bug-in-windows-dns-servers/">a great write up which can be found here.</a></li><li>I created a fake exploit on GitHub minutes after the original blog post was published - playing a prank on hackers and other security companies picking up and publishing in threat intelligence feeds. The code was initially just a bash script then I added a binary loaded with canary tokens to track who was running the script. If anyone is interested Thinkst has a great blog around how canary tokens work <a href="https://blog.thinkst.com/p/canarytokensorg-quick-free-detection.html?m=1">that can be found here.</a></li><li>Lots of people ran the code or helped spread the existence of the fake exploit, folks ran the "proof of concept" code without reading it first and got trolled. If I had been malicious I could have done something much worse than rick-rolling.</li><li>The repository also contains a real fix for the vulnerability. Which can be found here:</li></ol><pre><code>reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters" /v "TcpReceivePacketSize" /t REG_DWORD /d 0xFF00 /f
net stop DNS &amp;&amp; net start DNS</code></pre><div><p>This is a particularly "amusing" troll because the sort of people who keep up with CVEs and look for proof-of-concept exploits should really know better than to run random code they just got off GitHub without checking what it does. It's obvious with the most cursory examination of the code in the repo that you shouldn't run it, exploit.sh contains:</p><p>curl -L <a href="https://bit.ly/3exifav">https://bit.ly/3exifav</a> | bash</p><p>The code in the repo is loaded with canary tokens and just general trolling, the list of files below details what each thing is and what it does.</p></div><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/CVE-2020-1350.exe">CVE-2020-1350.exe</a> - Benign binary which opens rick roll and pings canary token</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/Fix.bat">Fix.bat</a> - Batch file that applies the fix from Microsoft</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/LICENCE">LICENCE</a> - The licence file, also does nothing</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/PoC.exe">PoC.exe</a> - &nbsp;Benign binary which opens cmd.exe and additionally pings canary token</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> - Details the README of the repo</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/README.pdf">README.pdf</a> - Pings a canary token, also a benign document</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/exploit.sh">exploit.sh</a> - Rick roll in shell, also benign</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/windows-exploit.ps1">windows-exploit.ps1</a> - Rick roll in shell, also benign</li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/ZephrFish/CVE-2020-1350/blob/master/CVE-2020-1350.exe">CVE-2020-1350.exe</a> <strong> does not perform any exploits or malicious activity.

      <p>You’ve always been a bit suspicious of the trashcan on your computer’s imaginary desk top, and I’m here to tell you why.&nbsp;</p><p>I know what you’re thinking –&nbsp;<em>I figured it out already, in real life no one keeps a trashcan on top of their desk.</em> Yes, this adds to the tension. But the real reason is, I think, far more interesting.</p><p>The trashcan is an example of a <em>skeuomorph </em>– an intentional borrowing from a prior time that exists as a bridge to the past in order to make people feel comfortable and familiar.</p><p>There are skeuomorphs all around you. Your electric car has a decorative front grille that it doesn’t need, plastic pieces painted to resemble chrome of Detroit’s glory years, and sometimes even decorative wheel spokes to harken back to the horse-and-carriage days. Many pre-WWII American diners copied the form factor and appearance of rail dining cars, and the later diners aped those in turn. Some of those diners sport modern LED-powered blinking OPEN signs that mimic their neon forebearers. A fully electronic Las Vegas slot machine still comes with a long pull arm despite not needing any gears to turn, and the Nest thermostat has a rotary knob at least in part because so did thermostats before it.</p><p>It is exactly here, in the world of electronics and pixels, where you find the most skeuomorphs – that world simply moves too fast for our collective comfort.

      <p>Skeuomorphs can be helpful, accelerating progress by easing in new technology. But left unchecked, they can also stunt it. The warm comfort of the previous era becomes nostalgia’s nostalgia, serving no other purpose than gatekeeping the future.</p><p>The 3½" floppy disk as a save button in the newest Office wasn’t a design decision as much as design <em>inaction. (</em>It made perfect sense when it appeared, but wasn’t ever updated.) You could make the same argument for the handset icon for your voice call app. The sophisticated page-turning animation on the early iPads was widely ridiculed as the least important part of “paperness,” and Craig Mod once <a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/subcompact_publishing/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that on the same device, Apple’s much-hyped Newsstand was a grotesque calque of the analogue newsstand –&nbsp;the entire point of the original was to allow to look at glorious covers, which the new version bastardized into but a few coarse pixels. Perhaps we should’ve ripped off the bandaid right there and then.</p>

      <p>My favourite example in that genre might be the calculator on your computer, its form factor frozen in 1970s, down to onscreen buttons that are slower and more cumbersome than the keys on the keyboard <em>your fingers are already on top of. </em>Its operation is so primitive – only one number at a time, only one slot for memory –&nbsp;it borders on parody. Grab any <a href="https://soulver.app/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">modern</a> calculator <a href="https://numi.app/?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">app</a> and you’ll see how much easier it is to understand and engage with math if you’re not beholden to old conventions.</p><p>And right next to that calculator, there’s the trashcan.&nbsp;</p><p>The premise was pretty fantastic. During the 1970s and early 1980s, people at Xerox Parc and Apple wanted to simplify computers to make them more palatable for people who never used computers before. On the hardware side, that meant mice and nice graphical displays. And what was shown on those displays – a pixelated representation of their offices – made perfect sense to office workers meant to use them: papers that you could drag to a printer, a clipboard to keep snippets of text, and a little calculator resembling the one on their desk. And, in the corner, a trashcan they could use to get rid of unwanted documents.</p>

      <p>The new idea – known as “the desktop metaphor” – felt visible and tangible. Dragging something to a trashcan was far more natural than typing DEL FILE.TXT. But, more importantly, a file in a trashcan could be retrieved back. This was a filesystem equivalent of Undo introduced at around the same time, too;&nbsp;a beautiful safety hatch that helped you worry about computers less.</p><p>All of this worked. And a few years later, in System 4, the trashcan borrowed even more from the real world – its representation would bulge a bit whenever it had files inside. It seemed like a great, useful idea. But, without anyone noticing, it made the trashcan so much worse.</p>

      <p>You see, in the real world, a trashcan filled with old stuff is an unwelcome state. Organic trash rots and smells. Office trashcan filled with too much crap won’t make you any friends. An overflowing trash bin on the street is a sign of failed infrastructure.</p><p>But none of this applies to computers. It’s quite the opposite. The more stuff you have in your trash, <em>the more useful it is. </em>The more you neglect it, the further back in time you’ll be able to get to recover files you thought long gone.</p><p>Having another icon representing a filled trashcan on your screen makes you instinctively want to empty it (which often comes with a nice rewarding sound, too). But every time you do this, you remove your own safety hatch.</p><p>The designers at Apple never realized this. What’s even worse, their approach was copied by pretty much every other graphical operating system:</p>

      <p>The bulging trashcan is my favourite example of the tricky nature of skeuomorphs. There are skeuomorph stories in the book, of course: early Caps Lock keys physically depressing to mimic typewriters, a Typewriter key on a young word processor. Even here, <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/shift-happens/issues/a-love-letter-to-the-in-betweeners-101403?utm_campaign=Shift%20Happens%20book%20updates&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">I once wrote about in-betweeners</a>.</p><p>But these days, I also wonder about visual skeuomorphism. See, many typewriter books look like this:</p>

      <p>If you’re a person of a certain age, you have typed on a keyboard using Gorton Normal. BBC computers, Compaq portables, DEC and TeleVideo terminals, CDC supercomputers, many PC clones, and Apple II all chose it. IBM eventually switched to Helvetica, but before that, they also borrowed a version of Gorton’s typeface. Hell, Gorton Normal even made it to the Moon aboard Apollo 11 and its famous DSKY keyboard.</p>

      <p>The work’s not done yet. I’m not a professional type designer, and despite the simplified nature of Gorton – and skipping lowercase altogether – some of the shapes are pretty complicated. But it’s fun to see it in my limited use already: the awkwardness of some of the distinctive digits, the pound sign every BBC computer user had nightmares about, the <em>five </em>versions of zero I found throughout ages.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>I get a lot of questions about which hiring tools do what and how they’re different from each other, so I decided to draw an ugly, yet handy, picture (see below).</p>



<p>By the way, the reason this post has “unbundled” in the title is that many hiring tools, in part because we’re all on the VC funding treadmill, aspire to be more than they are and to ultimately be the one ring that rules them all, all the way from sourcing to interviewing to reference checks to onboarding to god knows what. So far, these attempts at grand unification, much like communism, have not panned out in practice. Though most tools claim to do more, most do more badly<sup><a href="#footnote_0_2396" id="identifier_0_2396" title="Not all… some do a decent job of this.">1</a></sup> but will try to upsell you on how they can solve <em>all</em> your hiring needs. Therefore, in the picture below, I’ve chosen the primary use case for each tool, i.e. the use case that each tool has actually gotten traction for (and the use case that I believe they’re actually good at).</p>



<p>And last thing. I run interviewing.io, which means that my take on other tools is indiscriminately biased. But, hell, it’s my blog, and I can say whatever I want… and having been in this industry for almost 10 years as an engineer and later as both an in-house and an agency recruiter and having spent the past 5 years running a successful hiring marketplace, I have acquired my prejudices the honest way, through laboratory experience.<sup><a href="#footnote_1_2396" id="identifier_1_2396" title="The bit about acquiring your prejudices the honest way is one of my favorite quotes, and credit goes to James Roberge, electrical engineering professor at MIT.">2</a></sup></p>



<figure><img src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-750x422.png" alt="" width="750" height="422" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-750x422.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-450x253.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11-768x432.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hiring-tools-unbundled-11.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>All that said, a few of the choices I made in the picture probably require some explanation, so here goes…</p>



<p><em>I thought HackerRank also had an interview tool.&nbsp;</em><br>Yep, they do, it’s called CodePair. However, last I checked, in order to use it, you also had to buy other things, i.e. you can’t just use CodePair for technical interviews without buying in to the broader HackerRank ecosystem. And though CoderPad isn’t paying me for this, I think it’s a superior tool on many levels (and the one we actively chose to use inside of interviewing.io, forsaking all others). CodeSignal also has their own tool and Codility does as well, but that’s kind of the point of this post: tools unbundled. I’m listing the tools that have the differentiator in question as their core competency, not an add-on on some enterprise checklist.</p>



<p><em>Why is Triplebyte in the middle of the sourcing section?</em><br>Triplebyte recently pivoted to a new model. Instead of interviewing their candidates before sending them to customers, they now rely on a quiz, the results of which they use to annotate candidate profiles that recruiters can source from. Before that, they had their own interviewers conduct technical interviews with candidates and also had their talent managers match candidates to companies.</p>



<p><em>I thought Hired, AngelList, and LinkedIn had some kind of skills assessment/technical vetting?</em><br>They do, but last I checked it was an asynchronous test (rather than a human interviewer). In my opinion, asynchronous skills testing on these platforms has some value, but it’s quite limiting for a few reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Skills testing for candidates is optional on these platforms, which means that 1) not all profiles are vetted and 2) you get a good amount of selection bias for candidates without leverage taking them, e.g. juniors and people who need new visa sponsorship</li><li>Much easier to cheat</li><li>And of course asynchronous tests are lower fidelity than human interviewers (or at least the ones I’ve seen to date… but I want to be proven wrong)</li></ul>



<p><em>I thought AngelList had interested candidates come to you?</em><br>They do. But like any jobs board, it’ll be noisy and probably full of candidates who don’t have much leverage, e.g. juniors/bootcamp grads and people requiring visa sponsorship.</p>



<p><em>Should I use take-home tests in my process?</em><br>As with many of my answers, it’s a matter of leverage. Candidates who have lots of options probably won’t spend time on take-homes. Candidates who don’t, either because they’re junior or because they don’t get a lot of recruiter outreach for other reasons, will.</p>



<p><em>Why are you so obsessed with leverage?</em><br>Because market forces rule everything around me.</p>



<p><em>Hey, if you do sourcing, why does your company literally have “interviewing” in the name?</em><br>The way we get candidates into our ecosystem is by offering them mock interviews. Then top performers from our practice pool can choose to use us for their job search. The name originally was meant to highlight the practice offering, but yeah, it’s confusing.</p>



<p><em>Is interviewing.io a good way to source candidates?</em><br>Yes. Yes it is.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s really hard to overstate how much smartphones and tablets have transformed the world. Starting with the iPhone in 2007, these devices combine gorgeous and intuitive touch interfaces with a full suite of network technologies.</p>
<p>As an iOS developer, I wouldnâ€™t consider myself a stranger to networking. Itâ€™s almost a bread-and-butter requirement that every app these days has <em>some</em> kind of REST API that handles the encoding and decoding of data to and from a remote source.</p>
<p>But that side of the technology aside, another huge side of networking on a smartphone that Iâ€™ve never personally explored before is Bluetooth. And yet, sitting here, writing this post wearing my wireless headphones, with an Apple Watch strapped to my wrist, after I just played some Animal Crossing on my Nintendo Switch with a wireless Pro Controller, I feel like Bluetooth is something I take for granted. Itâ€™s a black box of magic that I never worry about in my day-to-day life. Itâ€™s just there, and it just worksâ„¢.</p>
<p>In all of my iOS engineering career, Iâ€™ve never been involved in a project, or had a need in any of my side projects, to learn the Bluetooth APIs Apple provides. So when my buddy Max asked me if Iâ€™d be interested in writing an app in order to demonstrate how Core Bluetooth works, and following up with a blog post on the experience, I jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>This blog post is geared for anyone else in the same boat as me. Someone who might not necessarily be a newbie to developing for Apple platforms, but has just never stopped to learn how the Core Bluetooth APIs work. Iâ€™ll discuss the core concepts behind Core Bluetoothâ€™s parent/child architecture, show how to send some basic data between devices, and then discuss some of the pitfalls I encountered.</p>
<h2 id="whatiscorebluetooth">What is Core Bluetooth?</h2>
<p>Core Bluetooth is an Apple public framework, and the only official way for third party apps to integrate Bluetooth functionality into their apps on iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>Up until this point, Core Bluetooth has been an abstraction over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is different from â€œclassicâ€� Bluetooth in allowing far more energy efficient communication to support low-powered devices. </p>
<p>What this has historically meant is that Core Bluetooth was aimed at low powered peripheral devices such as heart rate sensors, or home automation; the kinds of devices that primarily reside in a low power state and periodically broadcast small tidbits of information. </p>
<p>By contrast, devices using classic Bluetooth (like game controllers and wireless headphones), which are much more high powered and constantly streaming data, were previously impossible to access from third party apps.</p>
<p>However, as of iOS 13, Apple expanded Core Bluetooth to cover classic Bluetooth devices as well. While the public API hasnâ€™t changed through this, it does mean that a much wider variety of wireless devices now became available through it.</p>
<p>With all of these amazing capabilities, there has never been a better time to start learning how to adopt Core Bluetooth.</p>
<h2 id="basicconceptsofcorebluetooth">Basic Concepts of Core Bluetooth</h2>
<p>When working with Core Bluetooth, it is necessary to become accustomed with the specific terminology of all of the major components of the service and how they relate to each other.</p>
<h3 id="centralsandperipherals">Centrals and Peripherals</h3>
<p>BLE operates in a very traditional server/client sort of model. One device acts in the capacity of a server that contains information, and another acts as a client that queries for this information and processes/displays it locally.</p>
<p>Some devices broadcast advertisements about themselves. These are called "peripherals". Other devices scan for and connect to peripherals. These are called "centrals". After they are connected, usually the peripheral acts as the server and the central acts as the client. This is the way Core Bluetooth operates.</p>
<p>As a general example, when pairing a pair of Bluetooth headphones to a smartphone, the smartphone would be the central, and the headphones would be the peripheral.</p>
<p><img alt="Core Bluetooth Centrals Peripherals and Characteristics" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/38nhe7v4wswj/2phxlIZJeVuCblurCN3dIu/73b504d15b4fae4c38acff1121a2232e/core_bluetoot_central_peripheral_char.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="services">Services</h3>
<p>Obviously, the type of BLE device in question will determine what sort of capabilities it has. For example, a heart rate monitor can record a wearerâ€™s heart rate, but a smart thermostat would record the current temperature of its location.</p>
<p>Most apps will be built to support one or more specific class of device capability. For example, apps for tracking a user's health would have no interest in connecting to devices that aren't health related, such as a thermostat. In order to encapsulate and report on the capabilities of specific peripherals, Bluetooth requires that peripherals identify their classes or capabilities as â€œservicesâ€�.</p>
<p>Peripherals make themselves discoverable to centrals by broadcasting advertisement packets defining the main identifying service they offer. When a central scanning at the same time detects these packets and determines that the peripheral device it found supports the same class of service that it is searching for, it can begin the process of connecting. Traditionally, while only the main service of the device is advertised, once a connection is formed, the central can then query the peripheral for any additional services it offers.</p>
<p>In order for the central to determine it is compatible with a peripheral, it needs to know the ID values of the services that the peripheral supports. For very specific apps and peripheral devices, it makes sense to define a service using a shared UUID between both devices.</p>
<p>However, in more general practice, it makes sense for peripherals to adopt Bluetooth services that are a standard capability globally. For example, it would make sense that any device that records blood pressure readings could be connected to <em>any</em> Bluetooth device capable of processing that data, regardless of who manufactured either device. As such, <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/services/">a public database exists</a> that lists a standardized set of service IDs that can be used between both centrals and peripherals who want to adopt a specific use case.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h3>
<p>For any given service, any number of separate sets of information and/or services might be included within it. For example, a heart rate sensor peripheral might feature a heart rate service, but then contained within that service is both the raw current heart rate value along with information on where the sensor is positioned over the wearer at the time.</p>
<p>As such, services may contain any number of â€œcharacteristicsâ€� which record various types of data, or perform various sub-functions of the service itself. They may be used to receive data from the peripheral, or send commands back to the peripheral. It is possible for centrals to explicitly query for information from a characteristic, or register an observer that will be called every time the characteristic has an update.</p>
<p>This concept of Bluetooth devices offering their capabilities as services and characteristics is officially called GATT, which is short for Generic Attribute Profile.</p>
<h3 id="corebluetoothconceptssummary">Core Bluetooth Concepts Summary</h3>
<p>Hopefully by this point, the basic layout of Core Bluetooth is starting to make sense to you. Parent devices are called centrals, and they connect to child devices known as peripherals. Peripherals manage their capabilities as services, who then manage their own capabilities via characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="puttingitallintopractice">Putting it all into practice</h2>
<p>Now that we've discussed the basic concepts of Core Bluetooth, we can start putting them into practice. For demonstrating the flow of connecting two devices, I've built a companion sample app around Core Bluetooth. The app is a very basic chat app that allows two devices to connect to each other, and to then send messages between each other. The app demonstrates how to both scan as a central and advertise a peripheral. Once connected, the app can then send messages both upstream and downstream through one pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h3>
<p>For starters, before we do anything else, we need to add the <code>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</code> key to our app's Info.plist describing why we want to use Bluetooth. If this key isn't present, not only would the app be rejected by the App Store on submission, but the app itself throws an exception when trying to call any Core Bluetooth APIs. This is a security requirement of Apple, as all apps must get explicit permission from the user before Bluetooth is enabled. For our case, let's explain we need Bluetooth to enable our chat service.</p>

<p>For iOS devices that fill the role of the central in a Bluetooth connection, they are represented by an object called <code>CBCentralManager</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>When editing a file, it’s quite crucial that you can navigate your cursor around rather quickly. <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a> allow for many different ways of doing so which, depending on the situation, can be more or less efficient and useful. This article examines the different ways of moving the cursor and compares them. Here, the term “efficiency” refers to navigating the cursor with as little time and effort (i.e. the number of keystrokes) as possible.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-mouse">Using the Mouse</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Not recommended</strong></p>
<p>Using the mouse pointer to navigate Vim may seem like an obvious choice for users coming from a GUI editor like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> or similar. However, in Vim, the goal is to keep your fingers on the “home row” of the keyboard (the row where the <code>F</code> and the <code>J</code> keys reside) and not having to move them greatly towards the touchpad or even the mouse. This should reduce the strain on your hands and wrists and make editing more efficient. Therefore, navigating with the mouse should be highly discouraged in most situations and is even disabled by default.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to enable it for users transitioning from one of the aforementioned editors who would like to have a smooth transition by allowing themselves to use the mouse initially and switching it back off again later in their learning journey. To turn on mouse navigation, add the following to your configuration file (either <code>~/.vimrc</code> or <code>~/.config/nvim/init.vim</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Temporarily enable mouse support</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>mouse</span>=<span>a</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This will allow you to point and click to move the cursor and to scroll through the current buffer.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-arrow-keys">Using the Arrow Keys</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Not recommended</strong></p>
<p>Again, for users used to other text editors or even word processing software like <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/">LibreOffice Writer</a>, it may be tempting to use what they know. In these programs, you mostly use the arrow keys for keyboard-based navigation. This is not recommended because… you guessed it: They require the user to move their fingers away from the home row.</p>
<p>The alternative is, as described in the next section, to use the <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> keys on the keyboard which are conveniently placed at the center and where you most likely have your fingers most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="using-hjkl">Using h,j,k,l</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use for small navigations. Use in combination with relative line numbers.</strong></p>
<p><code>h</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> are the basic movement keys in Vim. They should be used instead of the usual arrow keys on the keyboard to, as discussed above, keep your fingers on the home row as much as possible. It takes a little practice but will pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>One hugely important thing to do with these keys is to not press them multiple times in sequence or even hold them down to move several columns or rows. As with many commands in Vim, they can be prefixed with numbers to move multiple times. For example, <code>12j</code> can be used rather than pressing the <code>j</code> key twelve times which is, obviously, much more efficient (3 vs. 12 keystrokes). However, it is recommendable to only use these keys for small movements and mostly to move lines up or down because there are more efficient ways of moving longer vertical distances or horizontal distances in general.</p>
<p>It can be very useful to enable relative line numbers to see at a glance what number to prefix <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> with to move to a certain line. They can be enabled by adding the following two lines to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Enable relative line numbers</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>relativenumber</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>number</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This will always show the absolute number of the line the cursor is currently on and relative numbers for all others.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-within-a-line">Navigation Within a Line</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Mostly use <code>f</code>. Also consider <code>w</code>,<code>b</code>,<code>e</code>,<code>^</code> and <code>$</code>.</strong></p>
<p>So far, we’ve mostly looked at navigating from one line to another. The next step is to navigate within a line. In many cases, the straight forward thing to do is to use <code>w</code> or <code>W</code> to move to the next word, <code>b</code> or <code>B</code> to move to the previous word or even <code>e</code> or <code>E</code> to move directly to the end of the next word. For all of them, the lowercase variant considers a “word” to be what we intuitively see as one using delimiters like <code>-</code>, <code>/</code> or <code>.</code> to separate one word from another. The uppercase variant considers anything a word that is delimited by whitespace. Obviously, any of these commands can be prefixed with a number to jump multiple words in one go (e.g. <code>7w</code>). Other useful commands are <code>^</code> which moves to the first non-whitespace character of the line and <code>$</code> to move to the last character of a line. Considering the following line</p>
<p>with the cursor currently on the <code>g</code> character, pressing the following commands is the most efficient way to get to a specific target character:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Target Character</th>
<th>Command</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>j</code></td>
<td><code>2w</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td><code>W</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td><code>B</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>i</code></td>
<td><code>e</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>l</code></td>
<td><code>E</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td><code>^</code> or <code>0</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>o</code></td>
<td><code>$</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When moving multiple words back and forth or to a specific place within a word, <code>t</code> and <code>f</code> are incredibly helpful. Especially <code>f</code> moves to the next occurrence of a specific character which lets you make big jumps within a line. The difference is that <code>f</code> moves to a character and <code>t</code> moves to right before a character. So <code>t</code> is mostly useful for deleting everything to a character. These commands’ uppercase variants <code>F</code> and <code>T</code> do the same thing but backwards. All of these commands can be “repeated” with the <code>;</code> command which jumps to the next occurrence of the targeted character while <code>,</code> jumps to the previous one.</p>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Great for moving larger distances vertically and horizontally</strong></p>
<p>By far one of the most efficient ways of moving longer distances horizontally and vertically in a buffer is to use the search. The <code>/</code> key lets you search for a term and conveniently jump to its location. Pressing the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> keys jumps to the next and previous occurrence of the search term respectively. The <code>?</code> key searches backwards from the current cursor position (which inverts <code>n</code> and <code>N</code>). Even though, the main purpose of the search command is obviously to search, it is an incredibly powerful tool to navigate quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The user experience of the search command can be vastly improved by adding the following settings to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Incrementally search while typing</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>incsearch</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Use smart case for searching</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>ignorecase</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>smartcase</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Highlight searches</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>set</span> <span>hlsearch</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>" Use &lt;C-L&gt; to clear the highlighting of :set hlsearch.</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>if</span> <span>maparg</span>(<span>'&lt;C-L&gt;'</span>, <span>'n'</span>) ==# <span>''</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>C</span>-<span>L</span>&gt; :<span>nohlsearch</span>&lt;<span>C</span>-<span>R</span>&gt;=<span>has</span>(<span>'diff'</span>)?<span>'&lt;Bar&gt;diffupdate'</span>:<span>''</span>&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;&lt;<span>C</span>-<span>L</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>endif</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p><code>incsearch</code> will make sure that the search pattern is applied incrementally while typing instead of only after pressing the enter key. The combination of <code>ignorecase</code> and <code>smartcase</code> ignores the case of the search term when not using any uppercase letters and doesn’t ignore it when using at least one uppercase letter which is quite convenient and surprisingly intuitive. <code>hlsearch</code> highlights any matches for the search term allowing to easily jump between them using <code>n</code> and <code>N</code>. The last statement lets you clear the highlighted search results by pressing <code>ctrl+l</code> to unclutter your view once done searching and jumping.</p>
<p>All in all, search is one of the powerful tools for intuitive and efficient navigation. It covers the common use case of knowing the word or part of a word to navigate to but not having your eyes directly pointed there yet. Furthermore, it’s simply the fastest way of jumping somewhere in many cases and beats other methods of navigation quite often in that regard.</p>
<h2 id="clunky-movements">Clunky Movements</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Use for very specific use cases only. Consider <code>gg</code> and <code>G</code> for getting to know a file.</strong></p>
<p>In this section we’ll discuss what can be referred to as “clunky movements”. They let the user navigate larger distances in the buffer while sacrificing precision. These commands are less useful for exactly that reason. Vim can be a very efficient text editor by letting the user think about what they want to change, jumping precisely there with very few keystrokes, entering insert mode, performing a change with scalpel-like precision and finally exiting insert mode as soon as it’s done. The movement commands in this section however, get the cursor around the document as a whole while it’s hard for the user to predict at a glance, which line and column exactly they will land on.</p>
<p>A good example are the <code>H</code>, <code>M</code> and <code>L</code> keys which take the cursor to the top, the middle or the bottom of the current view port respectively. While this is a very big movement with just one keystroke, it’s highly likely that they won’t exactly get the cursor to the line needed but rather will have to be accompanied by pressing <code>j</code> or <code>k</code> multiple times which will result in much more thinking and many more keystrokes than what can be achieved with other methods. Similar are the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> keys which take the cursor to the next paragraph (a block of text delimited by blank lines).</p>
<p>A useful exception to that are the <code>gg</code> and <code>G</code> commands which take the cursor to the first or the last line of a buffer respectively. It’s easy and effortless to predict where these movements will take you. Especially the <code>G</code> command can be quite useful because it allows to append to a file with just two keystrokes (<code>G</code> followed by <code>o</code>).</p>
<h2 id="plugins">Plugins</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Install only the necessary plugins. Check out fzf!</strong></p>
<p>So far, we’ve only talked about features that are built into Vim or that can be configured on a vanilla installation. However, there are many useful plugins which can make navigating Vim even more efficient. It is important to carefully pick them though as any plugin can make Vim slower and/or less stable.</p>
<h3 id="fzf">fzf</h3>
<p>One of the most useful plugins is <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf</a> which is a great one to have in general. It offers many helpful commands like <code>:BLines</code> for searching the current buffer with intelligent fuzzy matching or <code>:Rg</code> for even searching the whole project for specific patterns which, in contrast to the other methods we’ve looked at so far, lets the user navigate between files. fzf is a tool that can be used for jumping between files and buffers but also between different locations within them. I highly recommend to check it out and add the following lines to your configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Jump to specific file</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>C</span>-<span>P</span>&gt; :<span>Files</span>&lt;<span>cr</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>" Search whole project</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> \ :<span>Rg</span>&lt;<span>space</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>The first line lets you open …</p></div></div>

                    <p>VEED.IO has grown fast.</p><p>12 months ago we turned on our paywall and made our first ever SaaS $1.</p><p>For any entrepreneur, this is a moment that they will never forget. Tim and I could not control our excitement.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/IMG_0318.jpeg"><figcaption>Our first ever $1 - 12 months ago</figcaption></figure><p>You achieved the impossible, there is light at the end of the tunnel and everything you have been dreaming about and working towards might come true!</p><p>Exactly 12 months after this first payment, we have managed to cross the seemingly impossible task of hitting $83,333 MRR / $1M ARR.</p><p>And the best part is we did it 100% self-funded, with no external funding.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/IMG-20200703-WA0015-1.jpg"><figcaption>1M ARR - Tim &amp; Sabba - VEED.IO</figcaption></figure><p>In this post, I would like to share relevant financial data that might give other founders insights into how to build their own bootstrapped SaaS to $1M ARR.</p><p>I would also like to share some insights into our attitudes and believes that have got us to where we are. Such as our bullish attitude towards growth, how we build the product and how we think about the future of VEED.</p><h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3><p>First off, we are aware that we did this very fast and we also go lucky (I talk about this more below) From the outside, VEED might look like an overnight success, however it was 10 years in the making!</p><p>Before we look at the numbers, I would like to provide some context. When we started charging, we already had about 30,000 MAU. However, pretty much none of those users would speak to us and we were unsure that if we added the paywall any of the users would upgrade.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/Accounts-Copy-149.png"><figcaption>1M ARR in 12 Months</figcaption></figure><p>Growth starts slow, but having a product that is scalable and can we assessed globally from day one really means the sky is the limit. 6 months in, our projection for 1M ARR was December, then August and due to increasing demand influenced by the pandemic, we hit 1M ARR in June. </p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/Accounts-Copy-150.png"><figcaption>ARR Milestones</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, the first $100K ARR took 171 days to reach and the following $100K took just 48 days. The reason why the 2nd was much quicker than the first is because we were learning from users and building the required product features. We were also learning more about our acquisition channels and were able to double down on them. </p><p>Although 171 days is not a very long period of time, turning up to the office and putting in 12 hours every day can be really draining. The stress of getting to profitability was really real. For bootstrapped startup, be aware that it can really take some time.</p><p>Like with anything with compounding growth your first 100K takes ages, but the next comes a lot quicker. It took 12 months for us to hit 1M ARR, however we are projected to hit 2M in just 4 months!</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/Accounts-Copy-151.png"><figcaption>1M ARR Traffic Growth</figcaption></figure><p>Bootstrapping is hard work, but as you grow it gets a lot easier. The speed in which you grow makes a HUGE difference to the bootstrapping experience. You need to get the flywheel moving super fast to keep everyone motivated and to get you to ramen profitability.</p><p>6 months after our first-ever paid users, we reached $10K MRR. Although a relatively small sum, it was enough to support the founding team.</p><p>This is important as it means you can donate 100% of your time building and growing your product.</p><p>However, if it took 18 months to reach this goal, the market would have moved on, our attitudes towards the product would have changed and maybe we would have been disillusioned. Otherwise known as the "Long, Slow, SaaS Ramp of Death"</p><p>From our experience, there are three keys to successfully bootstrapping.</p><h3 id="your-ideas-at-the-core-"><br>Your ideas at the core.</h3><p>A common mistake I often see is founders building way too much!</p><p>Building any app is hard work. If you set out to build a fully-fledged product you might never finish and more importantly, you are not getting valuable feedback from your users to help shape your product.</p><p>Setting the bar too high will also delay your launch and also make responding to feedback much harder due to a bloated codebase and feature set.</p><p>After years of building VEED, we don't even think we are at version 1.0.</p><p>We believe the best thing to do is to build your MVP and get it out into the world as soon as possible. The first version of VEED had only 4 features, Trim, Crop, Draw and Text. There was no login, no accounts, just a simple web app. Looking back, I think we made way too much, we should have launched with just a really good crop tool.</p><p>After we saw that users were responding well to your app, we started building new features that they had requested. This kickstarted our build measure learn process. So you need to find the minimum set of features that represents your idea.</p><h3 id="validate-your-ideas-fast-">Validate your ideas fast.</h3><p>When I first entered the startup world, I was under the impression that you needed a new and original idea. For many years I tried that approach with little to no success.</p><p>In my opinion, the best way to validate an idea is to look to see if this is a product people are already willing to pay for.</p><p>For example, I would feel comfortable that people are willing to pay for an email marketing tool. Why? Because Mailchimp has proven this for us!</p><p>This questions now is, how are you different or what subset of users do you believe they are undeserving?</p><p>For us at VEED, we knew people where the will to pay for video editing software (I know because I had an Adobe subscription myself). What we did differently is we just put it online and targeted, short-form content creators.</p><p>Why? Because we believe they were being underserved by legacy video editing platform. One of my fave tutors from art school once told me "An original idea is not something completely new, it just 10% different"</p><p>If it feels like you are pushing a boulder uphill and struggling to get traction, it might be time to move to the next idea. Seriously, the faster you can get to this realisation, the better. Don't let a "sunk cost" fallacy keep you working on the same idea.<br></p><h3 id="work-out-how-to-charge-for-your-product-early-on-">Work out how to charge for your product early on.</h3><p>Your funds will not last forever. We ran out of money before and had to go back to contract jobs. This ultimately set us back 6 months. To give your startup the best opportunity for success (I believe this both applies to Boostrapped &amp; VC backed startups, with some exceptions*) it has to generate revenue, a clear sign that you are creating value.</p><p>And charging for your product early on does a few things.</p><ol><li>Proves that users are willing to pay for it.</li><li>Provides you with better feedback (users care more if they are paying)</li><li>Lowers your burn rate and gets your closer to profitability.</li></ol><p>If you can't avoid writing a lot of code before you get your basic product live, you can follow the real estate showroom strategy!</p><p>When a property developer is building a new block of flats, the first thing they do is build a showroom and start selling! Then once someone is interested and buys, you can ask them what colour they want the walls and ask them what taps they would like in the bathroom.</p><p>Overall we have been laser-focused over the last 12 months. We have not gone to any conferences, pitched investors, built pointless pitch decks, entertained any partnerships. We have just been 100% focused on building VEED, learning from our users and growing the company.</p><h3 id="product">Product </h3><p>Our product development strategies are user-centric. Every user who signs up for VEED can book an on-boarding call with us. This process is time-consuming but provided incredible insight into who our users are, what they don't understand and what they need from VEED.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/IMG_20200714_174440.jpg"><figcaption>User calls every day of the week</figcaption></figure><p>We have built new features fast and scrapped useless features even quicker. Overall we have put a lot of time into UX, but I must admit consistency with the design is sometimes lacking. But that is the cost we are willing to pay to move fast.</p><p>New paid users are also prompted to let us know why they chose VEED. We have collected over 500 of these responses and use them to inform our copy and also our focus.</p><h3 id="marketing">Marketing</h3><div><p>For the first 8 months, Tim has spent all of his time building the product and I (Sabba) have spent all of my time working on marketing. Admittedly, we were shameless and scrappy and had varying levels of success.</p><p>When starting VEED we knew nothing about marketing, so we made it our full-time job to learn and execute on our findings.</p></div><figure><img src="https://ghost-veed-blog.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020/07/IMG_20200714_174857.jpg"><figcaption>58 users a day was HUGE!!!</figcaption></figure><p>For first time founders, growth and marketing are often overlooked. The majority of the time, this is because it can appear confusing and complex. Another big reason why technical founder shies away from marketing is that they feel a lot more comfortable coding a new feature because that is what they know.</p><p>You need to understand what acquisition channels are the most relevant for your startup and go deep on understanding them. The book "Traction" by Gabriel Weinberg, founder of DuckDuckGo is a great starting point.</p><p>If you would like to lean more about the exact tactics we used to grow VEED, please check an older post on how we <a href="https://www.veed.io/blog/startup-growth-no-budget/">grew to 50,000 MAU</a></p><p>As entrepreneurs, we like to believe there as a playbook and a recipe to build a successful business.</p><p>The truth is there kinda is, but one of the largest factors of a successful business is luck.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In this post I’m going to explore Simple Workflow Service (SWF) available in AWS.</p>

<p>To understand what SWF is good for, we need to first understand what a workflow is. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow">Wikipedia defines it</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In computer systems we care about the part about processing information. Some things that could be modeled as workflows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deployment pipeline</strong>: We could receive some code as input and then build it in a worker machine. We can run tests in parallel in different machines. If all tests pass we can deploy the binaries to another set of machines.</li>
  <li><strong>Coordinate shipments</strong>: A user buys a product on an online store and the order is placed on a system. A human monitors this system and takes care of finding the products in a warehouse and shipping them to the correct address. When the shipment is made, the information is entered in a system. The workflow notices this information an e-mails the user the shipping details.</li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous image processing</strong>: A system uploads files to a system for processing (let’s say, create thumbnails). A workflow uses multiple workers to execute the task. If any of the machines fails while processing a set of files, they same work can be taken over by another worker.</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>Those are some high level examples. In this post I’m going to go over one example in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<p>Before we start building a workflow, let’s learn a little about the components of an SWF:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Workflow</strong>: A set of activities, and some logic that defines how these work together to achieve some objective</li>
  <li><strong>Domain</strong>: A workflow lives in a domain. A Domain can contain multiple workflows. Workflows in different domains can’t interact</li>
  <li><strong>Execution</strong>: An instance of the workflow with its associated state</li>
  <li><strong>Event</strong>: Represents a change on the state of an execution</li>
  <li><strong>Starter</strong>: A program, or person that starts and execution</li>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong>: A type of task that needs to be performed, such as: resizing images, running tests, etc</li>
  <li><strong>Task</strong>: An invocation of an activity</li>
  <li><strong>Worker</strong>: Program that performs tasks</li>
  <li><strong>Decider</strong>: Program that defines the logic for the workflow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="machine-repair-workflow">Machine repair workflow</h2>

<p>To help us get familiar with SWF, we are going to create a workflow to model the process for fixing a broken machine in a fleet. It will look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://ncona.com/images/posts/fixing-broken-machine-workflow.png"><img src="https://ncona.com/images/posts/fixing-broken-machine-workflow.png" alt="Fixing broken machine workflow"></a></p>

<p>This workflow can be used in a datacenter that runs a lot of machines. We can have the workflow probe machines to see if they are working well. If it notices something wrong, it sets the machine state as <code>maintenance</code> in a database. If it doesn’t find anything wrong, it finishes the execution.</p>

<p>Once a machine is drained we’ll do two things. We’ll have a person take a look at the machine and fix it and we’ll take the oportunity to reimage the machine so we have clean machine when it comes back.</p>

<p>Once the repair and the reimage are done, we can set the state back to <code>available</code> and finish the execution.</p>

<h2 id="getting-ready">Getting ready</h2>

<p>For our activities and the decider, we are going to need the AWS SDK. In this section I’m going to show how to get it ready.</p>

<p>We’ll use Ruby for our examples, since it’s easy to run and it’s very well supported. The latest version of the Ruby SDK at the time of this writing is version 3. We’ll create a <code>Gemfile</code> with dependencies:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>source</span> <span>'https://rubygems.org'</span>

<span>gem</span> <span>'aws-sdk-swf'</span><span>,</span> <span>'~&gt; 1'</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then install them using:</p>



<p>The AWS SDK will need to communicate with AWS, so we’ll need some credentials, these credentials can be set in environment variables like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>export </span><span>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>=</span>&lt;your key <span>id</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>export </span><span>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span>=</span>&lt;your secret&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p>Each of the boxes in the diagram above is an <code>activity</code>. Activities can be pretty self contained, so we’ll start building those.</p>

<p>An activity works by polling the workflow for pending tasks. If it finds that there is a task it can perform, it does so, and returns a result back. Polling then continues until there is more work to do.</p>

<p>Our activities will share some code with the decider, so let’s create a base class that will be shared between them (<code>workflow_base.rb</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

    <span>begin</span>
      <span>swf</span><span>.</span><span>register_domain</span><span>({</span>
        <span>name: </span><span>domain_name</span><span>,</span>
        <span>workflow_execution_retention_period_in_days: </span><span>'3'</span>
      <span>})</span>
      <span>puts</span> <span>"Domain </span><span>#{</span><span>domain_name</span><span>}</span><span> registered"</span>
    <span>rescue</span> <span>Aws</span><span>::</span><span>SWF</span><span>::</span><span>Errors</span><span>::</span><span>DomainAlreadyExistsFault</span>
      <span>puts</span> <span>"Domain </span><span>#{</span><span>domain_name</span><span>}</span><span> already exists"</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This class defines some constants that are shared between the decider and activities. It also initializes the SWF client and register the domain if it doesn’t yet exist.</p>

<p>Because of the way SWF works, it is best if the code for all our activities is handled by a single program. This program will poll for any new tasks in the domain. Every time it sees a task it will execute it and send the result back to SWF. Because each task is blocking, we could spin many copies of this program to allow tasks to be executed in parallel if we wanted to.</p>

To explore <span>and</span> mine Reddit<span>,</span> we need a way to access <span>all</span> of its exposed data<span>,</span> such <span>as</span> submissions<span>,</span> comments <span>and</span> users' information<span>.</span> The more brutal <span>and</span> straightforward way obviously <span>is</span> that of scrape the website itself<span>.</span> In particular<span>,</span> scraping Reddit would require a scraper<span>,</span> that <span>is</span> a software which should request one <span>or</span> more webpages<span>,</span> parse them <span>and</span> extract the information of interest<span>.</span> However<span>,</span> this <span>is</span> marginally doable <span>and</span> there are cases <span>in</span> which scraping a website would violate the Term of Service <span>(</span>ToS<span>)</span> of the website itself<span>.</span> Thus<span>,</span> we surely need another way to do it<span>.</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Measuring the similarity between vectors or arrays is a calculation that we encounter often while developing recommendation systems or other machine learning models. This often involves performing similarity searches on entire datasets that can be computationally expensive. For systems that require such calculations to happen online in real-time, this can be a major issue and is something we often have to deal with at Caboom.</p><p><br>Luckily, we are not the only ones faced with this problem and there are open-source libraries like <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss">FAISS</a> that have been developed to solve this exact problem by the Facebook AI Research team.</p><p>‍</p><p>FAISS or <strong>F</strong>acebook <strong>AI</strong> <strong>S</strong>imilarity <strong>S</strong>earch is a library written in the C++ language with GPU support. It also has Python bindings so that it can be used with Numpy, Pandas, and other Python-based libraries. Its algorithmic enhancements that vastly narrow down the search space for a vector's k-nearest neighbors allow it to have much faster similarity search between vectors as compared to existing libraries like Scikit Learn. This technique is called Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) search, and sacrifices some precision to obtain the vast speedups.&nbsp;</p><p>Compared to other ANN libraries FAISS implements various vector compression, partitioning, and indexing techniques, especially by making use of the parallelism enabled by GPUs to make similarity search lookups more efficient. We will mostly be focusing on its indexing features and how that leads to fast similarity search in recommender systems. There are several other methods and optimizations in FAISS which can’t be covered by this blog alone. For a detailed overview of how its internal mechanism works, different&nbsp; and the previous work it builds upon please refer <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki">here</a>.</p><p>To show the speed gains obtained from using FAISS, we did a comparison of bulk cosine similarity calculation between the FlatL2 and IVFFlat indexes in FAISS and the brute-force similarity search used by one of the most popular Python machine learning frameworks Scikit-learn.&nbsp;</p><p>A dataset of 20k movies was used for this comparison, with the similarity search performed on vectors obtained from the various genres of the movie.The task was to select the top 10 most similar movies for each of the 20k movies from a candidate pool ranging from 0 to 1000 movies. </p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-0ec5b7e06d99-2fefdd35"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0c174333f77039795e2d8a_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-13%20at%2013.56.15.png" alt="Speed comparison between two FAISS indexes"></p></figure><figure id="w-node-cf497c7d8071-2fefdd35"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0c17886b4272e3e7bd2790_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-13%20at%2013.56.35.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As seen from the plots above, the time taken to perform the similarity search increases linearly for Scikit-learn to a few seconds, while that for the Flat index based search is an order of magnitude faster.&nbsp;</p><h2>Basic Indexes</h2><p>As stated above the main strength of FAISS is the speed with which it can perform similarity searches on billions of vectors at the cost of some precision. This is possible because of the implementation of indexes in FAISS that the whole package is optimized for. These indexes store a set of vectors and provide search functions in these sets with various vector comparison algorithms. One good way of understanding them is to think of them like the indexes used in databases to make queries faster.&nbsp;</p><p>We will now go through an example implementation of creating a FAISS index.&nbsp;</p><h3>Flat Index</h3><p>The simplest implementation of the index in FAISS is the <strong>IndexFlatL2 index</strong>. It is an exact search index that encodes the vectors into fixed-size codes. As the name suggests it is an index that compares the L2 (euclidean) distance between vectors and returns the top-k similar vectors. During the search, all the indexed vectors are decoded sequentially, and compared to the vector whose nearest neighbors we are being calculated. This vector is also called the <strong>query vector</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is different from how similarity search is done in libraries like Scikit-learn, as we have to choose the kind of similarity we are measuring and select the index accordingly. FAISS also optimizes how the index vectors are stored in memory or disk by using a tree data structure that hugely improves the search time.</p><p>The following code shows the process of defining the index vector size, initiating the IndexFlatL2 index, adding vectors to the index and saving the index into disk.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8a67e212a15625c1ca46_Image1.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>We can reuse the saved index later for searching a vector's nearest neighbors. The following code snippet shows how to load the index and perform nearest neighbor search on it.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8a7a898b077ff2c73e44_image%202.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Output:<br>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8a87898b072b2ac73e45_image%203.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>The output shows the resulting indexes and distances for the first five vectors of an index. In the second “distances” matrix we can see that the vectors have their nearest neighbors at the beginning of the array row, with a distance of 0 with itself and increasing in value as we move towards the end.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing to remember is that in this case the index of the arrays is set automatically by FAISS in increasing order like the "auto_increment" column in SQL databases. It is advisable to use either a mapper with FAISS to real indexes or use a FAISS provided index setting which will come up further along.</p><h3>Cosine Similarity Measurement</h3><p>Although calculating Euclidean distance for vector similarity search is quite common, in many cases <strong>cosine similarity</strong> is preferred. In FAISS we don't have a cosine similarity method but we do have indexes that calculate the inner or dot product between vectors. For example, the <strong>IndexFlatIP</strong> <strong>index</strong>. We can then take advantage of the fact that cosine similarity is simply the dot product between normalized vectors.&nbsp;</p><p>The code snippet below shows how this can be implemented. Partition-based Index</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8aa4dd31940e941cddbd_image%204.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Another class of indexes in FAISS are partition-based indexes that speed up searches by partitioning the index into clusters and limiting the search to only a few clusters. This method however is not exact as there is no guarantee that the nearest neighbors will be in the clusters searched in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>An example of an index that uses partitioning techniques to make the search space a lot less and far more efficient is <strong>IndexIVFFlat index</strong>.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8aaf04e10128d6d54b3c_image%205.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The search operation can be carried out in the same way as earlier indexes. However, in the IVFFlat index we define the “nprobe” hyperparameter to limit the search to only the defined number of clusters nearest to the query vector. This is also an example of how different indexes can be compounded to form a single index.</p><h3>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h3><p>We’ve looked at the use cases for some of the basic algorithms in FAISS. This section looks at a method called PCA. It is an algorithm that is popular in unsupervised machine learning that is used to reduce the vector dimensions using <strong>Principal Components</strong> of the vector space.</p><p>In FAISS, PCA is generally followed by indexes like IndexFlatL2 or IndexIVFFlat and they are linked with the help of the <strong>IndexPreTransform</strong> function.&nbsp;One requirement of this method is that the dimension of a vector needs to be a multiple of 4.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8ab9ec95620e8410fb11_image%206.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Dimension Remapping</h3><p>PCA allows us to reduce the dimensions but what if we want to increase the dimensionality of the vectors? We may encounter this scenario if we want to use an IndexIVFFlat index for instance. In this case, the dimensionality should ideally be a multiple of 4. FAISS allows us to do this through the <strong>RemapDimensionTransform </strong>method.As an example, let us suppose we have a vector of size 150 that we need to use with an IndexIVFFlat index. The way we transform this to a size that is a multiple of 4 (152) is given below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f0d8ac81fd412abe2e2dab8_image%207.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><div><p>What next?This brings us to the end of Part 1 of this discussion on using the FAISS library from Facebook. Here we looked at the speedup it provides when compared to the similar methods used in Scikit-learn, and how FAISS optimizes this through various indexes. In Part 2 we will go beyond the basic indexing methods and look at more advanced versions. We will also look at the GPU support in FAISS, and how to make the calculations even faster by leveraging them.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>]]>

<ul><li>Stay updated on the latest news from Hungary by signing up for the free InsightHungary newsletter:</li></ul><p>Vice President of the European Commission for Values and Transparency Věra Jourová sent a <a href="https://index.hu/kultur/media/2020/07/07/aggodik_az_index_fuggetlensegeert_az_europai_bizottsag_alelnoke/">letter</a> on July 7 to Index.hu, Hungary’s largest online news portal, expressing her solidarity with its staff which she said “has been working under very difficult conditions”.<br></p><p>Jourová wrote that while media revenues have been heavily hit by the coronavirus pandemic, “economic pressure should not turn into political pressure...I have been following the situation of Index with concern. What you are doing, the values you are fighting for, media freedom and pluralism, are essential for democracy.”</p><p>The letter came amid what Index considered a fight for its existence. In late June, an urgent <a href="https://index.hu/english/2020/06/21/independence_of_index_in_danger_hungary_press_freedom_media/">public statement</a> signed by around 100 editors and journalists raised the alarm that the site's independence had come under attack, and that the outlet was in "grave danger".&nbsp;</p><p>To many observers of Hungary's media environment, the news came as little surprise. It was widely considered only a matter of time before the outlet faced attacks on its editorial independence, an expectation engendered by years of other Hungarian websites, newspapers, television networks and radio stations being shuttered or suddenly transformed under political and financial pressure.</p><p>This year, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which has described the level of media control in Hungary as "unprecedented" in the European Union, <a href="https://rsf.org/en/hungary">ranked </a>the country 89th in the world for media freedom, down 33 places from when the organization began its rankings in 2013. Additionally, the U.S.-based non governmental organization <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/hungary/freedom-world/2020">Freedom House</a> gave Hungary a score of two out of four for media freedom and plurality this year.</p><p>Despite this media environment and a perpetual struggle to preserve its independence, Index has, somewhat paradoxically, managed to remain the <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-06/DNR_2020_FINAL.pdf">most-read and one of the most trusted news sources in Hungary</a>&nbsp;for the past 20 years. It has maintained its critical reporting even as government-tied businesspeople were embedded in its ownership structure, and has walked a tightrope between its journalistic principles and a deep uncertainty over when, and how, they might be curtailed.</p><p>This constant vulnerability, and the ways Index’s newsroom has successfully struggled to retain its independence while so many other Hungarian outlets could not, are illustrative of the broader mechanisms that have undermined media plurality and freedom in Hungary for the past decade.</p><h2>“Index Is In Danger”</h2><p>Two years ago, staff at the outlet established an <a href="https://szabadindex.eu/">online independence barometer</a>, a means of directly addressing readers on the status of Index's editorial independence. The barometer was set up after a government-tied figure purchased a stake in the company that controls Index’s revenue stream, and was emblematic of the perceived inevitability of an attack on the site. At the time, a <a href="https://index.hu/english/2018/09/18/index_independence_press_freedom/">letter to readers</a> said that staff felt they were “stuck on the frontline of a world war. Sometimes it’s the Red Army, sometimes it’s the Wehrmacht that marches over us.”<br></p><p>For the two years since its inception, the barometer read “Independent”. But on June 21, for the first time, staff moved the dial to "In Danger".</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--axVjxGbd--/7T9PtAkyhooMBj7ps.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

</svg><span>Index's "independence barometer"</span><span>Fotó: index.hu</span></figcaption></figure><p>The change came after a series of board meetings of Index’s parent foundation, where a recommendation was made by an outside advisor to break up the site and outsource its content creation to external, newly-formed companies.<br></p><p>The proposal, ostensibly a response to economic pressure caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alarmed several members of the board of directors, including editor-in-chief Szabolcs Dull and CEO András Pusztay. In a <a href="https://index.hu/english/2020/06/21/independence_of_index_in_danger_hungary_press_freedom_media/">statement</a>, Dull wrote that Index was “under such external pressure that could spell out the end of our editorial staff as we know it. We are concerned that with the proposed organisational overhaul, we will lose those values that made Index.hu the biggest and most-read news site in Hungary.”<br></p><p>When news of the proposal leaked in the media, Dull was suspended from the board of directors. A few days later, Pusztay resigned as CEO, saying he could not in good conscience carry out the orders which had been placed on him. Since then, the newly-appointed CEO <a href="https://index.hu/kultur/media/2020/06/30/lemondott_az_index_vezerigazgatoja_zodi_zsolt/">resigned</a> after less than a week on the job, and another <a href="https://index.hu/english/2020/07/07/index_indamedia_hungary_press_freedom_editor_in_chief_advisor/">external advisor</a> has <a href="https://444.hu/2020/07/07/az-indamedia-tanacsadoja-az-index-foszerkesztojenek-levaltasat-surgeti">recommended Dull’s removal</a> as editor-in-chief.</p><p>These disruptive events and proposals by government-tied advisors alarmed Dull, Pusztay and many staff members on their own merits, but the circumstances’ similarities to earlier takeovers of critical media outlets likely added fuel to their suspicions. The events at Index, and some of the actors involved, fit a pattern going back years that illustrates a cohesive strategy for building a media environment that can be managed from the highest levels of political power.</p><h2>The Usual Suspects</h2><p>In March, an influential figure in pro-government media enterprises purchased a 50 percent stake in Indamedia, the company which controls all of Index's revenue streams and has exclusive rights to manage its advertising. The arrival of Miklós Vaszily in Index’s innermost circumference caused new concerns that government-tied figures were closing in on the outlet, evoking alarming memories of an earlier event involving Vaszily that sent shockwaves through the Hungarian media market.</p><p>In 2014, Vaszily oversaw the <a href="https://444.hu/2014/06/05/deutsche-telekom-hungarian-government-collude-to-silence-independent-media">dramatic takeover</a> of Hungary’s then-largest online news outlet Origo, where he served as CEO. Origo’s reporting on cases of corruption within the government, especially concerning two high-level ministers from the governing Fidesz party, reportedly angered party officials and led to political pressure being placed on the outlet’s parent company.&nbsp;</p><p>Vaszily is widely thought to have acted on the government’s behalf to facilitate changes at Origo that resulted in the <a href="https://444.hu/2014/06/02/varatlanul-kirugtak-az-origo-foszerkesztojet/">dismissal of the site’s editor-in-chief</a> and the <a href="https://444.hu/2014/06/04/petho-andras-a-lazar-utazasairol-szolo-cikk-szerzoje-felmond-az-origonal/">resignation</a> of more than 30 journalists over what they considered a pro-government shift in editorial direction. Once a producer of quality investigative journalism and reportage, Origo is now considered by many to be a government mouthpiece.</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--RGLOgiES--/6rMVTtlrB1zC1F5pJs.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

</svg><span>Miklós Vaszily (center), the joint owner of Indamedia.</span><span>Fotó: Koszticsák Szilárd</span></figcaption></figure><p>Following the takeover of Origo, Vaszily quickly rose through the ranks of government-tied media. He was appointed CEO of Hungary's public broadcasting organization MTVA (itself deeply loyal to the Fidesz-led government), and later became the CEO of Echo TV and the chairman of TV2, both owned by Lőrinc Mészáros, an oligarch and personal childhood friend of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. According to <a href="https://tldr.444.hu/2020/07/02/csendben-fojtana-meg-az-indexet-a-kormany-de-a-szerkesztoseg-nem-hagyja-magat">reporting by 444’s Pál Dániel Rényi</a>, Vaszily is known to have connections with the highest levels of government, and meets personally with Mr. Orbán to discuss important issues.<br></p><p>His important role in the government-tied media landscape and involvement in the Origo affair made Vaszily’s entrance in the ownership structure of Index seem to portend a future for the outlet which could echo Origo’s fate.&nbsp;</p><p>Origo’s 180-degree turn serves as a template for how government loyalists have repurposed critical media in the service of political interests. Often, rather than hostile legislation or direct intervention being used to transform an outlet, changes in ownership and financial pressure have been applied to indirectly shift outlets’ editorial direction, insulating the government from direct involvement. Financial "reforms" are thus used to justify takeovers under the banner of simple commercial efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>These same arguments are now being used to account for changes at Index: Vaszily has <a href="https://tldr.444.hu/2020/07/02/csendben-fojtana-meg-az-indexet-a-kormany-de-a-szerkesztoseg-nem-hagyja-magat">denied</a> he intends to muzzle the outlet, but insists economic problems must be addressed – despite the site’s position as the leader on the Hungarian media market.&nbsp;</p><p>Undermining media independence using financial “reforms” is a model that has been frequently used since 2010, although more aggressive methods including outright closure have also been employed. In 2016, Hungary's most-read daily newspaper Népszabadság was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/world/europe/hungary-newspaper-nepszabadsag.html">suddenly shut down</a> following the acquisition of the paper’s publisher by an Austrian businessman with ties to Fidesz. Staff arrived one morning to find they had been locked out of the building, and could access neither their company email accounts nor the paper’s website. The closure, which staff described as a “coup”, made international headlines and resulted in a wave of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/09/protests-in-hungary-at-closure-of-main-leftwing-opposition-newspaper">street protests</a> for media freedom, but the paper’s publisher insisted the decision was purely economic, and that the paper had been struggling financially.</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--MT582P6T--/6vATDH0v0K1lghSTs.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

</svg><span>A protester holds a copy of Népszabadság at a protest against the paper's closure.</span><span>Fotó: Zoltan Tuba.www.tubazoltan.com</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another means for seizing control of the media has been the generous use of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398?fbclid=IwAR0dDqMkZUlLipK1vS_QqWTEN1qm99Iupb4qde-vj1IW4BVx8kW9vv1LLDE&amp;">government advertising</a> in friendly publications and the withholding of ads in critical ones, heavily distorting the media market and putting financial pressure on independent outlets. Nearly 90 percent of ad revenues in the Fidesz-tied newspaper Magyar Idők came from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2019.1662398#F0002">ads paid for by the government</a> in 2017, compared with 3 percent in the conservative Magyar Nemzet (which was government-critical at the time but has since been recaptured). According to editor-in-chief Dull, Index receives practically none of its ad revenue from the government.<br></p><p>Such methods for media control, which have now become commonplace, first began with Fidesz’s entrance to power in 2010, and represented a dramatic interruption of some 20 years of relative balance and development in Hungary’s media market following the collapse of socialism in 1990.</p><h2>Paradise Lost</h2><p>At the time of Index’s founding in the late 1990s, Hungary was entering a period of hopeful optimism following a decade of uncertainty and economic decay that came after what Hungarians call “the system change”, the country’s democratic transition after 1989. The internet was just taking off in the country, and for many, Index was symbolic …</p></article></div></div>

There were secondary goals such as improving the testing infrastructure, setting up CI/CD, estimating progress and allowing the computation to be paused and resumed.</p><p>Forewarning: I have essentially zero domain knowledge in this project (and fluid dynamics simulation isn’t exactly the kind of topic you can catch up to research level on over a weekend) so I approached this project from a purely software engineering perspective. As for my Rust experience, I’ve been using it for personal projects since ~2016 and I worked as a Rust software engineer at a startup in Berlin for a year after leaving high school.</p><h2 id="dont-rewrite">Don’t Rewrite</h2><p><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">Don’t.</a></p><p><a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/avoid-rewriting-a-legacy-system-from-scratch-by-strangling-it/">Rewrite.</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-i-failed-to-deal-with-legacy-code-8e123cff5bce">Legacy.</a></p><p><a href="https://daedtech.com/the-myth-of-the-software-rewrite/">Code.</a></p><p>Not too hard a concept to grasp, is it? Not much ambiguity and a clear line of reasoning to follow as to why legacy software should not be rewritten. Well I read the articles written by people far more experienced and knowledgable than myself and thought:</p><p><img src="https://mckeogh.tech/post/shallow-water/0e1.png" alt="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read"></p><h2 id="why-my-situation-is-different">Why <em>My</em> Situation is Different</h2><p>All jokes aside, there are situations where a re-implementation is a reasonable option and I did have several factors to back me up.</p><p>FORTRAN is undoubtably <em>very</em> fast and highly suited to HPC problems with decades-optimised compilers and debugging tooling but it does lack certain features, namely memory safety, thread safety, data race guarantees and ergonomic GPU/CLI/TUI libraries.</p><p>Having written parallel software in both C and Rust, the memory safety guarantees and easy parallelisation with Rayon offered by Rust contrasts quite sharply with my poor experience using OpenMP. Replacing <code>.iter()</code> with <code>.par_iter()</code> and having the compiler automatically throw errors for any code that isn’t thread safe is amazing compared with adding OpenMP directive sentinels (designed to be hidden from a non OpenMP-compliant FORTRAN compiler) and manually determining thread and memory safety. Here seems a good a place as any to mention that <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/16/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/">“~70% of the vulnerabilities Microsoft assigns a CVE each year continue to be memory safety issues”</a>.</p><p>It was believed initially that GPUs could be used to accelerate the computation, ~another place where Rust’s (while not mature) ecosystem also shines above those offered for FORTRAN~ EDIT: completely untrue, FORTRAN’s GPU acceleratin libraries are very mature and production ready. Additionally when it came to the additional requirements building a <code>ncurses</code> interface in FORTRAN isn’t exactly ergonomic compared with the libraries available in Rust. I spent some time reading through the original implementation and attempted some basic parallelisation with little success due to small errors being hard to diagnose across long executions without snapshot testing across multiple modules.</p><p>Not only was there several “pull” factors, but there was also the absence of the typical reasons you shouldn’t rewrite: I was working as a one-person team, the software was finalised and so never needed to be modified again, it was relatively small so could be rewritten in a matter of months (part time) and is not a live business component so uptime and upkeep of the original implementation are irrelevant.</p><p>Given all of this I decided it would be faster to rewrite in Rust, then be able parallelise it and add features quickly than it would be to plough through with the FORTRAN, and with a go-ahead from my supervisor I got to work.</p><h2 id="translating-fortran-to-rust">Translating FORTRAN to Rust</h2><p><em>Relatively</em> straightforward translation of existing codebases in compiled languages to Rust is a noted benefit due to the combination of software like <a href="https://c2rust.com/">C2Rust</a> to perform automatic translation of C source into Rust, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen">bindgen</a> for automatically generating FFI bindings and of Cargo’s ability to compile code in other languages as part of a Rust project. While there are plenty examples of large projects successfully migrating to Rust this way, the issue I faced was that it would have required a two-step process, first translating from FORTRAN to C and then from C to Rust. I assumed the likelihood that the resulting code would be remotely parsable was very low and I couldn’t even get either of the most popular FORTRAN to C conversion tools to work.</p><p>Since the original implementation was only 6,000 lines total I decided to go with a manual translation. This involved starting at the base of the module tree with the Fast Fourier Transform routines and working upwards. I kept my process simple by inserting small pieces of FORTRAN to dump state at the beginning and end of routines which was then used for snapshot tests for the Rust implementation. This resulted in a thorough, robust testing suite which was invaluble during the optimization period. I really only made one bad design decision (please don’t read through the git history to confirm this 😅) during the translation phase which was thinking that nested <code>Vec</code>s would be easier than using <code>ndarray</code> from the start. This was a Bad Decision™️ and wasted so much time, not only in the abysmal execution speeds slowing down <code>cargo test</code>, but also in that it significantly increased development time. I would replace a statement such as</p><p>with</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Awful, awful Rust
</span><span></span><span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..x {
	<span>for</span> j <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..y {
		a[i][j] <span>=</span> a[i][j] <span>*</span> b[i][j]
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>when the final <code>ndarray</code> version would look like</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Ergonomic Rust
</span><span></span>a <span>*=</span> <span>&amp;</span>b;
</code></pre></div><p>Clearly the intermediary step could have been skipped and a more direct translation was possible. I wrote a regex to replace FORTRAN array indexing syntax (<code>array(x,y,z)</code>) to nested <code>Vec</code>s in Rust (<code>array[x][y][z]</code>), when <code>ndarray</code> syntax (<code>array[[x,y,z]]</code>) would have been a far simpler conversion. If this decision wasn’t bad enough, I also wasted time writing several functions to convert between a byte slice and the nested <code>Vec</code>s with the FORTRAN memory layout when <code>ndarray</code> has a built-in preset for FORTRAN shape and strides.</p><p>One issue that arose during testing was that due to the accumulation of small errors in floating point math, results would be slightly different between operating systems and hardware configurations which made the fantastic snapshot testing tool <code>insta</code> unsuitable. Instead <code>ndarray</code>’s <code>serde</code> and <code>approx</code> feature flags are used to read serialised arrays from disk to compare approximately during tests which has been working well.</p><h2 id="optimizing">Optimizing</h2><h3 id="parallelisation">Parallelisation</h3><p>Fundamentally the problem is not one that may be described as “embarrassingly parallel”, which was the assumption made going into the project (early discussions involved expectations of a 100x improvement on the university cluster). Ideally we would be want many large chunks of independent computation operating on a small amount of data, making it easy to distribute work across threads, GPUs and potentially different machines, but unfortunately I learned this problem is quite far from that ideal.</p><p>The outermost loop advances through time and is therefore strictly sequential, and in the primary function of the program (<code>src/nhswps/advance.rs:advance</code>) a large portion is iterated over twice, also strictly sequential. Some other lower-level functions perform operations on individual layers and so can be parallelised completely, but these are not generally very complex functions and so finish quickly before returning to sequential execution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> comes into affect here, describing how even if everything that can be parallelised is, there are fundamental limits to the scaling we can ever achieve.</p><h3 id="memory-bandwidth-issues">Memory Bandwidth Issues</h3><p>Throughout the program there are several kinds of operations being performed on the 2- and 3-dimensional arrays. Transformations between physical and spectral is common, involving calling the Fourier transform functions and swapping axes. Other than those, many operations are simple additions, subtractions and multiplications between arrays, sometimes including constants. The result of this is that these simple operations are being performed on some very large amounts of data which I believe is resulting in a memory bandwidth bottleneck. This hypothesis explains why SIMD did not improve performance and performance is not significantly improved by parallelisation. It only takes several cycles to perform a floating point ADD or MUL instruction, so even at tens of gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth it will be insufficient to keep the CPU “fed”. Performing the operations with AVX-2 instructions does not improve performance because even though the same operation may now be performed on several floats simultaneously the limit is still how quickly they may be read from memory. It is slightly more complicated in the multithreaded context because there is an improvement in performance; perhaps due to multiple threads being able to increase the amount of data read from memory. The program is also very cache-unfriendly, reading large amounts of data in only to perform a simple, fast operation before reading in new data. At several gigabytes in size even individual layers aren’t even close to being able to reside in on-die cache. I am unsure of how I might collect proof of my hypothesis but I believe it explains a great deal of the behaviours I’ve witnessed throughout this project.</p><h3 id="gpu-unsuitability">GPU Unsuitability</h3><p>There was also some hope at the beginning of the project that GPUs could be used but there are two main reasons they are unsuitable.</p><p>Firstly, ~GPUs with large amounts of VRAM (128GB+) simply aren’t available~ EDIT: I was wrong, <em>commercial</em> gaming and workstation GPUs don’t get that large, but there are plenty of datacentre options, like the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/announcing-google-cloud-a2-vm-family-based-on-nvidia-a100-gpu">A100</a>. There is the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/professional-graphics/radeon-pro-ssg">Radeon Pro SSG</a> which is a really interesting product but the memory bandwidth of …</p></article></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-8890"><div><div><div><p>VK social networking website and Telegram messenger App founder and developer, Pavel Durov wants Apple to let iPhone users install different App stores other than Apple App Store. Not only that, but he also wants legislation to make this happen.</p><p>Speaking at the panel discussion with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and representatives of the IT industry in Innopolis, Telegram Manager and Vice President, Ilya Perekopsky said that Apple and Google are holding back the development of startups by charging a tax of 30 percent commission from app developers. Immediately after Perekopsky’s speech,&nbsp;Durov published an article in which he called for legislation mandating Apple to be legally obliged to allow users to install an alternative App Store on the iPhone. Durov says that Tim Cook, Apple CEO should be obligated to this at the legislative level.</p><p>Durov is taking the bull by its horn. Apple has been successful because of its closed technology. It not only does not allow any other App store to be installed on iPhones but it also takes action against any iPhone jailbreaks that happen. We all know that the <a href="https://androidrookies.com/unc0ver-jailbreak-tool-for-iphone-released-works-on-all-ios-versions-including-ios-13-5/">uc0ver team released a jailbreak</a> exploiting the previously unknown vulnerability in iOS just hours after Apple released iOS 13.5. The <a href="https://androidrookies.com/kernel-vulnerability-unc0ver-jailbreak-patched-as-apple-releases-ios-13-5-1/">iPhone jailbreak was shut down in iOS 13.5.1</a> within days by Apple. Many private iPhone App stores exist like Cydia, Xabsi, etc but they work only on jailbroken iPhones.</p><p>Much of Apple’s profit is from selling content on its App stores. In fact, Apple’s App Store platform grossed around $50 billion for App store in 2019, according to an analysis by CNBC. Apple takes 30 percent commission from App developers to make their apps available on Apple Store. Last year it paid $35 billion to developers from the App store revenue and kept $15 billion for itself.</p><p>Durov has reasons for being mad at Apple for not allowing other App stores. Durov says that Russian startups fail to make money by paying 30% to Apple. “Preventing two supranational corporations from collecting taxes from all of humanity is not an easy task. Corporations employ thousands of lobbyists, lawyers, and PR agents, and their budgets are unlimited. At the same time, app developers are scattered and scared, as the fate of their projects depends entirely on the favor of Apple and Google,” wrote Pavel Durov.</p><p>Durov also has a personal bias for wanting Apple to open up its iOS for alternative App stores. In 2016, Apple banned the Telegram team from launching its own game platform. This hurt Durov and Telegram’s ambitions, “We had to remove the telegram games catalog that we had already created and almost the entire platform interface, otherwise Apple threatened to remove Telegram from the AppStore.”</p><p>Recently, <a href="https://androidrookies.com/apple-threatens-to-remove-hey-com-email-app-unless-it-pays-outrageous-cuts-to-them/">email client, Hey.com</a> had a similar experience with Apple regarding publishing their App on the Apple App store.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_1570553">
    
      <div><p>What this essay does is that it introduces a brand new education system. This education system is way more effective than the current education system we have in place. And unlike the current education system, which has been the same for a long time. This one is constantly getting better with time and data, thanks to AI.<br></p><p>The best thing about it is that it's totally free of cost. So anyone in the world with access to a basic smartphone+Internet can access Education 2.0. Meaning, now everyone has the same educational opportunities as a Harvard/Stanford student.<br></p><p>You see, education is the most fundamental thing to human progress. And once you deploy something like Education 2.0 on a global scale, it will have huge positive implications on economic growth, life quality, and human progress. And to emphasise what I just said, the collective intelligence of humanity is the best predictor of future progress.Â&nbsp;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#education-outcomes-predict-economic-growth" target="_blank">Here</a>Â&nbsp;is some empirical data to prove this statement. Nevertheless, you don't need empirical evidence; look around, education is what drives societal growth.<br></p><p>Looking at the current education system we have in place. It would be unfair to say that it hasn't done an excellent job in aiding human progress. Resolving the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Apollo Program, the iPhone, Tesla, SpaceX, the Internet, All of Science etc. are a prime example.<br></p><p>But it certainly hasn't been able to keep up with the growing human population, and the challenges raised by it. Looking at all the pressing issues, we face today like global poverty, climate change, and war. The incapability of civilisation to solve these problems stems from the fact that it's not educated enough as a whole. There is conclusive evidence to prove this â€”Â&nbsp;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-education#social-returns-to-education" target="_blank">Education correlates with prosocial behaviour</a>. Prosocial behaviour is behaviour, which affects society as a whole.<br></p><p>So the best way to ensure that we progress into a brighter future is by rewiring the current education system. So it can keep up with the ever-growing population and the challenges we face, which will then eventually increase the collective wisdom and prosocial behaviour of humans at a much faster rate.<br></p><p>There are 3 main issues with the current education system, which dramatically lowers its potential.<br></p><ol>
<li>Its inability to reach a large population of the world.</li>
<li>The unequal distribution of resources.</li>
<li>The low efficacy of the current learning environments (i.e. lectures/books).</li>
</ol><p>And Education 2.0 fixes all of these issues.<br></p><p><strong><u>No access to education</u></strong></p><p>The biggest problem with the current education system is that it's unable to reach an unfairly enormous number of the global population. People say that education is a human right, but looking at the current situation â€” that doesn't seem so.</p><p>According to Humanium.org,Â&nbsp;<strong>72 million</strong>Â&nbsp;children of primary education age are not in school, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>759 million</strong>Â&nbsp;adults are illiterate.<strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>And we haven't even considered the inconsistency in educational outcomes yet.<br></p><p>Now I would like to explain the enormous implications this has on the economy. But first, I would like toÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/correlation-between-mean-years-of-schooling-and-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank">establish a conclusive link between Education and GDP per capita</a>.<br></p><p>Now doing the math:<br></p><ul><li>
<strong>$18,381</strong>Â&nbsp;is the global average GDP per capita (a measure of economic output per person), and we haveÂ&nbsp;<strong>831 million peopleÂ&nbsp;</strong>with no access to education at all.</li></ul><ul><li>
<strong>831 million people * $18,381 ~ $15 Trillion</strong>Â&nbsp;worth of economic output wasted. And it has a growth rate of ~<strong>Â&nbsp;1.8% per year</strong>Â&nbsp;(Taking into account the growth rates of global GDP &amp; global population).</li></ul><ul><li>To put this number in perspective, this is more than the GDP of<strong>Â&nbsp;China</strong>,Â&nbsp;<strong>India,</strong>Â&nbsp;andÂ&nbsp;<strong>the UK</strong>Â&nbsp;separately, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>$5 TrillionÂ&nbsp;</strong>less than the USA.</li></ul><p>There is no doubt that the current model of the education system is responsible for this issue. An education system is basically a collection of what we call "learning environment.". And a learning environment is an environment where learning takes place (i.e. classroom).</p><p>You see, the major problem with the current system is the high relative cost of setting up that learning environment (i.e. a classroom with qualified teachers, furniture, and students, etc.). So when you scale the education system, the setup + maintenance costs increase with it. And some countries just don't have the resources to scale. This can be due to many factors like large population, not enough teachers, etc. All of these issues then boil down to one primary issue â€” lack of economic resources, aka no money.</p><p>Scaling requires huge costs, which then dramatically lowers the potential for impact. Due to which, a significant amount of people in the world don't have access to basic education.</p><p>To beat this issue, what we need to do is switch to a new model of the education system. One which can scale cheaply and effectively. The best way to do this is by moving to a more digitalised education system.</p><p>One way to go about doing this is by leveraging Software, AI, and low-cost smartphones. Software and AI can be leveraged to create digital learning environments, which are more effective than the current learning environments we have, and its efficacy improves with time &amp; data. These AI-taught lessons will be way better than attending a Stanford/Harvard lecture.<br>
</p><p>Once this works, the next thing to do is to ensure it supports low-cost smartphones, which will then allow for distribution at an enormous scale, while keeping the costs minimal. This will go a really long way in closing the educational gap. The best thing is that now anyone in the world will be able to have the same educational opportunities as an Ivy-League student.</p><p>In the long-term, you will see substantial positive implications on collective prosocial behaviour, economy, and quality of life. And redundancy in the current education system.<br>
</p><p><strong><u>Unequal distribution of educational resources</u></strong><br>
</p><p>First, we looked at inequality in terms of access to education. Now, we're going to look at inequality inside the people with access to education (in terms of the quality of educational resources). Turns out that this has huge negative implications on the overall learning outcome of the education system.</p><p>It is implausible to sustain the quality of educational resources (e.g. teachers, books, etc.) as you scale (make it available for a larger population) the education system. Due to which, a major side-effect of scaling is that it induces a widely unequal distribution of educational resources, which varies by economic demographic. Which then leads to variation in educational outcomes.</p><p>This is why the number of high-school graduates who attend prestigious colleges tends to be higher in private high-schools, relative to a public high-schools. The quality &amp; quantity of educational resources (quality of teachers, study material, support, etc.) available to students at the private school is more elevated. Which then leads to higher success.Â&nbsp;<br></p><p>Inequality in educational resources leads to a variation in educational outcomes, which then lowers the average output of the education system.</p><p>Now, coming around to solve this issue. We need to create a system where the quality of educational resources is the best on earth. And it's available to everyone, no matter their economic situation. And finally, as it scales, its overall effectiveness doesn't reduce.Â&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><u>Low efficacy of current learning environments</u></strong></p><p>The final issue I would like to talk about is regarding the teaching methods used currently. Teaching methods are ways in which teachers teach the student. Â&nbsp;<br></p><p>The problem is that the current teaching methods, which are used around the world, are scientifically flawed. This then makes the process of learning inefficient and ineffective. And on a large scale, it reduces the learning output (the product of learning) of the education system.<br></p><p>You might think that sitting in a classroom, while a teacher speaks out everything, and you note it down is an excellent way to learn. But in fact, this method is flawed. The reason it's flawed because it bears no consideration whatsoever to how our brain operates during learning. Due to which, the conversion rate from auditory + visual perception to long-term memory is low. This dramatically lowers the learning potential of the student.<br></p><p>The modern K-12 education system was established back in the 19th century to prepare the population to participate in the Industrial Revolution. At the time, not a lot of thought was given to the science of how we learn; they just wanted a cheap way to deliver information to a large number of students. And surprisingly, this factory model of the education system hasn't changed since then.<br></p><p>What we need to do now is to build a digital learning environment, which makes learning way more effective &amp; efficient. Leading to a dramatic increase in learning output of the education system. And leverage AI, to make it so that it improves its efficacy with time &amp; data.<br></p><p>The way to do this is by understanding thoroughly, how the human brain operates while learning. And then using those scientific principles to design the learning environment.Â&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here is a fantastic essay by Andy Matuschak, which explains what I just said above better. You can read itÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>The starting point for this digital learning environment should be something, which is way more effective than any learning environment present today. Deploying this on a global scale will yield dramatically higher overall learning output than today. Making the current education systems redundant.Â&nbsp;</p><p>This would be the first step in accelerating the advent of Education 2.0. A world where high-quality education is free of cost to anyone and the quality of education is increasing over time. In the long term, this will mitigate all forms of inequality, and help humanity get onto a path of something bigger and brighter, thanks to its more immense collective wisdom.</p><p><b><u>Education 2.0Â&nbsp;</u></b></p><p><b><u></u></b>We have now talked about the major issues our education system faces and potential solutions to them. I would now like to introduce a brand new education system â€” Education 2.0.<b><u><br></u></b></p><p>Introducing …</p></div></div></div>

                    <p title="Wednesday 15 Jul 2020, 3:25 PM"><span></span>Updated Wed 3:25 PM</p>                <p>A TOP EU court has ruled in favour of Ireland and Apple in their appeal against the European Commission’s finding that the country breached state aid rules in its dealings with the multinational.</p>
<p>The European Commission previously ordered the US company to hand back €13 billion in unpaid tax and over €1 billion in interest payments to the Irish government.</p>
<p>Both Ireland and Apple appealed that ruling and the General Court of the European Union has now found in their favour.</p>
<p>It is widely expected that this ruling will be appealed to the European Court of Justice, with parties having a little over two months to file an appeal.</p>
<p>In its judgement, the General Court of the European Union said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By today’s judgement, the General Court annuls the contested decision because the Commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU.According to the General Court, the Commission was wrong to declare that Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE) had been granted a selective economic advantage and, by extension, State aid.The General Court endorses the Commission’s assessments relating to normal taxation under the Irish tax law applicable in the present instance, in particular having regard to the tools developed within the OECD, such as the arm’s length principle, in order to check whether the level of chargeable profits endorsed by the Irish tax authorities corresponds to that which would have been obtained under market conditions.However, the General Court considers that the Commission incorrectly concluded, in its primary line of reasoning, that the Irish tax authorities had granted ASI and AOE an advantage.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple Operations International (AOI) and Apple Sales International (ASO) were two Apple subsidiaries that were based in Ireland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The General Court of Justice went on to say: “The Commission did not prove, in its alternative line of reasoning, that the contested tax rulings were the result of discretion exercised by the Irish tax authorities and that, accordingly, ASI and AOE had been granted a selective advantage.”</p>

<p><strong>Reaction</strong></p>
<p>Both Apple and the Irish government have welcomed the judgement.</p>
<p>“This case was not about how much tax we pay, but where we are required to pay it,” an Apple spokesman said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to be the largest taxpayer in the world as we know the important role tax payments play in society,” Apple added.</p>
<p>The government has welcomed the judgement, stating in a statement that Ireland has “always been clear that, based on Irish law, the correct amount of Irish tax was charged and that Ireland provided no State aid to Apple”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ireland appealed to the Commission decision on that basis and the judgement today from teh court vindicates this stance.”</p>
<p>The Department of Finance said the decision showed there had been “no special treatment” for the tech giant.</p>
<p>“We welcome the judgment by the General Court of the European Union annulling the Decision of the European Commission of August 2016, which alleged Ireland provided State aid to Apple,” the department said in a statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ireland has always been clear that there was no special treatment provided to the two Apple companies – ASI and AOE. The correct amount of Irish tax was charged taxation in line with normal Irish taxation rules. Ireland appealed the Commission decision on the basis that Ireland granted no state aid and the decision today from the Court supports that view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the judgement “proves Ireland was correct to pursue this case in the European courts”.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The court was asked to determine whether two tax rulings delivered by Revenue in 1991 and 2007 allowed Apple to funnel profits through Irish-anchored structures without paying tax in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It is the first legal ruling in a case that formally kicked off in 2014 when the Commission opened an investigation into the matter, which concluded in 2016. The decision could have major implications for the European Commission’s plans to harmonise tax regimes across member states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission had found that the two rulings had breached EU state aid rules designed to prevent individual companies from receiving favourable treatment from member state governments. As then-commissioner for competition Margrethe Vestager put it at the time, “Ireland had granted illegal tax benefits to Apple”.</p>
<p>After concluding that Apple had been paying corporation tax at an effective rate of just 0.005%, the Commission ordered the US company to hand back €13 billion in unpaid tax and over €1 billion in interest payments to the Irish government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple denied that it had ever sought special deals with any government and accused the Commission of selectively quoting “tiny figures”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_1356">In a statement this morning</a> Vestager, who is now Executive Vice-President of the Commision, said that the body will “carefully study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps”.</p>
<p>“The Commission stands fully behind the objective that all companies should pay their fair share of tax,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If member states give certain multinational companies tax advantages not available to their rivals, this harms fair competition in the EU. It also deprives the public purse and citizens of funds for much needed investments the need for which is even more acute during times of crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Political reaction</strong></p>
<p>Following Apple’s appeal of the 2016 Commission finding, the Fine Gael minority government at the time, supported by Fianna Fáil, decided to join the appeal – prompting significant political and public opposition.</p>

<p>Responding to the ruling this morning, former minister Charlie Flanagan said: “Important EU court ruling vindicates actions of Enda Kenny, Michael Noonan and government despite incessant hostility at home and abroad.”</p>
<p>Sinn Féin’s finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty TD said that “morally this is a terrible day” because Apple was allowed to avoid paying a “fair amount of tax”</p>
<p>“Apple had three stateless companies here, ‘we shouldn’t pay tax here, or anywhere in the world’. So, while the Department of Finance may be thinking that this is a good day for themselves, morally this is a terrible day,” Doherty told RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney.</p>
<p>“The richest company in the world was able to generate over €100 billion of profits and not pay tax anywhere in the world on those profits despite the fact that the companies are incorporated here in Ireland. “&nbsp;</p>

The dataset to be processed has:</p><ul><li>One trillion edges/connections</li><li>A total dataset of 150TB</li><li>An hourly update of 100 billion connections,</li></ul><p>And it is a huge challenge. The team at WeChat encountered problems when using <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula">Nebula Graph</a>, an open source distributed graph database.</p><p>However, through deep customization capabilities in the database, the team has realized some useful on-demand features.

For example, the community version of <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> provides single-host service and is widely adopted in the knowledge graph area. However, when it comes to a very large data set this solution misses the mark. And large data sets are increasingly common in today’s business world.</p><p>Plus, there are issues like data consistency and disaster recovery to consider if you choose a multi-copy implementation. <a href="https://janusgraph.org/">Janus Graph</a> has solved the big data storage problem by using external metadata management, kv storage and indexes. Yet the performance has been widely criticized. As a result, most graph database solutions that the WeChat team evaluated are many times better than Janus Graph in terms of performance.</p><p>Some Internet companies build their own databases. These self-developed solutions are catering to their own business requirements, rather than for general graph scenarios. So, they support only a limited proportion of query syntaxes.</p><h3 id="geabase-from-ant-financial">GeaBase from Ant Financial</h3><p><a href="https://tech.antfin.com/products/GEABASE">GeaBase</a> is another option, mainly used in the finance industry. It features a self-developed query language, pushdown computation and millisecond latency. The main scenarios for its usage include risk management in financial organizations. To this end, it supports a transaction network with trillions of edges/relationships, storing real-time transaction data, real-time fraud detection.</p><p>It is also useful for recommendation engines. This includes applications like stocks and securities recommendations. Its Ant Forest features the capability to store trillions of nodes, strong data consistency, and low latency querying. It also has a GNN feature for Dynamic Graph CNN, for online inference based on dynamic graphs.</p><h3 id="igraph-from-alibaba">iGraph from Alibaba</h3><p>There is also iGraph, a graph indexing and query system.

The structure is like the TAO of Facebook.</p><h2 id="architecture-of-the-wechat-big-data-solution">Architecture of the WeChat Big Data Solution</h2><p>The WeChat team has come up with the following architecture to solve the big data storage and processing problem.</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/86352447-a87a9980-bc1a-11ea-83c6-47a481675e9e.png" alt="Architecture of the WeChat Big Data Solution"></p><h2 id="why-nebula-graph">Why Nebula Graph?</h2><p>As seen in the architecture above, a graph database is the main component of the solution. WeChat ended up selecting Nebula Graph as the starting point of its journey in exploring graph databases.</p><p>WeChat found Nebula Graph had the most potential for handling huge dataset storage needs based on the capability of dataset partitioning and an independent relationship storage. It also had pushdown computation and MPP optimization based on the strong consistency storage engine. Finally, the team had extensive experience in the graph database field and a proven model for abstraction for big data.</p><h2 id="problems-in-practice-nebula-graph">Problems in Practice Nebula Graph</h2><h3 id="insufficient-memory">Insufficient Memory</h3><p>The WeChat team encountered memory issues. At its essence, it was a problem of performance versus resources. Memory occupation is an un-neglectable issue in an application dealing with large scale datasets.
There are a couple of components in RocksDB that contribute to memory usage. There are Block cache, Indexes and bloom filters. There are also Memtables and Blocks pinned by iterators.
So, the WeChat team moved to optimize memory utilization. It began with block cache optimization. To do this, it adopted a global LRU cache to control the cache occupation of all RocksDB instances in a machine.</p><p>Then the team did a bloom filter optimization. An edge is designed as a key-value pair and stored in RocksDB. If all keys are stored in a bloom filter and each key occupies 10bit, then the memory required by the entire filter will exceed the machine memory by a large margin.</p><p>The team observed that most of the time the requests are to acquire a list of edges for a specific node. Therefore, the team adopted a prefix bloom filter. Another optimization was made to create indexes for properties on vertices, which enables acceleration for most requests. Finally, the memory occupation of a single-host filter is at the gigabyte level without sacrificing the speed of most requests.</p><h3 id="version-control">Version Control</h3><p>There are several business requirements in practice for version control. It offers graph data fast rollback, periodic full data import, and automatic access to the latest versioning data. The team has classified data sources into two categories.</p><p>Recurring data, for example, generates a list of similar users by day and the data takes effect after being successfully imported. Then there is History data and real-time data. For example, there is refresh history data by day and the team combines the history data with real-time data as full data to be imported.</p><p>Following is the data storage model in RockDB.</p><p>Vertex Storage Model:</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/86352518-c516d180-bc1a-11ea-9ea3-25a774e6478c.png" alt="Vertex Storage Model in RocksDB"></p><p>Edge Storage Model:</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57335825/86352600-e2e43680-bc1a-11ea-819c-6161cdf719b3.png" alt="Edge Storage Model in RocksDB"></p><p>Timestamp is used as the versioning method for real-time data. The version of imported data is specified manually. In practice, the team has three options for version control. First, reverse_versions, where the list of versions is to be kept for rollback. Second is active_version, where the version is accessed by users’ requests. And finally, max_version, where data is reversed after a certain version. The reversed data is the combination of the history data and the real-time data.</p><p>Using the three options, the team can manage offline data and online data efficiently. The data that is no longer used is cleared from the disk during the next compaction.
In this way, the application can update the data version without in the background. And the data rollback can be completed within seconds.</p><p>Below are some examples:</p><ul><li>Keep three versions of data and activate one of them</li></ul><p><code>alter edge friend reserve_versions = 1 2 3 active_version = 1</code></p><ul><li>Data sources are history data and real-time write data</li></ul><p><code>alter edge friend max_version = 1592147484</code></p><h2 id="fast-full-data-import">Fast Full Data Import</h2><p>Conducting data imports at a large scale is a common practice. The import requests, without any optimization, would not only affect requests in production, but take longer than a day to complete. So, it became an urgent requirement to improve import speed. SST Ingest is a commonly adopted method to achieve fast import. The WeChat team adopted something similar.</p><p>The team generated SST files offline via scheduling Spark tasks. Storage nodes pull the data required and ingest the data to the graph database. And, then there is access to the latest versioning data via the version control request. The import process takes several hours to complete, which is fast. And it does not affect requests to the graph database because the computation is mainly offline.</p><p>The shared-nothing architecture is a widely discussed method for ensuring horizontal scalability. It requires programming skills to implement the architecture in practice. The meta cache is encapsulated with <code>shared_ptr</code> and is frequently accessed, making it a warm bed for atomic operation clashing. To realize shared-nothing, the WeChat team copied each meta cache as a local thread. This <a href="https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula/pull/2165">pull request</a> provides details.</p><p>It has been a long journey to achieve graph database utilization. And it is one that continues with success in large part by overcoming obstacles.</p><h2 id="you-might-also-like">You Might Also Like</h2><ul><li><a href="https://nebula-graph.io/posts/detect-corona-virus-spreading-with-graph-database/">Detect Corona Virus Spreading With Graph Database Based on a Real Case</a></li><li><a href="https://nebula-graph.io/posts/review-on-graph-databases/">A Review of Graph Databases</a></li></ul><blockquote><span>Like what we do ?

<p><h2>My First Demoscene production</h2></p> 
<em>15-07-2020</em> 
<p>This year, I made my first ever demo! I've been threatening to do so for ages now, but since the lockdown hit, I've really had no excuse not to. For these of you unfamiliar with the demoscene, it's a small, yet internationally recognised[^0] subculture revolving around computer art. Some of the best programmers and artists produce works for all sorts of computers and electronic equipment, pushing the machines and themselves to the very limit! There are demoscene parties taking place all over Europe (and some further afield). I entered <a href="http://novaparty.org/">NOVA</a> this year - the UK's main demoscene party, and had great fun doing so.</p>
<h3>Demos and the Demoscene</h3>
<p>The demoscene has been around for a while now. It started out when crackers learned to break the copy protection on games. To show off their prowess, these expert programmer-pirates would leave messages at the beginning of the game. These messages often had music, scrollers, custom art. You can draw quite a few parallels to graffiti work, and I mean <em>really good</em> graffitti work! Some of these <em>'cracktros'</em> are incredible! The crackros became the main event, and the demoscene was born.</p>
<p>Back in these days, before the internet, demos were distributed via disk or bulletin boards. You could swap disks with folks you knew, dial into a modem and download, get disks in the mail, or go to a demoparty. Demo parties are still going today, stronger than ever one could argue. The largest Demoscene party is <a href="https://2019.revision-party.net/">Revision</a>, held in Saarbrucken, Germany. I've been a couple of times - you'll see some of the finest computer art in the world at this event! </p>
<p>Parties tend to be built around competitions. There are several categories and you can enter as many as you like. The competitions range from oldschool demos, such as these written for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Amiga</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, to 64K PC Demos - where the size limit is 64K. There are competitions for music, ranging from new school to tracked, and also competitions for Pixel Art and digital photography. Something for everyone.</p>
<p>Quite often, folks will get together to form a demoscene group. Musicians, teaming up with programmers and illustrators to create entries none of them could do on their own. Some of these groups have been going for decades, albeit with different members.</p>
<p>In the past, computers were a bit more restrictive than they are now. 3D rendering on the Amiga is quite the task whereas it's quite trivial on a modern PC. To keep up the challenge, a set of size-coding competitions were devised. The idea is fairly simple - see how much you can do with 64K, 8K or 4K. Some competitions even go as far down as 256 Bytes[^3]! For reference, an average email is around 400 Kilobytes.</p>
<iframe width="881" height="496" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZ6ZzJeWgpY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Some of these competition entries are absolutely fabulous. One of my favourites is <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=67113">Fermi Paradox</a>; a 64k entry by the demogroup <a href="https://mercury.sexy/">Mercury</a>. I'm still amazed that not only can so much be packed into such a small space, but that so much can be <em>said</em> in a short space of time. The programming skill is only matched by the art.</p>
<h3>Linux 4K</h3>
<p>One of the things I've noticed is there are very few Linux demos. This sounds odd to me as Linux is quite the open platform, at least compared to Windows. However, Windows has been the mainstay of the PC demoscene for much of the scene's history. I think this is because the graphics drivers tend to be better, Windows setups are much more homogeneous (you can generally rely on certain libraries being around), and more of a history of the kinds of hacking techniques often used in demo production. As more demos were released for Windows, more demotools became available. Tools such as <a href="http://crinkler.net/">crinkler</a>, which compresses your demos down to a tiny size, to the <a href="https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier">shader minifier</a>. Linux hasn't got there yet with it's tooling, until recently.</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blackle_mori/scalemark/src/master/">Blackle</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/linux-4k-intro-template">poroCyon</a>, we now have a starting template for Linux 4K entries. I took a look at how the template was built up. There seems to be the following processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compress the shaders into a header file with shader minifier</li>
<li>Build the object files with some embedded assembly (which I don't understand!)</li>
<li>Strip out any of the bits of the ELF Header we don't need. </li>
<li>Link everything together with the <a href="https://github.com/Shizmob/smol">Shoddy minsize-oriented linker (SMOL)</a></li>
<li>Compress everything with the <a href="https://in4k.github.io/wiki/lsc-wiki-vondehi.html">vondehi</a> program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vondhehi is quite funky! The decompressor itself is loaded into your program and decompresses the rest of the program once the program is run. </p>
<p>There are no doubt other subtle things going on. If you want to know more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a03HXo8a_Io">there is a talk from Revision you can watch</a> that explains the process in more detail. The code-base itself seems a little complicated but some of that is down to the tools being made for windows; there is a dependency on <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> (among other things) for example. Nevertheless, it's quite possible to get down to an executable of 4K or smaller.</p>
<figure><img src="https://shutr.benjamin.computer/inpost/numenera1.jpg" alt="Generating protein images."><figcaption>Screenshot from within the mysterious Menger Sponge!</figcaption></figure>

<p>This demo runs on every Linux setup I've tested it on. The de-facto standard for demoparties seems to be Ubuntu (at the time of writing, Ubuntu 18 for Revision). All size coding demos rely on some libraries being pre-installed. Unlike Windows, there is no guarantee you'll have the library you want installed under Linux, so this template comes with three options for the OpenGL context: SDL2 and GTK3. I went with SDL2 in the end, as it resulted in a slightly smaller filesize.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Definitely my weakest area this one. I had no idea where to begin. Thankfully the template is setup to use a tracker or synthesizer. I honestly don't know how this bit works but after looking around briefly, I found a program called <a href="https://www.renoise.com/">Renoise</a>. Apparently, there are set of instruments made by demosceners that can be loaded into renoise, whereupon you can make your soundtrack. These instruments tend to compress rather well it is claimed. <a href="https://github.com/askeksa/Oidos">Oidos</a>, <a href="http://4klang.untergrund.net/">4KLang</a> and <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61592">Clinkster</a> are recommended in the template. I decided to go with Clinkster for no real reason at all. </p>
<p>Renoise is a Windows program unfortunately, but it seems to run well enough under <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>. I could create a tracked piece of music fairly quickly (I use music in the loosest possible sense of the word!). With the file placed in the right directory, the template makefile rolls it in quite easily.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about demoscene music and listen to the work of someone who really knows what they are doing, check out <a href="https://soundcloud.com/h0ffman">h0ffman</a>. He has <a href="https://hoffman.home.blog/2019/04/27/eon/">a good write-up on his site</a> about the kinds of hoops a demoscener composer needs to jump through.</p>
<h3>Raymarching Menger Sponges</h3>
<p>With everything in place, I set to. I'd wanted to learn a bit more about fractals and how they are rendered. I started with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge">Menger sponge</a> -  a classic fractal. I like the look of it! Something weirdly alien yet constructed. I thought I'd use this as the main feature around which this intro would be based.</p>
<p>Normally, fractals are described using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>. It's an elegant way of of generating an image as fractals are self similar. However, in a fragment shader, this isn't possible.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning what a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Fragment_Shader">fragment shader</a> is. In early 3D graphics, the pipeline that took your triangles and spat out pixels on your screen was fixed; you couldn't really tweak it. Nowadays, you can alter the functionality of many different sections of the pipeline using small programs called <em>shaders</em>. The fragment shader is the last shader in the line before the pixels appear. It's sometimes called a pixel shader too, though you aren't manipulating pixels at this point (well, you are close enough I guess). </p>
<p>The fragment shader is where all the graphics magic happens. You are given a fragment and you output a colour for that fragment. The in-between step is where the fun is. We can use a technique known as raymarching. </p>
<p>Raymarching (or Volume Ray Casting) is used all over the place in a lot of demos; it's a powerful technique. Similar to raytracing, you shoot a ray from your camera through the screen at the fragment position. You then need to find out what this ray hits. To do that, you use a <a href="https://prideout.net/blog/distance_fields/">distance field</a>.</p>
<p>Distance fields are a parametric way of defining a scene. The simplest example is a sphere. A sphere can be defined as a 3D point and a radius - 4 numbers. From these four numbers you can figure out the distance from where your ray is, to the sphere, even figuring out where on the sphere your ray will intersect. The next step is to <em>march the ray</em> that distance and then check again how far away you are. </p>
<p>You can build up an entire scene this way, with multiple objects, creating realistic lighting, special effects and more! It's a really powerful technique made famous by the website <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a> and it's creator, <a href="https://iquilezles.org/">Iniqgo Quilez</a>. His site details a number of <a href="https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm">mathematical formulas for distance fields</a> though I can't claim to understand most of them. However, we can do all this in a single pixel shader.</p>
<p>Back to our Menger sponge then. If we can do it recursively, we'll have to go iteratively. One way we can create the sponge is to start with a field for a large cube and effectively carve out the holes using smaller cuboids and a subtraction function. Turns out all of these are easy to do in a fragment shader if you have the right functions. An excellent set of such functions can be found on <a href="https://mercury.sexy/">Mercury's homepage</a>.</p>
<h3>Numenera</h3>
<p>Back to our demo. I had the idea of using a Menger Sponge but no idea on the actual <em>art</em>. Where to begin? What was a trying to say? I must admit, this bit really took me by surprise how hard it was! I suppose that's a bit of a cliche right - the engineer trying to do an art? Still, undeterred, I'd been reading a little about the roleplay game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numenera">Numenera</a>. I liked the idea of long lost advanced technology. I pictured a desert, with an ancient and worn down artefact, suddenly coming alive as we observe it. I had an idea, so off I went!</p>
<p>The desert part is quite easy - it's just a plane with a noise offset on the distance field. I used Iq's lighting model for the shadows and the ambient occlusion. With …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>This post appeared first on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/return-on-investment-for-machine-learning-1a0c431509e">Towards Data Science</a> on July 8th, 2020.</p></blockquote><p>Machine learning deals with probabilities, which means there’s always a chance for mistakes. This inherent uncertainty causes many decision makers feel uncomfortable with implementing machine learning and traps them in an endless chase for the magical 100% accuracy. The fear of mistakes nearly always pops up when I’m working with companies taking their first steps towards intelligent automation, and I get asked “What if the algorithm makes a wrong prediction?”</p><p>If this issue is not addressed, the company will very likely spend a hefty amount of resources and years of development time on machine learning without ever getting returns for their investment. In this article, I’ll show you the simple equation I use to relieve these concerns and get decision makers more comfortable with the uncertainty.</p><h3>When is machine learning worth it</h3><p>Just like with any investment, the feasibility of machine learning comes down to whether it generates more value than it costs. It’s a normal Return on Investment (ROI) calculation which, in the context of machine learning, weighs the generated value against the cost of mistakes and accuracy. So instead of asking “How do we get 100% accuracy?”, the right question is “How do we maximize ROI?”</p><p>Determining the expected returns is quite straightforward. I usually begin opening up the business case for machine learning implementation by comparing its benefits against the potential costs in mathematical terms. This can be formalized in an equation which basically says “What’s left of the generated value after the cost of mistakes is accounted for?” Solving this simple equation allows us to estimate the profits for different scenarios.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_simple.png" alt="returns = value - (1 - accuracy) * cost of a mistake"></p></div></div><p>Let’s look at the variables:</p><ul><li><strong>returns</strong>: Generated net value or profit per prediction  </li><li><strong>value</strong>: The new value generated by every prediction (e.g. assigning a document to the right category now takes 0.01 seconds instead of 5 minutes, so the value is 5 minutes saved)  </li><li><strong>accuracy</strong>: The accuracy of predictions made by the algorithm  </li><li><strong>cost of a mistake</strong>: The additional costs incurred by a wrong prediction (e.g. it takes 20 minutes for someone to correct the mistake in the system)  </li></ul><p>By flipping the equation around and setting returns to zero, we get the minimum accuracy required to generate net value. This is called <strong>break-even accuracy</strong>:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_simple_flip.png" alt="accuracy = 1 - (value / cost of a mistake)"></p></div></div><p>The equation gets more intuitive when plotted in a graph:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_simple_graph.png" alt="Break-even point visualized"></p></div></div><p>So let’s say each prediction saves you 5 minutes of work but it takes 20 minutes of extra work to fix a wrong prediction. We can now calculate the break-even accuracy to be 1–5/20 = <strong>75%</strong>. Any improvement after this point brings concrete profits.</p><p>The above equation assumes us to blindly accept any prediction the algorithm makes and fix the errors afterwards. Sounds risky? We can do much better by extending the equation with confidence scores to lower the risks.</p><h3>Optimizing ROI</h3><p>A machine learning algorithm (done right) does not only spew out predictions, it also tells us how confident it is in every prediction. The majority of mistakes happen when the algorithm is unsure of its answer, allowing us to focus automation on the highest certainty predictions while manually reviewing the lowest few. Even though manual review does cost a bit of labor, it’s normally much cheaper than fixing a mistake later on.</p><p>Let’s choose a threshold which picks out 10% of the least confident predictions for manual review. The rest 90% will be handled automatically. This ratio is called confidence split. The accuracy in the high confidence bracket will now be considerably better since many of the mistakes are caught in the small unconfident bracket. This leads us to the extended equation. It says “What’s left of the generated value after the costs of mistakes and manual review are accounted for?”</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_extended.png" alt="returns = (value - (1 - confident accuracy) * cost of a mistake) * confidence split - (1 - confidence split) * cost of manual review"></p></div></div><p>Let’s look at the variables:</p><ul><li><strong>returns</strong>: Generated net value or profit per prediction  </li><li><strong>value</strong>: The new value generated by every prediction  </li><li><strong>confident accuracy</strong>: The accuracy of predictions in the high confidence bracket  </li><li><strong>cost of a mistake</strong>: The additional costs incurred by a wrong prediction  </li><li><strong>confidence split</strong>: The ratio of high confidence predictions (90% in our case)  </li><li><strong>cost of manual review</strong>: The costs of manually reviewing the prediction  </li></ul><p>We can again flip the equation to calculate the break-even accuracy by setting returns to zero, like so:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_extended_flip.png" alt="confident accuracy = ((1 - confidence split) * cost of manual review) / (confidence split * cost of a mistake) - value / cost of a mistake + 1"></p></div></div><p>We’ll solve it using the following variables:</p><ul><li>value = 5 minutes saved  </li><li>cost of a mistake = 20 minutes  </li><li>cost of manual review = 5 minutes  </li><li>confidence split = 0.9  </li></ul><p>Now the new break-even accuracy is 78%. Wait a minute, that’s higher than with the simpler equation, did it just get worse? Not quite! Remember that many of the mistakes are caught in the low confidence bracket, which significantly boosts the accuracy in the high confidence bracket. Even though the minimum accuracy requirement for break-even got higher, it is now much easier to achieve.</p><p>The ability to calculate the profitability of a machine learning algorithm in operation allows you to find the optimal accuracy. And no, it’s not 100%. As I discussed in my previous article, the development cost of any system increases exponentially while providing diminishing returns. With the above equations, you can estimate a realistic ROI and calculate the point where accuracy improvements incur more development costs than increase in returns in a time-frame of your choice. That’s the ROI-optimized accuracy.</p><h3>Practical example</h3><p>Let’s take a real world scenario and run through the whole thing. Imagine your Accounts Payable team handles 5000 invoices every month, and you’ve been presented the idea of automating a part of the process. More specifically, the proposed automation would categorize incoming invoices to match complex internal vendor codes, which is currently done manually. You need to figure out whether a machine learning approach is worth the effort to solve this task.</p><p>In terms of data, below is what you’ll be working with. You have a history of previously processed invoices and the correct “Vendor_Code” value for each. The task is to predict the right “Vendor_Code” for any new invoice. You can find the original dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nikhil1011/predict-product-category-from-given-invoice/data#Train.csv">here</a>.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_data.png" alt="Sneak peet at the data"></p></div><p><span>Sneak peet at the data</span></p></div><p>To start off, use any machine learning library or tool you prefer and run a basic accuracy test for the data. I’m using aito.ai which gives me an accuracy of 78% after training with 4000 rows and testing with 1500 rows. If we use the same values and costs as before, we can calculate the monthly returns with the first equation:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_calc_simple.png" alt="returns = 5 minutes - (1 - 0.78) * 20 minutes = 0.59 minutes"></p></div></div><p>Using the simple approach which ignores the confidence scores, every prediction made by the algorithm with 78% accuracy saves you on average 0.59 minutes of work, or 35 seconds. That means almost <strong>50 hours of work saved every month</strong> from processing 5000 invoices. Not bad.</p><p>Now let’s look at the equation which considers confidence scores. I compiled the results and confidence scores for each prediction into a neat table like below which allows us to divide them into high and low confidence brackets. In this case, any prediction with confidence lower than 0.21 will be reviewed manually. This threshold gives us the 90/10 confidence split.</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_conf_table.png" alt="Prediction results, including confidence scores"></p></div><p><span>Prediction results</span></p></div><p>The accuracy in our high confidence bracket is an impressive 84%, and a measly 22% in the low confidence bracket. This makes the impact of utilizing confidence scores crystal clear. Now we can calculate the new returns when confidence and manual review costs are a part of the equation:</p><div><div><p><img src="https://aitoai-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/website-assets/blog/roi_calc_extended.png" alt="returns = (5 minutes - (1 - 0.84) * 20 minutes) * 0.9 - (1- 0.9) * 5 minutes = 1.15 minutes"></p></div></div><p>The extended approach nearly doubles the returns! Every prediction saves, on average, 1.15 minutes. Processing your 5000 monthly invoices now involves <strong>95 hours less work</strong> even when the cost of mistakes and manually reviewing 10% of the predictions are accounted for. That’s pretty great!</p><p>Now you know the level of profitability you can currently achieve. And even better, you now have a tool to determine the feasibility of further machine learning development. For example, with the equation, you may calculate the returns for a hypothetical 90% accuracy and find the returns to be <strong>183 hours saved monthly</strong>. Compare it to the estimated development costs of reaching the 90% accuracy and you’ll have factual data for deciding if further development is worth the investment.</p><h3>Summing it up</h3><p>As you’ve seen, machine learning should be approached just like any other investment. The inevitable mistakes are just a cost of doing business and they’re normal variables in our calculations. Armed with these equations, you know exactly when to start reaping the benefits of machine learning without playing a guessing game, and you can put the algorithms into production way earlier. Be freed from the endless grind towards 100% accuracy and start generating value already.</p><p><strong>Done is better than perfect.</strong></p><a href="https://aito.ai/blog">Back to blog list</a></div></div>]]>

<h2>Historical Context of Iota’s Hash Functions</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, researchers discovered that the hash function used within the Iota cryptocurrency (Curl-P), was <a href="https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Wed-August-8/us-18-Narula-Heilman-Cryptanalysis-of-Curl-P-wp.pdf">vulnerable to practical collisions</a>. When pressed about this, the Iota Foundation said the following:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>You can read this statement from the source <a href="https://blog.iota.org/official-iota-foundation-response-to-the-digital-currency-initiative-at-the-mit-media-lab-part-4-11fdccc9eb6d">here</a>. Archived <a href="https://archive.md/fZ1Dm">here</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In response to this research, the Iota developers threatened to sue the researchers.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh good. Here’s an IOTA founder darkly threatening to sue a researcher who found out that the IOTA hash function was broken (something he later claimed was done on purpose.) <a href="https://t.co/myRCv098uf">pic.twitter.com/myRCv098uf</a></p>— Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/965731647579664385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2018</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>Threatening security researchers is toxic and shady as fuck.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Iota replaced Curl-P-27 with a hash function based on Keccak-384 they call Kerl. Keccak, you may recall, is a sponge function that went on to become SHA-3.</p>



<p>At its face, this sounds like a conservative choice in cryptography protocol design: Migrate from a backdoored hash function to one trusted and respected by cryptographers around the world.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Iota even offered a bug bounty for attacks against reduced round variants:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>I’ve never met a fiercer cryptography conference live-tweeter than @durumcrustulum.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Kerl isn’t Keccak-384 though. It’s Keccak-384 with a bit of an odd twist: They encode the input bytes into <strong>ternary</strong> ({0, 1} -&gt; {-1, 0, 1}) before hashing. Apparently this weird obsession with ternary encoding is part of Iota’s schtick?</p>



<h2 id="collisions">Practical Kerl Collisions</h2>



<p>As a consequence of their weird ternary obsession, the following inputs all produce the same Kerl hash:</p>



<ul><li>GYOMKVTSNHVJNCNFBBAH9AAMXLPLLLROQY99QN9DLSJUHDPBLCFFAIQXZA9BKMBJCYSFHFPXAHDWZFEIZ</li><li>GYOMKVTSNHVJNCNFBBAH9AAMXLPLLLROQY99QN9DLSJUHDPBLCFFAIQXZA9BKMBJCYSFHFPXAHDWZFEIH</li><li>GYOMKVTSNHVJNCNFBBAH9AAMXLPLLLROQY99QN9DLSJUHDPBLCFFAIQXZA9BKMBJCYSFHFPXAHDWZFEIQ</li></ul>



<p>This is a consequence of always zeroing out the last “trit” before passing the input to Keccak-384.</p>



<p>Since this zeroing was an explicit design choice of Iota’s, I decided to helpfully <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/kerl/pull/8">submit a pull request</a> adding these inputs as test vectors to their JavaScript implementation.</p>



<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h3>



<p>These are the facts:</p>



<ul><li>Kerl is intended to replace Curl-P-27 within the Iota cryptocurrency.</li><li>The Iota Foundation previously admitted that Curl-P-27 was a “copy-protection backdoor”.</li><li>The ternary encoding in Kerl allows three different inputs to produce the same hash output (which is not true of Keccak-384).</li></ul>



<p>Given <a href="https://medium.com/iota-demystified/iota-vs-dci-or-how-an-innocent-hash-collision-became-a-huge-ego-collision-425114e61e8f">the past behavior of the Iota developers</a>, there are three possible explanations for this:</p>



<ol><li>It’s a <a href="https://aumasson.jp/data/talks/backdooring_syscan15.pdf">bugdoor</a> (a backdoor enabled by a bug) intended to be exploited by the Coordinator–possibly as another copy-protection backdoor in the spirit of Curl-P-27.</li><li>They made a critical design mistake in Kerl, which may or may not be exploitable in one or more of the places they use Kerl.</li><li>Their alleged justification for zeroing out the last trit is sound, and there’s no way to exploit this collision vulnerability within Iota.</li></ol>



<p>The last explanation is the one that Iota fanboys will probably cling to, but let me be clear: Even if this isn’t exploitable within Iota, it’s still a huge fuck-up in the design of Kerl.</p>



<p>I’ve lost count of the number of projects I’ve encountered that used secp256k1 as their elliptic curve choice simply because it was also the curve Bitcoin used. These are protocols doing ECDSA for JSON Web Tokens, or ECDH for use in <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12823/ecdsa-vs-ecies-vs-ecdh">ECIES</a> schemes.</p>



<p>The probability of someone <em>eventually</em> using Kerl outside of Iota is 1, and they will be vulnerable to collisions because of that choice.</p>



<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>



<p>Iota is a cryptocurrency project that threatens security researchers, intentionally backdoored the cryptographic hash function in their original design (for “copy-protection”) and admitted to it, and designed a replacement cryptographic hash function (Kerl) that is vulnerable to trivial collision attacks (but the underlying hash function, Keccak-384, is not).</p>



<p>I don’t need to connect the lines on this one, do I?</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="975" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/riley-edit/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png" data-orig-size="580,580" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="riley-edit" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=580" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png 580w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/riley-edit.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>It’s really freaking obvious.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Since this attack also works on “reduced round” variants of Kerl, I guess I win their bug bounty too!</p>



<p>If the Iota developers are reading this, please remit payment for your promised bounty to the following ZEC address: <strong>zs1lwghzjazt4h53gwnl7f24tdq99kw7eh9hgh3qumdvcndszl7ml4xmsudcmm60dut2cfesxmlcec</strong></p>



<p>That being said, I never got an answer to my question, “Should I report the security reduction in bits or trits?” I’m feeling generous though. Given the cost of a collision is basically 1 trit, this is a 242-trit security reduction against collision attacks in Kerl.</p>

This makes social media a critical protagonist in our search for truth.</p><p id="viewer-d3dka">The problem with this is that social media value engagement, and this doesn’t align generally with the truth. The number of retweets and likes has nothing to do with what’s true.</p><p id="viewer-669lp">Social media has increased our tendency to rely on tribal truth. It has become the realm of tribal truth. Identity is an essential part of who we are and when we base our identity on a set of ideologies that prevent people from accepting facts, there’s a clear problem. We learn and accept facts from people we like and trust. It’s obvious that this can’t be a way to find the truth.</p><p id="viewer-9pbaa">What if social media curated information and made the real facts more visible?</p><p id="viewer-9srt6">In that case, we’re back to the “Media” point above. If social media had become the new “guardian of truth,” we did not solve the problem. If Youtube bans what isn’t explicitly compliant with WHO’s recommendations, and if Twitter can edit the Times, it means there is one version of the truth. History already showed this isn’t a good idea.</p><p id="viewer-8quv5">Social media shouldn’t become the new “guardian of truth”.</p><h2 id="viewer-ajc89">Government Institutions</h2><p id="viewer-ee82t">The third entity where we usually get information from is institutions, from governments to global organizations. These entities have a lot of power but as they are political and strategic entities, they aren’t always incentivized to tell us the truth.</p><p id="viewer-7nopo">For example, a significant turning point may have happened during the current COVID-19 pandemic where science transformed from a tool of discovering the truth into a political tool of institutions.</p><p id="viewer-bq8u0">If science is used by big institutions to push their ideas or to justify their actions, we are lost.

Social media is weaponized, and while people spend more and more time online, they are being influenced by ideas turned into ideologies that may factually be wrong.</p><p id="viewer-bv41a"><a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/author/matt-mcmanus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt McManus</a>, coined the term “<a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/2018/08/27/trump-age-bullshit-roots-knowledge-crisis/155316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">age of bullshit</a>” to express the knowledge crisis we are going through. It’s a dangerous time we live in, and in order to solve many of the challenges we face, we need, first, to focus on the meta-problems.</p><h2 id="viewer-83re0">A solution: the iterative model of truth</h2><h3 id="viewer-b8q47">The COVID19 Tracking Project</h3><p id="viewer-hnvv">As said, the press coverage of COVID-19 was disastrous early on. It led to most people and governments not taking the pandemic seriously. A counterexample of this is the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID19 Tracking Project</a>.</p><p id="viewer-a7kdk">This tracking project was not presented as “the Truth” in the way the New York Times does. It shows the most accurate data, with revision history.</p><p id="viewer-544ku">Truth is a process; it’s not something set in stone; it changes. The problem with media corporations is that they present the truth as something fixed — the truth is what they publish. When they mistake, it’s difficult for them to admit that they have mistaken, because they would risk losing their positions as the guardians of the truth.</p><p id="viewer-dl914">It’s not a problem to be incorrect; the problem is not to admit it and build your whole legitimacy on being the truth.</p><h2 id="viewer-a80de">The GitHub Model of Truth</h2><p id="viewer-1vh0c">When’s the last time you heard a politician admitting he or she was wrong? I can’t think of an example. Conversely, if an app crashes, its developers will have no choice but to admit they made a mistake.</p><p id="viewer-fk3m8">It’s the GitHub model of truth. You know there will be mistakes, and you’re okay with it. As soon as you discover a problem, you correct it, and everyone can submit corrections.</p><p id="viewer-4ida7">Truth should follow the Github model. As soon as something is factually wrong, it should be easy to correct it and make the mistake visible to everyone.</p><p id="viewer-4l7ld">But how could we make it a reality outside of the tech world?</p><p id="viewer-e8tjf">For something to work, it must be created in a way that incentives are correctly aligned. Here, we want a collaborative system that gives us the best version of the truth.</p><h2 id="viewer-5otrr">How to Align the Incentives</h2><p id="viewer-a8302">The first idea that comes in mind to align the incentives is to make it financially attractive to be correct. What if “being right” meant earning money? An idea to fix this problem is to modify social media engagement metrics with social features based on a prediction market. Imagine if instead of liking or retweeting a tweet about an economically impactful statement, you could “bet” financially on it.</p><p id="viewer-46ogj">This approach would change the nature of the attention you give to the truth. You wouldn’t want to back the false claims, right? So before “betting” on a tweet, you would do your due diligence of fact-checking it and make sure it’s correct.</p><p id="viewer-c3726">No one should have the ability to say what’s right or wrong. It’s a collective process of multiple people fact-checking the statements and sourcing the information that can lead to the best version of the truth. The era of decentralized media must start if we want the truth.</p><p id="viewer-4djfj">In academia (I know a lot of things are wrong with academia), when a paper is published, it gets reviewed. We should do the same, but, unlike academia, we should do it in a decentralized way.</p><p id="viewer-b9dgk">For example, The <strong>Reproducibility Project: Psychology</strong> was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced_psychological_science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crowdsourced</a> collaboration of 270 contributing authors to repeat 100 published experimental and correlational psychological studies. This idea of reproducing a finding must be transferred outside of the research world. What if independent reporters were doing the same with major stories?</p><p id="viewer-d2436">How would they get paid? The rise of independent journalism is happening now; Substack is an excellent example of it. An increasing amount of people are ready to subscribe to independent journalists to receive their work. It could be a solution to the problem. The <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsletter</a> of Matt Taibbi is a great example of this, and another example is the excellent reporting of <a href="https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luca Dellanna</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic. To get the best information on the coronavirus, you had to follow the right people on Twitter, not the prominent publications.</p><p id="viewer-foc37">Decentralized and independent sources of information is also a way to promote <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/11/metarational_an.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meta-rationality</a>, a concept <a href="https://twitter.com/tylercowen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Cowen</a> brings up a lot. It’s the concept of being aware of your cognitive limitations and know how to trust in topics where you don’t have the expertise to understand.</p><h2 id="viewer-4l0pi">New Social Media</h2><p id="viewer-5g9m7">Is it possible to have this approach to the truth using the existing social media? It seems hard. The social media were built with different motivations at the core. What we need is social media made entirely for the purpose of revealing the truth. As the French investor Xavier Faure <a href="https://twitter.com/XFaure/status/1092444972635303936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p><blockquote id="viewer-ah70t"><p>“We need a trust social network.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


          

            <p>This is just a quick note to mention that I have updated my <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4">hardware
documentation on the Librem 13v4 laptop</a>. It has unfortunately
turned into a rather lengthy (and ranty) piece about Purism. Let's
just say that waiting weeks for your replacement laptop (yes, it died
again) does wonders for creativity. To quote the full review:</p>

<blockquote><p>TL;DR: I recommend people avoid the Purism brand and products. I
find they have questionable politics, operate in a "libre-washing"
fashion, and produce unreliable hardware. Will not buy again.</p></blockquote>

<p>People who have read the article might want to jump directly to the
new sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#libre-washing">Libre washing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#bullshit-anti-interdiction">Bullshit anti-interdiction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#bullshit-crowdfunding">Bullshit crowdfunding</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#hardware-reliability">Hardware reliability</a> (or lack thereof)</li>
</ul>


<p>I have also added the minor section of the <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/#no-mic-jack">missing mic jack</a>.</p>

<p>I realize that some folks (particularly at Debian) might still work at
Purism, and that this article might be demoralizing for their work. If
that is the case, I am sorry this article triggered you in any way and
I hope this can act as a disclaimer. But I feel it is my duty to
document the issues I am going through, as a user, and to call
bullshit when I see it (let's face it, the anti-interdiction stuff and
the Purism 5 crowd-funding campaign were total bullshit).</p>

<p>I also understand that the pandemic makes life hard for everyone, and
probably makes a bad situation at Purism worse. But those problems
existed before the pandemic happened. They were issues I had
identified in 2019 and that I simply never got around to document.</p>

<p>I wish that people wishing to support the free software movement would
spend their energy towards organisations that actually do honest work
in that direction, like <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> and <a href="https://www.pine64.org/">Pine64</a>. And if you're
going to go crazy with an experimental free hardware design, why not
go retro with the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/reform">MNT Reform</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you're looking for a phone, I recommend you give
the <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/">Fairphone</a> a fair chance. It really is a "fair" (as in, not
the best, but okay) phone that you can moderately liberate, and it
actually frigging works. See also my <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/phone/fairphone2">hardware review of the FP2</a>.</p>

<p>Update: this kind of blew up, for my standards: 10k visitors in ~24h
while I usually get about 1k visitors after a week on any regular blog
post. There were more discussions on the subject here:</p>

<p>Trigger warning: some of those threads include personal insults and
explicitly venture into the <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2019-05-13-free-speech/">free speech

consequences...</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Whether you are using a single IPU or thousands for your Machine Intelligence workload,&nbsp;Graphcore’s&nbsp;Poplar SDK makes this simple. You can use your preferred AI framework, such as TensorFlow or&nbsp;PyTorch, and from this high-level description, Poplar will build the complete compute graph, capturing the computation, the data and the communication.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">GC200 integrates 1,472 separate IPU-Cores, and&nbsp;is capable of executing&nbsp;8,832 separate parallel computing threads. Each IPU processor core gets a performance boost from a set of novel floating-point technologies developed by&nbsp;Graphcore, called&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">AI-Float.&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">By tuning arithmetic implementations for energy and performance in Machine Intelligence computation, we&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;serve up one&nbsp;PetaFlop&nbsp;of AI compute in each IPU-Machine M2000 1U blade.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With class leading support for FP32 IEEE floating point arithmetic we also support FP16.32 (16bit multiply with 32bit accumulate) and FP16.16 (16bit multiply accumulate). However, our Colossus IPUs are unique in having support for Stochastic Rounding on the arithmetic that is supported in hardware and runs at the full speed of the processor. This allows the Colossus Mk2 IPU to keep all arithmetic in 16bit formats, reducing memory requirements, saving on read and write energy and reducing energy in the arithmetic logic, while delivering full accuracy Machine Intelligence results. Each of the 1,472 processor cores and each of the 8,832 parallel program threads can generate a separate random number seed with shaped noise, allowing a unique compute capability to support, for example, Probabilistic or Evolution Strategy models. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The AI-Float arithmetic block also provides native support for sparse arithmetic floating-point operations. We provide library support for different sparse operations including block sparsity and dynamic sparsity. This means that the IPU delivers much more efficient compute on sparse data, not just in inference, but also during training, helping innovators to create new types of complex models that deliver state of the art performance with much fewer parameters, faster training times and using much less energy.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our IPUs working together with Poplar, also have a radical new approach to memory organisation. Firstly, each IPU has a huge amount of In-Processor Memory™ with our new Mk2 GC200 having an unprecedented 900MB ultra-high-speed SRAM inside the processor. This is spread across the IPU, with In-Processor Memory sitting right next to each processor core in an IPU-Tile™ for the lowest energy access per bit. 900 MB is a 3x step up in density when compared to our Mk1 IPU and is enough to hold massive models, prior state, or many layers of even the world’s largest models inside the chip running at the full speed of the processor. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our Poplar software also allows IPUs to access Streaming Memory™&nbsp; through&nbsp;our unique&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Exchange-Memory™</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto"> communication. This allows large models with 100’s Billions of parameters to be supported. Each IPU-Machine M2000 can support Exchange-Memory™ with up to 450GB in density and with an unprecedented bandwidth of 180TBytes/sec. As a result, the IPU Exchange-Memory delivers over a 10x advantage in density together with over a 100x advantage in memory bandwidth when compared to the very latest 7nm GPU products. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Overall, the combination of the unique way that the IPU accesses memory, the class-leading In-Processor Memory design and Exchange Memory features, together with native support for sparsity, enable developers to execute machine learning models at very high speed, no matter how large or how complex. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-GB" lang="EN-GB"><span>Unlike other solutions, you don’t need to add expensive InfiniBand networking cards to connect the IPU-Machines; each IPU-M2000 has dedicated AI networking built in.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">We created a new Graphcore GC4000 IPU-Gateway chip that delivers incredibly low latency and high bandwidth, for each IPU-Machine M2000 delivering 2.8 Tbps bandwidth. As you connect more IPU-Machine M2000 systems together, the overall bandwidth grows to many Petabits/sec.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">IPU-Fabric uses standard copper or optical OSFP connectors, linking IPUs up and down the rack. In larger configurations, communication between IPU-PODs uses tunneling-over-Ethernet technology to maintain throughput, while allowing the use of standard QSFP interconnect and 100Gb Ethernet switches – underscoring Graphcore’s commitment to straightforward deployment in mixed-use datacenters.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Across the entire system, IPU-Fabric uses a 3D ring topology, chosen both for maximum efficiency and because it maps well to the three dimensions of parallelism found in Machine Intelligence compute.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">IPU-Fabric is fully supported by our Poplar SDK.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For a while I’ve been intending to make my website more sustainable, but I succumbed, as I often do, to the human trait of sloth. But this morning after reading <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/">Gerry McGovern’s post on webwaste</a>, I thought I’d procrastinated long enough.</p>

<p>So I ran a web page performance test and got some <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_XX_e2daed33a24cd8a099d930fc373b1083/">grim results</a>: my website takes over a minute to load on a Moto G4 on using 3G data networks. It’s just as bad <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200713_6E_4e249b485a45882604420068caa21ae0/">using a desktop PC in Nottingham on 1.5Mbps DSL</a>. My website is bloated with large images and a bunch of JavaScript, which means it’s eating up lots of energy transmitting those bits and bytes.</p>

<p>But how much energy? I used the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon Calculator</a> to find out. Turns out that</p>

<ul>
  <li>6.90g of CO2 is produced every time someone visits the homepage</li>
  <li>it emits the amount of carbon that 4 trees absorb in a year, and</li>
  <li>it uses enough electricity to drive an electric car 1,116km</li>
</ul>

<p>Eugh. That’s disgusting. For each year my website has been online, I should have planted 4 trees just for the homepage alone. But, instead, my laziness has filled the atmosphere with more and more carbon.</p>

<p>I have to do something, this has gone on long enough, so I’m committing to some actions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’ll move my site to a web hosting provider using renewable energy, one that’s listed on the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/">Green Web Foundation’s directory</a>. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll compress and optimise the images on my site using <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac">ImageOptim</a>. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>I’ll get rid of <a href="https://github.com/samesies/barber-jekyll">my energy-guzzling site theme</a> until I can introduce one that’s lightweight and accessible. <strong>DONE</strong></li>
  <li>Going forward, my website will enshrine the principles of the <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">Sustainable Web Manifesto</a>. <strong>SIGNED</strong></li>
  <li><strong>NEW</strong>: I’ll pay for some trees to be planted that’ll reduce the impact of my website’s carbon footprint going forward.</li>
</ol>

<p>To show my committment to being a good web citizen, I’ll add the <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/">Website Carbon Badge</a> to all pages (<strong>DONE</strong>) and the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/">Green Web Foundation’s renewable hosting badge</a> (<strong>DONE</strong>). Once I’ve improved things, I’ll add a <a href="https://carbontxt.org/">carbon.txt</a> (<strong>DONE</strong>).</p>

<p>One day I’ll actually get around to building a solar-powered battery bank and run my site off my home connection, but until then I’m taking small steps to remove, minimise and clean-up my presence on the web.</p>

<p>What’s the carbon footprint of your website? What steps will you take to reduce it?</p>

Lastly, it made sense in the early days of Matrix to have different brands to illustrate the different roles of Riot, Modular and New Vector in the ecosystem… but nowadays there are loads of Matrix clients, Matrix hosting providers and companies building on Matrix - and so all New Vector’s different names were just causing confusion. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="so-why-element">So, why Element?</h3><p>We want a name that reflects the emphasis on simplicity and clarity that we aimed for when designing RiotX; a name that highlights our single-minded mission to make Element the most elegant and usable mainstream comms app imaginable. &nbsp;Riot had a pretty chequered history, spending much of its life in beta, with intermittent attention to design until we hit 1.0 last year - but nowadays we have a dedicated full-time design team working on Element, who not only design the graphics but the overall behaviour of new features in the app. &nbsp;This is not an easy task, given it turns out the hardest bits of end-to-end encryption are almost entirely UX challenges. &nbsp;What’s more, presenting a global decentralised communication network as simply as a centralised communication island is surprisingly tricky. &nbsp;However: we have been making massive progress, to the extent that we are barely recognisable as the Riot of the past.

July 14, 2020 | https://www.nomtek.com/blog/sleek-ui-in-flutter-wolt | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.nomtek.com/blog/sleek-ui-in-flutter-wolt">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase</em>. We are going to check its promises by recreating part of an existing application as accurately as possible. I chose the Wolt app because the Wolt team has been doing an amazing job, creating sleek UI &amp; UX with many subtle details.</p><figure id="w-node-ef7dc46c635c-c5de3bde"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UI9vN8Y583o"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>My goal for this series is to present a thought process that leads to the desired result rather than provide a copy-paste solution. We will work in a build-refactor cycle, examining potential problems and framework limitations. You may find the whole code for this series on our github: <a href="https://github.com/nomtek/flutter-meets-wolt">https://github.com/nomtek/flutter-meets-wolt</a>.<br>Let’s dive in!<br></p><h2>App bar buttons &amp; menu</h2><p>Let’s warm up with something that seems to be simple - app bar buttons. There are two of them - one is used to navigate back, and the other is showing a menu with two items. My first idea was to use <em>IconButton</em> composed with <em>Container</em> that has circle-shaped decoration:</p><div>
<pre>class AppBarButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final IconData icon;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;
     
     const AppBarButton({Key key, this.icon, this.onPressed}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      decoration: BoxDecoration(shape: BoxShape.circle, color: Colors.grey[300]),
      child: IconButton(
        icon: Icon(icon),
        onPressed: onPressed,
      ),
    );
  }
}
     </pre>
</div><p>When we put those widgets in an AppBar:</p><div>
<pre>SliverAppBar(
  leading: AppBarButton(
    icon: Icons.keyboard_backspace,
    onPressed: () =&gt; Navigator.pop(context),
  ),
  actions: [
    AppBarButton(
      icon: Icons.more_horiz,
      onPressed: () { /* TODO */ },
    ),
  ],
  </pre>
  </div><p>The result is already quite similar to what we have in the original application:<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eeca98badfe870ce2c0e65a_Hnet.com-image.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Our first implementation has no padding and buttons are too big. When we press the button it shows a grey highlight followed by an animated, darker splash instead of opacity change. Let’s try to implement those missing features.</p><h2>Size and layout</h2><p>On the iPhone 8, original buttons have a size of 40x40 points, 16 points margin to the screen edge and 8 points bottom offset. Given that app bar has a height of 44 points on this iPhone it would mean that those buttons have to overlay status bar (the one with signal strength, clock and battery status) and indeed they are:<br></p><figure id="w-node-53719c61cb64-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eeca9d84b65ff38701fee0a_overlay.png" alt="flutter_overlay"></p></figure><p>We can apply those constraints by wrapping our button widgets in <em>Padding</em> and <em>Align</em>.</p><div>
<pre>    return Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(
        position == AppBarPosition.leading ? 16 : 0, 0,
        position == AppBarPosition.trailing ? 16 : 0, 8),
      child: Align(
        alignment: Alignment.topCenter,
        child: Container(
          width: 40,
          height: 40,
(...)

  </pre>
  </div><figure id="w-node-11a065b0312c-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eecaa077f68da65b8562c7c_56px_app_bar.png" alt="flutter_app_bar"></p></figure><p>One difference is that the bottom offset is bigger in our implementation and we don’t even overflow status bar. The reason is that the height of our app bar is calculated based on the <em>const double kToolbarHeight = 56.0; </em>constant from the Flutter framework. There is no explicit way to set app bar height, eg. by constructor parameter, and the class responsible for the app bar layout, which uses this constant, is private (<em>_SliverAppBarDelegate</em>). This prevents us from using inheritance to override the code responsible for height computation. This delegate is, again, not exposed by the app bar (<em>SliverAppBar</em>), so even if we end up creating our own version, we won’t be able to use it unless we also extend <em>SliverAppBar</em> and override<em> build</em> method from its state. Since Flutter is open source this could be done in a few minutes, by copy-paste original implementation and tweaking those details, but it’s far from feasible solution as we would have to maintain our version and keep it in sync with improvements made by the Flutter team to the original classes.<br></p><p>It’s worth to take a note, that<em> kToolbarHeight</em> is also used to constraint the width of the leading widget (back button in our case), forcing it to be a square. This is how our app bar looks like with margins increased to 25 points. Notice shrunken leading button, while trailing is spaced from the screen edge as expected. This limitation has no effect in our case, as designed margin and button size is exactly matching available space.<br></p><figure id="w-node-0b501ed6363f-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eecaa3d49a49185d4d77cdd_25px_margin.png" alt="flutter_margin"></p></figure><h2>Highlight behaviour<br></h2><p>In the Wolt app when the button is highlighted it changes the opacity of the icon. There is no highlight colour change or splash animation. We can re-create such behaviour by wrapping button in the <em>Opacity</em> widget. To track highlight status we have to introduce an internal state, represented by the <em>_isHighlighted</em> boolean property. That means we have to refactor our widget from stateless to stateful:</p><div>
<pre>enum AppBarPosition {
  leading,
  trailing,
}

class AppBarButton extends StatefulWidget {
  final IconData icon;
  final VoidCallback onPressed;
  final AppBarPosition position;

  const AppBarButton({Key key, this.icon, this.onPressed, this.position}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _AppBarButtonState createState() =&gt; _AppBarButtonState();
}

class _AppBarButtonState extends State<appbarbutton> {

  bool _isHighlighted = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(widget.position == AppBarPosition.leading ? 16 : 0, 0,
          widget.position == AppBarPosition.trailing ? 16 : 0, 8),
      child: Align(
        alignment: Alignment.topCenter,
        child: Container(
          width: 40,
          height: 40,
          decoration: BoxDecoration(shape: BoxShape.circle, color: Colors.grey[300]),
          child: Opacity(
            opacity: _isHighlighted ? 0.3 : 1.0,
            child: IconButton(
              icon: Icon(
                widget.icon,
                color: Colors.black,
              ),
              onPressed: widget.onPressed,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
  </appbarbutton></pre>
  </div><p>Unfortunately, <em>IconButton</em> we are using is not exposing <em>onHighlightChanged</em> callback - only <em>onPressed</em>, which is not enough for our needs. We have to refactor our code to use more generic button class, like<em> RawMaterialButton</em> where we have more control over callbacks and visual settings.</p><div>
<pre>  child: RawMaterialButton(
    highlightColor: Colors.transparent,
    splashColor: Colors.transparent,
    onHighlightChanged: (isHighlighted) =&gt; setState(() {
      _isHighlighted = isHighlighted;
    }),
    child: Icon(
      widget.icon,
      color: Colors.black,
    ),
    onPressed: widget.onPressed,
  ),
</pre>
</div><h2>Showing the menu<br></h2><p>When the user presses menu button two things happen - the menu is shown and the button icon changes from three dots to close cross. We are going to track the current state in the boolean property <em>_isMenuShown </em>in the State of the screen-route. Updated menu button:</p><div>
<pre>    AppBarButton(
      icon: _isMenuShown ? Icons.close : Icons.more_horiz,
      position: AppBarPosition.trailing,
      onPressed: () {
        Navigator.push(context, AppBarMenu())
            .then((_) =&gt; setState(() =&gt; _isMenuShown = false));
        setState(() =&gt; _isMenuShown = true);
      },
    ),
</pre>
</div><p>We will build <em>AppBarMenu</em> class that extends <em>PopupRoute</em>, as it gives us more control over UI of the menu than <em>PopupMenuButton</em> from the Flutter framework. On button press, Navigator widget is tasked to push our Route to the stack. Push method returns a future which completes after this route is dismissed - that’s why we set <em>_isMenuShown</em> to false in the <em>then </em>callback.</p><h2>Menu look &amp; feel<br></h2><p>Our final task is to build a menu that will be displayed. It’s pretty straightforward - a list with two items, the less obvious parts maybe how to place it on the screen, and how to achieve the shape of a rectangle with rounded corners and triangle indicator on top. We are going to use <em>ClipPath</em> widget with a custom clipper to build the desired shape. An alternative solution would be to compose <em>ClipRRect</em> (RRect stands for rounded rectangle) with an <em>Image</em> widget for the top triangle. Yet another idea is to have a whole background as a nine-patch image, and there are for sure a few more feasible options to achieve the desired UI. Due to Flutter’s widget-oriented architecture, there are often multiple ways how can we compose existing primitives into more complex structures - like this fancy-shaped menu. You can preview updated buttons and the menu on the gif below:<br></p><figure id="w-node-2d5de7a9800c-c5de3bde"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5c95072393140f36ecc22e60/5eecaa9a37ac27758ef39129_Hnet.com-image%20(1).gif" alt="flutter_buttons_menu"></p></figure><h2>Conclusion<br></h2><p>Flutter allowed us to recreate, very closely, UI and UX of Wolt’s piece of the interface. We were able to achieve the compelling look &amp; feel quickly by composing native widgets, and even if there are certain limitations, due to open-source nature of the Flutter framework, achieving pixel-perfect quality is possible when needed.<br></p></div></div>]]>

			<p>According to <a href="https://thenews.asia/bank-of-korea-acquires-bank-sign/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The News Asia</a>, the Bank of Korea (BOK) is using blockchain technology in its banking sector also in order to commercialize the infrastructure. It has acquired Bank Sign for this purpose. It will help in transferring the financial services to a more organized structural framework. It will also help in making everything one step away with digital services. People will trust more the authentication and transparency of the system and will be able to invest in blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Bank Sign is a blockchain-based co-verification system that allows authenticated data to transfer among banks and financial institutions.</p>
<h2>Bank sign as&nbsp; a replacement for digital ID</h2>
<p>South Korea’s central bank plans to offer Bank Sign as a replacement for “Digital ID” (DID ). The COVID-19 pandemic situation is forcing South Korea’s banking stakeholders to consider other alternatives rather than currency exchanges such as digital alternatives for live operations.</p>
<p>Since the corona pandemic, organizations and banks have been trying to make everything online and operational through the digital space. Many people also believe that this pandemic can have positive outcomes for the emerging industries as they will render everything online.</p>
<p>Favoring the benefits of adopting Bank Sign, a BOK official told The News Asia:</p>
<blockquote><p>I expect that through cooperation, we will be able to realize cost reduction, service improvements, and discovery of new businesses</p></blockquote>
<p>The BOK adopting a blockchain digital ID system will not only strengthen the infrastructure but also will help in the development of advanced technology.</p>
<h2>Collaborating with Sendsquare to utilize blockchain in medical storage</h2>
<p>According to BTC Manager, the government is now planning to induce blockchain technology in medicine too by work in partnership with Send square.</p>

July 14, 2020 | https://emilymstark.com/2020/07/14/debunking-the-users-always-click-yes-myth.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://emilymstark.com/2020/07/14/debunking-the-users-always-click-yes-myth.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There’s a common myth among software engineers, and security engineers in
particular, that people will always click “yes” on any warning or prompt,
blindly accepting any risk about which the UI warns. This is not generally true,
and the misconception can lead to suboptimal design decisions and even <a href="https://noncombatant.org/2016/01/28/against-security-nihilism/">security
nihilism</a>.</p>

<h2 id="warnings-can-be-designed-for-adherence">Warnings can be designed for adherence</h2>

<p>Warning adherence is the percentage of users who do what a warning wants them to
do. For example, we say that users adhere to an SSL certificate warning if they
leave the offending site upon encountering the warning.</p>

<p>Design decisions can influence adherence significantly – for example,
redesigning the Chrome SSL warning
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43265.pdf">increased</a>
adherence from 37% to 62%. (Today, SSL warning adherence is even higher, at
around 80% on Windows. One possible
<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46359/">explanation</a> is that we got rid of many
false positive SSL errors, thereby leaving more real errors that users don’t
want to bypass, but I don’t know for sure.) Example of visual or interaction
adherence cues include highlighting the “safe” button or hiding the “unsafe”
button behind a dropdown.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/cert_error.png" alt="Chrome 86 SSL certificate warning">
  <figcaption><i>Chrome 86 SSL
certificate warning. The safe option (“Back to safety”) is visually highlighted.
The unsafe option is only shown when the “Advanced” button is clicked.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some warnings may not need to be as extremely opinionated as the SSL certificate
warning to achieve good adherence. For example, Chrome has a warning for
lookalike domains that use unusual characters to create convincing spoofing
domains. This warning, shown below, is designed to be less opinionated and makes
it easier for people to find the unsafe option, yet people choose the unsafe
option &lt;15% of the time.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/lookalike_warning.png" alt="Chrome 86 lookalike domain warning">
  <figcaption><i>Chrome 86
SSL lookalike domain warning. This warning is designed to be less scary than the
SSL certificate warning, and it is easier for users to find and exercise the
unsafe option. The warning still produces good adherence.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It can also be useful to measure user behaviors other than adherence. People may
choose the unsafe option on a warning, but then act more cautiously as they
proceed (for example, by not entering passwords on the unsafe site). Depending
on the risk in question, this may or may not be a safe behavior. My team has
some recent data on this phenomenon that I hope we’ll be able to share publicly
soon.</p>

<p>There are some caveats to this approach of designing warnings for adherence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43265.pdf">study</a>
I linked above, the redesigned warning did not improve comprehension. People
made safer decisions with the redesigned warning, but they didn’t understand
the warning better than before. Convincing people to make safe choices may be
easier than helping them understand the risks, especially in light of
follow-up <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46632/">research</a> suggesting that
there is no single easily-surmountable challenge that gets in the way of
comprehensibility.</li>
  <li>Designing for adherence can be seen as a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum
might be an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35274659/does-using-badidea-or-thisisunsafe-to-bypass-a-chrome-certificate-hsts-error/35275060">obfuscated
password</a>
for bypassing the warning. This end of the spectrum could be seen as
paternalistic, or as favoring expert users and denying non-expert users the
same functionality. On the other end might be placing the safe and unsafe
options on equal footing with no visual or interaction distinctions. This end
of the spectrum lets people make their own uninfluenced choices, but puts them
at risk if they do not comprehend the warning well. I think that choosing a
point on this spectrum is probably a subjective, qualitative product decision,
but it’s important to know that the spectrum exists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prompts-that-arent-warnings">Prompts that aren’t warnings</h2>

<p>One might concede that warnings can achieve good adherence, but still speculate
that users will always say “yes” to a prompt – a neutral question that doesn’t
have any particular desired outcome.</p>

<p>I’m less familiar with the research in this area, and there may in fact be less
research overall. But, one public data source we have is the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome User
Experience
Report</a>,
which recently added <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/02/notification-permission-data-in-crux">permission acceptance
data</a>
for the web notification permission prompt. This data suggests that users
neither blindly accept nor deny notification permission prompts. To pick a few
examples that come to mind, users accept ~3% of notification prompts on
www.tomshardware.com, ~22% on www.facebook.com, and ~82% on news.google.com (as
of early 2020). These numbers are not apples-to-apples comparisons; many
factors, including the audience and context of the website, will influence the
acceptance rate. However, I do think these numbers suggest that users do not
have a constant uniform reaction to permission prompts.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-does-this-mean">So what does this mean?</h2>

<p>Developers shouldn’t assume that users will always blindly say “yes” to any
security or privacy warning or prompt. We can design warnings to achieve good
adherence, and even neutral prompts elicit neither a single uniform response nor
a random response. Still, I think of it as good practice to avoid overloading
people with security and privacy decisions, especially when the risks may not be
comprehensible. I also think it can become unmaintainable to expose every
security decision in the UI; software designers need to prioritize which choices
to expose, and users should choose the software that gives the right level of
control for them.</p>

<h6>Cardi B is the <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp/following">only person that Cash App follows on Twitter</a>! (via YouTube)</h6>
<p>Last week’s “Cash App Friday” came at the perfect time. The COVID-19 pandemic has been costly, scary, and uncertain, especially for those living paycheck-to-paycheck. On Cash App Fridays, the mobile payment app users can log on Twitter and reply to <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp">@CashApp</a> with their $cashtag for a chance to win prizes that range from $100 to $500. Later that weekend, Cash App matched some of the giveaways from Shea Serrano –The Ringer staff writer and <a href="https://trapital.co/2019/11/04/shea-serrano-on-the-economics-of-book-publishing-movies-and-other-things-and-how-dj-screw-inspired-his-promotional-tactics/">Trapital Podcast guest</a>— who had already made it habit to give money to those in need.</p>
<p>These philanthropic measures are gracious, but it’s essential to Cash App’s growth model. In 2019, the company spent an estimated <a href="https://money.com/what-is-cash-app-friday/">$60,000 on Cash App Fridays</a>. In return, it earned much more in heightened brand awareness and earned media. This strategy translated well to hip-hop, where rappers use the app to give money to fans. Cash App has now been name-dropped by over 200 hip-hop artists.</p>
<p>Cash App achieved the modern brand’s dream: to become part of the culture. No appropriation. No cringe-worthy attempts to sound like a 23-year-old hypebeast. All genuine. It’s easier said than done, and it’s a model others can learn from.</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Make it easy for the customer</strong></h4>
<p>When Cash App launched in 2013, it was much more buttoned-up. Users needed phone numbers or email addresses to transfer money. A year and a half later, the service eased up, followed Venmo’s lead with usernames, and introduced the <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/introducing-cashtags">$cashtag</a>. These handles made the app more social and reduced friction to transfer money.</p>
<p>Square continued this trend when it offered debit cards. From <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/02/28/squares-cash-app-killed-it-in-2017.aspx">Motley Fool</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Square introduced a virtual debit card at the end of 2016, which allowed users to spend their Cash App balance online or through a mobile wallet. So, if you were ordering a pizza online, for example, your friends could send you money on Cash App, then you could pay for the pie with the debit card number.</p>
<p>Square followed it up in April with a physical debit card and allowed users to add a personalized signature or drawing to the front of the card. The card has proved extremely popular, with users spending over $90 million using their Cash Cards during the month of December. That’s a run rate of over $1 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>It dropped a full year before Venmo’s debit card, which also helped!</p>
<p>Cash App took its efforts to another level in November 2017 when it introduced the ability to trade Bitcoin. This was one month before Bitcoin’s peak valuation (and peak public interest). The timing was perfect. It would be like buying Nicki Minaj stock the month before “Monster” came out.</p>
<p>Square CFO Amrita Ahuja said that Cash App’s Bitcoin and Investing customers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynpollock/2020/02/29/bitcoin-paying-off-for-squares-cash-app-raking-in-178-million/#4ea73a5e28e7">generate up to two-to-three times more revenue</a> than the rest. Since Bitcoin accounts for about <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-drove-half-of-squares-cash-app-revenue-in-the-4th-quarter">half of Cash App’s revenue</a> and Cash App has 24 million monthly active users, that means less than 7 million (28%) use those features.</p>
<p>Most companies would use this as a reason to solely focus on acquiring more Bitcoin investors. They would run ads in fintech newsletters, sponsor emerging tech meetups, find Libertarian groups on Reddit, and so on.</p>
<p>But Cash App expanded its reach. Cash App giveaway recipients aren’t exactly the demo for Bitcoin investing. But they might be someday and may spread the word to someone who <em>is</em> in that cryptocurrency demo. That’s what Cash App is banking on (literally). This is the long game.</p>

<h6>This is a Spotify screenshot of songs named “Cash App.” That list keeps going… it’s clearly an SEO play.</h6>
<h4><strong>Influencer marketing done right</strong></h4>
<p>Square is still not entirely sure how Cash App first became popular with hip-hop. Here’s Square CEO Jack Dorsey at a 2019 investor conference via <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dont-venmo-iggy-azalea-cash-app-rules-rap-11565191206">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is also something we weren’t expecting, but I think Cash App has touched in the culture. We’ve just benefited from people loving it and wanting to sing about it, and putting it in their music videos, and it’s amazing how much that spreads.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But once Square noticed the trend, it locked in. In 2018 it teamed up with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/travis-scott-is-giving-away-100000-to-fans-through-the-cash-app-2018-8">Travis Scott </a>and <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2018/08/why-are-rappers-giving-away-money-cash-app-lil-b">Lil’ B</a>. In December, it got together with <a href="https://cash.app/legal/us/en-us/snoop-special-stars">Snoop Dogg</a>. Each of them used the app to give away money. The company acquired customers through the rappers’ social media followings at an extremely low cost. Free money is an easy sell, and it doesn’t take that many customers to justify the cost.</p>
<p>Here’s a great breakdown from <a href="https://ark-invest.com/research/squares-cash-app-twitter">Ark Invest</a> on the low-cost customer acquisition:</p>
<blockquote><p>While banks can pay from $350 to $1500 to acquire users, Cash App acquired a new customer through Burger King in five minutes without any direct mail or bank branch visit.</p>
<p>Square has run similar [$100,000] campaigns with rappers like Travis Scott and Lil B and other influencers, triggering a network effect for the Cash App… If only 129 of the 120,000 who commented on [Travis Scott’s] tweet were new to Cash App, then Square’s cost of customer acquisition would have been less than the $925 per user that banks pay on average, according to our research, and 6,000 comments, only 5% of the total, would have dropped it to $20. Moreover, as the converted users appear to spread the word on social media, the Cash App can acquire additional users from just one.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s well worth $100,000 for both La Flame and Cash App. It’s even more worthwhile considering the influence that hip-hop fans have on their peers. According to <a href="https://www.revolt.tv/2020/1/1/21043728/generation-hip-hop-2020">REVOLT’s Gen Hip Hop study</a>, hip-hop fans are 2x more likely to be culturally influential. It’s the right audience to acquire.</p>
<p>Cash App’s user base is <a href="https://twitter.com/hknightsf/status/1239976638844039168?s=20">strongest in the South and the Midwest</a> of the US, which aligns with the regions where many hip-hop fans are at. It’s the opposite of most founders who focus first on their “early adopter” personal networks in the coastal metro hubs in New York and San Francisco. This strategy made more sense years ago when broadband internet access was noticeably stronger in tech hubs and universities, but that’s no longer the case. It’s 2020. Smartphones are now ubiquitous. It’s time to think beyond Mark Zuckerberg’s Ivy League expansion plan that worked for Facebook in 2004.</p>
<p>Venmo’s growth strategy was more aligned with the traditional tech growth model. The founders are UPenn alums who hit up Princeton Hackathons and other similar events. It had its own “Million Dollar Money Tree” cash giveaway and $5 referral sign-up bonuses to attract customers. But those offers were also centered around Ivy League users and their friends who live on the coasts.</p>
<p>Cash App’s <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/114365585/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/2019-Q4-Shareholder-Letter-Square.pdf">monthly active users have grown</a> from 7 million in 2017, 15 million in 2018, to 24 million in 2019. It still trails Venmo in users, but Cash App is <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/27/the-gap-between-cash-app-and-venmo-is-getting-bigg.aspx">growing faster</a>.</p>
<p>I drew this chart to highlight the difference:</p>

<h4><strong>An effective flywheel</strong></h4>
<p>Cash App’s strategy is a true flywheel that drives more peer-to-peer transactions. The hip-hop influencers and their fans grew the user base and brand awareness further, which gained the attention of those who seek higher-end services like Bitcoin and Investing.</p>
<p>The flywheel looks like this:</p>

<p>It’s similar to Jay Z’s flywheel with his <em>4:44</em> release. Here’s <a href="https://trapital.co/2019/11/21/jay-zs-cell-phone-partnership-strategy-explained/">what I wrote last year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jay Z made a sale that valued the company at more than 10x his purchase price just two years earlier. That’s impressive especially with all the turmoil and controversy that surrounded Tidal during that stretch.</p>
<p>But the real kicker is that $75 million was budgeted for exclusive content for Sprint. Five months after the deal was publicized, Jay Z dropped 4:44 as a Sprint-Tidal exclusive. This connected the streaming service with Sprint, which now had a vested interest in Tidal’s success (not too different from Live Nation’s interest in Roc Nation). And by partnering with a cellular carrier instead of a manufacturer like Nokia or Samsung, Jay increased his flexibility and integration capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jay Z distributed his album through Sprint because it has an active customer base and a means to deliver his product. Sprint was now a co-owner of Tidal, Jay’s streaming service. The cellular carrier had a vested interest in both the delivery and implementation. And Sprint customers got the album for free. Everybody won.</p>

<hr>
<p>In this next decade, Cash App’s customer acquisition tactics will be replicated by many. Products that are built to serve the mass consumer will waste time if they religiously follow Silicon Valley’s age-old mantra to “start in San Francisco and New York” and expand from there. That traditional plan still makes sense for a product like Superhuman, the $30 / month email service that’s specifically targeted at that who will pay for that. It’s less ideal for an app that relies on network effects and massive scale.</p>
<p>Mass-market products need branding. In consumer tech, hip-hop has been the backbone. TikTok had Lil’ Nas X. Snapchat had DJ Khaled. YouTube had Soulja Boy. The list goes on. Hip-hop culture influence continues to grow, and more companies will find their own way to engage fans.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><time datetime="2020-02-12T00:00">February 12, 2020</time><div><p>At its core, Sentry is a tool that alerts you to defects in your production software. But it does more than blast stack traces into your inbox: Sentry provides powerful workflows to help your team determine root cause, <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/02/07/sentry-workflow-triage">triage issues</a> to your team, and keep tabs on ongoing concerns with comments and notifications.</p>
<p>These collaborative features can help you resolve problems with your software quickly. But the keyword here is <strong>collaborative</strong>; without your full team having access to Sentry, you may find yourself quickly becoming overwhelmed with an endless backlog of issues and no one to help.</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, the Growth team made it our mission to make it easier for our users to invite their teammates to join them on Sentry. To achieve this, we tackled three distinct areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Surfacing the ability to invite users contextually</li>
<li>Expanding Sentry’s permission model to allow <em>more types of users</em> to send invitations </li>
<li>Allowing external users to request access themselves</li>
</ol>
<p>Our theory: improving the user experience of inviting users, <em>as well as</em> democratizing the process to include all team members would lead to a significant increase in team-wide adoption. <em>(Narrator: it did.)</em></p>

<p>Before we get deep into what we changed and how it impacted the bottom line, let’s quickly revisit how user invitations worked: the <em>Add Member to Organization</em> page you see below.</p>

<p>This full-page experience, tucked away deep in Sentry’s account settings, had a number of issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since this is a full page, reaching it meant you would be taken out of context of whatever you were doing previously</li>
<li>Its location deep in our navigation hierarchy meant discoverability was poor</li>
<li>It’s <em>unclear</em> you can actually invite multiple people at once (you can!)</li>
<li>When inviting multiple users, you could only assign the group to the same role and collection of teams</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, to improve discoverability, we had previously introduced a number of “quick links” to reach this page more easily. But these links were scattered around the application, and didn’t appear contextually when users signaled intent to invite members.</p>
</div><figure><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/4xiHp1Gl0HaZ0l8USGDPLr/79402583357d98cf55ad2dfda6ffe537/2-invitations.png" alt="" title="2-invitations"></p></figure><div>
<p>These user experience and discovery challenges felt like obvious starting places. But instead of just settling for a new “improved” form, we decided to rethink the entire experience from the ground up.</p>

</a>The new member invitation modal</h2>
<p>It’s probably not a surprise that our first instinct was to convert this page into a modal –&nbsp;one that manages to squeeze all of the capabilities shown earlier into a smaller, more concise experience. It actually does one better: the modal is clearer in indicating that you can invite multiple users, and allows you to set unique permissions for each invitee.</p>

<p>While modals are sometimes overused in web applications, we believed this approach would solve our key discoverability and navigation concerns: it can be shown contextually without leaving the current page, and completing the form returns you to what you were doing.</p>
<p>To that point, we additionally introduced buttons to launch this <em>Invite New Members</em> modal contextually throughout Sentry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing an issue and notice a <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/workflow/releases/?platform=node#after-associating-commits">suspect commit</a> made by a coworker? If they’re not already part of your Sentry organization, you can now invite them then and there.</li>
<li>Trying to assign an issue to a team member, but don’t see their name in the assignee list? You now have the option to invite them right in the dropdown.</li>
<li>Creating a new team? Now you can invite new members directly to that team as you go.</li>
</ul>

</a>Democratizing invitations</h2>
<p>As we began rolling out our new <em>Invite New Members</em> experience across the application, we came to a sobering realization: only roughly <strong><em>half</em></strong> of Sentry users could actually use our new modal. That’s because historically, only those with Owner or Manager-level permissions could invite other team members. Combined, users with these permissions accounted for less than 50% of active users.</p>

<p>Restricting the ability to add new users to account administrators is pretty common practice for software tools, and Sentry is no exception. When an employee onboards on a new team, it’s common to see an exchange like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alice: Oh awesome, we use Sentry. Can you add me to the organization?
Bob: Ah, I can’t invite you. Maybe ask Jen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a perfect world, one of your administrators is tracked down, and they manually add the new teammate to the account. But sometimes that person is unknown, or is on a vacation, or maybe it takes them days or weeks or even months.</p>
<p>We began asking ourselves: what if we could unlock team members to fast-track this whole process and invite members themselves? This led to our next major change: updating our permission model to allow for <strong>members to request to invite other members.</strong></p>

<p>Now, when non-administrators open up the Invite New Members modal, it changes contextually to become a “request to invite” rather than a direct invitation. Hitting “send” kicks off an email to all organization administrators, who are prompted to approve any outstanding requests.</p>

<p>At this point, we had built what we thought was a fantastic new user experience and we just <em>doubled</em> the number of users who could take advantage of it. But this exercise of opening up user invitations got us thinking: what if there was an even <em>further</em> source of untapped users we weren’t reaching?</p>

</a>Removing the middleman entirely</h2>
<p>In the last section, we highlighted a scenario where one teammate asks another teammate for access to Sentry. And because of our recent changes, users can request to invite their teammates themselves instead of having to track down and ask their account administrator.</p>
<p>But this scenario still has a gatekeeping element: the new teammate has to ask <em>another</em> teammate for access. What if the new teammate spots an alert from Sentry in Slack stemming from their recent changes, and no one’s around to grant them access? Unfortunately, they’d land on an authentication wall that would prevent them from going any further.</p>

<p>This begged the question: was there an untapped source of potential users we weren’t reaching by restricting invitations <em>only</em> to active Sentry users? What if new users didn’t have to ask anyone at all?</p>
<p>So, to keep this party going, we dug in and additionally made it possible for <strong>external users to request to join an organization</strong>.</p>

<p>Now when a user lands on an Organization’s login page, they have the option to “Request to join”, which asks for the user’s name and email address. Once they hit send, the organization owners are sent an email that prompts them to approve the join request. Just in case, there’s also a call-to-action to disable the feature entirely for their organization.</p>

<p>Having developed a new contextual invitation modal and a pair of invite-friendly permission changes, we were <em>feeling</em> confident that these changes were going to have a strong impact on user behavior. It was time now to put our money where our code was, and verify that all this hard work actually moved the needle.</p>

</a>A/B testing the impact</h2>
<p>Our standard procedure for validating the efficacy of product changes is through A/B testing (also known as split testing). This means instrumenting our application code to serve different experiences to segments of users over the same time period, and comparing the results. This step takes extra effort, but it’s worth it –&nbsp;the alternative is to settle for a before-and-after snapshot of data, which is too easily impacted by external factors like seasonality or marketing pushes.</p>
<p>ℹ️ <em>To learn more about how we perform A/B testing at Sentry, please see <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/05/09/easy-ab-testing-with-planout">this earlier blog post</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s easy to get carried away with A/B testing, and having so many permutations that you don’t have enough data to be statistically significant. So, to simplify things, we decided that all treatments would get the new modal experience, and our “treatment” groups would focus on the new permission changes.</p>
<p>This left us with 4 distinct treatments that we rolled out to 4 equally-sized customer segments:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Baseline</strong> (new modal only)</li>
<li><strong>Request to Invite</strong> (user invites another user)</li>
<li><strong>Request to Join</strong> (external user requests to join)</li>
<li><strong><em>Both</em></strong> Request to Invite and Request to Join are enabled together</li>
</ol>
<p>Our main criteria for determining success: which of these treatments would result in <strong>an increase in <em>accepted</em> invitations</strong> (and thus new users)?</p>
</div><figure><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/em6l9zw4tzag/rlobEVJ4FCzWbU1tmPqqb/8ed779f9a63aa3382e5590cfa8e4bec1/11-invitations_2_.png" alt="" title="11-invitations"></p><figcaption><p>% of accepted invitations relative to baseline</p></figcaption></figure><div>
<p>After 30 days, the results became clear (not to mention, statistically significant):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>11%</strong> more users accepted invitations in the <em>Request to Invite</em> treatment vs. the baseline</li>
<li><strong>9%</strong> more users accepted invitations in the <em>Request to Join</em> treatment vs. the baseline</li>
<li><strong>21%</strong> more users accepted invitations who had both <em>Request to Invite</em> and <em>Request to Invite</em> treatments enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s probably not a surprise that allowing a wider set of users to invite team members resulted in more users inviting team members. It’s also probably not a surprise that enabling both feature sets at the same time was even better (given that they complement each other)!</p>

                  <p>
                      Today I’m excited to announce Snorkel AI’s launch out of stealth!
                      Snorkel AI, which spun out of the Stanford AI Lab in 2019, was founded on two simple premises: first, that the labeled <b>training data</b>  machine learning models learn from is increasingly what determines the success or failure of AI applications.
                      And second, that we can do much better than labeling this data entirely by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      At the Stanford AI lab, the Snorkel AI founding team spent over four years developing new <b>programmatic</b> approaches to labeling, augmenting, structuring, and managing this training data.
                      We were fortunate to develop and deploy early versions of our technology with some of the world’s leading organizations like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/harnessing-organizational-knowledge-for.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3329486.3329492">Intel</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05372">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300192">Stanford Medicine</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology#reference">over thirty-six peer-reviewed publications</a> on our findings; innovations in weak supervision modeling, data augmentation, multi-task learning, and more; inclusion in university computer science curriculums; and deployments in popular products and systems that you’ve likely interacted with in the last few hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Through all this academic tinkering and industry spelunking, we realized two things: first, that this concept of labeling and building training data programmatically, rather than by hand, had transformational potential to make machine learning more iterative, auditable, faster to deploy, and ultimately, more practical.
                      And second, that these ideas changed not just how you label training data, but so much of the entire lifecycle and pipeline of ML: how knowledge and feedback is injected; how models are constructed, trained, versioned, and monitored; how entire pipelines are developed iteratively; and how the full set of stakeholders in any ML deployment, from subject matter experts to ML engineers, are incorporated into the process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In other words, we saw that this shift to programmatic training data required a top-to-bottom rewrite of the entire ML development and deployment process.
                      With the support of some amazing investors (Greylock, GV, In-Q-Tel, and others) and incredible early customers, we’ve spent the last year doing just this: building and deploying <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/platform">Snorkel Flow</a>, an end-to-end platform to support this new vision of the ML process.
                  </p>
                  <h2>The Training Data Bottleneck</h2>
                  <p>
                      Snorkel Flow was motivated first and foremost by a growing realization that training data had become the key bottleneck in much of ML pipeline and AI application development.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f63e7bd828cf6019ca0add38ca51ca4050dfeea5/288e4/images/training_data_bottleneck.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f63e7bd828cf6019ca0add38ca51ca4050dfeea5/288e4/images/training_data_bottleneck.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Today’s ML successes often rest on a hidden cost: massive, hand-labeled training datasets.</b>
                      In the last decade, we’ve seen a tectonic shift in AI and ML towards powerful but data-hungry representation learning models.
                      These models—often deep learning architectures—are not only more powerful at obviating traditionally manual development tasks like feature engineering and bespoke model design, but also have never been more accessible in the open source.
                      However, there’s no such thing as a free lunch: these models are highly complex, with tens to hundreds of millions of parameters, and they require massive labeled training datasets to learn from.
                      And, other than in special scenarios where labels are naturally derivative of existing processes, these training datasets need to be labeled by hand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The hand-labeled training data interface to ML has enabled tremendous progress, but is also ridiculously broken.</b>
                      Consider a simple example: a legal analyst at a bank wants to train a contract classification model, and wants to inject a simple heuristic into the ML model: that if “employment” is in the title, the contract should be labeled as an “Employment contract.”
                      Simple, right?
                      Not so.
                      Theoretically, to communicate this specific feature to a machine learning model via only labeling individual data points could require thousands of examples (roughly, inversely proportional to the sparsity of the feature space).
                      From this perspective, it’s like playing 20 questions rather than just communicating the answer directly—fine if you have a massive question-answer bank, but otherwise wholly impractical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Manually labeling training data is prohibitively expensive–especially when expertise and privacy are required.</b>
                      Building training datasets often requires <a href="http://nytimes.com/2018/11/25/business/china-artificial-intelligence-labeling.html">armies of human labelers</a> at massive cost and time expense.
                      For example, ImageNet—one of the foundational projects behind ML’s current explosive progress—took <a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/">over two years</a> to create.
                      However, labeling cats, dogs, stop signs, and pedestrians is one thing; labeling data like medical images, legal and financial contracts, government documents, user data, and network data requires <b>stringent privacy protections</b> and <b>subject matter expert labelers</b>.
                      This means for sectors like financial services, government, telecommunications, insurance, healthcare, and more, creating training data (and by extension, using ML) is either a hugely expensive on-premise activity—or more often, one that is just not feasible to tackle, let alone practical.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Iterative development is not possible with hand-labeled data.</b>
                      From an engineering and data science perspective, manually labeled training data fundamentally breaks the ability to quickly iterate, which is absolutely essential in real world settings where input data, output goals, and annotation schema change all the time.
                      From a business perspective, training data is an expensive asset that can’t be reused across projects, can often depreciate to worthless overnight due to changing conditions or business goals, and that presents growing risks—everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200703104247/https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/data-labeling/docs">COVID-related delays</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">issues of bias</a>.
                  </p>
                  <h2>A New Input Paradigm for ML: Programming with Data</h2>
                  <p>
                      With Snorkel Flow, rather than needing to hand-label any training data, users develop <b>programmatic operators</b> that label, augment, and build training data to drive the ML development process.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ae088a1fc7f3c6326c2e7285bc2d3c7e88907290/ad302/images/platform-label-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>Programmatically labeling and building training data.</b>
                      With Snorkel Flow, the idea is to instead communicate this domain knowledge directly via a programmatic operator like a <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6523-data-programming-creating-large-training-sets-quickly">labeling function</a>.
                      For example, our legal analyst could write a labeling function that labels documents as “Employment contracts” if the word “employment” is in the title, and otherwise abstains; or, a range of more complex and powerful labeling functions relying on internal knowlegebases, models, legacy heuristics, and more.
                      This approach of effectively programming ML with data is simple, direct, interpretable, modifiable, and agnostic to the model used (which is especially important given the ongoing Cambrian explosion of powerful new open source model architectures).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>The directness of rules with the flexibility of ML.</b>
                      Rule-based systems have long been used in industry for certain tasks—as an input, individual rules have the desirable property of being direct and interpretable.
                      However, rules can also be brittle, and lack the robustness, flexibility, and sheer power of ML approaches.
                      With Snorkel Flow, you get the best of both worlds: rules (and other interpretable resources) as inputs, and powerful ML models that generalize beyond these rules as the output.
                  </p>
                  <p><img data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png" alt="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b9653f8e7b7803550e9afd55284d43beb190fbe/e2b34/images/platform-manage-v3.png"></p><p>
                      <b>A more powerful yet weaker supervision.</b>
                      At the same time that this programmatic supervision is advantageous in several transformational ways, it is also messier and raises fundamental new technical challenges.
                      The labeling functions and other programmatic operators that users write will have varying unknown accuracies and expertise areas, will overlap and disagree with each other, and may be correlated in tangled and unknown ways.
                      We focused on the algorithmic and systems solutions to these issues over <a href="https://www.snorkel.ai/technology">four-plus years of research</a>, showing both empirically and theoretically that with the right techniques, these deep technical challenges can be overcome.
                      The result: training data that is as good as or better than hand-labeled data, and immensely more practical to create and maintain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <b>Beyond labeling: data augmentation, slicing, monitoring, and more.</b>
                      In high-performance production ML, training data is about a lot more than labeling.
                      For example, data augmentation is a cornerstone technique wherein transformed copies of data (e.g. rotated or blurred images) are used to expand the sizes of training datasets, and make resulting models more robust.
                      Slicing or structuring training datasets into more or less important and difficult subsets is also a critical part of managing production ML. 
                      Finally, monitoring and adapting not just models but …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of today’s best bloggers in the functional programming space is <a href="https://chrispenner.ca/">Chris Penner</a>. Despite this, Chris is criminally underrated—nobody I talk to seems to know of his work. Go check him out as soon as you finish reading this post!</p>
<p>This is reasonably pervasive phenomenon in our subculture; there’s lots of fantastic work being produced, but for one reason or another, it falls between the cracks. I’d propose the biggest obstacle is that most FP writing <em>isn’t optimized to be read.</em></p>
<p>So I’d like to take some time today and talk about common failure modes in technical writing. If you don’t have a checklist you run through before publishing a post, you’ll probably get a lot of benefit from internalizing this advice.</p>
<p>The value? You’ll make it easier for people to understand what you’re trying to tell them. Which is why you’re writing in the first place, right? The good news is that none of this is magic—just some simple guidelines for structuring your content.</p>
<h2 id="the-guiding-principle">The Guiding Principle</h2>
<p>Here’s the biggest thing to keep in mind: your reader doesn’t really care what you have to say. You get maybe four sentences to convince them that your essay is worth their time. If you haven’t made your case by then, you’ve probably lost them to the next tab they binge-opened.</p>
<p>Even after you’ve convinced them that it’s a valuable read, you need to continue assuring them that you’re not wasting their time. If you take too long to get to the point, or if you make the information too hard to find on a quick skim, you’ve lost them again.</p>
<p>As a result, alongside your technical content, you have two primary goals to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide strong, concise motivations for everything you want to talk about.</li>
<li>Make it easy to skim.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can do these two things, you’re already most of the way to better engagement.</p>
<h2 id="writing-strong-motivations">Writing Strong Motivations</h2>
<p>People care about solutions to problems they have, or expect to have one day. They care about other things too, but it’s not really relevant to us today.</p>
<p>With this in mind, you want to tailor your motivations in terms of <em>solutions to problems.</em></p>
<p>Here are some good examples of problems that you’ve probably run into (and links to their solutions for you to read later):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrispenner.ca/posts/adjunction-battleship">Ed Kmett writes shitty documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/higher-kinded-data/">I have lots of types that need to evolve at the same time</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thinkingwithtypes.com/">There is no good place to learn type-level programming</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Bad examples of motivating documents are things that assume you care <em>simply because they exist.</em> This is <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.9/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html">pretty</a> <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Yesod-tutorial-for-newbies/">common</a> of libraries’ tutorials. The same document that convinces you to use a technology should also show you how.</p>
<p>As a more general rule, focusing on <em>why</em> is going to be more valuable than on <em>how.</em></p>
<p>Why should someone care, and why your solution is a good one.</p>
<p>“How” without a “why” suggests a contrived solution to a made-up problem. In other words, it’s easily read as “who cares?”</p>
<h2 id="understanding-how-people-read">Understanding How People Read</h2>
<p>People who spend lots of time reading have good heuristics for skipping lots of text. If you understand these heuristics, you can make it easy for people to find what they’re looking for. And remember: they’re looking for reasons to continue reading.</p>
<p>There are two behaviors here. The first is what I call “skimming for concepts”—which is that people will attempt to determine what text is about at a high-level. They’re looking for <em>what you’re trying to tell them</em>, as opposed to <em>what you’re actually saying.</em></p>
<p>When skimming, people are likely to read only the headings and the first two sentences of a paragraph. If they’re convinced they know what you have to say, they’ll skip to the next paragraph. If several paragraphs in a row don’t seem relevant, they’ll skip to the next heading.</p>
<p>If the next heading also fails to grab their attention, they’ll probably give up.</p>
<p>The solution is to structure your argument as a tree. Headings must provide enough information to let someone know whether or not they care about the following prose.</p>
<p>This also means that the first sentence of each paragraph should be sufficient to understand the rest of the paragraph. The remaining sentences are only allowed to reinforce or give details of the first sentence. One paragraph equals one idea.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the hierarchy of your document should look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document
<ul>
<li>Heading
<ul>
<li>First sentence
<ul>
<li>Rest of paragraph</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you feel like it’s hard to know how much knowledge to assume your readership knows. Understanding how people read makes this a non-issue. Present as much information as is necessary to understand your point, but make it easy to skip if people already know it. Those who don’t yet know will learn, those who do can skip past, and both camps will appreciate it.</p>
<p>After you’ve convinced your reader that they care what you have to say, they’re more willing to read what you <em>actually have to say.</em> When the reader is ready to dive in, that’s when you can make the finer points of your argument.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that anyone is going to read every word of your essay. It’s even less likely that they’ll read them all in order.</p>
<h2 id="stumbling-blocks">Stumbling Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve got people ready to listen to you, it’s important to keep them on the same page as you. You really need to stay on top of anything that might break their focus.</p>
<p>Use short sentences. If it’s too hard to parse, people won’t.</p>
<p>Make sure your spelling and grammar have no egregious problems. You don’t need to have perfect command of the language, but you need to be able to signal that you’re trustworthy-enough to listen to. Don’t underestimate how much credibility you’ll lose from blatantly bad spelling and grammar.</p>
<p>This stuff is relatively common-sense.</p>
<p>What might be less so is that you also need to stay on top of conceptual stumbling blocks. If your argument makes a jump that feels poorly motivated or references something potentially unfamiliar, expect that your reader will experience vertigo.</p>
<p>Most of the ideas we talk about in functional programming <em>are not easy,</em> and it doesn’t do anyone any favors to pretend this isn’t so. Expect that your readers will be pretty similar to you; if you had a problem understanding a piece of your topic, <em>call that out.</em> Point out the obstacle. Point out what they might be thinking, and then very explicitly show them what they should be thinking instead.</p>
<p>For example, if your code sample uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_dependency">functional dependency</a>, it might be worth a short sentence saying “that funny bar thing is a functional dependency.” Give a tiny summary of its purpose, and provide a link for them to learn more if they need to.</p>
<p>Another illustration: if <em>you</em> originally got confused that an “algebra in recursion schemes” is not the same thing as the algebra you learned in high-school, your readers probably will too. The first time you say “algebra” in the new context, say “this is a misleading term. This has nothing to do with solving equations like you did in high-school.”</p>
<p>More important than what you’re saying is what you’re <em>not saying.</em> If you’re giving examples of something that fits a pattern, make sure you give examples of things that <em>do not</em> fit the pattern. A concept that is applicable everywhere is useful nowhere.</p>
<p>Give lots of examples. Nobody I know learns via mathematical statements, nor do they learn via long, wordy, abstract prose. People learn by seeing lots of examples, and being told explicitly how these examples relate to one another. The mathematical statements are only useful <em>after</em> you have the intuition, so save them for an appropriate time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The takeaway advice from this essay is that <em>if you want lots of readers, you must make it easy for them to read.</em></p>
<p>To that end, pay lots of attention to motivation. Why should people care what you have to say? What value does it give <em>them?</em></p>
<p>Focus your energy on the beginnings—both of the essay as a whole, and of each paragraph. People who are unconvinced by your essay’s value will skim their way through it, and they will do that by reading only the beginnings of things.</p>
<p>Make your information easy to find. Structure your argument in a tree, and make sure it supports random-access. Nobody is going to read the whole thing from start to finish. Instead they’re going to jump around, ignoring the pieces they already know, and looking for the bits they don’t.</p>
<p>Use lots of short paragraphs. A paragraph should correspond to a single idea.</p>
<p>Anticipate which parts of your argument will be difficult for your readers, and be proactive in trying to assuage those difficulties. Give lots of examples of what you’re talking about, and more importantly, what you’re not talking about.</p>
<p>Point out where you went into the weeds while learning this stuff. Steer readers away from common mistakes and misconceptions.</p>
<p>And finally, end on a high note. Leave people with a good feeling, and it will incentivize them to get to the bottom of your next piece. Inspirational calls to action are a good way to go out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tell them what you’re going to tell them. Then tell them. Finally, tell them what you told them.</p>
<p>-Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny and poignant quotes are too.</p>

<p>Hello! 👋 My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>In short, I am a company of one. I answer the customer support emails and I code and deploy new features. I also manage the <a href="https://developers.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">API docs</a> and <a href="https://support.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>, poke around the logs when there are issues, write the <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/sample_newsletter" target="_blank">bi-monthly newsletters</a> and I designed the logo!</p>

<p>As the company scales, so too must all aspects of my work which I break down into 4 parts: customer support, engineering, product and marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Finding opportunities for process optimization is honestly one of the more fun parts of running a business</strong>. I greatly attribute these to how I’ve been able to stay both solo &amp; sane up until now, currently with 600+ users and $45,000 ARR. In this post, I’m excited to share some of my most successful strategies along with anecdotes from my experience working on Lunch Money.</p>



<p>In the last 14 days, here’s what I got done across all departments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Launched an internal beta testers program and two sets of new features to test</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wrapped up a 2-week long refactor of some core components on the client-side</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Launched a major feature: advanced transaction filters</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Closed 13 tickets related to feature improvements and bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Sent out a newsletter outlining the latest new features</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This blog post</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Added new pages to the marketing site (<a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/collaboration">Collaboration</a>) and updated the icons in <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features">Features</a></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Received 239 inbound support tickets and sent out 358 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes all this work bearable for me is the fact that there is so much variety (which, of course, is the spice of life!). I love being able to switch between tasks to keep the job interesting and my mind refreshed while still being productive overall.</p>

<p><em>Case in point: I just finished a major refactor and pushed out 2 major features to beta, so writing this blog post right now feels like a vacation for my brain.</em></p>

<p>To state the obvious, I enjoy being hyper-efficient (without burning myself out, of course). Even though I am a single person, I can still automate, optimize and parallelize processes.</p>



<h2 id="implement-safeguards">Implement safeguards</h2>

<p><i>Ah, the blissful beginnings of Lunch Money when I’d push code directly to production several times a day.</i></p>

<p>At 500+ users now, those days are long gone and I’ve since needed to adopt the more boring but responsible approach of implementing safeguards to prevent shipping faulty code.</p>

<p>For one, <b>I’ve been thoroughly reviewing my own code before every change</b>. Every major feature, improvement and bug fix lives in a feature branch that I still, by habit from the corporate days, prepend with <code>jen/</code>. After verifying everything works great locally, I make sure to take a break first, whether that’s working on a completely unrelated task, going for a meal or going to bed. The point of this is to ensure that I’m code reviewing with a clear head.</p>

<p>While adhering to these standards of code reviewing myself may add extra time to my overall process, it potentially saves hours of bug-fixing, answering related support tickets and self-loathing (I’m half-kidding here) down the line if I accidentally ship bad code.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New phase of Lunch Money– no more pushing major features straight to production 🤯😂 <a href="https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L">https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L</a></p>— Jen (@lunchbag) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchbag/status/1256987437600927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2020</a></blockquote> </center>

<p><b>I also recently implemented an internal beta-testing program open to Lunch Money subscribers.</b> With more users accessing my app on a regular basis, the stakes are higher to ship a version that’s as bug-free as possible.</p>

<p>As an engineering team of one, it’s nearly impossible to always get it right the first time, despite having tests (what if I missed an edge case?) or testing locally extensively (how I think my users will use a feature is not always so).</p>

<p>The beta-testing program has provided some additional benefits. It’s nice to have a cohort of users with whom I can have a more candid conversation about Lunch Money and it’s also a great way to show users that their feedback is valued!</p>

<h2 id="automate-later-than-you-need-to">Automate later than you need to</h2>

<p>While automating tasks can save a lot of time in the long-term, it doesn’t always make sense to automate right off the bat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"><span>Obligatory XKCD comic (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/" target="_blank">link</a>)</span></p>

<p>Automating too late is not a bad thing. I’ll have done the manual work enough times to understand how to eventually automate the task and what edge cases to look out for. I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someone– it’s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who you’ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).</p>

<p>I manually triggered the emails for bi-monthly account summaries for months because I wasn’t confident the sending cadence was reasonable. After observing open rates and collecting user feedback, these are now automated to go out on the 5th &amp; 25th of every month.</p>

<p>Something that I’m glad I didn’t spend the time to automate at all was the referral program. If an existing user refers a new user and the new user subscribes to a plan, then both users will receive credit for 1 month.</p>

<p>In the end, the referral program only brought on 11 extra users. It was not a pain at all to manually process rewards for those who did. If I had spent time conjuring up all the edge cases and automating this process, it would not have been worth the time investment.</p>

<h2 id="keep-low-hanging-fruits-in-the-back-pocket">Keep low-hanging fruits in the back pocket</h2>

<p>In my task management system, I use a tag (🍏) to denote which tasks are low-hanging fruits. For the uninitiated, low-hanging fruits are quick tasks that are easy to knock out, such as one-liners or 5-minute fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YP1Jb0JNc7kqFDbdjm/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>I find that keeping these around and tackling them on days when you feel generally unmotivated can really help raise spirits. Still being able to get something completed and shipped is a great way to get out of a slump.</p>



<h2 id="timing-marketing-pushes">Timing marketing pushes</h2>

<p>At Lunch Money, a big part of the business is using the services of Plaid for bank syncing. Plaid charges on a monthly basis which means that if a user signs up on April 30, connects a bank account immediately and doesn’t end up subscribing at the end of their 14-day trial, they will charge me for this user in both April &amp; May’s invoices.</p>

<p>This realization coupled with my intense aversion to paying more than I need to has shaped a lot of practices at Lunch Money.</p>

<p>For one, the data retention policy used to be 30 days which means if your trial ends and you didn’t put in your billing information, your data will be deleted in 30 days. This certainly guarantees that I’ll be overpaying for churned users and is the reason why the data retention policy has since been revised to 5 days.</p>

<p>In total, a user who does not end up subscribing can spend up to 26 days in the Lunch Money system. This comprises of a 14-day trial, the potential for a 1 week trial extension and a 5 day grace period. Assuming enough users connect their bank accounts, the best way to minimize my costs for churned users is to ensure their lifetimes are within one calendar month.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/calendar-1.png"></p>

<p>As a result, I always schedule marketing pushes such as blog posts and product launches in the first few days of the month. When I came to this realization, my next Plaid bill went down for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="merging-marketing-and-engineering-for-a-combo-win">Merging marketing and engineering for a combo win</h2>

<p>Taking this a step further, the perk of having a spike in new users is that their trial periods more-or-less overlap. Usually when a new user signs up, they will poke around the product and maybe send in a bug report, a feature request or another piece of feedback. If I reply and address their feedback by putting in a fix or shipping their requested feature within days, more often than not, they end up converting into a happy customer.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore identified the following cycle to maximize potential conversions from spikes in user signups:</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/gantt-2.png"></p>

<p>After a marketing push, let’s say a product launch, I will see an immediate increase in signups lasting about 3 days and then slowly trailing off.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll start hearing from these new users via support tickets. I prioritize responding to them and I get to work. Showing these users that I’m committed to improving Lunch Money based on their feedback is a great and honest sales tactic.</p>

<p>About 3 days before the initial wave of user trials ends, I wrap up my engineering sprint and send out a newsletter detailing the latest features and improvements. This re-enforces to new users that the product is under continuous development.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a drip campaign that automatically notifies users a few days before their trial expires and on the actual date of expiry. This period of time is when I typically see most users convert 🤞.</p>



<p>I used to think that if I were to hire someone, it would first be a customer support agent but I’ve since been moving away from that idea. Users are constantly surprised (in a good way!) when they realize the founder is responding to their bug reports or feature requests directly.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently providing great customer support is a long-term investment for Lunch Money</strong> as it is undoubtedly a great way to turn customers into champions. As I receive and respond to support tickets, I’m also able to identify and overhaul the common sources of trouble for users.</p>

<p>I’ve always believed that customer support would be the most important and the hardest part of the business to scale, especially if I have the goal of staying a company of one.</p>

<p>Corroborating data from <a href="https://emailmeter.com/">EmailMeter</a> and my database, it seems my changes are making a difference. Despite a growing user base, inbound support emails remain fairly steady!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<h2>What it means to be wrong and why it’s bad</h2>
<h3>Logical incorrectness</h3>
<p>It’s generally better to be right than to be wrong. Since there’s more than one way to be wrong, I want to be specific about the type of wrongness I want to address in this post before I move on.</p>
<p>The type of wrongness I’m interested in in this post is logical incorrectness, like two plus two equals five.</p>
<h3>The danger of being wrong</h3>
<p>Being right or wrong isn’t just an academic concern. In programming, being wrong often has concrete negative economic (and other) impacts. Developers who are often wrong will be much less efficient and burn up much more payroll cost and opportunity cost than developers who are wrong less often.</p>
<p>Being wrong is also not something that happens every great once in a while. Most humans are wrong about a whole bunch of stuff, a lot of the time, because that’s just human nature. Even really smart people are wrong about things a very nonzero amount of the time.</p>
<p>So I want to share some things we developers can do in order to be wrong less. But first let me share a concrete example of the kind of mistakenness I’m talking about.</p>
<h2>An example of being wrong</h2>
<h3>Bug: an appointment goes missing</h3>
<p>Let’s say I’m building some scheduling software. One of my users, Rachel, reports to me that yesterday she rescheduled someone’s appointment from July 1st at 10am to July 3rd at 10am. Today, Rachel looked at both the schedule for July 1st and July 3rd and the appointment isn’t present on either day. Apparently there’s a bug that removes appointments from the schedule when you try to reschedule them.</p>
<p>So I start to look at the code and see if I can find any evidence that this buggy behavior is present. Unfortunately, the code is very complicated, and my investigation takes a long time. My investigation lasts an entire day. By the end of the day I’ve made almost no progress toward fixing the bug.</p>
<h3>The bug was not the bug</h3>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, the thing I thought was the bug was not actually the bug. In fact, there was no bug. Between the time Rachel rescheduled the appointment and the time Rachel found the appointment missing, another user, Janice. deleted the appointment. There was in fact no bug at all. I was wrong. I wasted a whole day as a consequence of being wrong.</p>
<h2>How to be less wrong</h2>
<p>We developers can be wrong less of the time by studying <b>epistemology</b>. Epistemology is a branch of philosophy which deals with the acquisition of knowledge. Epistemology tells us how we can know, with certainty, what’s true and what isn’t.</p>
<p>More narrowly, we can study <b>logic</b>. Logic is a branch of philosophy that deals with a formal system of reasoning. One of the central ideas of logic is that of an <b>argument</b>. Arguments are the ideas we’ll be focusing on in this post.</p>
<h2>The definition of a logical argument</h2>
<p>An argument is a group of statements including one or more <b>premises</b> and one and only one <b>conclusion</b>. (I shamelessly stole this definition word-for-word from <a href="http://www.uky.edu/~rosdatte/phi120/lesson1a.htm">this web page</a>.)</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about what a premise is and what a conclusion is. As an aid I’ll share an example of a logical argument, henceforth just referred to as an “argument”.</p>
<h3>Argument example</h3>
<blockquote><p>
All fish live in water.<br>
All sharks are fish.<br>
Therefore, all sharks live in water.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument contains two premises. “All fish live in water” is a premise. “All sharks are fish” is also a premise.</p>
<p>This argument’s conclusion is of course “Therefore, all sharks live in water”. If it’s true that all fish live in water and it’s true that all sharks are fish, then it’s of course true that all sharks live in water.</p>
<h2>Validity and soundness</h2>
<p>Not all arguments are good ones. An argument can be <b>valid</b> or <b>invalid</b> and <b>sound</b> or <b>unsound</b>.</p>
<h3>Validity</h3>
<p>An argument is <b>valid</b> if the truth of the argument’s conclusion is logically connected to the argument’s premises. Our above fish/shark argument is a valid argument because, if the argument’s premises are true, its conclusion must necessarily be true. We could make the argument invalid by changing some things.</p>
<blockquote><p>
All fish live in water.<br>
All sharks are fish.<br>
Therefore, all sharks have fins.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument isn’t valid because its conclusion doesn’t logically flow from its premises. It happens to be true that all sharks have fins, but that fact isn’t true as a natural consequence of this argument’s premises, so the argument isn’t valid.</p>
<p>Note that validity doesn’t have anything to do with truth. An argument can be valid even if its premises aren’t true.</p>
<blockquote><p>
All turtles are invisible.<br>
Everyone has a turtle in their brain.<br>
Therefore, everyone has an invisible turtle in their brain.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The premises of the above argument aren’t true (at least as far as I know) but the argument is nonetheless valid.</p>
<h3>Soundness</h3>
<p>An argument is <b>sound</b> if the argument is valid and its premises are true. Our first argument (“all fish live in water, all sharks are fish, therefore all sharks live in water”) is sound because the argument is valid and its premises are true. <b>Sound arguments always have true conclusions.</b></p>
<p>Here’s another sound argument.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every 20th century American president has been male.<br>
Richard Nixon was a 20th century American president.<br>
Richard Nixon was male.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now comes the fun part, where we apply logical arguments to programming. </p>
<h2>Arguments in programming</h2>
<p>Read the following argument, keeping in mind the definitions of validity and soundness. See if you can tell if the argument is valid or invalid, sound or unsound. (If you don’t want a spoiler, don’t scroll past the argument until you’ve read the full argument.)</p>
<blockquote><p>
The site is unusually slow today.<br>
We performed a large deployment this morning.<br>
The deployment is the cause of the slowness.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument is <b>unsound</b>. Even if the premises are true, we can’t know based on the premises that the deployment was the cause of the slowness. How do we know it’s not a coincidence? For all we know, our site got featured on Hacker News and a big traffic spike is the cause of the slowness. Our argument is unsound because its conclusion isn’t necessarily true based on its premises. So, the reason that the argument is unsound is because even though its premises are true, its logic is invalid.</p>
<p>Here’s another example. Instead of just two premises, this argument has three.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Sometimes slowness is caused by code changes.<br>
Sometimes slowness is caused by traffic spikes.<br>
The site is unusually slow today.<br>
The cause of the slowness is either a code change or a traffic spike.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument is also unsound. There are more possible reasons for a site to be slow than just a code change or a traffic spike. For example, maybe our DevOps person killed half the servers in the middle of the night last night without our knowing it. So despite true premises, this argument, like the preceding one, is <b>invalid</b>.</p>
<p>Here’s another example.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The code in the most recent deployment introduced a bug.<br>
The only thing that went out in the most recent deployment was Josh’s code.<br>
Josh’s code caused the bug.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As long as this argument’s premises are true, this argument is <b>sound</b>. If we know for sure that the most recent deployment introduced a bug, and we know for sure that the only thing that went out in the most recent deployment was Josh’s code, then it does logically follow that Josh’s code caused the bug.</p>
<p>Here’s a final example. This one is a little more detailed than the previous ones.</p>
<blockquote><p>
At 10:32am, a duplicate $20 charge appeared in the system for patient #5225.<br>
Also at 10:32am, Jason carelessly performed a manual actual action on patient #5225, an action that was related to that patient’s $20 charge.<br>
Jason caused the duplicate charge.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is another <b>unsound</b> argument. Even though it sounds likely that my action caused the duplicate charge, it’s not logically valid to make that inference based on the premises. The invalidity is perhaps not obvious, but can be made more apparent by asking the question: “Are there any possible circumstances under which Jason’s manual action would NOT have created the duplicate charge?” For example, it’s possible that the card could have accidentally been run twice, and the timing was a coincidence.</p>
<p>I have empirical proof of the invalidity of the above argument because this is a real-life example and, in fact, my action was not the cause of the duplicate charge. Part of what helped me determine this is the following sound argument.</p>
<blockquote><p>
It’s impossible to create a charge without having a patient’s credit card information.<br>
It would have been physically impossible for me to involve the patient’s credit card information when I performed my manual action because we don’t store credit card information in the system.<br>
My action couldn’t have created the duplicate charge.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The preceding sound argument (and remember, sound arguments always have true conclusions) led me to investigate more deeply. What I ultimately discovered was that the patient’s card did in fact get run twice and the timing was just a coincidence. Why wasn’t it obvious from the outset that the patient’s card was run twice? Because we use Authorize.net as a payment gateway, and apparently sometimes the Authorize.net API returns a failure response even when the charge was successfully incurred, so from the perspective of our application there was only one charge that got successfully created, even though in reality there were two.</p>
<h2>Good luck with your arguments</h2>
<p>Next time you’re confronted with a programming mystery, I invite you to frame your mystery in terms of arguments. Write down your premises, and make sure to write down only premises that are true, otherwise your argument will be unsound. Then try to come up with a conclusion and make sure that your conclusion necessarily follows from your premises so that your argument is valid. If your argument is valid and sound, your conclusion will necessarily be true.</p>

I always like pointing out this fact when I teach classes on gesture, because it gives us an an interesting perspective on how we learn and use gestures. Until now I’ve mostly cited <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnature%2Fjournal%2Fv396%2Fn6708%2Fabs%2F396228a0.html&amp;t=ZjI3ODlkYTk0MjZhMTQ3OTdkZTY3OWE3MjA1YzU0NTI2N2JmYTk3MixqY2RYbFZ2Qw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A0DQa0-vgmaHanljYXgHk5w&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superlinguo.com%2Fpost%2F149950073272%2Fblind-people-gesture-and-why-thats-kind-of-a-big&amp;m=0" target="_blank">a 1998 paper from Jana Iverson and Susan Goldin-Meadow</a> that analysed the gestures and speech of young blind people. Not only do blind people gesture, but the frequency and types of gestures they use does not appear to differ greatly from how sighted people gesture. If people learn gesture without ever <i>seeing</i> a gesture (and, most likely, never being shown), then there must be something about learning a language that means you get gestures as a bonus.</p><p>Blind people will even gesture when talking to other blind people, and sighted people will gesture when speaking on the phone - so we know that people don’t <i>only </i>gesture when they speak to someone who can see their gestures. <br></p><p>Earlier this year a new paper came out that adds to this story. Şeyda Özçalışkan, Ché Lucero and Susan Goldin-Meadow looked at the gestures of blind speakers of Turkish and English, to see if the *way* they gestured was different to sighted speakers of those languages. Some of the sighted speakers were blindfolded and others left able to see their conversation partner. <br></p><p>Turkish and English were chosen, because it has already been established that speakers of those languages <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DExpressing%2Bmanner%2Band%2Bpath%2Bin%2BEnglish%2Band%2BTurkish%253A%2BDifferences%2Bin%2Bspeech%252C%2Bgesture%252C%2Band%2Bconceptualization.%26btnG%3D%26as_sdt%3D1%252C5%26as_sdtp%3D&amp;t=N2I4ZTYyZmU0ZTFlOWY3NjMwYzliYjNiNjQ3MTQyZWJmNGJjZThhMCxqY2RYbFZ2Qw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A0DQa0-vgmaHanljYXgHk5w&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superlinguo.com%2Fpost%2F149950073272%2Fblind-people-gesture-and-why-thats-kind-of-a-big&amp;m=0" target="_blank">consistently gesture differently</a> when talking about videos of items moving. English speakers will be more likely to show the manner (e.g. ‘rolling’ or bouncing’) and trajectory (e.g. ‘left to right’, ‘downwards’) together in one gesture, and Turkish speakers will show these features as two separate gestures. This reflects the fact that English ‘roll down’ is one verbal clause, while in Turkish the equivalent would be<i> yuvarlanarak iniyor</i>, which translates as two verbs ‘rolling descending’. <br></p><p>Since we know that blind people <i>do</i> gesture, Özçalışkan’s team wanted to figure out if they gestured like other speakers of their language. Did the blind Turkish speakers separate the manner and trajectory of their gestures like their verbs? Did English speakers combine them? Of course, the standard methodology of showing videos wouldn’t work with blind participants, so the researchers built three dimensional models of events for people to feel before they discussed them.<br></p><p>The results showed that blind Turkish speakers gesture like their sighted counterparts, and the same for English speakers. All Turkish speakers gestured significantly differently from all English speakers, regardless of sightedness. This means that these particular gestural patterns are something that’s deeply linked to the grammatical properties of a language, and not something that we learn from looking at other speakers. <br></p><p><b>References</b><br></p><p>Jana M.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), of which SHA-256 is a part, is one of the most popular <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hashing algorithms</a> out there. In this article, we are going to break down each step of the algorithm as simple as we can and work through a real-life example by hand.</p>



<p>SHA-2 is known for its security (it hasn’t <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://shattered.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken down like SHA-1</a>), and its speed. In cases where <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">keys are not being generated</a>, such as mining Bitcoin, a fast hash algorithm like SHA-2 often reigns supreme.</p>



<h2><span id="What_Is_a_Hash_Function">What Is a Hash Function?</span>
</h2>



<p>If you want to read more about hash functions in general, do so <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">here</a>. That said, in order to move forward let’s recap three of the main purposes of a hash function:</p>



<ul>
<li>To scramble data deterministically</li>
<li>To accept input of any length and output a fixed-length result</li>
<li>To irreversibly manipulate data. The input can’t be derived from the output</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="SHA-2_vs_SHA-256">SHA-2 vs SHA-256</span>
</h2>



<p>SHA-2 is an <em>algorithm</em>, a generalized idea of how to hash data. SHA-256 sets additional constants that define the SHA-2 algorithm’s behavior. One such constant is the output size. “256” and “512” refer to their respective output digest sizes in bits.</p>



<p>Let’s step through an example of SHA-256.</p>



<h2><span id="SHA-256_hello_world_Step_1_-_Pre-Processing">SHA-256 “hello world”; Step 1 – Pre-Processing</span>
</h2>



<ul><li>Convert “hello world” to binary:</li></ul>
