  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Over the past 8 weeks, I built a HomeKit accessory to open and close the gate at the end of my driveway.  The project was really fun, and this document outlines the process of creating it, from concept to working prototype.</p>

<h3 id="additional-background">Additional Background</h3>

<p>Programming examples for microcontrollers will be in C++.  For the most part, we’ll be sticking essentially to “C with Classes”, which is typical of most Arduino and other microcontroller projects.</p>

<p>The data in this document is by no means meant to be comprehensive.  I am not an electrical engineer, and welcome any corrections or other feedback.  Where possible, I’ve cited references or resources I found useful at each step.  For the most part, extensive googling served as the primary research tool.</p>

<p>The swing gate in question is a Sentex Crown Jewel, which was available in the early 2000s. It interfaces with a home phone system to control 1 or 2 relays.  Programming is performed either via the gate keypad, or via 300 baud modem connected to a Windows program.  Later in this document we’ll show how to use a listening modem to eavesdrop on the communication to reverse engineer the app-only commands which are not in the publicly available references.</p>

<p>Further data for those interested can be found</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://p.widencdn.net/51eik7/6001141">Crown Jewel Programming manual</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://p.widencdn.net/np06ng/6001145">Crown Jewel Installation manual</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>The problem I aimed to solve was to interface the gate microcontroller to HomeKit.  The only interfaces to the gate are a keypad (outside the gate) and a home phone line.  The previous owners did not install the manual operation switch, so I would frequently forget to open the gate when walking into town, get to the gate, then go back inside to dial the phone access code.  It would be great to just pull out a phone or say “hey Siri open the gate”.</p>

<p>First thing to do is to decompose the goal into tasks small enough that each can have easily understandable requirements and success criteria.  Another benefit of this process is that having many small tasks to complete will give us a sense of accomplishment and provide motivation as we complete them 🙂</p>

<h3 id="problem-1---phone-interface-to-swing-gate">Problem 1 - Phone Interface to Swing Gate</h3>

<p>Objective: Implement software library that can send and receive phone number tones, and communicate with a 300 baud modem.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detect when phone is off hook, and listen for DTMF tones to keep HomeKit state in sync when other users control the gate from the phone line.</li>
  <li>Take phone off hook and dial numbers to control gate relay.</li>
  <li>Communicate via 300 baud modem (Bell 103) protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-2---homekit-support">Problem 2 - HomeKit Support</h3>

<p>Objective: The microcontroller + phone line interface should appear as a home kit accessory.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Successfully pair the device with HomeKit</li>
  <li>Implement a service that  allows opening and closing the gate</li>
  <li>Demonstrate control via “Hey Siri open the gate”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-3---physical-prototype">Problem 3 - Physical prototype</h3>

<p>Objective: Combine the proofs of concept of the phone interface, and homekit device, into a single logic board, have that board manufactured, and enclose it in a case.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Capture a schematic which contains all necessary circuits for correct operation of the system.</li>
  <li>Arrange the physical design of those components and signals into a printed circuit board using a CAD program.</li>
  <li>Manufacture the board.</li>
  <li>Enclose the assembled board in a case so we can handle it safely and easily.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="phone-interface-to-swing-gate">Phone Interface to Swing Gate</h2>

<p>The first piece of the project is the phone line interface.  Reviewing the requirements from earlier, our first requirement is “Detect when phone is off hook, and listen for DTMF tones”.</p>

<p>Decomposing this further, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand how to interface a microcontroller to a phone line</li>
  <li>Understand how to take the phone “off hook”</li>
  <li>Do some signal processing to detect tones, for example, someone pressing the number “9” on a phone keypad.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="digital-access-arrangement">Digital Access Arrangement</h3>

<p>In the United States, home phone lines usually consist of a pair of wires, Tip and Ring, with a nominal -48VDC between them.  These wires carry the signal (voice or data), and the voltage and resistance between them indicates various states (on hook, off hook, ringing, etc.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service" title="Wikipedia Plain Old Telephone Service">Additional info at Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Since the voltage on the lines (48v) is well above that typically interfaced to a microcontroller (1.8-5.0v), we need some circuitry to extract the signal from the phone line, convert it to a voltage compatible with our processor.  Additionally, this circuitry should provide isolation of our circuitry from the phone circuit, to protect against transient voltage spikes.  A nice discussion of isolation is <a href="https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN1167.pdf" title="Safety Considerations for Silicon Labs Series Capacitor Isolators">here</a>.  In this application we’ve chosen to use a surge suppression capacitor that will fail open but magnetic isolation via a small transformer is also common in modem designs.</p>

<p>Since there are quite a few components in even simplified / cost reduced DAA’s (see page 21, &lt;&gt;) I opted to buy a reference board for the <a href="https://ixysic.com/Products/LITELINK.htm">Ixys CPC5622 Litelink III DAA</a>. Additional info can be found in the <a href="https://www.ixysic.com/home/pdfs.nsf/www/UG-LLIII-EB.pdf/$file/UG-LLIII-EB.pdf">CPC5622-EVAL Evaluation Board Users Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-arduino-uno">Integration With Arduino Uno</h3>

<p>Connecting the Eval board for the Litelink DAA to the Arduino so that we can start looking at phone line signals is pretty straight forward.  Looking at the Fritzing diagram below, we’ve connected an I2C oled to the Uno so we can see what’s happening.  The eval board implements DC-blocking capacitors on the TX/RX lines, so we implement a voltage divider with a pair of resistors, and connect the RX line (pink) from the 5622 to A0 on the Uno, putting the “zero point” at 1.65V (3.3/2).  We wire up a phone jack to the J1 header on the eval board, and we connect 3.3v through a 10k resistor to AREF on the Uno, setting the analog reference for ADC measurements at 3.3 * 32/(32+10) == 2.5v.  Since the Uno doesn’t have a differential ADC, the Vpp (peak to peak voltage) on the RX+ line from the eval board should be &lt;1V so we shouldn’t clip under normal operation, and get more precision out of the ADC by using more of its range vs. the standard 0-5V.  “Off Hook” (orange) is pulled up as required by the 5622.</p>

<p><img src="https://sampo3k.github.io/images/fritzing.jpg" alt="5622EVAL Fritzing"></p>

<p>Success!  At this point, we can read A0, and see the voltage held roughly constant at 1.65v when on hook, and if you pick up a receiver on the phone line connected to the 5622, you will start seeing the voltage vary as the call progress (dial) tone is received, or connect an oscilloscope and visualize it.</p>
<h3 id="digital-signal-processing">Digital Signal Processing</h3>

<p>Now we have an analog signal into our Uno, and can move on to the next requirement: decode DTMF tones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling" title="Link to Wikipedia article on DTMF">Dual-tone multi-frequency</a> (DTMF) is way each key on a phone key pad is converted into analog signals.  The wikipedia article does a really good job summarizing what’s going on.</p>

<p>At this point we need to do some Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to figure out which frequencies are present in the signal we’re receiving, and then see if there are exactly two strong signals that happen to be one of the 16 DTMF pairs.</p>

<p>I’m not going to go too deeply into DSP here, but for a better understanding of what we’re trying to do, I cannot recommend these two resources highly enough.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/">Intro to DSP</a>: This website has amazing interactive tutorials that explains some of the fundamentals of digital signal processing in a really neat and useful way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.dspguide.com/">DSP book</a>: This book is a wealth of information on DSP techniques, and the PDFs of each chapter are available for free.  With some effort, you can even concatenate them together into the entire book :)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tone-detection">Tone Detection</h3>

<p>For DTMF, the typical sequence we are looking for is &gt;=100ms of tone and &gt;=100ms of silence repeated for however many digits we are listening for.</p>

<p>The common approach to frequency detection is an FFT.  However, the performance of the 16MHz ATMega328P makes this difficult.  For example, we need the FFT bins about 70Hz apart or less to discriminate the DTMF tones.  So that means at 8KHz we need roughly  8000/70 = 114 samples or more.  Rounding up to a convenient power of 2 for the FFT, we’ll say 256/2 = 128 FFT bins. The bins will be 8KHz / 128 = 62.5Hz apart.</p>

<p>To do a 256 sample FFT, in addition to a reasonable amount of memory, we’d need something on the order of ~8k multiplies and ~8k additions, which given the performance of 16x16+32 MAC is around 50 cycles, our most wildly optimistic projection here if we hand coded a great FFT is like 25-30ms, or about 0.5x realtime. This seems to line up well with the results on this <a href="https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2019/03/arduino-fft-pt-2-improving-the-hardware-for-real-time-analysis/" title="Arduino FFT pt. 2: Improving the Hardware for Real-time Analysis">Arduino FFT post</a>. We also use the same performance hack noted there to reduce the ADC prescaler on the ATMega328 so that ADC reads don’t take so long.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goertzel_algorithm">Goertzel algorithm</a> which is essentially a single-frequency digital filter.  Doing 8 applications of the Goertzel algorithm including the ADC reads only takes about 12ms, which is about 1.2x realtime.  I think, based on the output of <a href="https://godbolt.org/">https://godbolt.org</a> that AVR GCC is generating full 32x32 multiplies for 16x16+32 -&gt; 32 MAC so some hand assembly could probably make this go faster.</p>

<p>In order to generate some test cases for our code, I used this <a href="https://www.audiocheck.net/audiocheck_dtmf.php">DTMF WAV file generator</a> and converted the resulting WAV files into virtual ADC samples in the range of our analog circuit.  I then ran our detection code, to verify the algorithm correctness before moving it to the Uno.  A reasonable sample Goertzel implementation can be found <a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/design_tip/dm00446805-the-goertzel-algorithm-to-compute-individual-terms-of-the-discrete-fourier-transform-dft-stmicroelectronics.pdf" title="The Goertzel algorithm to compute individual terms of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)">here</a></p>

<h3 id="bell-103">Bell 103</h3>

<p>Programming the gate microcontroller is done via the 300 baud modem protocol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_103_modem">Bell 103</a>.  The RX side of this seems well within the Uno’s capabilities, as we can likely count the number of zero crossings in every 3ms baud window to discriminate between the mark and space frequencies used by the <a href="http://edge.rit.edu/content/P09141/public/FSK.pdf">FSK</a> encoding.</p>

<p>The TX side however, seems much trickier on the Uno.  The Uno lacks a DAC, and while you can create one using PWM on a digital pin and then put it through a low pass filter, this seemed like a lot of work.  About this time I also wanted to get going on HomeKit portion of the project, and I took the easy way out: using an actual modem.</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://functional.christmas/2020/8 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://functional.christmas/2020/8">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last year I wrote <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/20">an article</a> explaining functors in simple terms and show why they are useful. It has well received, but some felt it was lacking in details which is true and by design. There is more to be said and some crucial details that I glossed over so I will try to address some of them now. Let’s get nerdy!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Functor as a context</h2>
<p>In the previous article I said you could think of a functor as a structure or container that has a mapping function. This is not strictly wrong as it is one way of thinking about the concept, but can be a bit misleading and confusing as it does not fit all situations. For example a functions can in some cases be a functor. A structure might give us thoughts about data structures or types. Container is fitting when talking about lists or other types that can contain data. Is a function a structure or container? For this reason it is common to refer to some of the general concepts and abstractions we use in FP (functor, monad etc.) as contexts which has some properties.</p>
<h2>The functor laws</h2>
<p>Unlike my vague explanation in the previous article a functor is actually a very specific thing, and is defined by rules or properties the context has to adhere to. These laws come from mathematics, specifically a branch called Category Theory. This is an area that I will not claim much knowledge of but great minds have found similarities between this particular part of mathematics and what we do in programming. </p>
<p>In addition to having the <code>map</code> function, functors needs to follow some rules.
The rules for functors are often called the functor laws. I'm not completely sure why. It might have something to do with math and also its sounds very sophisticated. :P Let’s get in on the sophistication!</p>
<h3>1. Law of preservation of identity</h3>
<p>The first law or rule of functors is that if the <code>map</code> function is given the identity function as its mapping function it will return the same functor.
The identity function is just a function that has one argument which it returns right back (<code>\x -&gt; x</code> in Elm or <code>function(x){return x;}</code> in JS).</p>
<p>Let’s use lists to visualize this a bit more. Elm actually has the identity function in its standard library so we will just use that one:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>List.map</span> <span>identity</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the javascript example we will add the identify function inline:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> x<span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When following this law the functor can not make any weird changes to the result. <code>List.map someFunction [1,2,3,4]</code> can never return an empty list. It can only map the function over the values. When mapping over a 4 item list, the returning list will always be a 4 item list. </p>
<h3>2. Law of composition</h3>
<p>The second law is not very complicated either but assumes that you know about composition. Lets quickly go through composition before looking at the next law.</p>
<h4>Composition</h4>
<p>Composition in functional programming (FP) is the ability to compose multiple functions into one single function. This is not often used in object oriented programming (OOP) but quite common in FP. </p>
<p>Composition is "gluing" functions together into one function. This is such a common thing to do that many languages have dedicated operators for this. Lets look at an example to see it in action to see why this might be useful. I'll be doing the examples in Elm as composition is a bit awkward in javascript and not that common.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a user record that has the fields name and age:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>:</span> <span>String</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To get the age of a User record we can in Elm use an accessor function which is available for every field defined in a record.<sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup> For the <code>age</code> field this function is called <code>.age</code> and has the type signature <code>User -&gt; Int</code>. It takes a <code>User</code> type as an argument and returns a <code>Int</code>. In this case it is the content of the age field.</p>
<p>Go get the age from a user you would to: </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code>
<span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>}</span>


<span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>user</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>At some point in your program you might have a <code>User</code> and need to display the age on a webpage, print it in a log or anything else that needs the age to be a string. To convert a <code>Int</code> into a <code>String</code> we can use the built-in function <code>fromInt</code> in the String module. </p>
<p>So where you have a user and need the age as a string you can use the compose operator in Elm to create a new function that gives you the user age as a string. I will write the type signatures for the functions as well so we can see how they fit together: </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>:</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>

<span>fromInt</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>

<span>ageAsString</span> <span>:</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>ageAsString</span> <span>=</span> <span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>fromInt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When the output of a function matches the input of another we can compose them together and make a new function that has the input of the first and output of the second. Note that <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the rightwards compose operator.<sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup></p>
<h4>The second law</h4>
<p>Now that you hopefully know a bit about function composition lets look at the second law of functors. The rule says that composing functions into a single function and then mapping that function over the functor should produce the same result as mapping the individual functions over the functor in sequence. Lets look as some code to make sense of it:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>users</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>User</span>
<span>users</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>[</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Mary"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>22</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Kevin"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>

<span>agesThroughMaps</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>String</span>
<span>agesThroughMaps</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>users</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List.map</span> <span>.</span><span>age</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List.map</span> <span>String.fromInt</span>

<span>agesThroughComposeAndMap</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>String</span>
<span>agesThroughComposeAndMap</span> <span>=</span> 
	<span>List.map</span> <span>(</span><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>String.fromInt</span><span>)</span> <span>users</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above we have a list of users and two constants<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> that both are a list of the users’ ages as strings. </p>
<p>The first constant, <code>agesThroughMaps</code>, is defined using two map operations. The first run passes the <code>.age</code> accessor function to <code>map</code> and gives us a list of ages (of type <code>Int</code>). In the second map operation the <code>String.fromInt</code> is used to create a list of the users’ ages as <code>String</code>. </p>
<p>For the last constant, <code>agesTthroughMaps</code>, the list of the users age is created with one map operation where the function passed in to <code>map</code> is composed of the <code>.age</code> and <code>fromInt</code> functions with the compose operator (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>). </p>
<p>And this is the result of the second law: the values in the two constants should be equal. A list of strings: <code>["20", "22", "30"]</code></p>
<p>See full example in Ellie: <a href="https://ellie-app.com/bKhq8M4vyjYa1">https://ellie-app.com/bKhq8M4vyjYa1</a></p>
<h2>The consequences of the laws</h2>
<p>The laws might seem a bit random and not very helpful at first glance, but it can actually help us a lot. To be a functor the structure/container/context has to follow these laws. It can not do anything weird with the value/values in it or the function that is passed inn. The only thing it can do is apply the function to the value in the context. The functor might have some extra logic around when to apply the function. A list might be empty so there would be nothing to apply the function to and similarly with <code>Maybe</code>. Take a look at <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/20">last years article</a> to see a more complex example.</p>
<p>With these rules for what constitutes a functor in place the behavior of functors become predictable. So if we see it in code or talk about it with fellow coders we know exactly how it should behave! 😄</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>To make matters worse: the company behind the app were in the middle of a perfect storm. The business was being changed by regulation. The core business idea were changing. This meant large changes coming to the digital side, including the app.</p>
<p>Naturally, we had quite mixed feelings about our ability to meet delivery expectations from the business side, given the bad state of the app codebase. We were at a crossroads, and felt we had to pick one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Negotiate a feature timeout while we frantically renovate the core code, or</li>
<li>Start a long-term migration plan towards a hybrid app, or</li>
<li>Write new features in React Native and eventually move all the JS code over to a new app shell</li>
</ol>
<p>We decided to try out React Native. Roughly three years later, the app is now 100% JavaScript. The big business transformation has come a long way, and I’ve experienced that React Native as a technology has played a key role in that success.</p>
<p>This article contains some reflections on <em>why</em> switching from pure native technologies to React Native worked so well for us.</p>
<h2>Starting Out Small Felt Really Safe</h2>
<p>We gave React Natives two tests. First, we wrote a small feature with a few developers. Futhermore, we did a larger, several-month feature where the entire team participated. A critical part of the tests was making sure that React Native would work as the small cogwheel it would necessarily start out as, inside of the large legacy app monster.</p>
<p>The people involved in each phase would evaluate the React Native developer experience, carefully considering if moving forward with React Native would be the right choice for us. After all, continuing with RN would mean a long migration process. Lots of our features would exist in the old, smelly native code for a long time, we would have to manually ensure backwards compatibility, handle (deep) navigation from old to new code (and vice verca), and lots of other things.</p>
<p>Even with these challenges in mind, the team were crystal clear post-testing. React Native made work easier, faster and more fun! In case we’d conclude differently, the investment made was so low that we could safely discard the effort as a proof-of-concept, where the learnings were enough to justify the time spent.</p>
<p>Trying out new technology this way just seems like a very smart way to do it. It was also key that it was the voice of the developers spending all day with the technology that weighed the most.</p>
<h2>We Actually Did Develop New Features Much Faster</h2>
<p>They say React Native save you half the work. Since your code will run on both iOS and Android, it eliminates the need to develop separate code &nbsp;for each platform. Write code once – not twice. Neat!</p>
<p>In our experience, this was mostly true. We did end up doing minor platform customizations here and there. Shadows don’t work as well on Android as iOS. Sometimes you’d want different UI behaviours to adhere to platform guidelines. And as with web development, you’ll encounter visual bugs for each platform that need special attention.</p>
<p><strong>I’d say we saved about 45% of the work involved.</strong> It’s not half - but it still makes a tremendous difference on productivity!</p>
<p>It’s also hard to not talk about the productivity boost obtained by Hot Reload (now Fast Refresh). Seeing the effect of my last code edit presented visually on screen immediately (with state preserved) is simply marvelous. Scale up the time saved for each little change with the amount of the developers involved and the amount of time spent… it’s just huge!</p>
<p><img src="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/blog/assets/fastrefresh.gif" alt="animation showing how react-native's &quot;Fast Refresh&quot; works" title="React Native's &quot;Fast Refresh&quot;"></p>
<h2>All Developers Code For Both Platforms</h2>
<p>I’ve met hundreds of fine developers, if not thousands. But those skilled and efficient in both native iOS and native Android development - I can count them on one hand. And they’re not exactly looking for work.</p>
<p>With React Native, we experienced that the entire team could do work for both platforms. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this fact. Instead of having dedicated iOS and Android teams, we’d have a feature being made by the same person (or small group) on both platforms, reducing the overhead involved in coordination and organization between devs and designers, business folks, product owners, etc. Also, fewer people needed to learn the ins and outs of that particular feature in a quite complex domain.</p>
<p>This provides great flexibility and robustness for a development team, and was much needed in our setting.</p>
<h2>Recruitment and Onboarding</h2>
<p>Not too many people are familiar with native mobile technologies. In comparison, capable JavaScript/React-developers come a dime a dozen. We found that finding talent was easier, and the newcomers found themselves productive way quicker than we’d expect. In a period with frantic scaling and expansion, this was critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine recruiting top-notch mobile development specialists is easier if you’re a huge company with infinite resources. In that case, you could staff the necessary amount of specialist teams for iOS and Android and just steamroll whatever you’re making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Norwegian market, with finite resources, easing your requirements from <em>«five years of Swift»</em> to <em>«five years of JavaScript experience»</em> makes all the difference. The programming language in itself is one thing, but there’s also the ecosystem, development enviroment, IDE, etc. Apple make a lot of really sweet products, but XCode surely isn’t one of them.</p>
<h2>Team Organization</h2>
<p>Our old codebase was.. entangled. I imagine it would be challenging to attempt doing distributed development on the same codebase across several teams. At least when aiming for near-continuous delivery. Doing a Spotify-like product team organization with an app dev in each team seemed utopian at the time.</p>
<p>Over the course of a few years, we went from a dedicated mobile team of five to a product team organization with near 20 mobile developer spread across all teams. This would be much harder without the flexibility and familiarity of <em>«it’s just JavaScript»</em> or <em>«it´s just React»</em>. Not having to invest as much time and energy in specialist competencies for iOS or Android, app devs have more cognitive surplus to work on other things as well - web, cloud stuff, backend, UX-collaboration, etc.</p>
<h2>Deploy To Production At Will</h2>
<p>Mobile apps have always had a longer way to production. The <em>«quality control»</em> mechanism with manual app reviews adds several days to the pipeline. The Apple App Store was alone responsible for up to a 14-day delay at it’s worst, although the wait times have been vastly reduced since then. Now they’re averaging at about a day.</p>
<p>A good dev team in 2020 will deploy to production many times each day. Looking at some of the biggest Norwegian apps today, it is not uncommon to see two-three-four week old builds as the most recent one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The negative effects of not releasing your code often, and not even having the possibility to release at will, are well documented. React Native with it’s <em>over the air</em>-update called <em>CodePush</em> allows for continous delivery, even for mobile apps!&nbsp;</p>
<p>CodePush allows your app code to download the latest version of the compressed JavaScript bundle from a third-party server. When a user opens the app, the new bundle is downloaded and immediately installed. Voilà – immediate deploy to production!</p>
<p>Our app’s release cycle went from semi-monthly to several releases per day. Paired with great monitoring, this reduces the need for testing. Non-critical bugs can be tolerated to a larger degree if they don’t reach your entire audience before they’re automatically detected and shortly fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product development is also way faster. The team can iterate on small changes on real customers in production as a part of the development process, instead of lengthy sketching and laboratory user testing. This made the entire organization more customer-focused and impatient for real customer feedback.</p>
<h2>A Note On The Rewrite</h2>
<p>The whole codebase transformation to React Native took about two years. We only wrote already-planned new features in React Native, allowing us to be productive and produce new features during the process. The business transformation underway meant that most of the features would have required changes anyway, and it could actually be faster to implement them from scratch in React Native than to modify the legacy code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meant that we didn’t need a feature-freeze period with the team stuck on unproductive rewrite work. However, when most of the old app was rewritten, we needed a month-long cleanup to move all the separate features in the old app over to a new, fresh React Native repo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From around March 2017 until June 2019 the app was in a state where some features existed in the old codebase and others in the new codebase. That wasn’t a pleasant situation, but not more unpleasant than working in the old legacy codebase before.</p>
<h2>Status As We’re Looming On 2021</h2>
<p>A total of <strong>10,000 commits</strong> have been made by <strong>33 contributors</strong> across <strong>5 teams.</strong>. Nearly 50 pull-requests from 14 authors was merged the past week. Our ability to deliver on business requirements have been strengthened. Looking back on our big choice of 2017, it’s truly awe-inspiring to see how big an effect a simple technology choice can have on helping teams reach lofty goals.</p>
<p>No technology is a silver bullet. React Native surely isn’t either. But it does have some truly wonderful effects on an impatient, agile, modern development organization that Swift, Kotlin or C# currently can’t offer, in my opinion.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message. When a message is encrypted with a secure algorithm, i.e. an encryption cipher, no one should be able to read it without the decryption key. However, the promise of security falls apart if the encryption algorithm is weak, or if someone has created a backdoor. In this article we’ll examine the modern history of encryption. We’ll learn that while the mathematical underpinnings of modern encryption is stronger than ever, government agencies have a history of thwarting efforts to reach the goal of truly secure communication. </p>
</section><article><section><p>The world’s first encryption ciphers often used algorithms that were themselves secret. The rather intuitive belief that security increases if the encryption details are hidden is a misconception, and is often referred to as <em>security by obscurity</em>. The algorithms that dominate the modern era rely on full openness, in accordance with <em>Kerckhoffs's principle</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This transparency allows the rest of the world to attempt to break the cipher. Every failed attempt at breaking a cipher reinforces the belief that it is secure. While there is a chance that someone breaks a cipher and does not report it, there is a far greater chance that a homemade algorithm will be broken easily.</p>
<h2>A big moment in cryptographic history</h2>
<p>Up until 1972 there was no standard cipher for encrypting secret messages. The US <em>National Bureau of Standards (NBS)</em>, which later became the <em>National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)</em>, started an initiative for finding a single secure algorithm. This was rather revolutionary. The American government had traditionally kept their knowledge of cryptography to themselves - they considered it to be crucial to national security. As a result of the NIST initiative, several ciphers were proposed as candidates for the first encryption standard.</p>
<p>The most promising candidate was contributed by a team of cryptographers working at IBM. They developed a refined version of an earlier encryption cipher called Lucifer, which was first developed by Horst Feistel in the late 1960s. Their candidate was a block cipher with a key size of 128 bits. A block cipher is an algorithm that encrypts several bits at a time, i.e. a block of bits, as opposed to stream ciphers that encrypts bit by bit. A sufficiently large key size is necessary for a cipher to withstand brute force attacks, since these attacks generate all possible decryption keys. In context of a brute force attack, one would say that the larger the key size the more robust the cipher.</p>
<h2>Speculation of NSA backdoors</h2>
<p>When the NIST examined the security of the cipher candidates, they reached out to the <em>National Security Agency (NSA)</em> for assistance. At this point in time the NSA did not even admit their own existence. The involvement of the NSA lead to speculation and rumors, since the cipher went through a couple of peculiar alterations during the cooperation between NSA and IBM. </p>
<p>The most worrying change was that the key size was reduced from 128 bits to 56 bits. This made the cipher considerably less resistant to brute force attacks. Concerns were raised that this change was motivated by the NSA, in order to provide themselves with a backdoor. Maybe their computers were powerful enough to brute force a key size of 56 bits – but not quite powerful enough to brute force a key size of 128 bits? </p>
<p>The cipher was also altered to be resistant to attacks using differential cryptanalysis. That doesn’t sound too bad, but this particular attack was not known to the public until 1990 – almost 20 years later! If the NSA were familiar with an attack the world would need 20 more years to discover, it is not hard to believe that they might be able to brute force a 56 bit key. However, it should be noted that none of these claims have been proven. </p>
<p>In 1977, the NIST presented an altered version of the IBM cipher as the new standard, which they named the <em>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</em>. It became the first modern, public, freely available encryption algorithm. All details regarding DES were made public, which is good practice since it allows researchers to scrutinize the mathematical details. However, the motivation for the design criteria remained secret. The public never learned why the key size was reduced, and this was the main cause for suspicion regarding the involvement of the NSA.</p>
<h2>DES cracked through brute force attack</h2>
<p>DES was initially meant to be the standard cipher for encryption for 10 years; from 1977 to 1987. But no serious weakness was found, and DES went on to reign as the standard algorithm for more than a decade past its due; until 1999.
In the final years of DES, several attempts were made to design and build a machine to brute force it. Building such a machine would cost millions of dollars. It was speculated that only government agencies would have the necessary financial resources to build it, and by this time it was widely believed that the NSA could in fact crack DES.</p>
<p>As the price of hardware fell, the <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</em> built the machine
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker">Deep Crack</a>.
In 1998 Deep Crack was able to brute force DES in 56 hours. This event demonstrated that it was time to select a new standard cipher for encryption.</p>
<p>In 1997, the NIST initiated an open competition to find a new standard encryption cipher. The competition had five finalists:
<a href="https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/Csc688.012/rijndael/rijndael_doc_V2.pdf">Rijndael</a>,
<a href="http://cryptosoft.de/docs/Mars.pdf">Mars</a>,
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.1151&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">RC6</a>,
<a href="http://www.networkdls.com/Articles/serpent.pdf">Serpent</a> and
<a href="http://gazizova.net/pub/Library/ihtik_Library/dvd_(%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BE)%D0%AD%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/rea_2/Schneider%20B.Twofish.A%20128-bit%20block%20cipher.1998.pdf">Twofish</a>.
This time the selection process was completely transparent. In 2001, after three competitive rounds and intense cryptanalysis by the world’s foremost experts, the decision was made. The cipher Rijndael, designed by the Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, was declared as the new standard. It was given the name <em>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</em>. This cipher has three possible key sizes: 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bit. All these key sizes were sufficiently large to withstand brute force attacks.</p>
<p>AES is widely regarded as the most secure encryption cipher invented. It has been battle-tested for decades and is expected to remain the standard cipher for many years to come. So far there are neither any known critical weaknesses, nor suspicion of backdoors.</p>
<h2>Attempts at legalizing government backdoors</h2>
<p>Algorithms have matured to be practically unbreakable, but current legislative measures attempt to undermine the basic purpose of cryptography. There are recurrent proposals for allowing government backdoors. For instance, the recently proposed <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity"><em>Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</em></a> aims to force technology companies to implement backdoors. The right to privacy ends when the government institutions deem it useful to their own agenda. If such a law were to pass, the consequences would be immediate and severe. It would grant immense power to the government, and if a key is leaked or stolen, all encrypted communications are out in the open. Lawmakers argue that having a backdoor would help fight crime and terrorism, but this view assumes that criminals play by the rules and communicate through services using government issued encryption. </p>
<p>In the modern era the goal of private digital communication is, from a technological standpoint, a solved problem. It remains to see if future citizens will be able to enjoy digital privacy in their lives. It’s a question of balancing power between the government and the people – and problems of that nature are not solved as elegantly as cryptographic puzzles.</p>
<p><em>If you want to go further down the rabbit hole, I highly recommend listening to the following episode of the Darknet Diaries podcast: <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/12/">Episode 12 - Crypto Wars</a>.</em></p></section></article></div>]]>

These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs. This includes a <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">plugin system</a>, <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">more configuration</a>, and <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools">dedicated integrations for existing tools</a>.</p> <p>We have an initial goal of <strong>$100,000</strong>. This will allow myself to work independently on our first stable release. Additional funding would allow us to expand upon our release goals, fund future maintenance, and compensate other contributors.</p> <p>If you’re passionate about what we’re building, or have otherwise benefited from my work, I would appreciate your financial support.</p>    <section> <h3 id="recent-contributions">Recent Contributions <a href="#recent-contributions" aria-label="recent-contributions"></a></h3> <ul> <li>Loading...</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute <a href="#contribute" aria-label="contribute"></a></h3> <p>Prices are in USD.

I’ll make sure Rome works well for you and your organization.</p> <p>Migration support is where I personally help your organization adopt and use Rome. This could include porting configuration, integrating with CI, or even adding new features and configuration to Rome.</p> <p>Interested in something else or have questions?

We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

Bateman and first author Kanta Horie, PhD, a visiting scientist in Bateman’s lab, realized that specific MTBR tau species were enriched in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, and that measuring levels of the species in the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain might be a way to gauge how broadly the toxic tangles have spread through the brain. Previous researchers using antibodies against tau had failed to detect MTBR tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. But Horie and colleagues developed a new method based on using chemicals to purify tau out of a solution, followed by mass spectrometry.</p><p>Using this technique, Horie, Bateman and colleagues analyzed cerebrospinal fluid from 100 people in their 70s. Thirty had no cognitive impairment and no signs of Alzheimer’s; 58 had amyloid plaques with no cognitive symptoms, or with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s dementia; and 12 had cognitive impairment caused by other conditions. The researchers found that levels of a specific form — MTBR tau 243 — in the cerebrospinal fluid were elevated in the people with Alzheimer’s and that it increased the more advanced a person’s cognitive impairment and dementia were.</p><p>The researchers verified their results by following 28 members of the original group over two to nine years. Half of the participants had some degree of Alzheimer’s at the start of the study. Over time, levels of MTBR tau 243 significantly increased in the Alzheimer’s disease group, in step with a worsening of scores on tests of cognitive function.</p><figure data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b80f5e6d9222f0044e0c36a76f464ec8/a732b01a66a4a7cb-da/s1280x1920/353cb72a4ec9acf360e43a1eb0a68bb6998b1887.jpg" data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700" width="700" height="467" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found a novel form of the Alzheimer’s protein tau in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

The amount of tau visible in a brain scan correlates with cognitive impairment. To see how their technique matched up to the gold standard, the researchers compared the amount of tau visible in brain scans of 35 people — 20 with Alzheimer’s and 15 without — with levels of MTBR tau 243 in the cerebrospinal fluid. MTBR tau 243 levels were highly correlated with the amount of tau identified in the brain scan, suggesting that their technique accurately measured how much tau — and therefore damage — had accumulated in the brain.</p><p>“Right now there is no biomarker that directly reflects brain tau pathology in cerebrospinal fluid or the blood,” Horie said. “What we’ve found here is that a novel form of tau, MTBR tau 243, increases continuously as tau pathology progresses. This could be a way for us to not only diagnose Alzheimer’s disease but tell where people are in the disease. We also found some specific MTBR tau species in the space between neurons in the brain, which suggests that they may be involved in spreading tau tangles from one neuron to another. That finding opens up new windows for novel therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease based on targeting MTBR tau to stop the spread of tangles.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.wustl.edu%2Fnews%2Fnovel-form-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-spinal-fluid-indicates-stage-of-the-disease%2F&amp;t=ZmE5MmZmMmU5ZWY4NjYyNDVjMWE4NDE3YzBiZjE0MDk1NmU1MTU5YSxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607603956">Washington University School of Medicine</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“CSF tau microtubule binding region identifies tau tangle and clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease”, <i>Brain</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1093%2Fbrain%2Fawaa373&amp;t=MWZkZTM5YjIxMjZiMTc3NzZlNzBlMjIzY2U0NWZjYjRjYjQwYWY2NSxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607603956">https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa373</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/625031181195509760/new-blood-test-alzheimers">Novel blood test could greatly improve diagnosis of Alzheimer’s</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

These peptides are small synthetically produced portions of viral sequences. A peptide-based vaccine is not infectious. We have selected these peptides as the basis for our vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The antigen portion of the vaccine can be substituted by other antigens; for example, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD. By appropriate selection of antigens, the intranasal vaccine design described here can also be adapted for use against other viruses, especially respiratory viruses, such as influenza or non-SARS coronaviruses.</li><li><strong>Chitosan nanoparticle delivery</strong>. Chitosan is a form of chitin, which is found in mushrooms and the shells of crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs (seafood allergies are not allergies to chitin). Chitosan acts as both delivery vehicle and immunostimulatory adjuvant.</li><li><strong>Extremely simple and inexpensive preparation</strong> with easily obtained materials.</li><li><strong>Short-term safety. </strong>This type of vaccine has shown excellent safety in animal studies and human clinical trials. The RaDVaC vaccine has been used repeatedly over several months,  by over 100 self-experimenters, with the most extreme complication in some recipients of stuffy noses. </li></ul>



<p>Protocols for the simple and robust production of chitosan nanoparticle vaccines for intranasal delivery have been published for over two decades. Intranasal delivery of chitosan-based vaccines have shown mild side effects and high levels of efficacy of both mucosal and systemic immunity, when delivered in a prime-boost regimen (in both animal models and human trials). </p>

<p>I recently talked to a company growing and selling in-home hydroponic kits to grow crops in an apartment in the city for example, where most people do not have gardens like in suburbia. Given my experience in the startup world as well as in technology, I thought of their idea for some time and realized that there are quite a few business models that they can go towards, as they had the tech but didn't know how to progress it into an actual business.</p>
<p>Here's the list I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong> - Selling access to the infrastructure (but not the infrastructure itself) with which customers can then do whatever they want
<ul>
<li>Sell access to hydroponics kits (kits) for individuals, restaurants, companies (groups) to grow their own crops, but they have to maintain it themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> - Selling infrastructure with less control over the details but more ease of use for customers
<ul>
<li>Sell access to kits with certain crops already available, and groups can pick what they want to grow, and perhaps customize the crops and crop choice</li>
<li><em>Serverless</em> - Grow crops on demand based on needed capacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> - Selling access to the product without selling the infrastructure itself to run the product
<ul>
<li>Sell the crops themselves to groups so that they don't need to grow crops themselves</li>
<li>Boutique grocery stores</li>
<li>Delivery of crops on a regular basis</li>
<li>Delivery of meal kits on a regular basis with additional included groceries such as pasta or rice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Desktop as a Service (DaaS)</strong> - Sell remote access to the product
<ul>
<li>Monitor crops from anywhere with a web app or mobile app. The app could show crop yields, stats, expected time to delivery, expected time to expiration, et cetera</li>
<li>Complementary to the other models, not a replacement</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Allow other people to grow crops and sell them locally</li>
<li>The crowdsourced Uber/Airbnb model</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list came up due to my experience in business and technology, but if I had expertise in other fields, then this list would've been different. Learn from different domains and create analogies between them to think of new ideas and combinations of those ideas.</p>

<p><span>The world has changed and nothing will be the same: Companies all around the world are shifting to remote work, employees have been adopting new work habits for more than 8 months now. So let’s be honest, employees won’t return to the office as before. Remote work is no longer a temporary situation. You have to create your future environment of work right now because it’s the new norm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So when companies shift suddenly from a 100% office environment to a home environment, what do they do? They shift all their in person meetings to video meetings! Really?? Some even double down on it to be sure their employees are working!!</span></p>
<p><span>What happened? Zoom fatigue became the new popular hashtag and people were less productive and less engaged. And we are not talking about “Zoom bombing”!</span></p>
<p><span>I think we have to completely reinvent the way of working, communicating, collaborating and learning in this new world and not just duplicate what we do in person in a digital form.</span></p>
<p><strong>I BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE OF WORK IS ASYNC VIDEO COMMUNICATION.</strong></p>
<p><span>Async video meetings are all about optimizing your team’s time, and they are a great way to get information in front of people who don’t have availability for a meeting, or who are working remotely across multiple time zones. When you work in the way I do,having time to think on and internalize information before acting is critical.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of coordinating schedules, opt to send a quick async video with key info that your remote colleagues can view during normal work hours.</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronous communication allows people to first absorb and then act on information when they are able to, rather than the moment a piece of information is put in front of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are my 5 beliefs to embrace this new world&nbsp; :&nbsp;</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>1. The remote worker is FREE, completely FREE</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>Your employees are working remotely, they decide where and when. They are working from their personal environment, so you don’t oversee how they want to manage their time and where they can or want work. You don’t offer them a work environment anymore so you have to admit that you also lost this power.</span></p>
<p><span>If an employee wants to work from 5am and go hiking or kayaking by 2pm, he can do that!! Why not? Trust me, he will be much more productive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s talk about children: When you are working from home, you are sharing the same family space and property. You cannot ask them everyday “Please be quiet, Iwill be on a zoom meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span>Seriously!! I am sure this generation will hate zoom meetings. They are synonyms to online school and now“mom and dad are not available”! You are physically here but not really here, it’s difficult for our loved ones. We need to take that in consideration and not impose our timing on others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I encourage your people to work the hours that suit them and their lives, in the middle of what is a stressful time for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>I think we need to be more respectful of each other’s time and not interrupt with alive meeting each time we need it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need to be more respectful of each others’ home life: We enter each other’s personal space. It’s why weet captures a small portion of your background and you can even blur it.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>2. The remote worker is MORE PRODUCTIVE</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>With asynchronous communication you allow yourself – or your employees – to put all energy into what you do each time and have better control over your workload.</span></p>
<p><span>In workplaces where asynchronous collaboration is reinforced and enabled with technology, productivity is higher. People can follow their agenda and complete daily tasks more easily when they are able respond to their colleagues’ requests based on bandwidth or set up time slots throughout the week to prepare feedback for specific projects. Plus, by focusing their attention on one task at a time they have a more detailed look and bring in better results.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>3. Working remotely = HUMAN &amp; EMOTION</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>It’s important to keep a human and emotional connection with our team and clients even if we cannot see them in person. I personally attach great importance to emotional communication where I can see facial expressions, hear a warm voice, and feel others’ mood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A lot can be lost in translation in writing, including empathy, body and facial language, and often the attention of the reader when it’s a long note.</span></p>
<p><span>Async videos accomplish a number of things that emails or text chat cannot. They create more of a human connection, which makes it easier to understand each other and makes it clear to the recipient that the ideas being shared are well understood. Async meetings are ideal for giving feedback, because empathy comes through much more clearly when you can see face-to-face or hear a warm voice.</span></p>
<p><span>You’ll be surprised by the power of emojis in a video or just how a voice tonality can say a lot!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Every person is different and some are not comfortable with the camera. For this reason, we offer the capability to&nbsp; record without the camera but we always show a profile picture in all the videos: It’s a good way to keep a human connection.</span></p>
<p><span>And Weet offers the ability to add filters on your webcam to create a fun environment&nbsp; and make your teammates smile 😉</span></p>
<p><span>We also discovered that&nbsp; async video gives a voice to those who are quieter. Contributing to live meetings can often rely on speaking skills of speed and volume, while async videos let people share their thoughts at their own pace.</span></p>
<p><span>While some people prefer reacting spontaneously others need time to think and video recordings accommodate both approaches to produce a clear “leave-behind” that allows everyone to review feedback at their own speed. </span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>4. STOP CHAT &amp; LONG MEETINGS</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>Working remotely equals working alone. It can be difficult to motivate yourself to concentrate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever found it difficult to concentrate on your daily job duties after being interrupted by an unexpected casual chit-chat about a project your colleague is working on? It’s fine if this happens sometimes because mutual support and camaraderie is a critical part of being a team. But what if it interferes with your productivity?</span></p>
<p><span>Avoid being interrupted and interrupted for just asking a question.&nbsp; Divide your time between working time and communicating time.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/"><span>Recent research</span></a><span> has shown that we live in a more collaborative era; We schedule our working day around meetings, Slack conversations and emails with our colleagues and sometimes these events could take up </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload"><span>80% of a full working day</span></a><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can be detrimental to our performance; Technically we spend more time hopping from one meeting to another or replying to messages than focusing solely and mindfully on our tasks.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, I shut down all my notifications and connect only 4 times in the day to check my emails and my weets. What is great is that if someone needs to ask me a question and would need to do it in a live meeting, he can record it and I answer when I am available. You cannot imagine the freedom that it gives me and above all, the time I gain!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why async video meetings are so effective : We talk faster than we type and we retain more information when delivery is via video. Plus people can review recorded videos at their own convenience.</span></p>
<p><span>I want to make a clarification : I am not saying to cut off all the live meetings (at least 2/3) but for those that are necessary, put 30min max in your agenda settings. It seems sometimes too short but you will see people will accomodate.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>





<div><div><div><div><p><span>2020 has been a challenging year, no doubt. But one thing is clear – the way we have adapted will inform how we work for years to come, empowering us all to do the best work of our lives. Allowing people to work at a time and a pace that suits them is key to this.</span></p>
<p><span>In this new remote world, we can hire anywhere in the globe. Embracing async collaboration allows companies to access a wider range of candidates and freelancers all around the world;</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>





<div><div><div><div><p><b>5 tips to embrace async video meetings :&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>1- the most important: Emphasize trust, organization &amp; independence: Evaluate people based on their results, not the number of hours spent online or number of emails.</span></p>
<p><span>2 – Be cool with the video as a media: Not everyone is comfortable with a camera, communicate that it’s ok to cut off the webcam. You are not looking for perfection, just authenticity; Your employees can record their video as they talk in a real conversation.</span></p>
<p><span>3 – Create an async culture mindset: Explain how it works, share the benefits, share some examples and ask top management to begin by creating some enthusiastic video messages and above all, share that in async communication, we don’t wait for an immediate answer.</span></p>
<p><span>4 – Ask your employees and teammates for feedback: Does it work? What are their feelings?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5 – Minimize the number of meetings you have, but don’t blacklist them.&nbsp; The async work communication stack looks something like this:</span></p>
<p><span>80% async video </span></p>
<p><span>15% live video meetings </span></p>
<p><span>5% physical meetings, e.g., annual company or team retreats</span></p>

<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

<p>5 years ago, I bought some new glasses. I found a cheap $60 frame and I was proud. I’ve worn those glasses every waking hour for the last 5 years, which adds up to about 30,000 hours. They’re slightly uncomfortable and I have to push them back up on my nose a few times an hour, but I make do because you can’t argue with that price!</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I recently bought a new minivan to lug the kids around. I could have made do with one for $10,000-ish less, but I wanted a nice shiny one with a DVD player and all that. I use it maybe 30 minutes a day. </p>



<p>I’m realizing lately how backwards that logic is. I saved a couple hundred bucks on glasses and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/06/all-self-help-boils-down-to-choose-long-term-over-short-term/">cursed myself with 30,000 hours</a> of discomfort and annoyance. And I spent an extra $10,000 on something that I barely even use compared to those dang glasses.</p>



<p>I think it makes sense to spend our money where we spend our time. What are the things we spend the most time with? Glasses, shoes, a computer and desk and chair, a bed, a belt, whatever it is. Even if one of those things is <em>slightly</em> worse than it could be, when you multiply that by <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">a bajillion hours of usage</a>, it explodes.</p>



<p>Say that I had spent $500 on a pair of glasses that felt great. That’s an increase of $440. Divide $440 by 30,000 hours, and it turns out that I’d be paying about 1 penny per hour for that added comfort. No brainer, right? </p>



<p>Now let’s look at the car. If I use that car for 7 years that’s about 1300 hours of driving time. That means that the extra $10,000 comes out to about $7.70 per hour. I’m paying minimum wage to no one in exchange for access to a DVD player we barely use and a van that looks a little nicer.</p>



<p>Never again. Never again will I skimp on glasses and splurge on a car. I don’t even have a commute!</p>

									<a href="https://julian.digital/2020/12/03/banking-on-status/" target="_blank">
										Banking on Status									</a>
									 &nbsp;by Julian Lehr									<br>
								</h5>
								
								<p>
									Takeaways
								</p>
								<div>
									<p><span>Julian wrote “</span><a href="https://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/"><span>Signaling-as-a-Service</span></a><span>” back in March 2020 (which I highly recommend reading) that dove deep into many aspects of signaling. In this piece however, he outlines the mix between signaling and neobanks.</span></p>
<p><span>To start, Julian believes signaling explains our everyday lives, “what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A Rolex isn’t any better at telling time than a cheaper watch. However, a Rolex signals status and wealth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Most of us know traditional banks such as Chase and Wells Fargo, however, there’s a less traditional kind of bank called a neobank:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Neobanks are entirely managed via an app&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Neobank card holders are the equivalent to the kids that sit at the cool-kids-table. Many of the neobanks feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies, Julian mentions.</span></li>
<li><span>Neobank premium subscriptions come with nicer looking cards: </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/"><span>titanium</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.treecard.org/"><span>wood</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832"><span>glow-in-the-dark yellow</span></a><span>, </span><span><a href="https://n26.com/en-de/metal">N26</a>,</span><span> or </span><a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/revolut-metal"><span>Revolut Metal</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Some neobank cards have no credit card number on the front. “[Making it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.” — Julian Lehr</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>A main point in Julian’s piece is that on in-groups and out-groups. Every signaling scenario has those two possible audiences. “The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Think iMessages blue text messages vs. Android’s green text messages.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Here are two ways to increase the signaling power of an out-group:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Raise prices</span></li>
<li><span>Create artificial scarcity&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Have a larger out-group who is aware of the in-group and vice versa</span></li>
</ol>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: Neobanks aren’t as talked about as much as people think. Maybe it’s because I’m not sitting at the cool kids table. A friend of mine got a titanium Apple credit card and would “accidentally” drop it on the table before handing it over to the waiter. Of course, it would make a significantly louder noise than my battered-plastic card. Signaling can take many forms. </span></p>

<p>Huzzah! I recently received my Librem 5 (Evergreen) from
<a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a>. The Librem 5 is a smartphone that runs an otherwise
standard linux kernel. However, unlike Android which also relies on the linux
kernel under the hood, the Librem 5 uses a GNU userspace, adapted for mobile.
This makes it more akin to your typical laptop in some ways, although the form
factor still resembles a modern smartphone (at least, mostly). Here are some
preliminary thoughts about the phone and how it compares to
<a href="https://pine64.org/">Pine64</a>’s Pinephone, which is another phone that uses
neither Android nor iOS, and relies on a GNU / Linux based OS.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a long post, and I’m sorry for that. Brevity is certainly a
hard-earned skill, but going forward without comparing the Librem 5 to the
Pinephone seemed like the wrong choice ;)</p>



<h2 id="purism-librem-5">Purism Librem 5</h2>

<p>Purism touts the Librem 5 as a “Security and Privacy Focused Phone.” This is
not wholly untrue, and there are some features that are unique to the Librem 5
in this respect. For example, there are “kill-switches” on one side of the
phone that allow you to disable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile network and mobile data</li>
  <li>Wifi &amp; Bluetooth</li>
  <li>Camera &amp; Microphone</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s an additional feature where if you disable all three switches, then
other sensors on the phone such as GPS are all disabled as well. You’d be
better served reading through the <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5">Librem 5 product
page</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="pine64-pinephone">Pine64 Pinephone</h2>

<p>In contrast to the Librem 5, which touts itself as being privacy and security
focused, the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">Pinephone is touted as</a> “An
Open Source Smart Phone Supported by All Major Linux Phone Projects.” It is
considerably different from the Librem 5 in many ways, from the hardware all
the way to the final software. It too has kill-switches, but these are not easy
to access on the side of the phone and instead are inside the case of the
phone. You can access these kill-switches by removing the back plate.</p>

<p>One of the neat things about the Pinephone is the ability to boot and use a
variety of Linux distributions on the hardware itself. It’s as easy as loading
the distro onto an SD card, and then booting the phone. You don’t even have to
flash anything to the internal eMMC in order to run it!</p>

<h2 id="price-">Price $$$</h2>

<h3 id="librem-5">Librem 5</h3>

<p>The Librem 5 starts at $799.00 USD, or can be purchased at $1999.00 USD if you
want your Librem 5 assembled in the good ol’ US of A before they ship it to
you. There’s a lot of talk about anti-interdiction or controlling the supply
chain, but trust me in saying that you’re definitely not in the market for a
$2k phone like the Librem 5. I don’t know anyone who is.</p>

<p>I could probably write an entire post on the economics of this, but quite
frankly, it’s kind of appalling that literally anyone would pay this much. It’s
kind of appalling that Purism would charge this much. I can imagine a scheme
where the parts are shipped from China, and verified and assembled by a
part-time college student in the States and they’d likely still be able to
price it cheaper than $1999.00.</p>

<p>Anyways this post isn’t about Purism’s business practices, of which I will
comment on at some point, but regardless I will drop this matter here. Please
just don’t spend $1999.00 on a Librem 5.</p>

<p>And for that one person who will eventually claim they did purchase the
$1999.00 USA version and it was very necessary for their use case: <em>look buddy,
I get it, you’ve drank the Kool-Aid on this one but I’m sincerely doubtful that
your very specific concerns and use-case apply to even the general nerd who
gets excited about the intersection of FOSS and mobile hardware. Moreover, I’m
doubtful that even if they did apply to such a niche group that $2k is a price
point upon which you still don’t balk at and go look for literally anything
else.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>Update (2020-12-08)</strong>:
</p>
<p>
Many wonderful people on Hacker News as well as the
Purism / Librem Matrix channels corrected me on the fact that part of the
reason that the phone is so expensive is due to the fact that the PCB is
fabricated in the States, in addition to the assembly.  I am still inclined to
believe that the price is rather exorbitant. Perhaps had the USA edition been
something that had been launched after Evergreen was completed I would be less
averse to the idea of it. Nonetheless, I still think that for the general
person reading this: you should not purchase it. You might argue that I don't
know your threat vector, but Bayes' theorem would suggest you will be better
served spending your money on a regular Librem 5 and putting the remaining
funds to something more important to you (like maybe an iPhone, so you can use
Signal while it is unavailable on the Librem 5 :-P).
</p>
<hr>

<p>I bought my Librem 5 back during the original crowdfunding campaign, so I ended
up spending a lot less than even the $799 USD. Surprisingly, I’ve been waiting
on this phone since around the end of 2017, and here we are in 2020 and I
finally have it. Purism has been sending out what are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_validation_test">DVT and
EVT</a> runs of the
phone that have been going through several phases named Aspen, Birch, Chestnut,
Dogwood, and finally Evergreen. Evergreen is supposed to be the final version
of the hardware, which I opted for. I wanted to get the final, true Librem 5,
not one that could be radically different. While my unit does not have FCC
certification (it is technically what you might consider a PVT unit), it is
representative of the final hardware that Purism will land on for this phone,
as there is ostensibly no more hardware revisions.</p>

<h3 id="pinephone">Pinephone</h3>

<p>The Pinephone starts at $149.99 USD, sold in small batches surrounding a
particular distro / community that is building software for the device (called
<code>&lt;distro-name&gt;</code> Community Edition). Recent batches have made a “convergence
edition” available, for $199.99 USD. The convergence editions have an extra
gigabyte of RAM and a larger eMMC flash storage, and are touted as being useful
for connecting the Pinephone to a full-size monitor and running it as if you
had a full desktop available.</p>

<p>I originally purchased a Pinephone from the UBPorts CE batch. Eventually, I
upgraded my mainboard so that my specs match that of the convergence editions
from later batches. All in all, I’ve managed to spend more than the original
$200, but I’m not disappointed, since I have had a lot of fun with the
Pinephone.</p>



<p>For the vast majority of people, the Librem 5 and Pinephone are probably not
worth even considering. The GNU userspace and associated “mobile” paradigms
within it are very much not ready for daily use.</p>

<p>For the Librem 5, there are some security aspects that this “security and
privacy focused phone” don’t even hit (e.g.  hardware backed security / secure
enclave, device encryption, etc.). That’s not to say that these can’t be made
possible in future updates, but as far as the software story today goes, they
do not yet exist.</p>

<p>
Small note: Hardware-backed features like the secure enclave do not exist on
the base phone today. However, there is a smart card reader and the M.2 slots
used for the SIM And wifi/bluetooth chipsets on board could be replaced as
well. That said, this isn't exactly in "buy an iPhone and guarantee your
physical security" territory, and there's no clear path to "do X steps to
enable this" yet.

Basically, don't be tricked by the marketing to believe this is somehow the
full package at present. It is not.
</p>

<p>Anyways, so why do I, the author, care? I will admit, after my first bout of
usage, neither phone will be a daily driver for me. I will probably continue to
stick to my Pixel 3, and it is very likely that I will eventually get another
Android device at some point in the next two years. Linux phones are definitely
not yet ready to be daily drivers; however, they are interesting for a few key
reasons.</p>

<h2 id="device-longevity">Device longevity</h2>

<p>Digital waste is a blight on our society. I can admit that the year-over-year
hardware cycle provides a vast set of improvements that can change the
smartphone landscape. However, I also acknowledge that the number of phones,
tablets, and other electronics that find their way into landfills or are
otherwise rendered into trash is a growing concern. Linux phones and mobile
hardware present an opportunity to move away from that, and it’s important to
support this in some way.</p>

<h2 id="free-software">Free software</h2>

<p>I’m a fan of free software! While my day job isn’t working on FOSS, I think
that there’s a lot of benefits to having better FOSS software available. The
least of which is because leaps in the mobile space have also attracted others
to work on Linux in the desktop space as well.</p>

<h2 id="a-third-option">A third option</h2>

<p>I care about Linux phones because they present a third option from the Android
/ iOS duopoly. Even if they suck now in (a lot of) ways, they will improve over
time. I want to move towards a future where I don’t have to choose between an
OS that’s built towards data collection and advertising, and another that’s
built on locking you into an ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, before I get into my impressions comparing the two, I should at the very
least mention what I am / am not testing. I did not / will not test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone calls &amp; SMS / MMS functionality
    <ul>
      <li>I do not have a secondary mobile number, and my primary mobile number is
registered to an e-SIM on my Pixel 3. So the best I can do is test how
mobile data works on a data-only SIM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Convergence features
    <ul>
      <li>I don’t really plan to use these as anything other than a mobile device, so
I haven’t bothered plugging them into a display. Additionally, my display
may be a bit too large and high-resolution for either phone to drive it
effectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email
    <ul>
      <li>This one is still on my TODO list, however I’ve been too lazy to try
setting this up on several of the Pinephone’s possible distros.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cameras
    <ul>
      <li>The Librem 5 does not yet have a functioning camera. For a phone to ship
with the hardware but no software… Well it’s not typical. So I can’t
compare anything, given that the Librem 5 hasn’t yet made it possible to do
so.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GPS / location
    <ul>
      <li>Look, I want to do this more than …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

    <p><img height="269" width="268" data-delta="1" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/Libbie-Mills-IMG_1510-1-300s.jpg" alt="Libbie Mills"></p><p><strong>Libbie Mills</strong>, an assistant professor in the department for the study of religion in the University of Toronto’s&nbsp;Faculty of Arts &amp; Science, noticed something interesting this fall in her introductory Sanskrit class: computer science students.

</p>

<p>The course typically attracts students majoring in the study of religion, who are learning the language to further their research into Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Reading through her class list, however, Mills found that of six of the 40 enrolled students were actually computer science majors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I'm always excited when there are students from an unexpected place,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lingual connection between Sanskrit and computer science, it turns out, has been the subject of interest for quite some time. The first well-known publication that examined the relationship was in 1985, when NASA scientist&nbsp;Rick Briggs&nbsp;published a research paper in which he argued that the 3,500-year-old language was the best candidate for programming artificial intelligence technology&nbsp;– namely because of its adherence to rigid grammatical rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Paul Thomas</strong>, a fourth-year undergraduate student at St. Michael’s College who plans on majoring in computer science next year, says he&nbsp;has a proclivity for learning languages, but ultimately took the course because of its connection to coding.</p>

<p>“Sanskrit is a very computational language,” he explains. “It’s a lot of syntax, which is the structure of programming itself. Classical Sanskrit is an engineered language.”</p>

<p>There are nearly 4,000 rules&nbsp;recorded in the fourth&nbsp;century BCE grammar of Pāṇini, an ancient scholar of the language&nbsp;– and&nbsp;Mill’s approach to teaching it is methodical.</p>

<p>“I'm a nerd” she says. “I like mathy type things, and I teach in a bit of a sciencey way.”</p>

<p>She stresses to her students that this is not a typical language class, where after a few classes they’ll be able to casually practise what they have learned over coffee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s not conversational, there’s too much to learn at the beginning,” she says. “They must learn the characters&nbsp;and how words get put together. It’s mind-bogglingly awful at first.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She starts with what she calls the building blocks&nbsp;–&nbsp;“the order of sounds we produce out of our mouths ... from the throat to palate to teeth to lips” –&nbsp;and enthuses over the “tidiness of the language”, where a few root words are the basis of the entire Sanskrit vocabulary.</p>

<p>“It's orderly,” Mills says. “If you know the systems for making words you can work backward&nbsp;to the root to understand the meaning of the word. It’s creative in an organized way. It is kind of amazing.”</p>

<p>Mills adds that she&nbsp;understands the affinity that computer programmers have with the language. “It’s good coding,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Thomas, the strict grammatical rules of Sanskrit&nbsp;align well&nbsp;with the goals of computer programmers who are ultimately interested in the “question of how to create interface between computers and human languages.”&nbsp; He maintains that Sanskrit is well positioned to do so because of its algorithmic foundation. “Computers don’t understand linguistics, they understand rules,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the rigidity of Sanskrit makes it less likely that an artificial intelligence algorithm would misinterpret commands. The same can’t&nbsp;be said of a language like English, which is&nbsp;looser with its rules and where words have multiple meanings.</p>

<p>“In English, there are so many influences from different language streams,” Mills says. “It’s kind of a mess.”&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Tutanota gehÃ¶rt zu den wenigen E-Mail-Anbietern, die standardmÃ¤ÃŸig alle eingehenden Mails verschlÃ¼sseln. Ein Urteil des Landgerichts KÃ¶ln zwingt das hannoversche Unternehmen nun jedoch zum Einbau einer Funktion, mit der Ermittler einzelne PostfÃ¤cher Ã¼berwachen und Mails im Klartext lesen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

<p>Tutanota will Beschwerde gegen den Beschluss einlegen, diese hat jedoch keine aufschiebende Wirkung. â€žWir mussten daher bereits mit der Entwicklung der Ãœberwachungsfunktion beginnenâ€œ, erklÃ¤rte eine Sprecherin Mitte November gegenÃ¼ber câ€™t. Sollte die Beschwerde Erfolg haben, werde man die Funktion nicht aktivieren beziehungsweise wieder entfernen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_abweichende__0">Abweichende Rechtssprechung</h3>
<p>Das KÃ¶lner Urteil ist bemerkenswert, weil es von der Rechtsprechung anderer Gerichte abweicht. So hatte im Sommer <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">das Landgericht Hannover entschieden</a>, dass Tutanota im rechtlichen Sinn keine â€žTelekommunikationsdiensteâ€œ erbringt oder daran mitwirkt â€“ und deshalb auch nicht zur TelekommunikationsÃ¼berwachung verpflichtet werden kann. Die hannoverschen Richter verwiesen wiederum auf ein Grundsatzurteil des EuropÃ¤ischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) von 2019. Diesem zufolge sind E-Mail-Dienste keine Kommunikationsdienste.</p>

  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/87298/tag"></a-script>
  


<p>Das KÃ¶lner Gericht sieht Tutanota dennoch als â€žMitwirkendenâ€œ bei der Erbringung von Telekommunikationsdiensten. Folglich mÃ¼sse das Unternehmen die Ãœberwachung ermÃ¶glichen. Das Urteil, das câ€™t vorliegt, nennt allerdings weder den Namen noch den Betreiber des Telekommunikationsdienstes, an dem Tutanota angeblich mitwirkt. Aus Sicht des Unternehmens ist das Urteil deshalb â€žabsurdâ€œ.</p>
<h3 id="nav_lka_will__1">LKA will Postfach Ã¼berwachen</h3>

<p>In dem Fall geht es um eine Erpressungsmail, die von einem Tutanota-Postfach aus an einen Autozulieferer gesendet worden war.

<p>FÃ¼r die anderen Nutzer soll sich dadurch nichts Ã¤ndern, ihre Mails sollen weiter standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sselt werden. Gleichwohl sieht Tutanota eine einmalige Umgehung der VerschlÃ¼sselung als Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsrisiko fÃ¼r letztlich alle Kunden an.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, 30.11., 12 Uhr]</strong> Wie Tutanota betonte, betrifft die ÃœberwachungsmaÃŸnahme nur die neu eingehenden unverschlÃ¼sselten E-Mails. Bereits verschlÃ¼sselte Daten sowie Ende-zu-Ende verschlÃ¼sselte E-Mails in Tutanota kann das Unternehmen nicht entschlÃ¼sseln.<strong> [Update]</strong></p>
<p>AuÃŸer Tutanota speichern auch einige andere Anbieter alle eingehenden Mails in verschlÃ¼sselter Form. Bei Protonmail ist das ebenfalls Standard, Posteo und Mailbox.org bieten die VerschlÃ¼sselung als Option an.

	<div>
		<p>As Europe and the United States are experiencing a second or third wave of the pandemic, depending on how you count, the debate about lockdowns is raging again. Many people are convinced they are the best way to deal with the pandemic until a vaccine arrives. Back in the Spring, I argued in favor of lockdowns because we didn’t know much about the virus and Western governments were caught by surprise (I’m not even sure I was right anymore, even when you don’t look at things in retrospect with the information we now have, but that’s a question for another day), but now I think we should not resort to them anymore. The main reason is that, after looking at the data we have accumulated in the past few months, I have come to believe that lockdowns weren’t as effective as most people think relative to less stringent restrictions. People seem to believe that lockdowns are the only kind of policy that can prevent a colossal loss of life, because less stringent restrictions just don’t cut transmission enough. They also say a lot of things about lockdowns, especially about their effects on the economy, which I think are false, but in this post I want to focus on the claim that only lockdowns are really effective to cut transmission and ultimately prevent a lot of people from dying.</p>
<p>Whenever someone makes that claim, you can be certain they will cite the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7" rel="nofollow">paper</a> Flaxman et al. published in <em>Nature</em> a few months ago, which concluded that non-pharmaceutical interventions had saved more than 3 millions lives in Europe in the Spring and that among those interventions only lockdowns had a substantial effect. This paper went viral when it was published and continues to be cited all the time as proof that lockdowns saved countless lives during the first wave. This isn’t just true in informal discussions, but also in the scientific literature, where this paper is systematically cited to support the claim that lockdowns are very effective. (It’s already been cited almost 450 times since it was published a few months ago.) I hadn’t read it until very recently, but since the debate about lockdown has been rekindled by the second wave in Europe, I decided to read it and I was astonished by how bad it was. Since it still plays a very important role in that debate, I think it’s important to explain why it’s bad, so in this post I’m going to take it apart and explain why even Flaxman et al.’s own analysis shows that, while lockdowns do make a difference, they don’t cut transmission that much more than other, less stringent and therefore less costly restrictions. (I basically taught myself Stan over a weekend to do this, so someone should probably check my <a href="https://github.com/phl43/flaxman-lockdowns-analysis" rel="nofollow">code</a>, though I’m pretty sure there are no major mistakes.) After pointing out that it changes the policy debate quite a lot, I conclude with a few remarks about the role bad science has played in this debate and how this paper illustrates why the cult of science that many people have fallen into is bad.</p>
<p><strong>What Flaxman et al. did</strong></p>
<p>I’ve seen many people claim that Flaxman et al.’s paper showed that lockdowns were very effective, but I don’t think many of them know what they actually did in that paper, because it showed no such thing despite what the authors claim. In fact, what they did is assume that non-pharmaceutical interventions work (as we shall see, the model was bound to find that lockdowns specifically did most of the work, but more on that later), fit the data on deaths to a model that makes this assumption in order to infer various epidemiological variables of interest such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t"> and the number of infections. Once this was done, they just compared the number of deaths predicted by this model, which by construction is going to be very close to the actual number of deaths, to the number of deaths in a counterfactual where there were no interventions. I will come back to this counterfactual, but first I want to say more about what this model, because it will be important to understand why this paper doesn’t show what Flaxman et al. claim it shows.</p>
<p>Here is the equation they use to model the true number of infections:<a href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png" alt="" width="1986" height="890" srcset="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png 1986w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-300x134.png 300w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1024x459.png 1024w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-768x344.png 768w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Infection-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1536x688.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1986px) 100vw, 1986px"></a>It’s basically a discrete version of the SIR model, the most basic model of epidemiology. Don’t worry if mathematical symbols scare you, what it says is just that, on any given day, the number of people who get infected depends on the number of people who got infected previously and are still infectious, when they were infected, as well as on the reproduction number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">, which is the average number of people that a person who is infected goes on to infect.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and other non-pharmaceutical interventions affect the number of infections through their effect on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">. Here is how they model the way in which those interventions affect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">:<a href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05.png" alt="" width="1996" height="1362" srcset="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05.png 1996w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-300x205.png 300w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-1024x699.png 1024w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-768x524.png 768w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Capture-decran-2020-11-22-a-02.15.05-1536x1048.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1996px) 100vw, 1996px"></a>Again, it’s not a big deal if you don’t understand everything, what you need to remember is that each non-pharmaceutical intervention is assumed to affect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t"> immediately, only non-pharmaceutical interventions are supposed to affect it&nbsp;and each is assumed to have the same effect in every country where it’s implemented.</p>
<p>Many people have criticized the first assumption, but while it’s no doubt unrealistic, the second and third assumptions seem even worse. Indeed, it’s obvious that even in the absence of any government interventions, people would still change their behavior in response to the pandemic because they’re afraid. This would reduce transmission and therefore it’s not true that only non-pharmaceutical interventions affect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R_t" title="R_t">. Moreover, there is also no doubt that each non-pharmaceutical intervention is not equally effective in every country where it’s implemented, so it’s not true that each intervention has the same effect in every country. First, although various restrictions are modeled as the same in the paper, they were actually pretty different. For instance, the intervention that Flaxman et al. call “public events banned” consisted in forbidding gatherings of more than 5 people in Austria, 100 people in France, 500 people in Sweden and 1,000 people in Germany, but in the model all those different policies are treated as identical. Indeed, even “lockdown” was not the same thing everywhere, since under “lockdown” people in France couldn’t leave their place without filling a form while in Denmark people could meet as long as they were no more than 10.</p>
<p>Not only very different interventions are treated as the same in the model, but even if they had really been identical, their effect in different countries would still have been different for idiosyncratic reasons. Everybody has noted how people in some cultures might be more willing to follow rules, but there are many other possible factors that could also affect how effective the same intervention would be in different countries, such as differences in the proportion of people who need to take public transportation to go to work, differences in the age distribution of the population, etc. As you can see above, Flaxman et al. did include a country-specific effect in the model, which is supposed to model the fact that, precisely for this kind of idiosyncratic reasons, we don’t expect that even the same non-pharmaceutical interventions will be equally effective in every country. I will come back to this country-specific effect later, because it plays a very important and largely unacknowledged role in Flaxman et al.’s paper, but for the moment it’s enough to say that it’s only associated with the last intervention, which is a lockdown in every country except in Sweden where it’s the ban of public events. So the model only acknowledges that idiosyncratic factors could affect how effective the same interventions are in different countries for lockdowns but not for the other interventions.</p>
<p>Another problem with the model is that it assumes the population of each country is homogenous, which is undoubtedly false and might result in getting the dynamic of the epidemic wrong even in the early phase, though as I have <a title="Let’s have a honest debate about “herd immunity”" href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/lets-have-a-honest-debate-about-herd-immunity/" rel="">discussed</a> before we don’t really know. (Some people seem to think that, since I wrote this, various things have shown that the naive model was correct, but they are confused. However, there is only so much you can talk about in one post, so perhaps I will revisit that issue some other time.) I just mention that issue because I think it’s important and people should try to model heterogeneity more often, if only as a robustness check, but I won’t be focusing on that in the rest of this post because we don’t know how much it matters and, even if heterogeneity actually had a large effect on the dynamic of the epidemic and the final attack rate, I think not modeling it would mostly affect their counterfactual and not their estimates of the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>
<p>Finally, they don’t fit their model on data about cases, but instead assume a particular infection fatality rate for each country and use this plus the infection-to-death distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\pi" title="\pi"> to work backward from data on deaths and&nbsp;infer the number of infections over time. (The infection fatality rates they use are derived from Verity et al.’s <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30243-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow">paper</a> and adjusted for each country based on age-specific mixing patterns.) To be more specific, they assume that the reported daily number of deaths in a country <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m" title="m"> follows a negative binomial distribution with mean $latex d_{t,m}, which they modeled like this:<a href="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png" alt="" width="1962" height="436" srcset="https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al..png 1962w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-300x67.png 300w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1024x228.png 1024w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-768x171.png 768w, https://necpluribusimpar.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Death-model-in-Flaxman-et-al.-1536x341.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1962px) 100vw, 1962px"></a>Again, don’t worry if you don’t understand everything, what’s important is just that you understand that Flaxman et al. assume a particular infection fatality rate and a distribution of the delay between infection and death (both of which are estimated from data collected early in the pandemic), which they use to infer the daily number of infections during the period they consider by working backward from the data on deaths. This is a good idea because, while data on deaths are hardly perfect, there are definitely more reliable than data on cases, which are a mess.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ll go back to the model …</p></div></article></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelcarranza.es/assets/posts/boothduty.JPG" alt="Booth Duty, AltConf 2019">
</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At <a href="https://www.community.com/">Community</a> we use <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, a lot. It’s the infrastructure backbone that allows our services (over fourty at this point) to communicate with each other. That mostly happens through <strong>events</strong> (since we have an event-sourced system), but in some cases what we need is a <em>request-response</em> interaction between two services. This is the best tool in a few use cases, like retrieving data on the fly or asking a service to do something and return a response. An industry standard for such interactions is HTTP, but we are not big fans of that. Instead, since RabbitMQ is so ubiquitous in our system, we settled on using it for request-response interactions as well in the form of <strong>Remote Procedure Calls</strong> (RPCs). In this post, I’ll go over the architecture of such interactions, the RabbitMQ topologies we use to make them work, the benefits around reliability and the compromises around performance, and finally how this all implemented to be as fault-tolerant as possible with Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-rpc">What is an RPC</h2>

<p>An RPC can be seen as a function call across sytem boundaries, instead of at the code execution level. An RPC allows you to call a <em>procedure</em> on another service and treat it mostly like a local function call (with the additional error handling to account for the network interaction).</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of caller and receiver of an RPC" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rpc-definition.png"></p>

<p>I won’t go into too much detail about RPCs themselves, but you’re probably familiar with a common form of RPC: HTTP. HTTP request-response interactions between services in a service-oriented architecture are essentially RPCs, they’re just less explicit on the fact that they’re <em>calling a procedure</em>. One of the benefits of RPCs is, like HTTP, that they are agnostic of technologies. A services written in Elixir can make an RPC (or HTTP request) to a service written in Go, for example. If you want to read more about RPCs, their definition, their benefits, and more, guess where I’ll link you to? Exactly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this post, I will refer to the services involved in an RPC as the <strong>caller service</strong> and the <strong>receiver service</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-rpcs-over-rabbitmq">Why RPCs over RabbitMQ</h2>

<p>At Community, we chose to do RPCs over RabbitMQ, instead of the common service-to-service communication via HTTP, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>The main reason is that we want to use message queues as often as possible. When you have a queue-based message broker between services that talk to each other, the availability requirements of the services can be less demanding. If you have two services that communicate over HTTP, then if the receiver service is down it means that the requester service will not get a response and will have to implement request retries in order to increase the chances of a successful request. With RabbitMQ in the middle, if the receiver is down then the RPC is queued and can be picked up once the receiver comes back up.</p>

<p>Another important reason that influenced our decision is that we make heavy use of RabbitMQ for all sorts of things. This means our engineer know it well, our infrastructure is solid, and we have good systems to trace and observe messages flowing through it.</p>

<p>One compromise we had to make is that, generally speaking, RPCs over RabbitMQ tend to be <em>slower</em> than direct service-to-service communication (such as HTTP). This is hard to avoid given that in our case we have a message broker sitting between the caller service and the receiver service. That means that you’ll <em>at least</em> have twice the RTT (round-trip time) on the network, since the messages you’re sending and receiving need to jump through one more hop than if you do direct service-to-service communication. However, when we do RPCs the bottleneck is rarely the network or the message broker, and instead tends to be the processing of the RPC itself. So, we’re fine with the compromise here.</p>

<h2 id="rabbitmq-topology">RabbitMQ topology</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about the <strong>RabbitMQ topology</strong> that powers our RPC system. We have the following components in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>headers</em> exchange called <code>rpc</code>. Caller services publish RPCs to this exchange with two headers, <code>destination</code> (the receiver service name) and <code>procedure</code> (the procedure name).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Per-service queues where RPCs end up. Their name usually looks like <code>receiver_service.rpcs</code>. A single queue is shared across multiple <em>instances</em> (nodes) of the same service. All the running instances of the receiver service consume from this queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A binding between each per-service queue and the <code>rpc</code> exchange. Since <code>rpc</code> is a headers exchange, the binding happens on the headers. Most commonly, receiver services bind their queue to the <code>rpc</code> exchange on the <code>destination: receiver_service_name</code> header, but sometimes we can be more flexible and specific by also using the <code>procedure</code> header.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A per-instance <em>response queue</em> where responses to RPCs are published by the receiver service. Each <em>instance</em> of the caller service consumes from its dedicated response queue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an artistic representation of the RabbitMQ topology. This one is for you, my visual friends.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of RabbitMQ topology" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rabbitmq-topology.png"></p>

<h2 id="caller-architecture">Caller architecture</h2>

<p>Our focus when designing this architecture <em>was not</em> performance. Since our system is event-sourced, when services need to access data <em>fast</em>, we usually have alternatives to RPCs. In those cases, instead of fetching data from another service via RPC, a service can usually build a “local” data store (usually Redis, but whatever fits best) by consuming events and have fast access to that data store. However, this doesn’t cover use cases where a service wants to ask another service to do something and return a result. This can be usually also be done via asynchronous events, but sometimes it really can’t and in any case we like the agility of RPCs for when we’re moving fast and don’t want to commit to particular data exchanges in the long term.</p>

<p>Instead, we heavily focused on reliability and resource utilization. We want our RPCs to succeed whenever they can. We also want to limit RabbitMQ resource utilization as much as possible, since the message broker architecture shares the broker between all the services that use it.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, we came up with the topology described above. In the sketch below, I’m focusing on the caller service perspective.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of the architecture of the sender service" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-caller-architecture.png"></p>

<p>This is what happens, step by step, when a service makes an RPC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The caller assigns a new UUID to the request and encodes the request (we happen to use Protobuf, but anything would work).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller includes the name of the <em>response queue</em> in the <code>reply_to</code> metadata field of the RabbitMQ message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller publishes the request on the main RPC exchange (<code>rpc</code>) using headers to specify the <code>destination</code> and <code>procedure</code> to call.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If publishing the request is successful, the caller stores the request in an in-memory key-value store (ETS for Elixir and Erlang folks), storing the mapping from request ID to caller process. This is used to map responses back to requests when they come back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller has a pool of AMQP channels also consuming from the response queue. When the response comes back on such queue, a consumer channel picks it up, finds the corresponding caller process from the in-memory key-value store, and hands the caller process the response.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From a code standpoint, an RPC really does look like a function call. The main difference is that an RPC can <em>definitely</em> fail due to the network interaction, so we always make sure to return a successful value or an error value. In Elixir, that translates to <code>{:ok, response}</code> or <code>{:error, reason}</code> tuples. In a typed language (say Haskell) it would be the “either” type. In Elixir-flavoured pseudocode, this is what an RPC looks like from the caller side:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>RPCPool</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>"my_receiver_svc"</span><span>,</span> <span>"add"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"args"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>]})</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"result"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>result</span><span>}}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>#=&gt; 13</span>

  <span>{</span><span>:error</span><span>,</span> <span>reason</span><span>}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>"failed because: </span><span>#{</span><span>inspect</span><span>(</span><span>reason</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>#=&gt; such as :timeout</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-response-queue">The response queue</h3>

<p>It’s worth focusing on the <strong>response queue</strong>. This queue is declared by all AMQP channels in the caller pool when they start up. This is a common pattern in RabbitMQ since declaring resources (queues, exchanges, and bindings) is <em>idempotent</em>, that is, you can do it as many times as you want and the resource is declared only once.</p>

<p>The response queue is declared with a key property: <code>auto_delete</code>. When this property is present, a queue is deleted as soon as there are no channels consuming from it anymore. This is exactly the behavior we want: as long as a caller pool is “up and running”, there’s gonna be at least one channel consuming from the queue and handing responses over to caller processes. However, if the whole pool or the whole node for the caller goes down then the queue will be deleted. This works perfectly, because if the caller node goes down, then we likely lost the “context” of the requests, and even if the node will come back up then it won’t know what to do with the responses anymore. As <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html">one RabbitMQ documentation page</a> puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reply messages sent using [RPC] are in general not fault-tolerant; they will be discarded if the client that published the original request subsequently disconnects. The assumption is that an RPC client will reconnect and submit another request in this case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this way, we allow RabbitMQ to clean itself up and avoid leaving garbage in it, without writing any code to do so.</p>

<p>The code for each AMQP channel that consumes responses goes something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>channel</span> <span>=</span> <span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Channel</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>amqp_connection</span><span>)</span>

<span># "response_queue" is determined per-pool.</span>
<span># Usually it looks like: "caller_service.#{UUID.generate()}"</span>
<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Queue</span><span>.</span><span>declare</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>,</span> <span>auto_delete:</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Basic</span><span>.</span><span>consume</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When a response comes back, the caller does a key lookup on the response’s request ID in the in-memory key-value data store to retrieve the original request and moreover the process that’s waiting on the response. It looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>handle_rabbitmq_message</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>decode!</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span>
  <span>caller_process</span> <span>=</span> <span>KVStore</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>re…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"> <section>  <section> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction <a href="#introduction" aria-label="introduction"></a></h2>  <p>I’m Sebastian McKenzie, the creator of <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> and <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>. These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs. This includes a <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">plugin system</a>, <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">more configuration</a>, and <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools">dedicated integrations for existing tools</a>.</p> <p>We have an initial goal of <strong>$100,000</strong>. This will allow myself to work independently on our first stable release. Additional funding would allow us to expand upon our release goals, fund future maintenance, and compensate other contributors.</p> <p>If you’re passionate about what we’re building, or have otherwise benefited from my work, I would appreciate your financial support.</p>    <section> <h3 id="recent-contributions">Recent Contributions <a href="#recent-contributions" aria-label="recent-contributions"></a></h3> <ul> <li>Loading...</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute <a href="#contribute" aria-label="contribute"></a></h3> <p>Prices are in USD.

We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

</figure></div></div>

<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/12/no-escape-from-our-techno-feudal-world/">Asia Times</a>.</em></p>
<p>The political economy of the Digital Age remains virtually terra incognita. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technof%C3%A9odalisme-French-C%C3%A9dric-DURAND-ebook/dp/B08GS8XV47/ref=pd_ybh_a_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=ZCPCTPFZXYQBGGRPBDH3">Techno-Feudalism</a>, published three months ago in France (no English translation yet), <strong>Cedric Durand,</strong> an economist at the Sorbonne, provides a crucial, global public service as he sifts through the new Matrix that controls all our lives.</p>
<p>Durand places the Digital Age in the larger context of the historical evolution of capitalism to show how the Washington consensus ended up metastasized into the Silicon Valley consensus. In a delightful twist, he brands the new grove as the “Californian ideology”.</p>
<p>We’re far away from Jefferson Airplane and the Beach Boys; it’s more like Schumpeter’s “creative destruction” on steroids, complete with IMF-style “structural reforms” emphasizing “flexibilization” of work and  outright marketization/financialization of everyday life.</p>
<p>The Digital Age was crucially associated with right-wing ideology from the very start. The incubation was provided by the <a href="http://www.pff.org/">Progress and Freedom Foundation (PFF)</a>, active from 1993 to 2010 and conveniently funded, among others, by Microsoft, At&amp;T, Disney, Sony, Oracle, Google and Yahoo.</p>
<p>In 1994, PFF held a ground-breaking conference in Atlanta that eventually led to a seminal Magna Carta: literally, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39342741-cyberspace-and-the-american-dream">Cyberspace and the American Dream: a Magna Carta for the Knowledge Era</a>, published in 1996, during the first Clinton term.</p>
<p>Not by accident the magazine <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired </a>was founded, just like PFF, in 1993, instantly becoming the house organ of the “Californian ideology”.</p>
<p>Among the authors of the Magna Carta we find futurist <a href="https://www.tofflerassociates.com/about/the-toffler-legacy/">Alvin “Future Shock” Toffler</a> and Reagan’s former scientific counselor George Keyworth. Before anyone else, they were already conceptualizing how “cyberspace is a bioelectronic environment which is literally universal”. Their Magna Carta was the privileged road map to explore the new frontier.</p>
<p><strong>Those Randian heroes</strong></p>
<p>Also not by accident the intellectual guru of the new frontier was Ayn Rand and her quite primitive dichotomy between “pioneers” and the mob. Rand declared that egotism is good, altruism is evil, and empathy is irrational.</p>
<p>When it comes to the new property rights of the new Eldorado, all power should be exercised by the Silicon Valley “pioneers”, a Narcissus bunch in love with their mirror image as superior Randian heroes. In the name of innovation they should be allowed to destroy any established rules, in a Schumpeterian “creative destruction” rampage.</p>
<p>That has led to our current environment, where Google, Facebook, Uber and co. can overstep any legal framework, imposing their innovations like a <em>fait accompli</em>.</p>
<p>Durand goes to the heart of the matter when it comes to the true nature of “digital domination”: US leadership was never achieved because of spontaneous market forces.</p>
<p>On the contrary. The history of Silicon Valley is absolutely dependent on state intervention – especially via the industrial-military complex and the aero-spatial complex. The Ames Research Center, one of NASA’s top labs, is in Mountain View. Stanford was always awarded juicy military research contracts. During WWII, Hewlett Packard, for instance, was flourishing thanks to their electronics being used to manufacture radars. Throughout the 1960s, the US military bought the bulk of the still infant semiconductor production.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/03/21/161487/the-rise-of-data-capital/"><em>The Rise of Data Capital</em></a><em>, </em>a 2016 MIT Technological Review report produced “in partnership” with Oracle, showed how digital networks open access to a new, virgin underground brimming with resources: “Those that arrive first and take control obtain the resources they’re seeking” – in the form of data.</p>
<p>So everything from video-surveillance images and electronic banking to DNA samples and supermarket tickets implies some form of territorial appropriation. Here we see in all its glory the extractivist logic inbuilt in the development of Big Data.</p>
<p>Durand gives us the example of Android to illustrate the extractivist logic in action. Google made Android free for all smartphones so it would acquire a strategic market position, beating the Apple ecosystem and thus becoming the default internet entry point for virtually the whole planet. That’s how a de facto, immensely valuable,  online real estate empire is built.</p>
<p>The key point is that whatever the original business – Google, Amazon, Uber – strategies of conquering cyberspace all point to the same target: take control of “spaces of observation and capture” of data.</p>
<p><strong>About the Chinese credit system…</strong></p>
<p>Durand offers a finely balanced analysis of the Chinese credit system – a public/private hybrid system launched in 2013 during the 3<sup>rd</sup> plenum of the 18<sup>th</sup> Congress of the CCP, under the motto “to value sincerity and punish insincerity”.</p>
<p>For the State Council, the supreme government authority in China, what really mattered was to encourage behavior deemed responsible in the financial, economic and socio-political spheres, and sanction what is not. It’s all about trust. Beijing defines it as “a method of perfecting the socialist market economy system that improves social governance”.</p>
<p>The Chinese term – <em>shehui xinyong</em> – is totally lost in translation in the West. Way more complex than “social credit”, it’s more about  “trustworthiness”, in the sense of integrity. Instead of the pedestrian Western accusations of being an Orwellian system, priorities include the fight against fraud and corruption at the national, regional and local levels, violations of environmental rules, disrespect of food security norms.</p>
<p>Cybernetic management of social life is being seriously discussed in China since the 1980s. In fact, since the 1940s, as we see in Mao’s <em>Little Red Book</em>. It could be seen as inspired by the Maoist principle of “mass lines”, as in “start with the masses to come back to the masses: to amass the ideas of the masses (which are dispersed, non-systematic), concentrate them (in general ideas and systematic), then come back to the masses to diffuse and explain them, make sure the masses assimilate them and translate them into action, and verify in the action of the masses the pertinence of these ideas”.</p>
<p><strong>Durand’s analysis goes one step beyond Soshana Zuboff’s</strong></p>
<p><em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> when he finally reaches the core of his thesis, showing how digital platforms become “fiefdoms”: they live out of, and profit from, their vast “digital territory” peopled with data even as they lock in power over their services, which are deemed indispensable.</p>
<p>And just as in feudalism, fiefdoms dominate territory by attaching serfs. Masters made their living profiting from the social power derived from the exploitation of their domain, and that implied unlimited power over the serfs.</p>
<p>It all spells out total concentration. Silicon Valley stalwart Peter Thiel has always stressed the target of the digital entrepreneur is exactly to bypass competition. As quoted in <em>Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World</em>, Thiel declared, “Capitalism and competition are antagonistic. Competition is for losers.”</p>
<p>So now we are facing not a mere clash between Silicon Valley capitalism and finance capital, but actually a new mode of production:</p>
<p>a turbo-capitalist survival as rentier capitalism, where Silicon giants take the place of estates, and also the State. That is the “techno-feudal” option, as defined by Durand.</p>
<p><strong>Blake meets Burroughs</strong></p>
<p>Durand’s book is extremely relevant to show how the theoretical and political critique of the Digital Age is still rarified. There is no precise cartography of all those dodgy circuits of revenue extraction. No analysis of how do they profit from the financial casino – especially mega investment funds that facilitate hyper-concentration. Or how do they profit from the hardcore exploitation of workers in the gig economy.</p>
<p>The total concentration of the digital glebe is leading to a scenario, as Durand recalls, already dreamed up by Stuart Mill, where every land in a country belonged to a single master. Our generalized dependency on the digital masters seems to be “the cannibal future of liberalism in the age of algorithms”.</p>
<p>Is there a possible way out? The temptation is to go radical – a Blake/Burroughs crossover. We have to expand our scope of comprehension – and stop confusing the map (as shown in the Magna Carta) with the territory (our perception).</p>
<p>William Blake, in his proto-psychedelic visions, was all about liberation and subordination – depicting an authoritarian deity imposing conformity via a sort of source code of mass influence. Looks like a proto-analysis of the Digital Age.</p>
<p>William Burroughs conceptualized Control – an array of manipulations including mass media (he would be horrified by social media). To break down Control, we must be able to hack into and disrupt its core programs. Burroughs showed how all forms of Control must be rejected – and defeated: “Authority figures are seen for what they are:  dead empty masks manipulated by computers”.</p>
<p>Here’s our future: hackers or slaves.</p>

<p><em>Gender inequality</em> examples are all around us, and we learn to recognize them from a very early age. However, most cases based on differences between men and women usually praise <em>one</em> side while undermining the other. Female developers enter into this problem reluctantly, being an ever-present target for inequality proponents.</p>
<p>We want to believe that gender should not be a discriminative factor in IT, and the sooner everyone accepts this realization, the better we look in the eyes of our future selves.<br>A quick look at how women rank in the tech business shows us how vulnerable companies are to gender-based attacks. At Facebook and Apple, most employees are men. The same goes for Microsoft and Google. Is the IT industry going to stay a man’s domain?<br>Although the IT Industry feels the man-to-women ratio discrepancy, it is not a strictly IT-related problem. In fact, all other sectors <em>except manufacturing</em> are all man dominated.</p>

<p>A GAO report from 2015 suggests that a little over one-third of people working in the tech sector are female in the US. Even though the discrepancy gap between gender has been evening out since the 80s, gender issues are still stagnating the market with equal opportunities demands of all nature.<br>The number of female software engineer graduates ready to enter the workforce is even lower than the number of total employed women in the sector, which shows that they are somewhat reluctant to pursue a career in this domain. Even more — nearly half of the women who graduate as certified engineers choose not to enter the industry market as coders. Most females from the IT industry prefer more creative positions like <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/ui-ux-design-explained">graphics</a></strong> or fashion designers.<br>Some might suggest that coding is hard for girls, which mostly deters them from taking this path. However, there is a lot more ingredients brewing in the pot. And besides, software development is <strong>not exactly rocket science</strong>. Female working in high tech is under the constant umbrella of possible male repression and the fear of being undermined. Gender inequality claims and conditions are prerequisites for creating a very unhealthy work environment and navigating around them, sometimes facing the facts straight away.<br>We believe the female contribution to software development and the way it changes and improves is undeniable. The fact that gender inequality factors sustain a <em>dogma</em> in the business world is what some female programmers recognize as motivating factors. We strongly encourage all girls interested in software engineering to pursue their dream because very soon, all traces of discomfort coming due to inequality will be a thing in the past.<br>Let’s look at some concrete reasons why women may feel threatened while impacting the tech industry.</p>
<h2>Feeling like a stranger in your own yard</h2>
<p>During college and her first year on the job, Maria shared that she felt like an <em>alien</em>. She was repeatedly asked about her <em>qualifications</em> and peppered with comments on her excellent dress style and <em>neat appearance</em>. They even used a loud pitch to inquire about here future planning on family and children.<br>Such experience comes with an initial shock, Maria said. She decided to <em>desensitize</em> herself from this disturbance and focus on picking up <em>skills</em> quickly. She learned how to rise above obstacles and familiarized herself with strong male rivals, as well as a horde of competition from the same gender. These initial struggles were very challenging, but she eventually learned how to better promote her accomplishments and successes.<br>Nowadays, Maria is an intrapreneur working for <em>Samsung</em>. She quickly adapted to the male ruled world of IT and learned how to be excellent at it.</p>
<h2>Why women leave</h2>
<p>Maria was motivated to succeed, but as we mentioned before, many women in <strong>software engineering</strong> decide to move to industries outside the tech domain shortly after getting their first job. We are not busting a myth here. Evidence is abundant for the fact that most of all high-ranked employees are men.<br>Part of the reason can be the already discussed reluctance of women to become software engineers. It is almost normal to see young female developers leaving their current job and switching to a different career path.<br>We know that the role of women in technology use and development is somewhat under-represented. However, it’s much more essential to recognize the need for more women to engage in activities previously associated with men stereotypes. History is rich in examples of women with stellar minds and determination. We have collectively allowed for a working environment that admits discrimination. Gender-based factors are both powerful arguments as well as liability for all parties involved. They sometimes cause damage and eventually delay our progress.<br>Companies that are more gender-neutral in their approach towards employees and businesses create a friendly ecosystem where professionals work closely with each other and learn ways to optimize their collective output as a team.<br>In contrast, <strong>gender discrimination</strong> is a recipe for a toxic work environment with seriously undermined potential. The value of any <em>Men’s club</em> is denominating with each passing day. We must be smart and quickly acknowledge gender discrimination as something we need <em>to put in our calendars</em>.<br>Of course, if too much energy goes into denouncing some of the patriarchy-based business models, the opposite effect is due. We can see the impact in companies whose mission is to turn their female employees into relentless business warriors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need to understand that if we all work on inclusion together, it’s going to be faster, broader, better, and more thorough than anything we can do on our own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Former Reddit CEO + Current Co-Founder of Project Include</p>
</div>
<h2>Focus on belief</h2>
<p>The level of confidence of women has very much detrimental to their success rate. One such woman brings the statistical part of gender distribution in the workforce to another level — she created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxbEifUr1z6HwY2_IcExQwUpKPRZY3FZ4x4ZFzZU-5E/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">spreadsheet with about 80 different companies</a> and their man/women employee ratio. I’m very eager to point out that these numbers represent not <em>all the women</em> in a company, but <em>all the women who are software engineers.</em> This spreadsheet is a fine example of how science can help us use data to better deal with a century-old problem.<br>Women are fully equipped <em>to do well in IT</em>. Sara Gottlieb proves that a strong belief is at the base of success. She is the software engineer behind <em>SurveyMonkey</em>. Sara is an excellent software engineer who decided she didn’t have enough on her plate already and started learning more about <strong>engineering management</strong>. Not long after that, she became a recognized mentor in Hackbright Academy, teaching programming classes to other women.<br>Focus on belief is a powerful success tool, significantly when others recognize it and support it. Joyce Jang was encouraged by both men and women in her company to pursue her career advancement. Having a lady in high positions is excellent makes the real difference. It also sets a healthy pace for all men. </p>
<h2>Less Shy, More Direct</h2>
<p>Caroline Tess, a VP, has been trapped under a male dominance sea before realizing her best card. She says that when making a conversation, she tries to stay as clear and assertive as possible while maintaining directness and presence. Speaking up, especially when you have a valid argument, helps understand your work potential and your identity as a professional. Speak up and be heard!<br>Women are somewhat less competitive than the testosterone-driven men, who are creative enough to turn anything into a fierce competition. Women are less likely to demand recognition or honor but just as <em>equally entitled to it</em>.<br>Joyce Stack, an engineer advocate in Mendeley, says the best recommendation for women and visitors to surrender is to ask for something acceptable to them. It is what Stack did to get a major position in programming testing. “After the meeting, they asked the spot if there were any additional inquiries, and I requested this activity.” “Because you are considering it, no one will give you anything. You need to open your mouth and question.”</p>
<h2>Find a coach or a supporter</h2>
<p>Ladies looking to ascend the career ladder and reach leadership positions line up with male <em>and</em> female coaches and supporters.<br>Maria perceived the significance of having a coach right off the bat. It kept on searching them out all through her profession, remembering for her developer functions at eBay and Microsoft. Besides, she established a versatile web-based media stage Flockish and Anecdote, an inventive photograph network bought by Samsung.<br>She claims that your guide can’t be an arbitrary person.<br><em>“You need to discover somebody that acknowledges you and your abilities,</em>”<br>she clarifies.<br><em>“Your mentor better be a senior who can convey their knowledge and perspective.”</em><br><em>“That is the secret to escaping a reality where work becomes more of a minefield than a healthy environment for personal and professional development.”</em></p>
<h2>Talk to Female Role Models</h2>
<p>Women continue to prove they can lead and be excellent role models – most examples from history ring true even today. The world’s top female developers now are just as stellar as those <a href="https://wiredelta.com/the-history-of-women-in-software-and-programming/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">from our not so distant past</a>. Creating a LinkedIn profile and contacting other female software engineers is an incredible way to strengthen your network and widen advancement opportunities. Start a discussion with a female professional and share some views about your personal experience and professional interests. You will be amazed at the freedom and openness level when it comes to getting help from peers.</p>
<h2>Be Bold for Change</h2>
<p>The International Women’s Day is bringing awareness with the <strong>#BeBoldForChange</strong>. Change happens when we get to work in full swing. We urge you to learn improvement, attend tech opportunities, work tirelessly, value yourself, and be confident in fulfilling your potential. </p>

December 7, 2020 | https://billisfun.com/blog/10-Culture-Lessons-from-Tony-Hsieh | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://billisfun.com/blog/10-Culture-Lessons-from-Tony-Hsieh">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main><p>Personally, I didn't know Tony or his previous history until my Tweeter feed got filled with the sad news about his death. It took me some time to learn more about Tony and his impact on our world today. After doing my research, I came to a conclusion: most of the companies today are totally missing out on creating a strong team culture. So, here are some key things that I was able to extract from numerous interviews and talks with Mr. Hsieh.</p><h2>What is your bad culture experience?</h2><p>Before Zappos, Tony was running a startup called LinkExchange. It was sold to Microsoft. Tony's reason for the exit was bad team culture. Tony admitted to this, and used it as a motivation to create a great team culture at Zappos. You can think about your own bad employee experience. What sucked for you at your first job? Perhaps you still have similar problems at your current company. Can you find a fix for them?</p><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Ff1d3c31c-1fcf-4309-b409-96d87ba41b57%2Fgift-habeshaw-Of8C-QHqagM-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Dc1b66b9d-f244-4e54-b77c-903224bb7d4d%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=c1b66b9d-f244-4e54-b77c-903224bb7d4d&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Focus on your employees as much as on your customers.</h2><p>Don't forget that people who are on-board with your vision have their own dreams and aspirations. Try to think of ways you can make their job more enjoyable. For example, Zappos employees claim that they make decisions on their own. How great does that sound?</p><h2>Give Freedom to your employees.</h2><p>No micromanager will admit they micromanage. Maybe you should always assume that there's some micromanagement involved. So how will you create the type of environment where your team doesn't get told what to do yet still  achieves needed results? At Zappos, Tony was able to create this atmosphere. The customer support team doesn't have scripts. Their whole aim is to help people. They act based on principles and not direct tasks.</p><h2>Your focus should be your customer not your product.</h2><p>While Zappos started as an online shoe store, Tony said that they want to be much bigger than that. At the core of his company he preached to focus on customer and satisfy their needs instead of improving the product. At Zappos, the whole strategy was to ignore advertising as their growth channel and instead think about how customer service can be improved. This approach led to great sales results and mutual understanding inside of Zappos on what matters.</p><h2>Think creatively about your hiring.</h2><p>Zappos hires based on 2 fits. Fit for the hiring position and fit for the culture. After an interviewee is determined to be a great fit, Zappos offers them something very intriguing. A new hire has a chance to get paid for the training, plus a $3000 bonus if they reject the hiring offer. That way the people who accept the job feel more committed. Only about 2-3 percent of people take that offer. It's a great bargain for the company to onboard people who are there for the right reason and not just a paycheck. </p><h2>Don't start a brand, start a philosophy.</h2><p>The Zappos team created a set of 3 things that are essential for the brand: <b>Clothing, Customer Service, Culture. </b>By putting it all together, they have realized that Zappos is about <b>delivering happiness</b>. That's a genius way to distill your mission.</p><blockquote>“People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them <b>feel</b>”</blockquote><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0f41dc6c-adcd-40ca-ab18-1b4ce5cad667%2Flex-sirikiat-YlHhljkuEFE-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D5739c1c5-491c-474e-8773-e6048a565e56%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=5739c1c5-491c-474e-8773-e6048a565e56&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Hire, promote, and fire based on culture values not on performance.</h2><p>It's up to you to decide what your company values are, but you should have them set. For Zappos, one of them is being humble. Turns out it's not easy to ask people about this value while hiring. The response won't be very accurate. To fix this issue, Zappos came up with a pretty smart way to uncover the truth. Since a lot of job applicants are out of town, Zappos hires a driver that picks them up from the airport. After the interview done, a driver is asked how the job applicant was treating them. If the driver says "bad", it doesn't even matter how good the interview was.</p><h2>Core values don't matter, committing to them does.</h2><p>Tony said that he took this idea from nature by looking at flying birds. As they fly they look like one organism. Birds do have very simple rules while traveling. Have some distance from the bird to the left, have some distance from the bird to the right. They are not guided by one main bird that tells them what to do. Those simple rules are just like your company culture principles. Commit to them and your team will be united. That's how Zappos was able to scale their team culture.</p><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe8254a5a-318a-475d-98ed-82ba113c641d%2Fvincent-van-zalinge-fiQ7YrVFPqs-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3De99a523c-7963-4a1e-bc7e-3e520e7c7746%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=e99a523c-7963-4a1e-bc7e-3e520e7c7746&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Chase the vision not the money.</h2><p>Even though it might sound obvious, Tony is very convinced about this idea. He was often being asked about what industry to enter to make a giant pile of money. This response was standard. Focus on problems and customers that you like the most. Money will follow. After selling his first startup, he was able to invest in dozens of startups. It was his choice to join Zappos. Without his love for the customer service, he wouldn't achieve such result. </p><blockquote>“Don't chase the paper- chase the dream” — P. Diddy</blockquote><h2>Rediscover your Happiness.</h2><p>Even though Tony left the world on a sad note, he was standing firm on the idea that we should focus on happiness. By happiness he didn't mean running after every pleasure but rather fulfilling purpose. I guess we should take a lesson from that and apply it to what we do. </p></main></div></div><div id="article-bottom"><hr><div><p><h2>Looking for new ways to stay connected with your team?</h2></p><p>Bill is a Slack app that helps your team get to know each other better using fun icebreaker games.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="Post__Main-Content">
        <div>
          <p><strong>Hey Kaio! Thanks for taking the time to talk with me about your journey! To start, why don’t you tell me about yourself!</strong></p><p>I’m originally from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Goi%C3%A2nia+-+State+of+Goi%C3%A1s,+Brazil/@-11.7982607,-55.4825581,4.56z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x935ef0ede1248cf7:0xbaedffbfd0c11fd1!8m2!3d-16.6868982!4d-49.2648114">Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil</a> but currently live in a small city called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palmas,+State+of+Tocantins,+Brazil/@-11.6859599,-50.3391487,6.56z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x933b3439911f1257:0x93b8070d05c818f!8m2!3d-10.249091!4d-48.3242858">Palmas</a>. Well it’s small by Brazil standards, it’s no São Paulo (12 million people) - there are about 400,000 people here. When I first arrived I only had my bike with me, I really like biking so I thought it would be all I’d need, but everything is pretty spread out so I now have a motorcycle as well.</p><p>For fun, I’m always reading plus... <em>something else</em>; for a while this was dancing. I learned 4-5 kinds of ballroom dancing, tango, zouki, forró and, of course, Brazil’s popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CimlZ1Vaqzc">samba!</a> At some point I realized that I wanted to fight more than I wanted to dance so I started training in jiu jitsu!</p><p><strong>Hah! A bit of a change!</strong></p><p>Yes, I’ve been doing it for 3 years. After practicing on a daily basis, I can tell you the best defense is to run! Always try to run first in a bad situation, you never know the other person’s intentions, if they have a weapon, or what their training is.</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/hobbies-kaio.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Great advice! So that’s your “something else” right now, but what do you like to read?</strong></p><p>I read a lot of different things. I’ve always read fantasy, but lately it’s been more “reality-related” stuff - a lot about leadership (like, <em>a lot</em>) or books that have communication as the main topic. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250067057">“Extreme Ownership”</a> by Jocko Willink and Leif Brabin is one of my favorites. Jocko has a podcast that I listen to as well and he talks about a book in almost every episode.</p><p>I’ve also been reading a lot of war-related books. They’re very interesting even though they get in the way of my sleep. It’s quite hard to sleep after you read about the ugly stuff of war! Though it doesn’t affect my dreams. The only fighting that happens in my dreams is jiu jitsu - I <em>always</em> wake up right after I get a hold locked on my opponent. Always!</p><p><strong>So you’re the CTO. How do you describe what you do here at Codelitt?</strong></p><p>The shortest description is: my job is to make sure that everyone on the engineering team has what they need to succeed in their tasks. Since I'm no longer a full-time engineer (although I work with engineering as much as I can) my goal is to make sure my team has all the resources they need. </p><p>So yes, I’m the CTO, but in the tech world my role goes by a lot of different names. It’s kind of a hybrid of management and engineering. At the end of the day a person in my position is leading, but I also have to be in the trenches to ensure that the quality of the output is something that I myself would be proud of.</p><p><strong>How did you end up in software engineering?</strong></p><p>I’ve always loved technology. I got my first computer when I was 11 years old. I like to say that I “never really left the chair” even though I grew up with my mom telling me that I’d lose the use of my hands if I worked on the computer all day. </p><p>For university, I was initially focusing on Biological Sciences but 2 years in when I was 19 years old I made the switch to software engineering. I used to think these two were <em>totally</em> different, but I realized that a lot of areas, ecology and DNA work for example, are very mathematical in their approach. Also I saw that there were some lessons in biology, like the importance of naming and classification, that are also key in software engineering. We try and fail miserably in engineering, but we’re getting there! </p><p><strong>What made you switch?</strong></p><p>I became frustrated that I had to go through an entire course to properly work in the biology market. I could do some internships, but they were pretty limited. I also looked into the future and didn’t like the idea of doing research for the university. I believed that the idea was to write <em>papers </em>instead of getting <em>results.</em> There seemed to be too much focus on getting points academically than producing quality output, you know, to be promoted at the university it is about research points, not research results.</p><p>Software engineering also gave me the freedom to work <em>where</em> I wanted to. I didn’t have to be in a lab to work. I could use my <em>reasoning </em>to solve problems and get results - I didn’t need something physical, a specimen, to solve a problem. When we studied substances and their effects on rats, we had to go to the lab. I realized I’d rather get the problem that I was supposed to solve and then go off somewhere to think about it.</p><p>I’m also a big fan of small victories. You know, the really small things that add up at the end of the day. You can have this in biology, but every advancement is pretty huge since we know so much at this point. With software engineering, you can literally create anything out of thin air. Goals are only limited by <em>time</em> and not by any <em>physical</em> resource. </p><figure><img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/hobbies-kaio-1.jpg"></figure><p><strong>I like that! So how did you find Codelitt? </strong></p><p>So before I started with Codelitt I was working for a tech company in Goiânia. At this point, I had already been studying software engineering for a while. I made up my mind to find the top engineer within my company so I could find out what makes them the best at what they do. This person was Bruno! He would later go on to become the CTO.</p><p>A year or so after I met him, Bruno and I had teamed up to lead an effort to create a new product for the company and started discussing the idea of working remotely. One thing I noticed was that there were a lot of positions looking for Ruby engineers, so I teamed up with him to learn it - although he knew quite a lot of it already. We both decided to start looking for remote jobs with US based companies. It was actually Bruno that found Codelitt first!</p><p>So before Bruno started working as Codelitt’s CTO, I reached out to him to see if there were any open source projects that I could work on after I’d finished with my day job. For me it was all about practice and the chance to get some more experience. Luckily Bruno said, yes there was a project!</p><p>This project was actually the side project for Cody, Codelitt’s Founder, so I had the opportunity to meet him briefly. A few weeks later, Bruno sent me a screenshot of a Slack conversation where Cody was asking Bruno if he “knew this guy Kaio” because they needed a Ruby developer. I was so happy.</p><p>I was initially offered a contract job for 3 weeks. Cody made sure this assignment was super clear for me saying something like, “Hey this is the deal - we only have work for 3 weeks. I just want to make sure you understand that if you leave your job for this, then in 3 weeks you won’t have a job anymore.” </p><p>This was the first opportunity to work remotely <em>and</em> for the US. It was huge for me! I was <em>terrible </em>at English, though. Like seriously, at one point during the interview Cody said, “Hey Bruno you can continue the interview in portuguese and just let me know what you think.” Honestly though, as soon as I received the screenshot from Bruno I knew I was going to say yes!</p><p>With Bruno being the CTO of Codelitt, I had a lot of responsibilities that I wouldn’t normally have had as a junior developer. He was working side by side with the CEO. Career-wise, it was great for me. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ">Jeff Bezos calls it “regret minimizing”</a>. The idea comes from the question “What will you regret - doing something or <em>not</em> doing something?” If I hadn’t taken the opportunity I know, then I would have regretted it.</p><p><strong>What are some of the big differences between then and now?</strong></p><p>First thing that comes to mind is the size. I first joined as a contractor and at that time this meant I only had contact with the people that I <em>needed </em>to have contact with: the CTO and COO. We were a total of 7 people then and today we’re 35-40 people typically. Back then the engineering team was only 3 people and more often than not we were working on the same project together.</p><p>The amount of projects that we manage at the same time is different too. In the early days it was no more than 2-3. It took a while to run 4 projects. Now we’re much more efficient.</p><p>The third biggest difference is communication. In the beginning, communication was easy with so few people and projects. It was almost too easy! Back then, I had direct access to the CTO. You know, I didn’t have to run a question to HR. Anything project-related I ran to the CEO! &nbsp;Now it’s very different.</p><p><strong>What are some of your favorite memories or favorite projects that you’ve worked on? </strong></p><p>I think about this a lot - I have a lot of good memories. With projects, we always have something new which is always fun. In the beginning, it would often be only myself and another developer on a project, most of the projects in my first two years were like this.</p><p>I’d say my favorite project was my first project. </p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I don’t think I’ve ever worked so hard in my life. I mean, I’ve probably worked harder on other projects in recent years but I’m stronger than I was then. It’s like a guy going to the gym the first time and trying to lift. It was the first project that I owned fully - pages, process, etc. - I was the one developer tasked with building <em>everything </em>the user will see. Working together with the CTO was huge because he was able to provide me with a ton of technical help. I wasn’t as good as someone should be for this project, so I had to work <em>extra </em>hard for it.</p><p>On a common day, I worked 14 hours. Between Aug 1st and Oct 11th I worked 7 days a week, 14 hours a day. I may have taken two Sundays off, but I still worked 6 hours. That was a “day off” for me. </p><p>I mention that not because I think it was good. It was NOT healthy. Nowadays I would <em>never </em>accept working like that again. It was a “high cost” experience because it’s not just about the time spent working, it’s also about mental health. At one point I remember getting to my desk and seeing 5 empty cans of Red Bull. Sometimes I’d go to bed at 12am and wake up at 4am. </p><p>It was a great experience because it showed me how far I could go.</p><p>Although I’d love to say that I was up for continuing on like this if needed, I wasn’t.

I’m your host, dr. McKayla. And today I have the pleasure to talk to Thomasz Łakomy.</p><p>But before I start, let me share something fantastic news. The podcast has gotten its first sponsor. I’m so happy about this because it means I can focus even more on producing episodes for you. And it’s not any sponsor. It’s an amazing match. Actually, two founders, Tracy and Dom reached out to me. They are building CodeSubmit, a take home assignment platform to streamline your tech recruiting. They’re already profitable and they are part of the TinySeed Accelerator. The reason for them to build CodeSubmit is because they strongly believe that take home challenges are the most candidate friendly way of assessing developer talent. And they could not find a dedicated tool for them. So they set out to build the best experience for take home assignments for hiring managers and developers. It’s built on Git and they support 64 different languages and frameworks, even though it’s a young startup, and it’s built the Indy Way, they already worked with hundreds of companies. Well, last weekend to show me the whole experience and it’s fantastic. So I really hope you go and check out CodeSubmit. You can find it at&nbsp;<a href="https://codesubmit.io/" rel="nofollow">https://codesubmit.io</a>. And they also offer a free trial. Well, if you like it, please give them some love and social media for sponsoring this episode.</p><p>But now, back to Thomasz. Thomasz is a senior front end engineer at the Alix group, which is a fast-growing platform for trading businesses. Commercial is also an ad hack instructor. He’s certified for AWS and he’s a speaker and blogger. So I’m really happy to have Thomasz here with me, Thomasz, welcome to the show.</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:01:46] Hello, everyone. I’m very happy to be here.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:01:48] So, Thomas, maybe as a start, can you tell me a little bit about your role at Alix group on the website? It says it’s a platform for buying and selling cars, finding housing, getting jobs, buying, and selling household goods. But what are your team’s responsibilities? What are your tasks at this company?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:02:05] Sure. So, as you’ve mentioned, like basically what we do at Olin’s group is, but we did a huge number of different websites for like buying stuff, selling stuff. So as you mentioned, we have cars, we have real estate, we have goods, we have services. So there’s obviously a lot of things going on. And obviously, you know, my team in particular, like we cannot be responsible for everything. The way we work at all X group is about each team is focused on a certain area of the business and they own it competently. So my team is focused on all the jobs because not only you can bounce stuff, but you can also find a better hopefully job at all X. So what we are building is what we are building solutions. That has people find a, you know, a newer better job in particular, we are working on something that is called a candidate profile, because the idea that we have in mind is about, you know, CVS are kind of outdated because this concept of a CV has been around for, for ages and when we need something better. So not only people can create basically are four fires at all X, but we also are going to use the data in the profile. In order to find people. I bet a job automatically because we send them recommendations based on their profile and also the face on the job ads that were actually, they were going through on the other side. So we are kind of, kind of trying to find a better job for them.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:03:34] Okay. So can I imagine it as like LinkedIn, but a little bit different or is it very different?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:03:41] Is this somewhat different than LinkedIn? I think LinkedIn has this very, very focused on like white collar jobs. So, you know, white collar, basically what I mean by that is that, you know, you work in the office, you probably have a product to probably have a, you know, a title that is in English and you probably spend your time in front of a computer. And this is not the reality of like, I suppose like majority of people, because people have different careers, people have different skill sets and whatnot. So what we are trying to build is to have a product that is somewhat similar to LinkedIn as a new, create a profile. And you can use it to find a better job, but with a much broader focus. So we are wanting to target basically everyone who is looking for a job in Poland. And also help them find a better job because like not everybody is used to, you know, searching for a job, offer online, not everybody’s student negotiating. So one of the experiments that we’ve had a couple of times, I go, there’s also building a platform in which the employer would have to provide a salary because we also would like to in ideal a scenario, avoid this process of, you know, Whenever you have to negotiate a salary, how much do you want? How much are you willing to give me? How much do you want? And so bucket and so forth.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:05:02] Yeah, for me, it’s always mind blowing that, you know, I, to be honest, I haven’t known about all ex before. Right. And so for this podcast, I researched it a little bit and I went on the website and I see like this large numbers of employees that you have. And then I went to the career side and I see, wow. There, I think if I, on the top of my head, I think there were like 16 open positions in data analysis or data engineering, something like this. Right. Then there were like 80 positions for engineers. Right. And I was like, Wow, because I worked as a data scientist or like a researcher before. Right. And sometimes struggling, like where are the companies that actually hiring, you know, people with these skillsets and then you’re stumbling across a company that you never heard of anything like, well, this is not a small company. It’s a large corporation, right. That you’re actually working for. And so, yeah, maybe what would be interesting for me is like, well, you said my team, right? So my team, and then you’re working with data scientists. What are other engineers that you’re working with? Right. You’re a front-end engineer. So who is on your team? You know, do you have like testers on your team? Do you have like designers on your team and, and then you’re working with data scientists. How does the communication work like this? Can you tell me a little bit about the structure and you know, how, how are teams collaborating at all X.</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:06:13] Sure. So the way we kind of work at all X or X group is, but each team is a park. So we are defined the divided into something that is called a park and a park is this like self-contained unit of the organization that can ship their staff to the production. So each park has, you know, If you need front-end engineers, you have a front end engineer, you have buckets, engineers you’ll have product managers. There’s usually an engineering manager. If there are no engineers on the team, that’s kind of all, it is also useful. Some teams have a dedicated designer, some teams are working closely with, you know, with the designers, but they’re not necessarily in that team because some teams have like different needs when it comes to things like design. We also have a business analyst in our team. So again, like this is a very kind of self contained unit. What I like about this setup is because I used to work in the companies where we have, we had a front-end department and we had a backend and not only was communication tricky, but also working in an actual AI way was some somewhat difficult because as a front end engineer, if I wanted to get, by the way, I would like to get this one more piece of data from the backend. Then you had to go do the backend team, talk to them, but they apparently have the authority for this, for this space. I have to wait for the next bit and whatnot. Whereas in our current setup, we’ve worked very closely together. So we are not working in a silo, but quite the contrary, we are working very closely together with backend engineers, front end engineers. All of those skill sets that are required to build amazing products. Everything is included in that team. And I are very proud as a front end engineer of our backend engineers, because there are actually submitting a feedback when it comes to design and when it comes to UX solution that we build it. So this is honestly, this is something that I haven’t seen before then. Just the level of commitment to building. Uh, great products and not only, you know, juggling Jason data, as some of buckets engineers are used to doing.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:08:23] Okay. Yeah. And so how many front end engineers are, for example, in your team, but</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:08:29] those themes, they don’t have to be very large. So in my thing currently, we have two trumpet engineers. There’s two backend engineers. We have a dedicated contact in the data science team. So he’s not technically in our team, but we are working very closely together. We also have a dedicated designer, a product manager, business analyst, and my engineer manager. So there’s less than 10 people in total. I like this role that each team should be large enough that a one pizza can fit the entire theme. And I think this is not a good metric for how large the teams should be. Yeah, I like that.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:07] But with 10 people and one pizza, I mean, everybody gets a little slice. Really?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:14] Yeah.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:15] Yeah. And so one of the things that I love is code reviews. And so if you have like two front end engineers, do you do code reviews for each other? Or do you have like the back end engineers also looking at your code? …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393390920/_sH5RujzQ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Most web application developers reach for the tried and tested approach of fetching data from their API right when they need it, and they don't give an offline-first approach the consideration it deserves. Perhaps that's because working offline is generally thought of as a specific feature and that it's not necessarily applicable or appropriate for a wide variety of applications. However, there's a lot to be gained from going offline-first, even if your app isn't the "typical" offline application. Hopefully, after reading this article, you'll feel like you're better equipped to answer if working offline-first is right for your app.</p>

<p>When we say "offline-first", we don't just mean a bit of caching that means your user can revisit some pages they've already seen before. Many web apps make heavy use of the browser cache to achieve some basic level of functioning without a working internet connection. We're talking about going well beyond that.</p>
<p>For us, an offline-first web application is an application that is designed to be (close to) fully-functional without an internet connection. Now of course, the application may need an internet connection the first time around to authenticate the user and download some data. However, after that initial sync, it should be able to function without internet connectivity for some period of time. This means that not only browsing data (i.e. read operations) should work, but the user should also be able to create and update data (i.e. write operations) while in a disconnected state.</p>
<p>There are a million and one ways to achieve this kind of offline-first functionality. There's the browser cache, service workers, local storage, IndexedDB and a myriad of other tools that can be brought together to give your users a brilliant offline experience. </p>
<p>Inspired by the offline-first tools we use every day like Superhuman, Figma and Pitch, we've recently been working hard to turn <a target="_blank" href="https://kitemaker.co/">Kitemaker</a>, our product management tool for cross-functional, self-organizing product teams, into an offline-first application. We fetch the data the user may need ahead of time and store it in a local cache. The web application itself operates on that local cache only, and a separate layer takes care of syncing those changes back to the server. Our design was heavily inspired by the work Evan Wallace published about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">how multiplayer behavior works in Figma</a>. We're currently working on using service workers to download static assets and using IndexedDB to back our cache with persistent storage. We'll do a follow-up blog post on how offline works in Kitemaker, but here's a quick peek at the architecture:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393439657/Q9T8clsHl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="offline_architecture.png"></p>
<p>But this is just one example of how to achieve offline functionality. Exactly how you solve it will depend heavily on your application. The important part is that you start to think about whether your app <em>should</em> be offline-first.</p>

<p>You may be thinking that offline functionality sounds nice, but isn't super relevant most applications. We tend to disagree. We think there is a trend to push more and more SaaS products towards supporting working offline, and we think this is absolutely the right idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your application's performance (how fast it responds to your users' inputs) important/critical?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application in areas with spotty connectivity?</li>
<li>Will your users by using your application on airplanes?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application when roaming on their data connections, such as when on vacation?</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd be surprised if you didn't answer "yes" to at least a couple of those questions.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of advantages that come along with making your application offline-first:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It'll work offline.</strong> Yep, that's right. If you make your application work offline, it will in fact work offline 😊 It's actually a pretty killer feature and one which we appreciate greatly, especially when traveling/commuting.</li>
<li><strong>It'll survive flaky networks.</strong> There's nothing worse than getting an error on a web application just because your network had a hiccup. We really wish more chat applications (you know who you are) worked offline-first to avoid bad behavior on bad networks.</li>
<li><strong>It'll make your application react quicker to your users' inputs.</strong> Instead of waiting for a server roundtrip to update a UI, offline-first applications can behave optimistically and update local data right away and then send off changes to the server. This means your users don't need to wait around for the response.</li>
<li><strong>It sets you up nicely for "multiplayer" behavior.</strong> In order to make your application work offline, you  need to be able to handle conflicts that might arise when your users come back online and start shipping queued changes to your servers. Handling these queued operations is very often the same type of logic that's needed to handle two users operating on the same data at the same time, which means you might be able to unlock more collaborative features of your application.</li>
<li><strong>It can help you scale your writes on your server.</strong> Because your users aren't waiting around for responses from the server, you can treat your writes a bit differently. Maybe you queue them up for processing, or adopt a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a> approach. It opens up all sorts of possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your app logic.</strong> For us in Kitemaker, this was a big one. Before we adopted this offline-first approach, our GraphQL API calls had wormed their way into our code in a lot of places. Whenever changing data, we had to set up a GraphQL mutation, handle the response, provide optimistic responses to get the performance we need, etc. It was messy and complex. Now we just operate on objects in our local cache and the changes are transparently synced to our backend (and onwards to other users).</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your backend API.</strong> This one is not guaranteed by any means, but for us, our backend API became a very simple thing indeed. Instead of create/update/delete endpoints (or in our case mutations since we use GraphQL) for all of the different resources in our system, we now have a really simple API for sending changes from the client to the server. That's it. Of course YMMV.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are numerous advantages to working in an offline-first, it's not a given that you should dive in right away. Think about these things a little first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the data your users need to interact with reasonable small or can you chunk it into smaller datasets that your users can selectively choose to download for offline use (e.g. restaurant recommendations for a particular country/city)? If not, it will be very hard to build a good offline experience.</li>
<li>Can you ensure that most operations that your users perform while offline will succeed? Being offline-first does not lend itself to applications where your users will frequently get their requests rejected, transactions will be get rolled back, etc. Basically you need to ensure you have a very simple and deterministic way to handle any conflicts that might occur. If you can't ensure this, you'd better think twice before digging in.</li>
<li>It can be <em>a lot</em> of work to get it right. There are tools out there to help you, but you won't get offline-first behavior for free. You need to decide if it's worth the investment for your product or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope this article got your gears turning a little when it comes to offline-first web applications. We don't think appropriate for every application - it can be quite a lot of work to get right and for some applications it just doesn't make a lot of sense. But we just think people should give it some thought when designing and architecting a new application. We've learned from experience that retrofitting this type of behavior can also be quite a lot of work, but we're super happy we did it nonetheless!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week my mom died after a three year battle with cancer. I was fortunate to be by her bedside in the last few days of her life. At the beginning she was lucid and we got to say good bye— a great privilege. Then, for days, I watched her struggle for every breath as her breathing got shallower and shallower, until it eventually stopped.</p><p>Watching your parent die momentarily changes your executive depth of field. Important aspects of life near the foreground and assume unprecedented sharpness; unimportant ones recede and blur with the background. What matters and what doesn't becomes exceptionally obvious. For a moment, there is no mistaking one for the other.</p><p>In her last days, my mom had the long view on her life. Our conversations were emotional, but in part they sounded like a strategic postmortem, the way one might analyze key moments of a football game. Much of what she recalled was surprising— details that must have been mundane at the time, but turned out to have crucial importance to her in the end.</p><p>I wanted to write the lessons that seemed obvious to me while I was with her before they fade from memory. This is my writing and my view.  If my mom wrote this, the list would have been different. In all likelihood, she would have disagreed with many of my conclusions. Most of them contradict each other anyway. Caveat emptor.</p><ul><li><p>At the end, you will care about 3-5 things.</p></li><li><p>Your relationship with your parents, your spouse, and your children will be on that list. Get as many of these right as you can.</p></li><li><p>You can't know everything you will care about, but you can introspect the most important things. Do that early.</p></li><li><p>Always keep them in mind. Write them down. Review them daily. This is your North Star.</p></li><li><p>Declare bankruptcy on bullshit— faux emergencies, manufactured glitter, family and relationship drama, pointless errands, gossip, events you can't control, judgement of strangers, the opinion of Jeremiahs. My god, what an exhausting waste of time! Let it all go.</p></li><li><p>Every time you do something that you regret later, write it down. Then do those things less.</p></li><li><p>There will be times when you will have to be ruthless. When those times come, do not flinch. Do what must be done.</p></li><li><p>Addiction, abuse, depression and violence erode your humanity. Extricate yourself from these situations without mercy. Be strong. Do not permit anyone to harm you.</p></li><li><p>Don't neglect your body and don't obsess over it. Eat good food, exercise, attend to medical needs when it becomes necessary.</p></li><li><p>Get off the internet.</p></li><li><p>Cultivate a reading habit, and read widely. Reading broadens the imagination and expands the space of possibilities. It's a way out of the prison of your circumstance available to almost anyone who wants it.</p></li><li><p>Do more. Don't wake up one day thinking you haven't done all you could.</p></li><li><p>Have faith that the powers of darkness will, in time, <a href="https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/bad367b8edfc189a337bbf691b8fcb32">be crushed by the spirit of light</a>.</p></li><li><p>Seek  advice, but don't outsource your decisions. No one can make them for you.</p></li><li><p>Make a list of people you want to impress. Keep it very short. Be sure these people have your best interests at heart. Then ignore judgement from anyone not on the list.</p></li><li><p>Learn to think for yourself. The best way is to be around someone who can already do that. The second best way is to read correspondence of inventors, scientists, mathematicians, and artists. Third best is to read biographies. Ideally, do all three.</p></li><li><p>Examine your circumstance every few months. If something makes you unhappy for too long, make a change. Don't live a life of quiet desperation.</p></li><li><p>Strive for excellence, not greatness. <em>(thanks Robert!)</em></p></li><li><p>The hardest battles are the ones you’ll fight with yourself.</p></li><li><p>Accept people as facts.</p></li><li><p>Every time you do something you don't want to do, but are happy about it later, write it down. Do those things more.</p></li><li><p>Have adventures that carry risk. Start a business, ask out the girl you like, climb a mountain. This is where you'll find the 3-5 things that matter.</p></li><li><p>Have children.</p></li><li><p>Cultivate a sense of humor in all things. Prefer comedy over tragedy.</p></li></ul><p>My mom’s last words to me before she fell asleep and never woke up:</p><blockquote><p>Wear warm clothes. There is apple strudel for you on the kitchen table. Be strong.</p></blockquote><p>I’ll miss you every day, mom ❤️</p></div></div>]]>

  <h2>Pixel-Perfect Scrolling With a Mouse Wheel Under Linux</h2>
  <time datetime="2020-01-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Jan 2020</time>
  <p>Yesterday, I plugged in my Logitech mouse into my laptop and started reading a PDF file. I started scrolling the page and realized that the scrolling is not as smooth as with my touchpad. The difference is that the touchpad scrolls the PDF pixel-by-pixel, whereas my mouse scrolls the PDF with one scroll-wheel click roughly 3 lines at once.</p>

<p>I previously had a look into the HID++ protocol of Logitech mice to <a href="https://github.com/fin-ger/logitech-m720-config">enable the thumb button of my M720</a>, and did know that my mouse has a high-resolution mode for the scroll-wheel. So, technically it is possible to get high-resolution scrolling data from my mouse and translate it to smooth pixel-perfect scrolling in my PDF viewer.</p>

<p>I searched the internet, read systemd source code, dug into libinput documentation, and finally found a way to achieve pixel-perfect scrolling! 🎉</p>

<h2 id="here-is-how-to-set-it-up">Here is how to set it up!</h2>

<p>First you have to install the <code>solaar</code> package with your Linux distribution’s package manager.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/solaar">Debian</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/eoan/solaar">Ubuntu</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/solaar">Fedora</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-misc/solaar">Gentoo</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/solaar/">Arch</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://madb.mageia.org/package/show/release/cauldron/application/0/name/solaar">Mageia</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/Solaar">OpenSUSE</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After installing, follow the wizard to configure your unifying receiver and mouse. Now, you can use <code>Solaar</code> to configure some options on your mouse. The <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property enables the high-resolution mode on the mouse-wheel.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.made-by-fin.de/assets/solaar-config.png" alt="Solaar configuration window"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, the wheel resolution property is not working with all unifying receivers. If it is not working, you can try restarting and disconnecting and reconnecting the unifying receiver to see if it works then, but some receivers of mine were no able to set the property. The receiver with <code>Bootloader 34.00.B0004</code> and <code>Firmware 04.02.B0009</code> worked best for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, you can try to set the property via the command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>solaar config <span>"M720 Triathlon"</span> hires-smooth-resolution <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property could be successfully set, you will recognize way too fast scrolling behavior. This can be changed by applying some <code>udev</code> <code>uwdb</code> rules.</p>

<p>Create the file <code>/etc/udev/hwdb.d/71-logitech-m720.hwdb</code> as <strong>root</strong> and open it in your preferred editor (also as root or with sudo). Insert the following lines and save the file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mouse:usb:v046dp405e:name:Logitech M720 Triathlon:
mouse:bluetooth:v046dpb015:name:M720 Triathlon:
    <span>MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_ANGLE</span><span>=</span>1
    <span>MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_COUNT</span><span>=</span>360
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Documentation on all available options for your mouse can be found <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/05de16766b6bae290c500857269b753df2a0c649/hwdb.d/70-mouse.hwdb">here</a>. A more up-to-date version may be available <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/hwdb.d/70-mouse.hwdb">here</a> (might be broken in the future).</p>

<p>Next, we have to apply the changes. Run the following commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>udevadm hwdb <span>--update</span>
<span>$ </span>libinput list-devices | <span>grep</span> <span>-A</span> 1 M720
Device:           Logitech M720 Triathlon
Kernel:           /dev/input/event15
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>udevadm trigger /dev/input/event15
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Replace <code>/dev/input/event15</code> with the result shown by `libinput list-devices**</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong></p>

<p>You got pixel-perfect scrolling with your mouse-wheel!</p>

<video width="1000" controls="">
  <source src="https://blog.made-by-fin.de/assets/m720.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<blockquote>
  <p>A before/after comparison of the proposed configuration</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="persisting-the-configuration">Persisting the Configuration</h2>

<p>The <code>hwdb</code> configuration will be automatically loaded when you plug in your mouse. The <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property is sometimes restored by Solaar, and sometimes not. Try to put Solaar in the autostart of your desktop environment. It might work. Otherwise, you have to manually enable the property 😢</p>

<h2 id="enhancements-and-future-work">Enhancements and Future Work</h2>

<p>The scrolling can stutter or jump when scrolling really slow. Also, when the middle mouse button is clicked you may unintentionally scroll, as the sensitivity of the scroll-wheel is so high. Maybe, this can be solved by applying a filter with libinput on the incoming scroll events. I have not figured out, how to set this up, yet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>DevOps, the method of <strong>automating processes between development and operations</strong>, is one of the essential factors of successfully implementing a cloud-native approach. Since cloud-native has a purpose to<strong> reduce go-to-market time and bring more efficiency to companies</strong>, DevOps is what streamlines individuals, tools, and systems, contributing to the overall success of the enterprise. This is what makes cloud-native DevOps a logical step towards improved productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both cloud-native and DevOps movements are on the rise. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reportsanddata.com/report-detail/devops-market#:~:text=The%20global%20DevOps%20Market%20is,USD%2017.27%20Billion%20in%202027." target="_blank">Reports and Data</a> predict that <em>the global DevOps market will grow from $4.49 billion in 2019 to $17.27 billion in 2027</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is more, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/devops-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank">the COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced cloud adoption</a>. <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/idc-worldwide-it-predictions-for-2021-that-cios-need-to-know/#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20a%20dramatic,affect%20the%20enterprise%20by%202023.">Predictions</a> say that by the end of 2021, <strong>80% of companies will double the adoption of cloud-centric infrastructure and apps</strong>. This is mainly due to the shift to a remote-first workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A cloud-native DevOps approach maximizes agility with continuous deployment. Moreover, it scales up systems and applications without the need for drastic changes.</p>



<p><em>Let’s dive in and see what this approach really means.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>What is the cloud-native approach to software development?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Adopting the cloud-native approach means embracing many new options for leveraging innovations. <em>The primary tools cloud-native teams use are offered by the cloud instead of on-premise infrastructure.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Cloud-native applications are <strong>agile, adaptable, robust, and easy to monitor.</strong> This means that teams build them with frequent and quick deployments and iterations. Instead of preventing failure, they embrace it and have <strong>the ability to improve in real-time</strong>. </p>



<p>Furthermore, they don’t rely on external factors when it comes to monitoring. Instead, the application can be controlled from the inside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cloud-native beginnings date from around ten years ago, when a group of tech leaders introduced it to the public. <a href="http://pzf.fremantle.org/2010/05/cloud-native.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This blog post</a> by Paul Fremantle,  VP of Technical Product Strategy at Weaveworks, is among the first related articles. In the post, he claims that applications should be written FOR the cloud to behave well ON the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in 2015, Matt Stine, Executive Director at JPMorgan Chase, cleared the cloud-native concept in his book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/migrating-to-cloud-native/9781492047605/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Migrating to Cloud-Native Application Architectures</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now,<strong> the cloud-native umbrella covers many tools and methods, including microservices, containers, CI/CD, multi-cloud</strong>, etc. <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The CNCF Cloud Native Interactive Landscape</a> provides a great overview of most of the tools used in the cloud-native approach.&nbsp; To help and provide development communities with good alternatives for building cloud-native applications, the CNCF cultivates this landscape of open source tools.</p>



<h2>What is cloud-native DevOps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If we combine the two definitions, cloud-native DevOps turns into <strong>a set of practices that consists of constant development, automated actions, and cross-functional teams,</strong> which result in improving the entire experience of the end-user. Cloud-native DevOps is all about <strong>making your company more flexible.</strong> You achieve this through technologies like Kubernetes and containers, which can automate processes and make applications more scalable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All these practices apply to almost every aspect of the company. This means changing the entire culture which involves tools, people, and processes. When it comes to <strong>culture, </strong>you need to <a href="https://microtica.com/want-to-move-from-ops-to-devops-here-is-what-you-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopt a DevOps-oriented approach</a>. This will foster better alignment between people and tools. </p>



<p>You have to motivate your employees to collaborate more effectively, encouraging a faster feedback circle. Faster feedback will enable quick iterations and real-time improvements. </p>



<p>You’ll also have to make some <strong>technical changes</strong>. This refers to adopting technologies that are in the center of cloud-native DevOps, such as containerization and microservices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How to get started with cloud-native DevOps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>These are the options to get started with a cloud-native strategy:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Implementing a cloud-first strategy by choosing a cloud provider instead of an on-premises one</li><li>Adopting a multi-cloud strategy if it meets business needs more closely</li><li>Embracing DevOps, which is obviously what we’re going to focus on further in this post.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>When companies realize that agile development requires both automation and culture transformation to produce quality applications faster, DevOps becomes a priority. Handling multiple hybrid environments or streamlining infrastructure stuff can get very complicated. That’s why the popularity of tools that align cloud-native and DevOps processes is rising rapidly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make the implementation of cloud-native DevOps easier, these are some things you should pay attention to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Containerization</strong> enables the creation of environment-agnostic software. It also eliminates implementation conflicts between developers and operation departments, enabling developers and testers to communicate easier.</li><li><strong><a href="https://microtica.com/why-transition-from-monolith-to-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Going from monolith to microservices</a> </strong>also makes the company more agile. This establishes a set of tools, terms, and processes for both development and operation teams. With microservices, you get sophisticated process automation and an easier transition towards agile product development, which is what continuous delivery requires.</li><li><strong>Using a container orchestration platform</strong>. The most popular is Kubernetes because it solves the challenges related to underlying computing, storage, and networking.</li><li><strong>Automating CI/CD pipelines </strong>in order to reduce complexity and the chances of errors. This automation can save a lot of headaches for developers. Moreover, it allows them to focus on the actual product instead of fixing issues.&nbsp;</li><li>Writing code <strong><a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the 12 factors</a></strong> also makes things more transparent.</li></ul>



<h2>Most common mistakes in adopting cloud-native DevOps</h2>



<h3><strong>Using too many tools</strong></h3>



<p>Once you switch to cloud-native DevOps, you’ll try automating as many processes as possible. However, you don’t do this by just adding and adding tools. You have to pick the right tools and make the best combination that’s right for your application. Overusing tools will also cost you a lot of time and money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another mistake here is that developers often get too reliable of a certain tool. The essence of DevOps, however, lies in the team spirit and the implementation of correct practices that contribute to increased productivity and enhanced processes.</p>



<h3><strong>Avoiding continuous monitoring</strong></h3>



<p>While testing inside the implementation pipelines makes the things more straightforward and flowing, it also makes them limited&nbsp; and incomplete. Continuous monitoring, on the other hand, can optimize the entire process by highlighting each malfunction that happens even after the testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Not paying enough attention to security</strong></h3>



<p>Security checks can be quite time-consuming and costly. Teams often think of that security checking capabilities as something that is put to use within the CI/CD workflows. The implementation of a separate tool that takes care of security is a critical move for DevOps to turn and avoid any vulnerabilities in the process.</p>



<h3><strong>Making the transition too fast</strong></h3>



<p>Adopting cloud-native DevOps should be a slow process with a lot of learning on the way. Expecting a company that has been using on-premise applications to immediately align all their structures and platforms into a single cloud-native architecture is simply impossible. Maybe you can quickly make new cloud-native applications, but transitioning existing applications will take a while.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best solutions would be to go step-by-step. Start by migrating applications to the cloud and continue with transitioning from monolith to microservices. Then, you can set up containers and container orchestration platforms. However, none of this will be successful unless you undergo the culture shift we talk about so much.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>To wrap things up</h2>



<p>Effective implementation of cloud-native DevOps helps businesses to market fresh technologies more rapidly, speeding up their digital transformation. Through cutting enormous cloud costs and rising efficiency and performance, the cloud-native approach has become a blessing to companies with software products. Completely relying on the potential of cloud-native DevOps, unlocks on-demand, unlimited software development powers.</p>

<h3>[ 2020-December-05 19:55 ]</h3>
<p>When accepting a job or working at a startup, you need to understand what startup options might be worth. In this article, I'll describe the simple models I use. I learned about options during the 7 years of my career running a startup (failed), then working for one (still doing well!). Stock options are a complicated subject, and I will not explain anything other than how I personally estimate their value. My advice is probably wrong. Like any financial decision, you should research your choices carefully. If you want to understand startup stock options in depth, I recommend the book <a href="https://www.venturedeals.com/">Venture Deals: Be smarter than your lawyer and your venture capitalist</a>.</p>

<h2>Trivial model: Your options are worthless</h2>

<p>Assume your stock options are worth $0. If this is true, will you still take the job, or stay with your employer? If the answer is no, I recommend looking for other jobs. There are many, many ways that startup stock will become worthless. The company can go bankrupt. It can have financial trouble, and dilute existing investors in order to raise money (research: "down round"). It can be purchased for a small enough amount of money that investors get all of it (research: "liquidation preference"). It can continue to exist for a long time, either as an independent company, or be acquired by another private company for stock. The average outcome for a startup is that it is worth $0, since most startups fail. You should estimate how likely you think this is, based on what you know about the company. However, you should be pessimistic, since even high-flying companies can run into challenges (e.g. WeWork, Theranos, and many, many others). I like to assume that even good startups have at least a 50% chance of being effectively worth $0.</p>

<p>This does not mean you should never consider working for a startup. However, you should have good reasons other than the potential financial reward. The reliable way to earn a lot of money in the software industry, at least for the last 20-30 years, is to work at a big publicly traded software company. However, small companies have other advantages. Working at a small company gives you more responsibility and an environment with a higher rate of change. In the best startups, this means you can learn different skills, and might learn at a faster rate than at a large company. More specifically, I think that startups provide much better insight into how businesses work. You will get more exposure to important concepts like revenue, cost of good sold, and the cost to acquire customers. At large companies, other job functions are very remote, so you are isolated from having to know anything about them.</p>

<p>As a personal disclosure, at the time of writing, I am working at Datadog, which I consider a big company. However, working at startups taught me an enormous amount about the business of software. I do not regret my choices, even though I likely would have made more have working at Google, Twitter, or any other publicly traded company. (Although that could still change! Come on <a href="https://www.bluecore.com/">Bluecore</a>, I'm rooting for you!) I would also consider working for another startup, or even starting my own again at some point in the future.</p>

<h2>Financial model: Value the company</h2>

<p>The next approach is to estimate how valuable the company is. You can then compute your stock value = (company value)×(ownership fraction). This is very hard, and professional investors make or break their careers on their ability to do this. However, even a simple model is useful, as long as you recognize that it is probably wrong. I like to assume that I have a 50% chance of the stock being worth $0, a 40% chance of getting the money I use to exercise the options back, and a 10% chance of the stock being worth something. This means that my risk-adjusted "expected value" of the stock is approximately 1/10th the estimated value. Another way of saying this is you should believe that your options have some chance at being worth 10× what you will pay to exercise them. If this sounds crazy, you should walk. Again, you should adjust the chance of the stock being worth something based on your opinion of the company, since every company is different. But again, be pessimistic! It is easy to be sentimental for companies that you have worked for, or where you know employees personally.</p>

<p>To compute the ownership fraction, you should ask the company for the total number of outstanding shares, including the options pool. Private companies are sometimes hesitant to provide this information. If they don't want to divulge, I like to tell them that means I have to assume the stock is worthless when comparing their offer to other companies. This should motivate them to share some information, or you should take a job elsewhere. It is a bad sign if your employer lacks transparency for a basic thing like company value.</p>

<p> The numbers I like to use to estimate the company value are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Last 409a valuation</strong>: The 409a valuation is an IRS requirement, and is the "fair market value" of common stock, based on <a href="https://carta.com/blog/what-is-a-409a-valuation/#jumpto6">a number of evaluation methodologies</a>. I think of this as a "low" estimate. It is supposed to be approximately what an investor would pay for a share of common stock, at the time of the estimate. The company is either worth more than this in the future, or it is worth $0. This mean you should consider a range of values, based on your opinion of how fast the company is growing (e.g. maybe 1×, 2×, 5×, 10×?). If you are a current employee, this number should be available to you, since you need it for tax purposes if you exercise your options.</li>

<li><strong>Last round valuation</strong>: At the last round of investment, professional investors believed they could earn a profit by buying shares at this price. In one way, this is a low estimate because it was made some time in the past. You can only sell the shares in the future, if the company has grown and is more valuable. However, this is also a high estimate because as an employee you have common shares, while investors have preferred shares. Preferred shares are less risky because they typically have a liquidation preference, so therefore are worth more.</li>

<li><strong>Multiple of annual recurring revenue (ARR)</strong>: A rough way to value companies, particularly SaaS companies, is to assume they are worth some multiple of their revenue. <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/valuation_multiples_2020-03-02/">An evaluation of public company SaaS revenue multiples in March 2020</a> showed that the average public SaaS company has a valuation that is about 6-8× their ARR. However, the faster the growth, the higher the valuation, so it ranges from 30× to 1×. You should calculate a range of values, based on how fast you think the company is growing.</li>

<li><strong>Comparable acquisitions/fundraising (high)</strong>: If you know of similar or competing businesses that have recently raised money or have been acquired, you can use their valuations. You will need to scale them to match the size of the company and to adjust for differences in their businesses. This is complicated because no two businesses are the same, and you need to know about comparable events. I usually don't bother with this, unless you know of something relevant.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Regret minimization</h2>

<p>After I have some rough idea of what the company might be worth, I like to imagine how I will feel in the future in two scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>The stock is worth $0, and I exercised my options or accepted the job: How bad will I feel about losing this money, or about the other job opportunities I passed up?</li>
<li>The stock is worth something, and I did not exercise my options or passed on the job: How bad will I feel hearing about how much money I could have made?</li>
</ul>

<p>I find it useful to think about what choices I will regret the least. Avoiding regret is why I usually advise people leaving a startup to exercise some of their options (e.g. $100-1000), even if they think the company is not doing well. If I walked away from options after working at a company for some time, then later learned those options would have been worth something, I would be very annoyed at myself. If you own at least a token amount, you can share in any potential future success, while limiting the amount you might lose.</p>

Starting from an initial guess and iterating to an optimal point is key to getting  the right kind customers and many of them.</p><p>That’s no different as a marketplace, but the vectors are different. Especially if you are taking <a href="https://twosided.io/p/monetization-strategies-for-marketplaces">transaction commissions</a>, many changes can only applied to new users (i.e. taking a bigger cut) at a time or need to be agreed to.</p><p>This can be painful and difficult. Marketplaces are more static for that reason. Some commission schemes at leading marketplaces have stayed unchanged for years.</p><p>Let me show you an example that it’s still worth to experiment with your pricing, though. At <a href="https://mentorcruise.com/">MentorCruise</a>, pricing is moving and changing all the time, but in 2020  there were two really big changes, can you spot them?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd12fe6f-3fac-4e7a-af30-d3a64996fa13_1306x612.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd12fe6f-3fac-4e7a-af30-d3a64996fa13_1306x612.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd12fe6f-3fac-4e7a-af30-d3a64996fa13_1306x612.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:612,&quot;width&quot;:1306,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72638,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I’ve made it easy for you, but let me walk you through it :)</p><p>In <strong>March 2020</strong>, I decided to push for a monthly subscription model. Previously, mentees were able to pay weekly and one-off rates and churned quickly at the sight of those many transactions. Going with longer windows yielded longer mentorships.</p><p>That growth compounded to something along a 600% growth in just six month, but it was harder to pull off than just setting up a new pricing plan.</p><p>While great for creating longer lasting mentorships, mentors were now getting access to their funds a lot slower.</p><p>Previously, if they had set up weekly calls, they got funds sent to their accounts not more than 7 days after. Now, they would take up to a month to clear!</p><p>Documentation and customer support were crucial here to explain these new delayed payouts.</p><p>Then, in <strong>September 2020</strong>, I felt locked in by my fee structure. From any transaction I would take a 20% cut. Pricing was in the hand of mentors. That didn’t allow me to expand and experiment on that front a lot.</p><p>While transparent, it’s also a fee structure that hurts to see. Frequently I would get messages why after all fees a mentor would only receive $78 out of their $100 price tag.</p><p>So, I ran a wide migration that would give mentors 100% of what they wanted to charge and put my own fees on top. On one side, that made the prices go a little higher, but would give me a change to experiment with that cut, run promotions, try and round to $xx9 instead of $xx0, all without adjusting the partner agreement.</p><p><strong>So, let’s stop with the anecdotes. Pricing changes in the right direction are worth it, but how are they done right?</strong></p><p>1) If you are building something new, my advice would be to choose a structure that does not limit your freedom. Agree on a flat fee with your suppliers, then experiment with whatever fee or pricing you put on top.</p><p>If you work on something where pricing changes require you to change partner agreements, work on one last migration that will get you away from that.</p><p>2) If you do need to change partner agreements, provide an option to be grandfathered or opt out. For example, a few months into operations, we started to provide a 7-day trial at MentorCruise. Three mentors opted out, but were later convinced by the far more superior numbers.</p><p>3) Look into non-commission based pricing schemes. For example, sites like MicroAcquire charge a subscription for access and a lot of the revenue of ebay comes from advertising.</p><p>4) Communicate! Pricing changes that are visible to suppliers will always produce customer support load, be braced for it.</p><p>Going for a marketplace structure should not limit the decisions you can take around pricing.</p><p>Instead, they should be a tool you can utilize to get more high-quality leads to your suppliers and hopefully more money in everyone’s pockets.</p><p>As you can see, even for marketplace getting to the right pricing scheme is immensely valuable!</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[How many layers of my BERT model should I freeze?]]>

December 7, 2020 | https://raphaelb.org/posts/freezing-bert/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://raphaelb.org/posts/freezing-bert/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p><span>S</span>ince the advent of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017) and of BERT models (Devlin et al. 2019), Transformer models have become ubiquitous in NLP, achieving SOTA results on most NLP datasets.</p>
<p>Before Sesame Street puppets flooded on ArXiv, the de-facto method to train an NLP model leveraged word embeddings pre-trained using Glove or word2vec. These word embeddings were used to initialize the first embedding layer of your model, and you just had to plug the rest of your architecture above this first layer.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s increasingly common to use BERT-like language models trained on vast amounts of unlabeled text, and fine-tune the model on task-specific data. This change of paradigm led to a new subfield in NLP called BERTology which studies the ins and outs of BERT-like models.</p>
<p>Many hyper-parameters of BERT — such as the number of attention heads or the learning rate to use — have been studied, but few papers looked at how layer freezing affects performances.  Freezing layers means disabling gradient computation and backpropagation for the weights of these layers. This is a common technique in NLP or Computer Vision when working on small datasets as it usually reduces the chances of your model to overfit. Usually, models are frozen from bottom to top, as the first layers of neural networks are thought to encode universal features while the top layers are more task-specific. Another advantage of freezing is that it provides a nice speed boost and reduced memory usage during training.</p>
<p>Most machine learning teams in industry don’t have access to high-quality and domain-specific datasets. As the costs of building custom datasets are high, these datasets are usually way smaller than those often used in academia. Learning how to train better models with fewer data is a major concern, especially in industry. While the effect of freezing on performance has been explored (Lee, Tang, and Lin 2019), the low-resource setting hasn’t attracted much attention yet. Luckily, it’s what this post is all about 😎</p>

<p>To test how freezing affects performances when data is scarce, we will use the now popular <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">🤗 Transformers library</a> from Hugging Face to train a RoBERTa model (base version) on two standard binary classification datasets from the GLUE benchmark: SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) and CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability).</p>
<p>SST-2 is a sentiment analysis task and CoLA a dataset containing sentences labeled with respect to their grammatical acceptability (i.e whether each sentence is grammatically correct or not). SST-2 and CoLA contain ~51% and ~69% of positive samples respectively in their validation set, which gives us a majority class baseline to compare to. We will use accuracy as the metric of evaluation for both datasets.</p>
<p>We will train models with a subset of the training dataset and evaluate on the whole validation dataset. For CoLA and SST-2, we generate subsets of size 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>taking care that the fraction of positive samples is the same as in the original train dataset (stratify splitting)</li>
<li>generating the splits by increasing size (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000) and reusing all samples from the previous split. By doing so, we limit the variability coming from using different samples in each split.</li>
</ul>
<p>To assess the impact of layer freezing on performances, 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, or 12 encoder layers were frozen. I also tested to only freeze the embedding layers (frozen layers = -1).</p>
<p>Similar to the original RoBERTa paper (Liu et al. 2019), I fine-tuned for 10 epochs with a linear warmup of 1 epoch followed by a linear decay to zero. As my computational budget was limited, I didn’t perform any hyper-parameter search and stuck to the default values (<code>lr = 5e-5</code>, AdamW optimizer).</p>
<p>On both datasets, for each layer freezing value (-1, 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12) and for each train size (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000), 5 replicates were trained with a different random seed.</p>
<p>I decided to use the recent (and pretty awesome!) <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/datasets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">🤗Datasets</a> library — also developed by folks from Hugging Face — to easily fetch and process these two datasets:</p>

<p>Here comes the most interesting part!</p>
<p>Below is displayed for both datasets the best accuracy obtained during training on the development set for all train sizes and all numbers of frozen layers. Each red dot on the plot represents a single run.</p>
<p>The complete results can also be found as tables at the end of the post.</p>
<p><img src="https://raphaelb.org/img/freezing-bert/sst2.png" alt="Results on SST-2"></p>
<p><em>SST-2: Best accuracy during training on development set</em></p>
<p><img src="https://raphaelb.org/img/freezing-bert/cola.png" alt="Results on CoLA"></p>
<p><em>CoLA: Best accuracy during training on development set</em></p>
<p>As expected, having more data always help: we gain +0.15 (0.75 → 0.90) in accuracy by increasing dataset size from 50 to 1000 for SST-2.</p>
<p>Freezing all (12) layers of the encoder is definitely not a good idea when dealing with limited data: there is always a significant performance drop, and the resulting models are barely better than a majority class classifier. Freezing 10 layers is also associated with degraded accuracy, even if the effect isn’t as strong. Aside from 10- and 12-frozen layers, there are no clear impact of layer freezing on performances.</p>
<p>We also observe high variability in accuracy between runs with the same settings (but with different random seeds). This instability is known since the release of BERT. While catastrophic forgetting and the small sizes of datasets were first suspected as the causes of this instability, more recent work (Mosbach et al. 2020) suggests that optimization difficulties leading to vanishing gradients are the actual reasons. For both SST-2 and CoLA datasets, there are no clear evidence that freezing reduces these instabilities.</p>
<p>As a final note, the performance gap between SST-2 and CoLA with 50 examples is interesting: while best models for SST-2 classify 82% of samples correctly (with 51% of positive samples), best run are barely better than the majority class baseline with 70% of samples correctly classified. This is indicative of the inductive bias of these models, which are more prone to detect polarity than grammatical correctness.</p>

<p>And that’s all for this second post 😊!</p>
<p>The results of these experiments were surprising to me, I initially thought layer freezing would have a more visible impact on performances.</p>

It lists ~30 libraries for creating web components, comparing code style, performance and bundle size. One of the libraries got me intrigued - Stencil - which looks very promising and has lots of stars on GitHub - about 8.6k.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-m0td"><span><a href="https://stenciljs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Stencil</u></span></a><span> is a React-inspired web component library. It is using the same JSX as React and some of the same concepts (Render function, props, state). However, Stencil differs as it compiles to an optimal bundle, creating Virtual DOM that is consolidated directly into the DOM itself (no VDOM to VDOM comparison). The result is standard web components with optimal performance.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-876ce"><span><span>On top, Stencil provides good development experience through their template applications - for building a component, a website / app or a PWA. Stencil also supports server-side rendering and hydrations for websites that need to be optimized for indexing.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-4f7v9"><span><span>To learn Stencil, we decided to build yet another version of </span><a href="http://todomvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>TodoMVC</u></span></a><span>. TodoMVC is a great platform to compare different javascript libraries - it </span>exposes<span> 54 Javascript UI libraries on one simple use case - a Todo list application.

With Stencil both the props and state are just members of </span><span>this</span><span> - </span><span>this.newTodo</span><span> and</span><span> this.mode</span><span>l.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-6ojpl"><span><span>The second difference is the use of the </span><span>class</span><span> attribute instead of the </span><span>className</span><span> attribute. The semantics are the same, with Stencil using the more standard naming scheme.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-acdmj"><span><span>The third difference is event binding, where in Stencil they promote using arrow functions while React promotes explicit binding using the</span><span> .bind() </span><span>function. This is obviously a preference and both options can be used in both libraries.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-8hram"><span><span>The last, not so obvious, difference is with using child components. In the React version, we see the use of </span><span>TodoFooter</span><span> and </span><span>TodoItem</span><span> - both are React components which are imported into the module. However, with Stencil, the child components are</span><span> todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span>, and there is no import statement to import those into the module. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-d0h3a"><span><span>While this may seem strange at first glance, it actually makes sense once you remember that both </span><span>todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span> are web components and are supported natively by browsers.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-f06tp"><span><span>When comparing Stencil to React and Svelte in terms of performance, Stencil scores a higher lighthouse score for desktop. For mobile, Svelte takes the lead but is less stable. Stencil on mobile is close behind Svelte and is more stable.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-9o36j"><span><span><strong>Desktop comparison:</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-83opl"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_320%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ong4"><span><span><strong>Mobile Comparison (3 runs):</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-b92bd"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_488%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9gf8n"><span><span>All the libraries score very high grades for the TodoMVC case.

Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-11-19">November 19, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Every day at work, hundreds of customers ask us "can I get a large cappuccino?". Later, we go home and use the money to narrowly avoid starvation while working on IMGZ, the best image host, in true Silicon Valley spirit. We thought that some of the architectural challenges we faced while building the service would interest others, and decided to write about them to help our readers and change the world.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with IMGZ, it's an image host with a twist: You pay to host images, thus ensuring that we always have your best interests in mind and won't turn into a social network. In essence, we flip the traditional "startup giving away VC money to users" on its head, and take money <strong>from</strong> users. If that sounds good to you, you can sign up <a href="https://imgz.org/">on our home page</a> and we'll only be mildly surprised.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we're passionate about two things: Serving images, and speaking about ourself in the plural so it doesn't look like it's the one-man sideproject it is, and we don't even really care about serving images that much. Today, though, we're going to talk about the former, and take a deep dive into the technical details of serving more than one million bytes of images per day while maintaining the elusive "nine fives" reliability guarantee we're loved for and usually uphold.</p>
<h2>Architecture deep-dive</h2>
<p>Our architecture is pretty simple, a fairly run-of-the-mill, scrappy-startup SaaS architecture which you've no doubt seen countless times before:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></a></p>
<p>While designing the IMGZ storage and serving model, we wanted scalability and reliability to be our foremost concerns.
After months of designs and grueling research, we ended up designing a Kafka-based georeplicated image processing pipeline over a multitenant, distributed, resilient microservices architecture, where metadata about each image is kept in a georeplicated MongoDB instance, and with images themselves stored in DynamoDB on AWS, ensuring scalability and low latency.</p>
<p>When we realized we didn't have investors to impress, we trashed that plan, as it sounded like too much work.
We realize that architecture design nowadays is mostly aspirational, but at some point a startup needs to come to terms with the fact that it doesn't have ten million users right now, it probably won't have ten million users soon, and it'll likely never have ten users.
Instead, we stored the images in a small Postgres database (yes, the actual image data itself), with a small Django app handling the business logic. Sexy.</p>
<p>When the user uploads an image, we process it, create thumbnails for displaying in various views of the website, and store it along with its metadata in the database, at least in theory.
When a user requests the image, the request first goes through our CDN, which fetches the image from our server and then caches it forever, so each image is only served by us at most once.
For our CDN (for serving, caching, georeplication, etc), we use CloudFlare's free tier, which is excellent.
We ensure that we'll always remain in the free tier by providing a paid service nobody would actually ever pay for.</p>
<h2>The hardware</h2>
<p>This is the heart of IMGZ:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze/"><img src="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze.jpg" alt="Servers"></a></p>
<p>Images, just like the one above, are the heart of our service, but let's not digress.
The hardware is a $5/mo Hetzner VM that serves ~10 other projects, so it's pretty beefy.
As our favorite proverb goes, "you don't need lots of resources when all your content is static and you can get someone else to serve it for free".</p>
<p>We're pretty confident in our ability to scale our infrastructure in the event that more users join the service, as our VPS provider has a button we can press to make the server larger, solving all scalability problems once and for all.</p>
<h2>Moral of the story</h2>
<p>This article was a bit boring, wasn't it? That's by design: Your architecture doesn't have to be exciting to work, especially in the early stages of a company. Doing the easiest thing that works (taking care not to paint yoursellf into a corner) is often the best way to start, since you usually don't even know where you'll end up.</p>
<p>To summarize, our architecture follows the tried-and-true Silicon Valley approach: Build the simplest thing you can, by piggybacking off of everyone's free tier, while they hope you one day become successful and pay them exorbitant amounts of money in return. The strategy to outsmarting them is simple:</p>
<p>Just make sure you never succeed.</p>

<p><span>T</span>he Indiranagar 100-Feet Road is the commercial heart of India’s technology capital Bangalore, lined with international brand stores, bars, restaurants, and food courts. Owning retail space here, alongside consumer giant Reliance Digital and German footwear brand Puma, is a marker of success for brands breaking into mainstream consciousness. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi’s two-story, 6,000-square-foot flagship store is right at the heart of the district. Behind its saffron frontage is a showcase for its as-yet-unlaunched handsets, televisions, laptops, fitness bands, e-scooters, and water purifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, the store had a complete facelift. A new logo was put on the front of the building that read: “Made In India.” By August, the interior had been decorated with tricolored balloons in the green, white, and orange of the Indian flag. Along the walls, a company timeline showed the history of Xiaomi’s manufacturing operations in India. Mentions of the company’s heritage — it was founded in Beijing in 2010 — disappeared. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/xiaomi-puts-up-made-in-india-banner-outside-stores-to-counter-boycott-china-campaign-1692633-2020-06-25">Hundreds</a> of the company’s stores across the country underwent the same transformation. “Super proud to share that majority of our TVs are #MadeInIndia! We employ thousands of team members across our India factories #ProudIndian,” <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1276052185638252544?s=20">tweeted</a> Manu Kumar Jain, the India head of Xiaomi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anti-China sentiment had already been rising in India’s heartlands before a skirmish in June in a disputed Himalayan border region left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Nationalists started <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bharat-mata-and-chinese-tvs-a-tale-of-boycotting-goods-from-china">smashing</a> Chinese-made televisions; one minister called for shutting down <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/restaurants-and-hotels-that-sell-chinese-food-should-be-shut-down-union-minister-ramdas-athawale/videoshow/76442910.cms">Chinese restaurants</a>. A few weeks after the skirmish, the Indian government banned TikTok, along with hundreds of Chinese apps, and, in August, passed an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55642551-f6e8-4f9d-b5ba-a12d2fc26ef9">unofficial</a> order to phase out dependence on Chinese telecom equipment, including 5G networks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a special appearance on television encouraging Indians to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmx92Q_kQ4">“vocal” in their support for “local” products</a>, creating the #vocalforlocal slogan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chinese smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi — who made up 81% of the Indian market — were left in a precarious position after the clash. Right-wing groups gathered outside Oppo’s factory in the outskirts of Delhi and <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/jun/20/anti-china-demonstration-held-outside-oppo-factory-in-greater-noida-32-protesters-booked-2159224.html">burnt effigies of Xi Jinping</a>, as they demanded that the plant be closed. Some companies battened down the hatches, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/chinese-brands-endorsers-may-go-slow-on-promotions-some-pull-out-ads-some-plan-to-play-up-make-in-india-credentials/articleshow/76429828.cms?from=mdr">suspending their prime-time advertising campaigns</a>. Vivo <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ipl-title-sponsor-vivo-pulls-out-of-tournament-this-year-amid-row-2274036">pulled out</a> as the title sponsor of the country’s biggest sporting event, the Indian Premier League cricket competition, after an aggressive campaign against it on social media. Stray protests took place outside some Xiaomi stores, as threats of vandalism loomed large and mobile shipments from China were <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/smartphone-makers-in-panic-mode-over-stranded-shipments/76536342">stalled for manual inspection at Indian ports</a>.</p>



<p>But while other Chinese brands retreated from the limelight, Xiaomi pursued a unique — and potentially high-risk — strategy: It presented itself as not being Chinese after all, but Indian. Jain, its figurehead in India, took to television, newspapers, and social media to talk up the company’s all-Indian local leadership team and the thousands of jobs it had created in manufacturing and retail. “We are more Indian than anyone else,” Jain told <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1274316181235568645?lang=en">CNBC-TV18</a>. The company even donated money to the families of soldiers “<a href="https://www.mi.com/in/service/support/crpffund.html">martyred</a>” in Kashmir.</p>



<p>Jain has proven adept in using social media and his own personal brand to launder Xiaomi’s origins. But the company faces growing pressure in an unstable political environment. Narendra Modi’s government is once again proclaiming its desire to bring manufacturing back to India, offering <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-10/india-mulls-23-billion-package-to-lure-global-manufacturers?sref=QYWxDQ1o">lavish incentives</a> for export-led manufacturers, which may help once-moribund local phone brands. Xiaomi has indeed moved some of its production onshore, but the core components of its devices are still made in China. With the country’s nationalist surge unlikely to end soon, Jain and Xiaomi will eventually have to face up to the question: How Indian is Indian enough?</p>

<p><strong>Jain, 39, “is</strong> the Indian middle-class dream personified,” in the words of a former colleague. As a child, he lived in Meerut in northern India, alongside 150 members of his extended family, in an isolated housing compound inside a military quarters built by his great grandfather. “I had never even been exposed to the outside world,” Jain says.</p>



<p>After studying at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology and at the Indian Institute of Management business school, he joined the global consulting firm McKinsey.</p>



<p>Jain’s early career in technology was successful but low profile. He quit McKinsey in 2012 to launch e-commerce portal Jabong.com, which was sold to SoftBank-backed (now Walmart-owned) rival Flipkart for $70 million in 2016. By then, Jain had already moved on to <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/Jabong%E2%80%99s-former-MD-switches-attention-to-wearable-smart-devices/article20718785.ece#">start a short-lived wearables company</a>. In 2014, he became Xiaomi India’s first hire, recruited by Hugo Barra, the former Android executive who had been tasked with expanding Xiaomi outside China.</p>



<p>At the time, the market was dominated by Samsung and by Indian brands, such as Micromax, Karbonn, and Lava, whose model was to import unbranded Chinese products and sell them as their own. “There was no R&amp;D team, no product team, and no product design. They would basically just buy those products and sell them here,” says Jain.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s entry was not just about cutting out the middleman. In China, Xiaomi, along with Oppo and Vivo, had evolved beyond their origins in cheap but unreliable products and were now designing and producing higher-quality but affordable devices that were well adapted to a market like India, where disposable income was increasing in step with demand for mobile data.</p>



<p>Jain began his tenure at Xiaomi with a big gamble. In 2014, only 6% of Indian retail sales happened through e-commerce, but Jain launched Xiaomi as an online-only brand, replicating an approach that had worked in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Most people said, You are going to fail. You are going to be a disaster,” he said during a 2017 TED Talk. “Most smartphone brands until then focused on building large distribution networks, and we didn’t do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To drum up interest, the company organized flash sales and made sure the phones sold out quickly, to enhance their perceived popularity, a technique known as “hunger marketing.” They spent relatively little on advertising, instead relying on their users to become evangelists for the brand.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s phones seemed to hit a sweet spot of pricing and specifications. “Their phones were undercutting basically every other device on the market by half,” says Harish Jonalaggada, Asia editor at mobile review portal Android Central. The company launched phones for $180, with high specs like 64GB storage and 4GB RAM that were previously seen on only devices over $400.</p>



<p>The rush of orders for the launch of the Mi 3 model crashed the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart in the summer of 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Xiaomi’s success wasn’t just about its hardware. Under Jain’s leadership, the company tailored its Android-based operating system, MIUI, to the local market. One feature, Smart SMS, identifies the cluttered text messages that Indian Railways sends to its customers and extracts booking information, turning it into a ticket-like document. Xiaomi was the first company in India to incorporate a popular “dual app” feature that allows users to run duplicate versions of the same app — such as WhatsApp — on the same phone.</p>



<p>As online channels exploded in popularity and started to become saturated, Xiaomi shifted direction. In 2017, the company dramatically expanded its physical retail presence, pushing deep into rural areas. In October 2018, it set a mark recognized by the Guinness World Records by opening <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-opens-over-500-retail-stores-in-a-single-day-in-rural-india-1950375">500 stores</a> in a day. “One of the reasons Xiaomi has done well is — from both a product perspective and channel perspective — they made decisions unique to the India market,” says a Shanghai-based financial analyst covering Xiaomi who requested to remain anonymous, citing geopolitical tensions. In September, Xiaomi piloted its unique <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-mi-store-on-wheels-mobile-stores-moving-trucks-launch-india-villages-watch-xiaomi-2298745">Mi Store on Wheels</a>, a van that sells everything from trimmers to phones throughout the hinterlands of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sensitivity to the local market is in no small part due to the unusual autonomy that Jain has had in running Xiaomi in India. The Indian operations of Oppo and Vivo are both run by Chinese nationals. “Chinese companies are often very inward-looking and wouldn’t devolve the power in the same way Xiaomi has,” the analyst says.</p>

<p>That unusual autonomy stems from the relationship that Jain has built with Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s founder and CEO, a self-confessed acolyte of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jain says that, when he and Jun first met, “both of us were wearing black T-shirts and denim jeans. It was cool.”</p>



<p>One former employee, who worked closely with Jain while setting up the India operations, told <em>Rest of World</em>: “Over a period of time when Xiaomi India was growing, Manu was able to earn Jun’s trust, which is actually very hard. … Manu’s bets on the Indian market proved him right. And so, after a while, the CEO decided to just let Manu make his own decisions, which is very rare.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2019, Xiaomi was the largest smartphone brand in India, shifting 100 million units, according to data from the International Data Corporation. The company has expanded beyond mobile and offers everything from luggage to beard trimmers. Its rise came at the cost of Indian brands, whose market share fell from close to 50% to just 13% by the end of 2018, according to market intelligence firm Counterpoint Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jun and Jain share a love of the limelight. Jun is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/business/global/in-china-an-empire-built-by-aping-apple.html">social media celebrity</a> in China, posting mobile teasers and specifications to his 5 million …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After taking a look at <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/vue-overview/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/angular-overview/">Angular</a> it’s time to check out the last of the big three -  <strong>React</strong>. </p>
<p>In terms of popularity and user base it might be the biggest of the three so let’s look at how it got here. It’s also worth mentioning there has been a lot of discussion on if React is a framework or a library, with both sides of the argument nitpicking the definitions. How you call it isn’t really of the utmost importance when you’re actually using it, so let’s just call it a library since that’s how it’s referred to on its official website.</p>
<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook and it first appeared as FaxJS in 2011. The same year it got its first use in Facebook’s newsfeed and a year later on Instagram.com. May 2013 saw the big launch with React becoming opensource and publicly available, it was a bit of a rocky start with many being sceptical about its usefulness. Later the same year it became available in Python Applications and Ruby on Rails. By 2014 was steadily gaining users and the community started growing quickly. 2015 was the big break and the start of mainstream recognition as big companies like Netflix and Airbnb started using the library. The following years saw numerous improvements with the most recent version 17.0 coming out on October 20 2020.</p>
<h2>JSX and Virtual DOM</h2>
<p>Shedding some light on the background is fine and all, but the main ‘selling point’ (don’t worry, it’s opensource) of the library are its features. React is basically a frontend library aimed at helping developers build user interfaces. The most basic advantage, as with any library, is that it provides reusable code which saves time and reduces the chances of coding errors. Obviously that’s not all it does, ever since its initial release two features have been the backbone of React</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JSX:</strong> React uses JSX (a syntax extension to JavaScript) instead of basic JavaScript for templating. It lets you easily modify the DOM using simple HTML-style code and is compatible with all web browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> React creates a data structure cache which traces the changes made and then updates only the relevant part of the DOM. Let’s say a user leaves a comment under the article, normally for it to appear the entire DOM would have to be updated, while React scans the DOM for changes and updates only the relevant segment. This makes for an important performance boost since it means way less computing power used and significantly shorter loading time. While that might not sound like much, think about the scale, we’re talking here about something made for Facebook and not some small blog with a handful of users commenting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Going native</h2>
<p>With the basic features out of the way we can look at some things that were added later. React Native was released in March 2015 letting developers create natively-rendered apps for iOS, Android and a multitude of other platforms. It quickly became one of the most used tools for mobile app development and was adopted by big companies like Skype, Soundcloud, Ubereats or Walmart. What’s the difference? Well ReactJS still uses some CSS and HTML elements while React Native uses native mobile UI elements. As cross-platform is very highly valued in mobile development it’s little wonder why it quickly became so popular.</p>

<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>The new feature in version 16.8 released early last year was adding Hooks. Hooks are basically functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class component. This way you can ‘hook into’ React and use state and lifecycle methods inside functional components. They are reusable and provide better code composition and flexibility in moving around the component tree. With Hooks functional components can be used for almost everything from rendering UI to handling state and logic. You’ll find some built-in Hooks shipped with React and since they are reusable you’ll find lots of useful ones created by others or you can always create your own. There are two main rules to Hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not use Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions</strong> - this ensures that Hooks are called in the right order each time a component renders and their state is preserved between multiple calls.</li>

<p>Version 17.0 was released about a month and a half ago and it was the first major release without any developer-facing features. The update was primarily focused on making it easier to upgrade React itself. It’s not like that’s it though, the team even called this update a stepping stone while they work on new features. So if those mentioned above did not convince you there’s more coming soon. Oh and if you’re up for some more convincing, next time we’ll take a look at some of the most useful component libraries for React.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://dmellonielet.com/images/onboarding.jpg" alt="WFH!" title="Photo by XPS on Unsplash"></p>

<p>Career moves like starting a new role are challenging, can often be unnerving, and for sure requires leveling up. <img title=":computer:" alt=":computer:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>A few months back, I accepted an offer with another business group at Intel. To me, it was a great way of exploring new opportunities within the company and experiencing another flavor of its engineering culture. This new role was a scale-up from my previous one, a lot of new areas for me to contribute, learn, and explore.</p>

<p>What helped me tackle this was defining how I onboarded in the new role. In this article, I am sharing the framework and ideas from my onboarding learnings.</p>

<h2 id="onboarding-done-right">Onboarding done right</h2>

<p>A well-defined onboarding is crucial to provide team members with the resources they need to succeed and ensure their expectations match the reality of the organization. It also clears any confusion about the role. Not having the right onboarding experience can often lead to not clearly understanding the new work environment leading to one as the wrong fit for the team.</p>

<p>Usually, onboarding has two distinct &amp; complementary components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General Onboarding</strong>: Getting familiar with the company culture, vision, mission, value, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Role-specific Onboarding</strong>: Acquire the knowledge, skills, and behaviors to master the role effectively and efficiently.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Joining a new team brings in a plethora of information and emotions and can be quite stressful. If you are reading this as someone who needs to onboard a team member, I highly encourage taking some time to think through the prep work covering basics for onboarding. At the end of the article, I have listed some useful resources for the same.</p>

<p>The focus of this article is someone (particularly a software engineer) who will be onboarding a new role.</p>

<h2 id="the-onboarding-template-page_with_curl">The onboarding template <img title=":page_with_curl:" alt=":page_with_curl:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c3.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<h4 id="1-set-expectations-with-yourself">1. Set expectations with yourself</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one can hit their target with their eyes closed.” ― Paulo Coelho <img title=":sparkles:" alt=":sparkles:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most important thing is setting expectations for your new role. Sure, you have done quite some assessment before accepting the offer. However, this step talks about goal setting before your first day.</p>

<h3 id="2-set-clear-expectations-with-your-manager">2. Set clear expectations with your manager</h3>

<p>Well, you have cracked the role owing to your strengths and the value you potentially bring to the team. Hence, it is vital to discuss the expectations of onboarding with your manager. A few questions to ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you suggest I focus on for my first week and month in this team?</li>
  <li>How can I learn more about the project(s)?</li>
  <li>Is there a team ‘how-to’ document I can refer to?</li>
  <li>Who is my dedicated buddy for onboarding?</li>
  <li>What accesses a new member needs to request?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-create-a-plan">3. Create a plan</h3>

<p>Now that you have a fair idea of the expectations, chart out an onboarding plan. It helps to list out activities to not be overwhelmed and create a to-do list to cover all essential tasks.</p>

<h3 id="4-meet-with-as-many-team-members-as-to-familiarize">4. Meet with as many team members as to familiarize</h3>

<p>In the pre-covid world, face to face introductions were much easier. It’s not quite the same in a remote environment.
Make it a point to proactively reach out to as many team members/ stakeholders and set introductory 1:1s to learn about them, get a preliminary idea of the project, learn more about their preferred working times/ style, etc. This is an opportunity to get started on the technical details about the systems, projects, etc., and also provides a window into other team members’ interests.</p>

<h3 id="5-work-with-your-buddy-on-the-team">5. Work with your buddy on the team</h3>

<p>“There is no such thing as a stupid question!”</p>

<p>It can be a bit daunting to ping someone with a question that feels stupid to ask even if it is not. A dedicated buddy on the new team makes it easier to figure out the correct point of contact for your questions. A buddy can help understand communication dynamics within and across the teams, help understand the company/ team abbreviations &amp; acronyms, guide you on your tasks, etc.</p>

<h3 id="6-ask-questions-a-lot-of-them">6. Ask questions.. A lot of them</h3>

<p>Your imposter syndrome sure will not kick in until the first week or two. Maybe it won’t kick in at all. But if you are venturing out for something new, more often it does. A great tip for dealing with this is to be fearless and ask questions (<em>again..there are no stupid questions..</em>). The more you can familiarize yourself with the new team, the project, and the business, the better. It may not all make sense to you all at once but keep notes. Eventually, it will all come together.</p>

<p>It also helps to schedule regular 1:1s with members of your team and driving the agenda on things you wish to understand in the project.
Another great way to learn fast is to shadow experienced team members on tasks, understand their thought process, watch them debug issues, understand their communication style.</p>

<h3 id="7-read-the-documentation-and-code">7. Read the documentation and code</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to read the documentation and code. The information you have heard from your teammates will now start making more sense. Additionally, this will help you recognize potential improvements in the documentation/ codebase for future contributions.</p>

<h3 id="8-contribute">8. Contribute</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to do. Nothing beats the feeling of your first commit in the new project- be it a bug fix, a small feature enhancement, documentation improvements, etc. Channel your doer mindset and look for ways to make things better.</p>

<h3 id="9-seek-feedback">9. Seek feedback</h3>

<p>In a loop of continuous improvement, nothing triumphs feedback. Seek constructive feedback from your manager, your teammates on what you did better and what are your blind spots. Where can you improve as well as discuss what challenges you are facing and how can you address them?</p>

<p>Good feedback is a two-way conversation. Not only should you receive feedback but also provide it. Be open to sharing what you learned through the onboarding process, what can potentially improve for the future, how did your team members help you feel comfortable with the process, etc.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Owning your onboarding can contribute to your success in the role and can bring joy. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" alt=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c8.png" height="20" width="20"> I hope these tips and ideas can help new engineers navigate the onboarding successfully.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum is resin&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Mastic tree found on the Greek island Chios. It's been labelled as a superfood because of its numerous health&nbsp;properties- which we'll talk about in just a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But in the last 5 years its popularity has skyrocketed for&nbsp;a reason no Greek farmer could have ever expected.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>It can sharpen your jawline</em></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;People are catching on to an old BodyBuilder method for building muscle in the jawline- chewing mastic gum! Because it's 10x harder than regular gum it's basically like taking your jaw to the gym.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently this is relatively well-known in Hollywood and the BodyBuilding space. Now it's&nbsp;making its way into the mainstream. More on that later. First you've got to understand where it comes from to know why it's so special:</p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>he people of Chios have&nbsp;cultivated and harvested mastic or "Mastiha" for over 2500 years. The hot and humid climate is ideal for the 6-month, laborious process.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/mastic-gum-from-chios_0706dfc7-3e37-472b-9669-5ec2e9f92bad_480x480.jpg?v=1607283273" alt="Farmers harvesting chios resin"></p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Every 4-5 days, several&nbsp;cuts are made in the trees to slowly drain the resin. It takes roughly 15-20 days for the crystal to solidify and fall off. Because of the way it falls from the tree and it's shape, these small pieces of resin are called "Tears of Chios". The farmers then collect these small teardrops and wash them in natural spring water.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>It&nbsp;has a refreshing pine/cedar flavour.</strong></h3>



<p><strong>M</strong>astic's earliest identified uses was as chewing gum- the additional benefits were yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic producing villages&nbsp;were fortresses,&nbsp;bordered by huge walls. The only way to enter these villages was by ladder, designed to shield the resin from invaders.</p>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say: <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chios_massacre"><strong>wars were fought over mastic gum</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the Ottoman rule of Chios in the 1800s, mastic was <strong>worth its weight in Gold.&nbsp;</strong>In todays gold prices that means 1 piece would cost $59.14</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily for us, it doesn't cost that much. But with its growing popularity, maybe someday it might. Let's talk about <em>why </em>it's selling out around the world:</p>



<p><strong>T</strong>he ancient Mediterraneans loved mastic and thought it had "magic" healing properties. Thanks to modern science we know today how that "magic" works. Here's the 7 main health benefits we use it for today:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#dental">Aids Dental Health</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#inflammation">Anti-Inflammatory</a></strong></li>
<li>
<strong><a href="#cholesterol">Lowers Cholesterol &amp;</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;Blood Sugar</strong>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="#biotic">Anti-Biotic&nbsp;/ Anti-Fungal</a></strong></li>

<li><strong><a href="#cancer">Cancer Preventative</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#asthma">Asthma Treatment</a></strong></li>
</ol>

<h3><b>Here's The "Magical" Ingredients (Skip If Boring)</b></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic gum is composed of several bioactive compounds responsible for its numerous health benefits. These include <em>triterpenic acids</em> (TAs) such as <em>isomasticadienolic acid</em> as well as triterpenes. These are natural antibiotics that also act as strong anti-inflammatories.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastiha naturally&nbsp;contains large percentages of organic compounds like Terpenoids, which add to its aromatic element. The main active Terpenoids include&nbsp;<em>alpha-pinene</em> (40%), <em>beta-myrcene</em>, <em>beta-pinene</em>, <em>limonene</em>, and <em>beta-caryophyllene</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Alpha-pinene</em> is also found in pines and rosemary. It's what gives Mastic a fresh pine/cedar flavor.&nbsp;As well as providing a strong woody aroma, it's also a potent topical antiseptic. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike regular chewing gums, which are</span><span>&nbsp;filled with artificial coloring and flavors, <strong>mastic gum&nbsp;is 100% natural.</strong></span></p>


<h2 id="dental"><span>1. Aids Dental Health (Prevent Cavities)</span></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>here are&nbsp;multiple studies about Mastic gum and its positive effect on dental health.&nbsp;A <span><a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/angle-orthodontist/article/77/1/124/58081/Short-term-Effect-of-Mastic-Gum-on-Salivary">2007 study</a>&nbsp;</span>found that chewing&nbsp;mastic gum may potentially help prevent teeth cavities by&nbsp;reducing bacteria in the mouth and the pH of saliva.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/Tooth-decay-diagram_b8ee88bd-931a-4d5d-b51e-ad0d796e9211_480x480.jpg?v=1607283312" alt="Diagram of tooth decay"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum has been shown to reduce the build-up of plaque</em></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;After chewing mastic gum for 15 minutes, participants in the study were found to have lower levels of&nbsp;</span><em>lactobacilli</em> and <em>S Mutans</em> in the oral cavity. The rate of bacteria levels even remained low even 2.25 hours later. This same effect was further supported by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281189/">2014 study</a></span>.</p>
<p>What this means for you is:</p>
<h3><strong>Mastic Gum Prevents Cavities And Bad Breath</strong></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There's no need to worry about chewing a random resin that came from a tree in Greece- it's recommended by dentists!</p>
<p>Just chew it&nbsp;like a regular piece of gum and chuck it when you're done.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>WEIRD FACT:&nbsp;</strong>you can swallow mastic gum! It can be broken down by your stomach like any other food because it's 100% natural.</em>&nbsp;</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="inflammation"><strong>2. Anti-Inflammatory (Heal Faster)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic's anti-inflammatory properties may help with autoimmune illness&nbsp;and chronic inflammation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It decreases the levels of various inflammatory substances and blocks inflammatory pathways. It also aids the activation of neutrophils which is a type of white blood cell.</span></p>

<meta charset="utf-8"><br>
<h2 id="cholesterol">
<span>3.&nbsp;Lower Cholesterol &amp; Blood Sugar&nbsp;</span>(Healthier Heart)</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>O</strong>ur modern lazy-lifestyles and unnatural diet have made high cholesterol and high blood sugar levels commonplace. These two things increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Some studies suggest that chewing mastic gum could help&nbsp;restore these levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2047487315603186">2015 study</a></span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;<span>with</span>&nbsp;156 healthy individuals found that daily mastic consumption lead to lower total cholesterol levels. These results were observed after 8 weeks.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2047487315603186">2016&nbsp;study</a></span>, people who took mastic&nbsp;in some form also experienced lower blood glucose levels which are&nbsp;sometimes associated with high cholesterol levels. Mastic was found to have&nbsp;a greater effect on people who are overweight or obese.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="biotic"><strong>4. Anti-Biotic / Anti-Fungal (Good For Everything)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>B</strong>alancing our body's bacteria is a crucial function of our diet. Mastic has anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties that&nbsp;serve as a&nbsp;cure for several ailments.</p>

<h3>Soothing Stomach Ulcers</h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to&nbsp;help in treating symptoms of peptic ulcers (stomach ulcers).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A well-known <span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a>&nbsp;</span>conducted in 1984 on 38 people demonstrated that 1 gram of mastic gum taken daily, results in reduction of ulcer symptoms in less than 2 weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>Reducing Helicobacter Pylori Bacteria In The Stomach</strong></h3>
<p><span>Helicobacter pylori bacteria infections are a major risk factor that can contribute to stomach ulcers. If left unchecked, t</span>hese bacteria&nbsp;may potentially lead to stomach cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic gum's antibacterial capabilities against&nbsp;<i><span>H. pylori </span></i>have been shown to mitigate these risks. A<span> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711309002396?via%3Dihub">study</a></span>&nbsp;from 2010, found that mastic gum destroyed&nbsp;H. pylori colonies faster than a placebo in a 14 day period.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="digestion">
<strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Soothes Digestion &amp; Heartburn</strong>
</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic gum's most common use (for health purposes) throughout history has been as a cure for digestive problems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;One<span> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a></span> found that 1g of mastic gum a day, led to fewer stomach aches and heartburn in volunteers. If you read <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mastic+gum&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a></span> reviews for Mastiha and mastic gum, you will find hundreds of cases where it has cured men and women's ulcers and digestion problems:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/amazon-review-for-mastic-gum_480x480.png?v=1607283351" alt="Amazon review of mastic gum"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum is an almost "magical" cure for stomach ulcers&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<h3>Helps Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</h3>
<p>New research presented in <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367210/">2015 review</a></span> suggests that mastic gum can help with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;A study conducted on 60 people with IBD found that individuals who consumed mastic in any form had&nbsp;measurable improvements in their IBD inflammation markers such as&nbsp;</span><span>decreased levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein. This was over a 3 week period.</span></p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="cancer"><strong>6.&nbsp;Cancer Preventative</strong></h2>
<p><span><strong>R</strong>esearchers</span>&nbsp;are currently investigating mastic gum’s role in inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer. According to a<a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.21935"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>2006 study</span>,</a> mastic gum can inhibit an androgen receptor that could have an effect on the development of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to weaken the function of the androgen receptor in&nbsp;these&nbsp;cancer cells. More recent<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951764/"><span>laboratory studies</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;have uncovered more about how this effect works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5476564/">Research from 2017</a>&nbsp;</span>suggests that mastic&nbsp;may also help suppress the growth of tumors that can lead to colon cancer. Researchers found that mastic inhibited the increase of colon cells. It has been show to&nbsp;inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma tumors.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="asthma"><strong>7. Asthma Treatment</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8"><meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum's anti-inflammatory properties may make it useful in treating<span>&nbsp;allergenic asthma</span>. This type of asthma often includes airway inflammation, eosinophilia, and airway hyper-responsiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.2010-0212OC">2011 study</a></span></span><span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;</span>on mice, mastic gum significantly inhibited eosinophilia, reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, and blocked the production of inflammatory substances. It had a positive effect on lung fluid and lung inflammation. In vitro tests found that mastic gum inhibited cells that react negatively to allergens and cause airway inflammation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;These results are promising but further studies are needed to determine efficacy in human cases.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">

<p><span><strong>G</strong>enerally well-tolerated and 100% natural, mastic and&nbsp;doesn't have any major reported side effects. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;In some rare cases, it may cause dizziness, headache, or an upset stomach. These cases are likely due to increased tension in the muscles surrounding your skull because mastic gum is so much harder than what we are accustomed to chewing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Start with a small quantity and see how your body reacts to it</strong>.&nbsp; Once you're sure there's no&nbsp;negative&nbsp;effects you can gradually increase the dose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It's always possible to have an allergic reaction to something new</span><span>. So monitor how you feel and consult a doctor if you're concerned.</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>You shouldn’t take mastic gum if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.</span>&nbsp;</p>

It gives me perspectives on issues that could be getting carried over from the previous week and any critical changes I should be aware of.
Although you can’t plan for all that happens during an oncall week, a proper handoff helps you prepare for it.</p><h3 id="organizing-slack-during-an-oncall-week">Organizing Slack during an oncall week</h3><p>As an SRE on LinkedIn’s container scheduler and deployment infrastructure team, our users are engineers at LinkedIn. We use Slack for internal communication and we have certain channels where users share issues they are experiencing with the tooling or to get our oncall’s attention. During an oncall week, I star these channels and organize my sidebar so that I can easily notice messages from our users and distinguish them from the other messages I receive. As an optional tip - I also like to mute/leave channels that I am not actively participating in to reduce clutter.</p><p>As compared to a normal week, I spend more time on Slack when I am oncall - responding to people, answering support requests, helping users with tooling. These Slack notifications can create a little bit of distraction, however, considering all our users are internal, a rise in messages on our channels can also indicate that something might be wrong with our system and our alerting hasn’t caught it yet.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/slack-pings.gif" alt="slack pings during oncall"></p><h2 id="signal-vs-noise">Signal vs Noise</h2><h3 id="trust-but-verify---not-all-alerts-are-created-equal">Trust, but verify - not all alerts are created equal</h3><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/trust-but-verify-you-must.jpg" alt="trust-but-verify-you-must"></p><p><i>This is something I learned during my interview at LinkedIn and it has been very applicable in my experience since.</i></p><p>In early days of oncall and incident management, it is very common to feel as if things are on fire when any alert gets triggered. Over time, I have realized that gaining context and verifying that the alert is actually indicating an issue helps with the right next steps. It is important to distinguish signal from noise because:</p><ul><li>An alert could be non-actionable as it was recently configured with a threshold that’s making it too noisy</li><li>The monitoring stack is down and the alert is being triggered because the configuration treats a lack of data points as an issue</li><li>Your service is operating perfectly fine, however, the traffic tier routing requests to your service had an issue</li><li>Timer on a deliberately silenced alert expired and the alert started triggering</li></ul><p>I have experienced all of the above at some point in time. Now when I either receive an alert or a user reports an issue, I check our services (metrics, logs, reproduce the reported problem etc.) to verify that the issue is real.</p><h3 id="declaring-an-incident">Declaring an incident</h3><p>Not all actionable alerts result in an incident. To be effective at identifying the ones that do, it is extremely crucial to think about the bigger picture of mitigating the issue than be overwhelmed by the technical task of resolving the alert.</p><p>Some of the qualitative measures that help make this differentiation is to consider whether an issue requires coordinating the fix with other teams or whether the issue is impacting customers or violating an SLO. If any of the conditions are true, declare an incident. It is always better to declare an incident early in the process than waiting too long.</p><p>At LinkedIn, we have defined guidelines for all teams about what warrants an incident along with different levels of severity. This takes guesswork out of the picture, and provides a shared understanding to every team member.</p><h2 id="communication-during-an-incident">Communication during an incident</h2><h3 id="the-incident-title-and-scoping-the-impact">The incident title and scoping the impact</h3><p>Every incident gets a title. I didn’t realize it initially, but giving an incident a title forces one to define the problem and communicate it to the stakeholders very succinctly. When communicating to stakeholders, <strong>scoping the incident is very important</strong>. What I mean by scoping is identifying how big the impact is - which environment is impacted, is the impact limited to a region or is it global, how many customers are impacted, etc. For instance, “the login feature on the site is not working” vs “the login feature on the site is not working for traffic originating from Asia Pacific” say two very different things.</p><h3 id="establish-communication-channels-and-an-incident-lead">Establish communication channels and an incident lead</h3><p>We heavily rely on Slack to communicate during an incident. A dedicated slack channel helps focus all the energy and inputs from everyone in one place. It helps the incident lead collect data about symptoms that the users are experiencing and also captures a log of considered/discarded hypotheses and any changes made to the system. Once the Slack channel is created, establish an incident lead and let everyone know who is driving the incident forward.</p><p>Eslablishing explicit comms channels for reporting and identifying issues and establishing an incident lead reduce the delay in action and disambiguate any confusion.</p><h3 id="communicate-changes-to-the-system">Communicate changes to the system</h3><p>If there’s a fix you’d like to try out, let others know who are and encourage everyone to do the same. This ensures that the potential fix doesn’t make an already bad situation worse and helps catch any blind spots early. If you do end up making a change to the system after getting consensus, let others know and follow up on its effects.</p><h3 id="provide-regular-updates">Provide regular updates</h3><p>While working towards a resolution for the incident, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the technical details and miss to communicate an update. This leads to angry leadership and annoyed customers who have no insight into what’s happening.</p><p>An update provides visibility to the customers that the issue is being worked upon and lets the leadership identify if they can help out with anything. Depending on the severity of the incident, an update every 15-30 mins serves pretty well. The update doesn’t have to be extremely detailed, rather a brief summary describing the current state and immediate next steps is sufficient. An example update:</p><blockquote><p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Our hypothesis about the memory leak checks out and we have validated the fix in the staging environment. We have pushed out the change and as soon as it goes through the CI pipeline, we’ll canary the new release, monitor metrics and promote the change after verifying the fix.</p></blockquote><h2 id="incident-response-is-a-collaborative-process">Incident response is a collaborative process</h2><h3 id="get-help-early">Get help early</h3><p>In my earlier days, I used to think that it was solely my responsibility to mitigate the issue, find the root cause, and roll out the fix. If I couldn’t do it, it wouldn’t reflect well on me. In reality, incident management, like much of software development, is a very collaborative process.</p><p>One of the big differences in how I approach it now is I focus on actively pulling in other engineers who could help with debugging or resolving the issue early in the process. This change in perspective has relieved me of a lot of unnecessary stress and also made me more effective at resolving incidents.</p><p>When requesting help, be specific about the task as well as the urgency. It helps others calibrate their response and manage things they might have at hand.</p><h3 id="working-with-others">Working with others</h3><p>One of the most important things while handling incidents is working with others. Considering the multi-faceted nature of an SRE role, it’s one of the most important while underrated skills.</p><p>With multiple people involved, various possibilities get shared and one of the responsibilities of the incident lead is to guide these discussions in a productive direction while filtering out the noise. One should be cautious about going down any rabbit holes and focus on stopping the bleeding first. If there’s a probable cause, share it early - it helps rule out possibilities. And it’s okay to ask questions that seem obvious, but specific questions are more helpful.</p><p>Being fearlessly curious, and keeping an open mind enables one to consider possibilities that could be overseen otherwise. Remember, you are working together as a team on sharing and ruling out hypotheses to solve a challenging problem.</p><h3 id="video-conferencing-is-your-friend">Video Conferencing is your friend</h3><p>We …</p></div></div>

<p><b>Ralph W. McGehee:</b> It's a real honor for me to be here today. I don't often say that, but I really mean it. I like to start off my talk by mentioning two things. One, please don't believe anything I'm going to tell you. The American people are so inundated by misinformation, there's absolutely no reason you should believe anything anybody tells you, particularly the evening news. Of course, with everything there is an exception, and I think in my case, I have a fairly valid exception. Because of the process that I had to go through to clear my book, I had to prove that everything I am saying is in the public domain. I still go down to the Agency about twice a month and turn in new material to let them clear it. And in doing that process, I have to produce or pull out from government documents that particular information, because they inevitably will say, "You can't say it, it's classified." And I will inevitably locate that information in the public domain.</p> 
 
<p>So if you doubt me, and I hope you will, there is a way to check up on me. Go to the library and look in the back of my book, and almost every major conclusion that I will be talking about here today will be documented to an official government document. I've drawn upon the Pentagon Papers. Are you all familiar with the Pentagon Papers? And the Senate and House investigations of the Agency and a variety of other material. So don't believe what I say, but if you want to check up on me, the information is available.</p> 
 
<p>Secondly, I'd like to say my message is basically a real downer. It is real negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression, because I just returned from a two week speaking trip in Iowa, where I was going to testify at the court case there in Iowa City for the protesters, and in Nebraska. And I've been in Arizona and various other places speaking, and wherever you go, you find concerned groups. So I am encouraged. I know during the Vietnam War for the first ten years, we didn't even know what was going on. And then eleven or twelve years later, people began to protest. But this time in Latin America, the protest was almost instantaneous. The substructure is there. The only reason we got out of Vietnam, of course, is because of the student protests. So I am very encouraged. My message is negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression. I am very, very encouraged.</p> 
 
<p>I think I should talk in three basic phases. One, walk you very quickly through my career with the Agency up to right now where I am today, and back up and walk you through Vietnam a little bit or walk you through my career in a little more detail, including Vietnam. Now I do that not to talk about Vietnam but because the processes that are followed today in Central America, in the Middle East and in Africa have all been used in Vietnam. I'll take out three or four incidences, and they are documented by the way, and show you that these are sort of typical of what the Agency does around the world since the very beginning in '47, what it's doing today in '86.</p> 
 
<p>Then I'll go back and review the Agency's domestic operations, and I'll do that for one purpose, because everything they were doing up to the mid-seventies they are now doing again. The only difference now is under President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 of December '81, they can do the things legally that they were doing illegally before. It's the only difference. Then I would like to talk, sort of bring it all together in Central America and talk about El Salvador, Grenada, and particularly Nicaragua, and then come to my conclusion. So that's basically the approach I'll take.</p> 
 
<p>I went to the University of Notre Dame. I played on four undefeated football teams, three national championships, and then I tried out with the Green Bay Packers. And to this day, I can't understand what's the matter with the coaches up there. When I was cut, I received a cable, "Would you be interested in an important government position similar to the State Department in function?" My football background was not irrelevant. When I went down to Washington, I found that the class before me, my class, and the class after me were basically rejects from the National Football League, not the standard concept of an intelligent (He does say "intelligent" here, I think as a joke about football players) officer.</p> 
 
<p>Well, I served in the Agency for 25 years. The first 15 or 16 years, I believed that the CIA was sort of like a missionary organization, out saving the world for democracy and religion and gathering good intelligence to help our policymakers make good decisions. When I'd go into work in the morning, I'd feel a real pride that I'm part of the great crusade to stop the international communist conspiracy. All that began to change for me in Vietnam. That's when I began protesting.</p> 
 
<p>I should mention that I served my entire 25 years in the Directorate of Operations. Now, the Agency is broken down to basically four directorates, Administration, Science and Technology, Intelligence, and Operations. Administrators administrate. Science and Technology, they devise the sophisticated collection devices and monitor the results. The Directorate of Intelligence, that's the scholars who sit and read the reports that come in from around the world and then put out the final reports. And the Operators operate. The Directorate of Operations has two basic functions, covert operations and gathering intelligence covertly.</p> 
 
<p>Since it's my contention that the Agency is little more than a covert action agency, I will dwell a little bit on it. Now, covert action operations in broadest context can be described as those operations designed to overthrow or support foreign governments. Overthrow operations have four basic components, economic warfare, political warfare, psychological warfare, and economic warfare. In my 25 years in the Agency, I served overseas in Japan, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, six years or three tours in Thailand, and two years as the chief police adviser to the head of the Vietnamese Special Police. That's the equivalent of our FBI.</p> 
 
<p>As I said, my period of protests began around the Vietnam War. I for the next period within the Agency began protesting, and having no luck with those protests, I finally left the Agency in 1977. Now, in a stroke of real irony at this particular point, because they had assigned me to the CIA’s Siberia. When you escalate your protest, you become persona non grata. In '77 in a stroke of irony, they awarded me the Career Intelligence Medal and the Honorable Service Medal. Of course, I think I know why. They knew they had a loose cannon and they wanted to kind of damp me down, appease me a little bit. And I think that was the purpose of giving them to me.</p> 
 
<p>But I also earlier had won awards, two Vietnam service awards, a commendation from the director for devising a program of counterinsurgency and intelligence, and a variety of other CIA and foreign awards. Well, when I left the Agency, I testified before the Senate and House intelligence committees and before a variety of other Senate and House committees, all related to CIA activities.</p> 
 
<p>I immediately set about writing a book about my experiences. It took me three years to research and write the book, and then like all CIA officers, when you join the Agency, you have to sign a secrecy agreement. And as I said, I must now submit everything to the CIA for pre-publication review. I did, and they came back and they said they have identified approximately 400 security violations in my manuscript. And they returned it in little bits and pieces of paper, because some of these deletions ran up to several pages in length.</p> 
 
<p>Well, to defeat this process, I went through going through the public record and pulling out the identical information. And ultimately with this effort, I got virtually everything reinstated. There are a few little specifics that I didn't get reinstated, but for the most part they were all reinstated. I did in a few cases, they had deleted some very boring information, so I said rather than fight them over this one, let's just leave this comment, "Seven words deleted." It looks a lot sexier than mine. So I didn't fight them on all of them.</p> 
 
<p>Then I went looking for a publisher, a long hard process, and finally one publisher said, "You know, you've written a nice legal brief here. You make your points and then you have your citations to your information. But boy, it's dull as mud. Who would want to read a legal brief? So we will publish it if you'll rewrite it as a autobiography," which I did. I then resubmitted it to the CIA for pre-publication review. I didn't put any more secret details in there. I just added my personal life.</p> 
 
<p>At this time, William Casey had become Director of the CIA, and they in essence told me, "We're not going to let you publish a book." And I said, "Well, you can't stop me. Everything that's in the book, you have not only cleared for other people, it's not only in the public record, but you also cleared for me before. And the laws that you operate under say you may not reclassify information once it's been declassified and released." And their response in essence, "Well, that's tough. We're doing it anyhow. There's nothing you can do about it." Well, this was a very critical period. I just didn't know what to do. I really worried about this, because if they would've stopped me with that, then I would not be able to speak to you here this evening, because everything would have been classified.</p> 
 
<p>So I called <i>The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> ran a long exposé of how the CIA was violating the law by reclassifying information that was in the public domain, a violation of the law of the land. This public exposure forced the Agency to relent, and the book was finally released. Subsequent to the release of the book, I then traveled to Cuba, where we stayed about a week, and to Grenada, …</p></div></div>

			<p>In 1995 LEGO conducted a study to determine how to become “digital” – how to do it and what it would take. This study took place from May to October in a secret lab on the third floor of LEGO&nbsp;headquarters, Legocentret. At the end of the study LEGO&nbsp;management received a report detailing programs, people, and resources needed to move into the new paradigm. LEGO&nbsp;quickly approved the plan, and SPU-Darwin was set in motion at the beginning of the new year.</p>
<p>This website is the story of SPU-Darwin, of moving LEGO&nbsp;into the 21st century. I’m not sure yet how to tell that story, so it’s organized as a blog. This will allow me to present pieces of history as they come, without worrying about having to have everything set before presenting anything, and will allow me to experiment with presentations. Also, a great deal of leading edge science and engineering had to be developed, and those stories will require intense technical material, which might not appeal to everyone, and those entries will be separate from the general ones.</p>

<p>To Darwin members: the blog structure of this website is expressly designed to allow everyone to chime in with their memories. Please do that. Periodically I’ll go through the topics and concentrate them down into organized stories. It’s my hope that this path will eventually lead to an actual publication someday, like an interactive multimedia book, but we’ll worry about that later.</p>
<p>I’m not a designer, so if you’d like to contribute anything about this website design, PLEASE do so.</p>
<p>Note: only Darwin members (which is not just LEGO employees, it’s everyone who was intimately involved – this means you, SGI and Informix and DDE) will have editing access. Everyone else can email, which will be dealt with separately.</p>

<hr>

<p>Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term <em>analysis of algorithms</em> in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
<em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>

<p>When the first volume of TAOCP was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with <em>hot metal</em> type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Matrixcase-bembo-16pts.jpg" alt="Monotype matrix case" height="400">
<figcaption>
A case of letter molds—or <em>matrices</em>—used by the Monotype caster,
the most commonly-used machine for printing books in the days of hot metal type.
Its main contemporary, the Linotype, molded entire lines at a time,
and was often used for printing newspapers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of TAOCP, Volume&nbsp;2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn’t provide the same level of quality he had come to expect.</p>

<p>The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s hard to understand how much of a revolution <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe’s PDF wouldn’t exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, DVI.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
<span>METAFONT</span>
, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.</p>

<p>Here is where the timelines diverge.
In one, <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was just the beginning.
Computer typography evolves rapidly as the decades go by,
building on Knuth’s prior work and
taking advantage of the million-fold increases we’ve seen in computing power.
Browsers, e-readers, and word processors deliver beautiful type
to every person who looks at a screen, with almost no effort from authors.</p>

<p>In the darker timeline… none of this happens.
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 is still some of the best we’ve got for computer typesetting.
It’s seen some impressive improvements,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
but its core hasn’t changed much in decades.
To this day,
it doesn’t lay out more than one page at a time because 1980s computers didn’t
have enough RAM to do any better.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Almost no other software—except for a handful of professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign—leverages any of the advances
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 made in line breaking and hyphenation.
Layout in Word, browsers, and even e-readers is a sad joke.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://assets.bitbashing.io/images/exa.png" alt="Mobile browser layout example" height="400">
<figcaption>
State of the art text layout in today's browsers. Mind the gaps.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m not sure what to make of this.
Maybe most people, outside a small cadre of designers and
enthusiasts, just don’t care about typography very much.
After all, the human brain is incredibly good glossing over minor details and
im<span>p</span>erfections when reading.
But even the design world seems largely unaware or indifferent to Knuth’s work.
Despite collaborations with famous type designers like Hermann Zapf,
you’ll find no mention of him in renowned books and documentaries on
the subject.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
And parametric font families—just like the ones <span>METAFONT</span>
 offered in 1983—are
heralded in 2017 as “a new era of type design”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
It’s bizarre.</p>

<p>Good typography can make almost anything more enjoyable to read,
and it feels like such a shame that better layout isn’t
available to the masses
when so much of the groundwork was laid almost forty years ago.
In an age when the average American reads from a screen they keep in their pocket
dozens of times a day,
and where each one of those devices holds more processing power than you could
fit in several rooms back when Donald Knuth
wrote <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
, surely we can—and <em>should</em>—do better.</p>

<p>Sunday December 6, 2020</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://planspace.org/2013/09/28/polyas-how-to-solve-it-quotes-and-comments/">How to Solve It</a>, <a href="https://planspace.org/20200716-lateral_thinking_creativity_step_by_step/">Lateral Thinking</a>, and others,
I've started to collect tactics for problem-solving. The shuffling
stuff is so that you can easily choose a random tactic to try.</p>
<p>I might do more with this and I'd love feedback/suggestions;
<a href="#contact">comment or message me</a>!</p>

<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#1" name="1">1</a>. Embrace problems</h3>
<p>The word "problem" has a negative connotation, and some problems are
hard to love. But in general, problems make life more interesting and
give us opportunities to learn, grow, and improve. Keep your problems
close.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#2" name="2">2</a>. Take care of yourself</h3>
<p>Are you hungry? Tired? Stressed? Eat well, sleep well, and look after
your mental health. Try to do something right now to make your body
and mind more effective, like stretching.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#3" name="3">3</a>. Take the pressure off</h3>
<p>What can you do to approach the problem calmly? Should you ask for
help or otherwise communicate with others? Should you make a back-up
plan or adjust your goal?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#4" name="4">4</a>. Reinforce the positive</h3>
<p>You have an opportunity for growth. You're learning. Celebrate all
progress, even small progress. Feel good about what you're doing. You
can do this.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#5" name="5">5</a>. Remove distractions</h3>
<p>Turn off the TV. Turn off your phone. Turn off notifications. Don't
check the news. Multitasking is a lie. If other thoughts come, jot
them down elsewhere to return to later.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#6" name="6">6</a>. Get inspired</h3>
<p>Why are you working on this? What's the larger goal? What are the
larger benefits? What other problems or people have done work you
admire? Appreciate and aspire to greatness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#7" name="7">7</a>. Make a plan</h3>
<p>If you know how to attack the problem, make a plan to do that. Even if
you don't, make a plan to spend time on the problem, not all at once,
but consistently over a longer period.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#8" name="8">8</a>. Do other things</h3>
<p>Don't forget to eat and sleep, but also, spend time on complementary
and even unrelated tasks. Read a book. Tutor a student. Revisit other
things. Take a walk.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#9" name="9">9</a>. Work hard</h3>
<p>You need to focus. You need to put in time and effort. Sometimes you
have to stop looking for shortcuts and do the work. There is no royal
road. Work harder than anyone else.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#10" name="10">10</a>. Relax</h3>
<p>Take some time to change the nature of your focus on the problem. Pull
back from single-minded concentration. Don't focus on anything else
either. Relax. Don't micromanage your brain. What comes to you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#11" name="11">11</a>. Work smart</h3>
<p>Even if you're already making progress, is there something you could
do more effectively? Can you find a better process if you reconsider?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#12" name="12">12</a>. Find support</h3>
<p>What would help you to be effective? Is there a group or team you can
join or form? What people or other resources can you engage with?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#13" name="13">13</a>. Understand the problem</h3>
<p>Do you completely understand what you're working on? Are all the
definitions clear? Does everyone involved agree on the problem
statement and objective?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#14" name="14">14</a>. Find roots</h3>
<p>What is the root cause (or causes) of the problem? Is the problem as
stated the real problem? How did the problem come to be? Keep asking
why.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#15" name="15">15</a>. Know what you know</h3>
<p>What do you know, and how do you know it? Are you sure? Could you
explain it to someone else? What do you not know, and how could you
come to know it? What else might be relevant?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#16" name="16">16</a>. Question assumptions</h3>
<p>What are you taking for granted? What is so obvius that you haven't
thought about it? What biases might be affecting your thinking? Are
there alternatives that seem "out there"?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#17" name="17">17</a>. Find similar problems</h3>
<p>Do you know a related problem? What have others done in similar
situations? How is a similar problem solved in nature, or in another
field? Can you build on work you or others have done before?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#18" name="18">18</a>. Consider quitting</h3>
<p>Is this a problem that shouldn't be solved? Is this problem the right
use of your time, right now? What if you didn't solve this particular
problem?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#19" name="19">19</a>. Get an easy win</h3>
<p>Find a task that you can succeed at in the next two minutes. It could
be getting out a pen, or opening a book. Do it, then praise yourself
for that victory. It may be easier to keep making progress afterward.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#20" name="20">20</a>. Start things cooking</h3>
<p>Many tasks involve some waiting after you initiate them, like waiting
for food to marinate, or waiting for responses to an email. Make a
point to get these things started as soon as you can.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#21" name="21">21</a>. Take a step</h3>
<p>Even if you're not sure of your whole plan, do something now. You can
always reevaluate afterward. Choose some goal that you can accomplish,
and do it now.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#22" name="22">22</a>. Do an experiment</h3>
<p>You don't have to only do things that you know will work. Try
something and see what happens. Be prepared to throw it away. You'll
learn from it and it will help you to make progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#23" name="23">23</a>. Guess and check</h3>
<p>A particular kind of experiment is to choose a next step, even if you
don't know that it's right, and see what happens next. Follow the
consequences forward. Even if you guessed wrong, you'll learn
something.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#24" name="24">24</a>. Write down what you’ve done</h3>
<p>Keep some log of what you've been doing, what you've tried, and what
the results have been. If you haven't been doing this, try to remember
and write down what you've done so far.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#25" name="25">25</a>. Try again</h3>
<p>Sometimes when you try something and it doesn't work, it isn't that
the approach was bad, it's that something didn't align that time. It
could be worth trying again, especially with things you tried when you
knew less.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#26" name="26">26</a>. Zoom in</h3>
<p>How close can you get to the tiniest pieces? What happens for exactly
one component? For a global problem, how does a single individual play
a part on a daily basis?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#27" name="27">27</a>. Zoom out</h3>
<p>What's the big picture? How does the problem fit into larger systems?
What's the global view? What's the long term view?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#28" name="28">28</a>. Draw a picture</h3>
<p>Make a graphical representation. It could be a sketch, a plot, a
diagram, a mind map, a flow chart. Make something you can see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#29" name="29">29</a>. Change representations</h3>
<p>What's another way to conceptualize the problem? In math, you might
switch between numeric, geometric, and algebraic forms. You might
change domains, or phrase the problem as a story.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#30" name="30">30</a>. Use a different tool</h3>
<p>Try saying it out loud. Try typing, or writing longhand, or recording
a video. Try post-it notes or index cards. Try paper and pencil, or a
calculator, a diagramming tool, or a programming language.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#31" name="31">31</a>. Use analogy</h3>
<p>What else is this like? Can you compare to something else, even if
it's a stretch? What do the similarities and differences tell you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#32" name="32">32</a>. Change viewpoints</h3>
<p>How does this look from different perspectives? How do different
people, pieces, places see the problem? Can you imagine yourself in
different positions?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#33" name="33">33</a>. Organize concepts</h3>
<p>What's the deep structure of this problem? Can you model the problem?
Are there axes or other ways of representing the ideas of your
problem?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#34" name="34">34</a>. Add randomness</h3>
<p>Consider something you wouldn't otherwise: a random word, WikiPedia
article, or the concept of randomness itself. Go to a museum, or a
store. Whatever you find, relate it to your problem. What could it
mean?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#35" name="35">35</a>. Talk it through</h3>
<p>Have a conversation with someone. Or imagine a conversation with
someone. Or have a conversation with yourself. Explain everything
you're thinking about.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#36" name="36">36</a>. Decompose/Recompose</h3>
<p>What are the words and ideas that you're using? Are they cliché? Are
they appropriate? What if you broke down the way you're understanding
the problem and rebuilt it? Can you articulate the problem and
solution spaces?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#37" name="37">37</a>. Get feedback</h3>
<p>Get an outside view on your problem and your work on it. Try to
solicit feedback that helps you see things you aren't otherwise
seeing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#38" name="38">38</a>. Learn more</h3>
<p>You may not know enough to solve your problem, and you may not even
know what it is that you don't know. Keep learning! Be curious about
topics near and far. Read and study for pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#39" name="39">39</a>. Ask for help</h3>
<p>Other people can help you a lot. Put effort into finding the right
place and way to ask, and others will often put effort into helping
you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#40" name="40">40</a>. Break it up</h3>
<p>Sometimes you can break big problems into many more manageable steps.
It may even be possible for multiple people to work on separate parts.
Regardless, pursue and celebrate partial progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#41" name="41">41</a>. Use inversion</h3>
<p>How might you achieve the opposite of your goal? Are there other
reversals or inversions that might be illuminating? What's the worst
case outcome? Can you avoid it?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#42" name="42">42</a>. Make a list</h3>
<p>Generate lots of ideas. What are all the options? Consider more
possibilities. What else could you make a list of?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#43" name="43">43</a>. Eliminate possibilities</h3>
<p>What can you rule out? What hasn't worked already? What's impossible?
What has to be wrong? Why is that? What are the constraints? What can
you learn from what doesn't work?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#44" name="44">44</a>. Work backward</h3>
<p>Assume you have a solution. How would it come to be? What would
immediately lead to it? Can you follow steps backward from the end?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#45" name="45">45</a>. Consider special cases</h3>
<p>Are there some specific forms of the problem that are more tractable
or help with understanding? Can you extend a method based on these?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#46" name="46">46</a>. Consider extremes</h3>
<p>What if something in your problem disappeared, or was huge? What if
the problem itself was much worse, or more minor?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#47" name="47">47</a>. Add a constraint</h3>
<p>Add a deadline for something. Can you come up with ten ideas in ten
minutes? What if you have to be done today? What if your techniques or
resources were limited? What if you couldn't use a tool you're
currently using?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#48" name="48">48</a>. Simplify</h3>
<p>In what ways could a complicated problem be made less so? What does
simplifying it mean? Can you solve the simpler problem? If so, is that
good enough, or is there a way to build on the solution?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#49" name="49">49</a>. Generalize</h3>
<p>Can you make your problem a special case of some other problem? Can
you solve that problem? Maybe a general-purpose tool or approach can
be used or adapted for your problem.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#50" name="50">50</a>. Change the goal</h3>
<p>Maybe you don't need to solve exactly the problem you started with.
What's most important? Can you focus on that? Can you compromise to
find something that you can make progress on?</p>

<p>Google is the <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/">most widely-used search engine</a> in the world, and the company now offers hundreds of other services and products on top of search-based advertising. Personally, I think Google has done a great job improving search over the past two decades, but we are reaching a point where Google’s interests are colliding with offering honest search results to users.</p>
<h2 id="googles-competing-services">Google’s Competing Services</h2>
<p>All the way back in 2012, Yelp’s IPO statement cited Google as both its <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/399831-yelp-has-a-google-problem">biggest asset for gaining new users as well as its biggest competitor</a>. Because the site was the largest local business review site when it went public, it gathered much of its traffic from users who use Google to search for nearby businesses - especially those without a website or strong social media presence.</p>
<p>Since Yelp launched, Google has released its own competing review aggregator, which means that if Google wanted, they could force their results to the top of the list every time. This could effectively <em>kill</em> Yelp’s ability to get new users, and raises a lot of questions about Google’s monopoly on search and its effect on internet businesses.</p>
<h2 id="smart-phones-and-search-engines">Smart Phones and Search Engines</h2>
<p>A more recent frontier in the fight against Google is on smart phones. In 2020, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">brought a lawsuit against the search giant</a> accusing them of “anticompetitive and exclusionary practices,” related to the pressure they allegedly put on phone makers to default to their search engine.</p>
<p>Because Google owns one of the two biggest mobile operating systesm (Android), they have a lot of power to push users towards their search engine. It’s possible that this latest lawsuit could result in a large judgment against the company. A similar lawsuit <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/eu-fines-google-51b-for-abuse-of-power">filed in the European Union in 2018</a> led Google to change the way it bundles apps on Android phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-wiki-model-for-search">The Wiki Model for Search</h2>
<p>As Google’s intentions to integrate search with its own services more deeply has become clear, and I’ve been considering what a non profit search engine might look like.</p>
<p>A great model to look at for guidance is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, the non-profit internet encyclopedia. Could having a crowdsourced, community-funded non-profit search engine be the way to save search engines from becoming cogs in a corporate advertising machine?</p>
<h3 id="spinning-off-a-not-for-profit-search-engine">Spinning Off a Not For Profit Search Engine</h3>
<p>Realistically, it’s not likely that a new competitor will be able to enter the search engine market and make any impact on Google’s market share. But, the US Justice Department or EU could split the company up.</p>
<p>For example, they could break Google up into multiple companies like they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System">did to the telephone companies in the 1980s</a>, or Google search could be turned into a public utility. This is <a href="https://www.project-disco.org/competition/030819-antitrust-in-60-seconds-public-utility-regulation/">how electric companies became publicly supported infrastructure</a>, so it’s not impossible that it could happen again.</p>
<h3 id="how-would-a-non-profit-search-engine-work">How Would a Non Profit Search Engine Work?</h3>
<p>Essentially, a non-profit search engine would allow users to drive improvements to the algorithm by reporting bad results or collaborating on improvements.</p>
<p>I would envision a core team with many contributors - much like open-source projects hosted on Github. While the basic functionality (crawling, link-tracking, etc.) would be the same as a search engine like Google, an impartial not for profit search engine could sidestep privacy pitfalls like Google’s <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-results-get-more-personal-with-search-plus-your-world-107285">SPYW</a> and the aforementioned Yelp problem.</p>
<p>Of course, there is room for abuse in this system as well, but there are numerous improvements to be had in a publicly visible model like this.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-option-today">The Best Option Today</h2>
<p>The closest thing we have today is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, which is closed-source and for-profit, but does not store personal data. This gives users some of the privacy-focused features that a non profit search engine might provide, but doesn’t answer the potential for abuse or eventual monopoly.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OkT1Ljn.png" alt="DuckDuckGo search engine"></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I spent 3 months exclusively using DuckDuckGo as my search engine of choice. As a programmer, it was really challenging though. Google’s results have lots of context about my browsing behaviors, but DuckDuckGo doesn’t, so it takes a little massaging to get the results you might expect.</p>
<p>That said, DuckDuckGo did much better for non-technical search queries. For example, “watch Breaking Bad” takes you to a list of places you can watch the TV show “Breaking Bad.” The results are similar enough to Google’s that you probably wouldn’t notice the difference.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should there be a major player in the search engine market that is not for profit? Is it even necessary? Let me hear your thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>There’s an important trade-off you need to make in order to be more creative: you need to be willing to <em>feel</em> less productive.</p>



<p>I say “feel” instead of “be” because productivity can be a really subjective and delusive game.</p>



<p>Even though efficiency freaks like to measure everything, what usually determines whether they were productive or not is their expectations. And those tend to be very high.</p>



<p>You should definitely work on adjusting your expectations about productivity. But, in the meantime, the best thing you can do is learn how to deal with unproductive guilt.</p>



<p>Because being more creative inevitably requires engaging in “unproductive” behaviors. Like sleeping, going for a walk (without your phone) or meditating.</p>



<p>Creativity is an unconscious and organic process. A great deal of the action happens behind the scenes. And like nature, it works on its own schedule.</p>



<p>You can foster and nurture creativity. But you can’t rush it.</p>



<p>Your mind needs time and space to chew experiences and information, process them, and make novel, interesting connections.</p>



<p>“Productive” people call it procrastination. For creatives, it is the making of a new idea.</p>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

December 6, 2020 | https://aelkus.github.io/theory/2020/12/03/solu.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aelkus.github.io/theory/2020/12/03/solu.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Economist Noah Smith <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/climate-change-isnt-that-hard">is fed up with</a> generic critiques of technological “solutionism,” specifically what he calls the “2010s consensus that technology is a sideshow compared to social movements.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the last decade, we’ve basically been taught to deride “solutionism” — while Silicon Valley techbros were bending their genius toward figuring out ways to sell more ads or lower taxi drivers’ wages, inequality was running rampant and parents were struggling to feed their kids. Instead of trusting wizardry to solve the world’s problems, we were supposed to place our faith in politics, in mass action, and in cultural change.</p>

  <p>Except then consider what happened with COVID. Our leaders failed to fight the virus effectively, and the President actively sabotaged containment efforts. Culturally, we screeched our heads off about masks and herd immunity and “just the flu” and beach parties and school closings and bar closings and restaurant closings and dorm closings and so on and so forth. We didn’t implement strict lockdowns and we protested against lockdowns and we didn’t even obey the half-assed lockdowns we did implement. We became one of the planet’s worst-hit countries, despite having the planet’s most expensive health care system. We died in the red states, we died in the blue states. We died in droves, in hundreds of thousands. Collectively, as a society, we wrung our hands and ran in circles and screeched and died and screeched and died and screeched and died until scientists made vaccines against the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this correct? In some ways, Smith stacks the deck in his favor. Scientific breakthroughs on vaccines can be produced by small groups of experts insulated from public pressure and the clown show of 21st century American politics. This was never the case with non-pharmaceutical interventions, even if I share Smith’s sense out of outrage and horror over America’s failed response to COVID.</p>

<p>Comparing them is a little akin to comparing World War II’s military-technical research achievements to the great campaigns of Europe and the Pacific War. The latter required extensive political and organizational coordination on a hitherto unprecedented scale, and buy-in from millions of ordinary people. The former were not exactly a bunch of eggheads in a seminar room, but they represent at least crudely processes that are largely autonomous from the need to attain large-scale consensus and cooperation.</p>

<p>Come next year, when we enter into the challenge of rolling out vaccines while preserving basic social distancing measures, we will get a reminder of how different these two kinds of activities are. I’m more optimistic that next year will be significantly better than 2020 was, but only guardedly. However, Smith is also on to something larger when he notes the dubious framing of how the answer to engineering our way to nirvana is supposed to be large-scale political and cultural change driven by mass popular mobilization.</p>

<p>‘Political solution’ in this framing seems to be a euphemism for either a deliberative process that harmonizes competing views or (more often) the imposition of one’s will on the body politic via political struggle. Neither look particularly promising in a polarized society in which merely putting on a piece of cloth held together with string has become a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/25/republicans-democrats-move-even-further-apart-in-coronavirus-concerns/">partisan issue</a>. Moreover, Smith <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-17/california-is-back-on-the-brink-of-being-a-failed-state">observes elsewhere</a> that even in my home state of California – where GOP opposition has been virtually eradicated – single-party dominance has failed to resolve basic governance issues.</p>

<p>Certainly most thoughtful critics of techno-determinism likely will say that they aren’t categorically against the use of technology, but rather criticize a particular mindset that uncritically postulates that objective solutions can be discovered to objectively framed problems and then objectively implemented and accepted by a mostly cooperative public. However, it is hard to tell if they are talking about the technologists or themselves when they make this criticism. Statements like “if only we had the political will” to do something of interest are just as naive as “if only we had the right app.”</p>

<p>Technologists are often criticized for wanting to ‘route around’ the US political system, but <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/">given</a> low institutional trust and increasingly low interpersonal trust, it is difficult to be entirely critical of that desire. The biggest problem with it is that it often devolves into fantasies of taking one’s toys and exiting into an autonomous space free of the need to gain mass consensus (seasteading!) or instituting impersonal mechanisms that suppress political resistance (make the AI president!) There are idiots. Look around. But we’re all idiots in some shape or form and we’re stuck with each other. What do we do next?</p>

<p>First, somewhat of a meta-point: indirection often is a very underrated way of creating change. Part of what this post is looking to encourage is something I sometimes refer to as the “Andrew Marshall style” of change. For decades, Marshall headed up the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) within the United States Department of Defense. Most people interested in defense and strategy, including yours truly, have in some way directly or indirectly benefited from ONA and its projects. But Marshall did so largely below the radar.</p>

<p>Demanding only autonomy, a tiny (by Pentagon standards) budget, a small office, and the freedom to report directly to the Secretary of Defense, Marshall at first glance took a rather counter-intuitive approach. But this was actually critical to his success. He was not a threat to other people’s bureaucratic rice bowls. But he preserved his own autonomy. And by slowly building up a network of relationships and becoming a hub for innovative work, ONA ended up exercising a profound influence on American national security and defense.</p>

<p>What is remarkable about Marshall’s success is that he propagated his particular institutional relationships forward through decades of changing political, economic, and bureaucratic turmoil while slowly altering the surrounding environment around him. It would be ridiculous to assert that Marshall is singularly responsible for any particular major shift in American national security and defense, but it is also very evident that ONA’s presence and persistence changed the boundary conditions of the US defense and security system.</p>

<p>While many technologists often valorize another Cold War American defense icon – John Boyd – Marshall is also a model worth emulating. Technology is complicated, frustrating, and more often than not disappointing relative to our ambitions. But it can change the boundary conditions of problems. Tweaking the boundary conditions of problems is a big part of how meaningful change can happen overall.</p>

<p>Getting 2-3 promising vaccines in under a year is a great example. Vaccines do not change the massive amount of political and institutional failures America has experienced since the COVID-19 outbreak began. However, consider the alternative world without vaccines that we were in only a short time ago. We had all of those problems but without any kind of roadmap as to how we might escape them. Now we have a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/11/15/heres-when-experts-say-things-could-get-back-to-back-to-normal-after-coronavirus/?sh=3f66c9d936ed">hazy but nonetheless meaningful</a> idea of how long it could take to get back to normal, even if there is no really coherent shared idea of ‘normality.’ This is worth celebrating!</p>

<p>Even without a vaccine, we would be much worse off than we are now if everything from the physical network backbone to distributed work solutions did not perform well under significant stress. The Internet, also created originally in part for the purpose of scientific collaboration, enabled scientific researchers around the world to work together at breakneck speed to learn as much as possible about a novel virus and figure out how to attack it. Outside of the US and most <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/lessons-from-taiwans-experience-with-covid-19/">successfully in Taiwan</a>, governments have also found success in working together with the private sector to manage information flows during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Beyond COVID, what might this mean? Even in the best of times, the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">most</a> we can often accomplish on the most intractable social problems is to <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">muddle through</a>. They have <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01405730">no inherent point</a> at which they officially stop being problems, and often no inherently correct shared framing. It doesn’t mean that action is pointless, but true students of politics often understand that politics is a secular activity instead of a means of bringing about religious salvation.</p>

<p>It seems unwise to stake our hopes on some kind of decisive reckoning at which political solutions will somehow materialize and then be imposed on our friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Much for the same reason that many of us find that we cannot get even members of our own family to take sensible COVID precautions no matter how much we plead, cajole, and threaten them. Still, we have also seen what happens when we simply stand still and do nothing.</p>

<p>“Techno-scientific” changes in the surrounding environment can do a number of salient things. They can provide tools we did not have before to mitigate problems. They can subtly influence or even shift the dynamics of particular interpersonal and institutional relationships and interactions. New frontiers to explore can distract people that otherwise would make trouble, and a bigger pie can make people feel more generous than they otherwise would be. While much has been made of the costs of technological disruption, breaking up established social hierarchies can be necessary for the system as a whole to survive and grow.</p>

<p>Preventing stasis and injecting more slack into the system are both means to the same end: propagating the system forward into the future. So technological “solutionism” (a term I have always disliked due to its imprecision), is both more and less important than ever. It certainly falls short of the hopes of its biggest boosters and the fears of its opponents. But if you are a technologist looking to make a difference now is as good of a …</p></div></div>
