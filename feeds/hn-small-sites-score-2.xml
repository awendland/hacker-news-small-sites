			<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Stories and takeaways from growing ProveSource from 0 to $700k ARR as a 2-person team in less than 3 years and with no funding.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover.png" alt="3 year story provesource" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-year-story-cover-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<h2><strong>Our false start</strong></h2>
<p>We started the company in June 2015 with no real idea.</p>
<p>Most people we know fail to ever get started because they’re looking for the perfect idea.</p>
<p>As the founder of Instagram famously said:</p>
<p>“It’s about going through false starts. The best companies in the world have all had predecessors. YouTube was a dating site. You always have to evolve into something else.”</p>
<p>We brainstormed for several days and because both myself and Natan (my co-founder) are very good with mobile app development (iOS &amp; Android) we decided to build a personalization platform for mobile apps and sell it to enterprises.</p>
<p>Around 2.5 years later, having invested almost $100k out of our own pockets, having done hundreds of calls and demos with huge enterprises and dozens of Proof of Concepts, we decided it’s time to move on…</p>
<p>It felt awful – like you’re killing something you love, but it had to be done.</p>
<p>That was our “false start”. But more on that another time.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>The sooner you kill an idea that is getting no traction, even if it’s super hard because it’s your baby, the less painful it is. The more time and resources you devote, the harder it becomes to pull out in case things don’t work out.</p>
<h2><strong>Starting over – The lean way</strong></h2>
<p>In January 2018 we decided to start working on a new SaaS product.</p>
<p>The idea was to “steal” the social proof hack that Booking.com was using (e.g. 5 people booked this hotel, etc.) and create a platform from it – a social proof marketing platform.</p>
<p>This time, because we were running on fumes, both in terms of cash and motivation, we decided to validate the idea first.</p>
<p>We had a single purpose in mind – getting 100 leads interested in our product.</p>
<p>We created a landing page that showcased our new idea as a real product, including pricing, a signup button, and all – a social proof marketing platform for mobile apps.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps.png" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/landing-page-for-product-validation-ps-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<p>The fastest way to get targeted traffic to your website is to use Google Ads targeting the brand names of the biggest players in your niche.</p>
<p>So we did that.</p>
<p>We also posted the landing page anywhere we could think of: Reddit, ProductHunt, BetaList, social media, wherever…</p>
<p>About one month and – $300 later, we had around 200 leads that wanted to try out ProveSource.</p>
<p>We were finally making progress!</p>
<p>We figured that even if only 1% of them converted, we would already have 2 paying customers.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>You can easily get traction without having a product.</p>
<p>Just buy a domain, build a landing page, and go validate your business idea.</p>
<p>We usually create landing pages to validate products using plain HTML and Airtable, to send the leads we collect from the forms. No fancy designs, no expensive CRM.</p>
<h2><strong>Making our first dollar $</strong></h2>
<p>Next goal – how do we make a dollar?</p>
<p>That is, unlike our previous product which made practically $0 in 2.5 years.</p>
<p>We created a rule that whenever we launch a new product, all our efforts will be towards making our first dollar, so we can have real-life validation.</p>
<p>So we have 200 people interested in ProveSource.</p>
<p>Now we needed to give them a product and get them to pay.</p>
<p>We built the leanest MVP possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product just for website owners (mobile was too small of a niche).</li>
<li>You could only show how many page visitors you had on your website.</li>
<li>The whole UI and UX should be super simple. No menus and extra buttons, don’t give users a reason to abandon your product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you forget your password and need to reset it? Sorry, no can do.</p>
<p>Did we accidentally change your password when you logged in? Oops, we’re on it.</p>
<p>What are onboarding and email automation? Dunno, don’t care.</p>
<p>April 2018 – we are approached by a Facebook Group admin that is interested in promoting our product to his group as a “lifetime deal” (LTD).</p>
<p>This means selling a lifetime subscription to your product for a one-off payment ranging from $39-$99.</p>
<p>We’ve never heard of this before so we thought long and hard about the consequences of selling a lifetime deal and how it would position the product and our company…</p>
<p>We decided to go with the deal and ran it with the group for 1 week.</p>
<p>We generated over $7k revenue, got tons of feedback, ideas for product improvements, tons of bugs were discovered in the process, which taught us the value of having live chat support.</p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>In hindsight, there were no real consequences, only advantages to running a lifetime deal.</p>
<p>Sure, you have a few dozens of customers that are not paying you on a recurring basis – but they help a lot in the beginning when you need the cash and the validation.</p>
<p>Once we were done with the LTD we started pushing the product in all marketing channels and to our 200 user waiting list. None of them converted by the way.</p>
<p>A couple of days later we got our first monthly subscription customer ($19/month).</p>
<p>It was an amazing moment, validating that you indeed have a real business opportunity in your hands.</p>
<h2><strong>Our “wow moment”</strong></h2>
<p>During the next months, we focused on spreading the word, squashing bugs, and doing tons of support for our existing customers.</p>
<p>How did we decide what to build next?</p>
<ul>
<li>We learned to ask questions about our product’s value. Why do people buy our product? Is it because they want to increase conversions? How do we help them achieve that?</li>
<li>We brainstormed about what it means to be a social proof platform.</li>
<li>We heard our customers’ feedback</li>
<li>We learned from competitors; but not too much. We found that those who only copy will always lag behind.</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole process has to be accompanied by analytics and metrics.</p>
<p>You don’t have to measure each and every step or A/B test you do, though.</p>
<p>We don’t really do it, to this day.</p>
<p>A lot of product leaders talk about the “wow effect” or “wow moment” – if you want to retain users, make them say “wow”.</p>
<p>For Facebook, for example, their “wow moment” is logging into their platform and seeing familiar faces. That’s why they make sure that during sign up, you connect with as many people you know on Facebook as possible.</p>
<p>In our case, we focused on improving our user onboarding.</p>
<p>Since the product requires users to install a javascript snippet on their website, we put a big emphasis on making that process as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Our thought was – if users can see a social proof notification on their website, they’ll get to that “wow moment”.</p>
<p>We can see a very close correlation between successful onboarding and someone becoming a paying customer.</p>
<p>The funnel looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-10% of visitors will signup.</li>
<li>70% of those signups will complete the onboarding.</li>
<li>7-10% of those users who are onboarded will eventually become paying customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel.png" alt="ProveSource Signups Funnel" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel.png 1920w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-300x169.png 300w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-1024x576.png 1024w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-768x432.png 768w, https://provesrc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ProveSource-Signups-Funnel-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></p>
<p><strong>🧠 Lesson learned:</strong></p>
<p>Find what your “wow moment” is in your users’ experience, and make sure you get users to experience it as early in the onboarding process as possible. That way you can spend a lot on User Acquisition activities because the users you bring in end up becoming paying customers and sticking with you.</p>
<h2><strong>Our First Growth “Hack”</strong></h2>
<p>After we added some “necessary” features like showing recent sales and polishing the product to have fewer bugs – we wanted to grow bigger, we wanted to scale up, we wanted to get more exposure.</p>
<p>How do you scale a notifications product that is essentially an add-on for websites?</p>
<p>You build integrations for all website builders.</p>
<p>So we worked hard on adding more and more integrations: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/provesource/">WordPress plugin</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/provesource">Shopify app</a>, Magento plugin, Wix app, <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/provesource/integrations">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/provesource-social-proof/">BigCommerce</a>, and more.</p>
<p>All of these marketplaces and app stores proved to be really good traffic sources and traction channels for us, each with its own audience and unique requirements.</p>
<p>Today, around 20% of our customers and revenue comes from Shopify alone.</p>
<h2><strong>Scaling past 2 people</strong></h2>
<p>Being a two-person team that does development, marketing, support, accounting, and more is tough. But it also teaches you a lot, you learn so much about your business, your audience, and your customers.</p>
<p>And that gives you the experience you need on what to look for when hiring someone to take over some of your responsibilities.</p>
<p>In September 2019 we decided it’s time to scale the team.</p>
<p>After all, a great company can’t be just 2 people, right?</p>
<p>Naturally, a software company’s first hire would be a developer.</p>
<p>Bringing Dima to the team, allowed us to build more integrations faster, and scale the company beyond its initial stage.</p>
<p>So we now have tons of integrations, pretty much with any large marketing or website platform out there.</p>
<p>We also scaled and optimized our Google and Facebook ads as much as we could.</p>
<p>We optimized our product onboarding rate, increased prices, added great features, and made it even easier to use the product, by adding tooltips, auto-suggestions, wizards, and more.</p>
<p>We were growing at a steady rate, so what could possibly be bothering us?</p>
<p>Well, we didn’t know how to grow faster, or what to do next.</p>
<p>We came up with a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring a Growth team member to scale our marketing efforts and bring new ideas to the table.</li>
<li>Since our product offering is strong and we couldn’t think about any impactful feature we could develop – we thought about zooming out of our product’s initial market.</li>
<li>Build a new product – we have no investors so we are free to make any decision we want about the company’s direction. Investors often block the founders from doing whatever is best for the company and push for a point where they can exit.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Building a new product</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, we decided to build another product to scale the company further.</p>
<p>We had these questions in mind before picking what to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How big is the market, is it potentially bigger than our current product?</li>
<li>Would our existing customers be customers of this new product too?</li>
<li>What do our existing customers need and are willing to pay for?</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding ProveSource to your website is great, but, there is a critical prerequisite to making it work for you and your website: traffic. If your website has no traffic, you won’t be able to generate social proof.</p>

    <section>
      <!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>“T</span>he Democratic Party,” wrote the late Walter Laqueur, was “liberal and slightly left-of-centre in outlook, progressive but not too much so, in favour of reform but afraid of going too far. . . . They had quite a few professors among their leading supporters and also some bankers and industrialists, but for the majority of academics . . . [it] was quite unacceptable.” Bourgeois parties “are never militant, almost by definition”—and the “Democratic Party was perhaps the least militant of all.”</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Central to its impotence, Laqueur believed, was “the mood of an activist younger generation.” An “unthinking, aimless radicalism,” which “preferred drums to speeches and parades to long and inconclusive discussions,” could “turn left or right or lead nowhere at all.” Not just on college campuses: “Contempt for ‘the system,’” its “vested interests, cliques, and party caucuses,” permeated the middle class. Leftists “attacked the Republic and all it stood for as something that was rotten through and through,” while conservatives thought “‘the system’ so corrupt that any political order that succeeded it would be an improvement”—even as they complained (correctly) that “the left was anti-patriotic.” Both sides “were unhappy, though for different reasons, with . . . the existing state of affairs.” “There was not the slightest willingness to take each other’s point of view seriously, let alone to compromise.” </p><p>That, at any rate, is how Laqueur saw Weimar Germany with the benefit of hindsight.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>A</span>merica is not Weimar. We have not lost a World War or been forced to pay war debt; we’ve had 250 years of democracy, not 25; Trump isn’t Hitler, and Biden, whatever his faults, isn’t calling for communism. There is street violence, but a lot less of it—for unlike Weimar, we do not generally let paramilitary groups supplant the police, Seattle’s “autonomous zone” being the exception that proves the rule.
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But the exceptions are mounting. In Portland, protestors <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/protesters-attempt-create-autonomous-zone-portland-graffiti-smoke-pigs-precinct-1513743">attempted to create</a> an autonomous zone of their own by barricading the area with stolen property and blocking the exits of a nearby police precinct; “going to burn the building down,” one man threatened. In Minneapolis, a precinct actually did burn down after it was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/protests-looting-erupt-again-minneapolis-area-following-death-george-floyd-n1216881">set ablaze</a> by “demonstrators,” two of whom (<a href="https://www.startribune.com/charges-minneapolis-brothers-destroyed-property-inside-third-precinct/571450752/">both white</a>) were subsequently charged. In Kenosha, riots claimed two lives and several more city blocks, which <a href="https://twitter.com/joshglancy/status/1299734436792197120">were</a> “indistinguishable from a war zone” by the time the dust settled. </p><p>And throughout the country, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/nyregion/nyc-shootings-surge.html">New York City</a> to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-police-six-month-crime-stats-20200626-wqsf3rebavaldex7v54ozqsnxe-story.html">Chicago</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/davon-mcneal-shot/2020/07/05/16390c1a-bec6-11ea-b178-bb7b05b94af1_story.html">Washington, DC</a>, shootings have surged alongside looting—in some places, <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/nypd-shootings-increase-1.46044819">by over 400 percent</a>—destroying lives and livelihoods in their wake.</p><p>On its own, this would hardly warrant comparison with Weimar. Crime and violence are as American as apple pie, and street fighting, though aesthetically German, has plenty of precedent in the U.S. What recalls interwar Germany is not the chaos itself, but the way it has been excused, even encouraged, by those notionally in a position to stop it—many of whom seem ambivalent about whether the republic it threatens deserves defense. Examples of this excuse-making include, but are not limited to:</p><ol><li>The true <a href="https://unherd.com/2020/07/the-ugly-truth-about-the-blm-protests/">but trivial claim</a> that the protests have been “mostly” peaceful.</li><li>The argument, made by a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/03/of-course-destruction-of-property-is-violence-299759">Pulitzer-winning <em>New York Times</em> journalist</a>, that “destroying property, which can be replaced, is not violence.”</li><li>A <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/in-defense-of-looting/">widely-circulated essay</a>, written during the Ferguson protests of 2014, that defends looting as a “righteous,” attention-grabbing tactic in the fight against white supremacy. (The author subsequently elaborated her arguments in a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/08/27/906642178/one-authors-argument-in-defense-of-looting">controversial interview</a> with NPR.)</li></ol><p>It is telling that, despite reaching the same conclusion, these excuses all contradict one another. If violence were extraordinarily rare (1), there would be no reason to deny its status <em>as</em> violence (2), or to defend its tactical value (3)—whereas if looting <em>weren’t</em> violent, if it didn’t disrupt or endanger life, its attention-grabbing power would be extraordinarily diminished. The contradictions suggest that elite alegality isn’t rooted in any specific principle, but rather a kind of inchoate radicalism: a vague, burn-it-down impulse increasingly common across the political spectrum, whose ends are drifting farther and farther apart. If the 2016 election <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/18/12210500/diagnosed-dysfunction-republican-party">seemed to confirm</a> the existence of “asymmetric” polarization, the 2020 tumult suggests that polarization can only remain asymmetric for so long. </p><p>And as the symmetries grow more apparent, the shadow of Weimar grows longer still. Much has been made—<a href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/11/12/resilient-democracies/">too much</a>—of what are ultimately very weak parallels between Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler. But though<strong> </strong>Trump’s America looks nothing like Nazi Germany, it <em>has </em>developed echoes of the Republic from which Nazism arose—echoes that implicate the left no less than the right. Weimar was not, as is sometimes suggested, a good society beset by bigots and bad luck. It was a febrile, dysfunctional culture in which few voters, and even fewer elites, believed in the Republic they eventually dissolved. We often hear about the perils of “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/trump-impeachment-journalism/">bothsidesism</a>,” of treating “fascists” and “anti-fascists” as equivalent threats. Yet in the collapse of Weimar Germany, both sides played an important role.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <span>T</span>o be fair, Weimar didn’t have a whole lot to work with. One of the things it did not have—or rather had stolen—was a well-defined founding. Officially, it began outside the German Reichstag on November 9, 1918, where the Social Democratic minister Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the birth of the Republic. But unofficially, it began at Hohenzollern Palace two hours later, when the communist leader Karl Liebknecht proclaimed a Republic of his own—the first of many such putsches by Germany’s leftmost wing. The repeated attempts to overthrow the government, and the fact that the Social Democrats, like the communists, claimed to be committed Marxists, made it easy for the right to blame instability on the left, and for the masses to associate that instability with Weimar's socialist architects.
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>But many republics, including ours, had violent foundings. What made Weimar special, as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weimar-Republic-Crisis-Classical-Modernity/dp/0809015560">historian Detlev Peukert put it</a>, was that it “was not marked by an event that served as an old-fashioned but politically unifying . . . moment in national history, along the lines of the American Declaration of Independence.” It had two competing proclamations, two rival origin stories, which meant that there was “no legitimizing founding ritual” to sustain “active commitment to the new order.” Germans did, of course, debate which story was the true one. That it was debated at all both signaled and intensified a profound lack of legitimacy, an open wound ripe for infection. </p><p>These disagreements—less about facts than about symbolism—did not mean collapse was inevitable. (Weimar survived the 1920s, after all.) But they did mean that there were few common reference points to rein in polarization, and more chances for insurgent ideologies—never mind actual insurgents—to gain steam. </p><p>Weimar had no shortage of radicals; centrists, on the other hand, were a dying breed. The intelligentsia fell roughly into one of two camps: leftists who hated everything about Germany, from its culture to its constitution; and rightists who hated the constitution because it was insufficiently German—which is to say, insufficiently authoritarian. The last group dominated the universities, whose reliance on public funds did not dampen their rancor toward the Republic. In fairness, those funds hadn’t stopped the academic job market from cratering after WWI, which meant that even the best-credentialed thinkers were often precariously employed. With few prospects in the existing system, the intellectual class saw little reason to defend it, and had an easy time rationalizing its destruction. The upshot was that college-educated civil servants typically hated the Republic they were serving, as did judges, policymakers, and educators. Ditto artists, journalists, and playwrights, though these professions skewed left. </p><p>Beyond their shared anti-Republicanism, all that the two sides had in common was their contempt for one another. The left derided the right as backwards-looking and chauvinistic, while the right derided the left as self-hating and unpatriotic—all of which, it must be said, was true. Kurt Tucholsky, Weimar’s leading leftwing satirist, complained that “the German spirit was poisoned almost beyond recovery,” and that “German democracy [was] a facade and a lie.” “There is no secret of the Germany army I would not hand over readily to a foreign power,” he bragged in 1931, a boast that did not exactly endear him to the people who took power in ‘33. Those people, of course, were just as Tucholsky described them: irredeemable, backwards bigots whose deaths could not come soon enough.</p><p>But the Nazis never won more than a plurality of the vote—and most conservative elites were not Nazis. (Indeed, several became their victims.) What united the right was not a particular political program, but a general sense of grievance against the far left and republican center, distinct groups it would often synonymize. Marxism, modernism, liberalism—these were all shades of the same thing, corruptions of the old order. An equal but opposite elision occured on the left, with the communists calling everyone to their right—including the Social Democrats—fascists, an unfair charge that many leftwing intellectuals nonetheless echoed. The result of these stereo-stereotypes was threefold.</p><p>First, they exacerbated Weimar’s crisis of legitimacy. If the Republic lacked a founding ritual, the elites were in no hurry to invent one; rather, the “center” was so widely anathematized that it effectively didn’t exist. In one case, <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/communists-allied-with-nazis.html">the communists even endorsed a Nazi referendum</a> to overthrow the Social Democratic government in Prussia, on the theory that social democracy was a greater threat than National Socialism.

<div id="abstract"><p>In this multi-part tutorial I'm going to show you how you can use cheap and "low end" hardware to build an amazing router with firewalling capabilities, DNS, DHCP and much much more, using the fantastic OpenBSD operating system. I am going to use a setup in which the router segments the local area network (LAN) into separate networks, one for the grown-ups in the house, one for the children, and one for public facing servers, such as a private web server or mail server. I'll also show you how you can use DNS to effectively block out most ads, porn, and many harmful websites on the Internet. Last, but not least, I'll show you how you can use the firewall to block outgoing telemetric data from computers running Microsoft Windows, NVIDIA graphics drivers, etc. The router can also be used on small to mid-size offices.</p><p>If you don't need a segmented network, but simply need a solid firewall and/or DNS server, you can still use the tutorial as I am going to guide you step by step introducing and setting up one solution at a time.</p></div>

<li><a href="#the-network">The network</a></li>
<li><a href="#why-openbsd">Why OpenBSD?</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-a-firewall">Why a firewall?</h2>
<p>Almost no matter how you connect to the Internet from your home or office you need a real firewall between you and the modem or router that your ISP has provided you with.</p>
<p>I have worked for quite some time in the ISP business and if there is one thing I can tell you for sure, it is that not only do they rarely keep your modem or router firmware up to date, they almost always use some of the most miserable products on the market.</p>
<p>One of the sources for most of the SPAM email on the Internet originates from consumer market modems and routers that has been compromised.</p>
<p>With a firewall between you and the Internet, meaning the modem or router from your ISP, you can not only protect your computers much better, but you can also monitor the traffic that comes and goes to and from your house, and you can react to situations that might call for an alarm.</p>
<p>Without a firewall between your local network and the ISP modem or router you could basically consider this an open door policy, like leaving the door to your house wide open, because you cannot trust the equipment from your ISP.</p>
<p>At one particular ISP I have even witnessed how some employees used to hack into customers computers using the services that the ISP provided. Of course the ISP didn't know that at the time, but this illustrates my point very well.</p>
<p>It is always a really good idea to put a real firewall between your local network and your ISP and with OpenBSD you get a very solid solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>You don't have to buy expensive hardware to get an effective router and firewall for your house or office. Even with cheap and "low end" hardware you can get a very solid solution.</p>
<p>I have build multiple setups using the <a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Q1900DC-ITX/">ASRock Q1900DC-ITX</a> motherboard that comes with an Intel Quad-Core Celeron processor.</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/asrock-q1900dc-itx.png" alt="ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard"></p>
<p>I'll admit, it's a pretty "crappy" motherboard, but it gets the job done and I have several builds that have run very solid for many years on gigabit networks with full saturation and the firewall, DNS, etc. working "overtime" and the CPU hardly breaks a sweat. This is contrary to the extremely expensive Soekris, which people used to recommend, that typically ran less powerful Intel Atom processors not capable of saturating a gigabit network.</p>
<p>The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard has the advantage that it comes with a DC-In Jack that is compatible with a 9~19V power adapter, making it very power saving.</p>
<p>The ASRock Q1900DC-ITX motherboard is no longer sold, but I'm just using it as an example because I have used several of these boards in the past.</p>
<p>I have also used the ASRock Q1900-ITX (it doesn't come with the DC-In Jack) combined with a PicoPSU.</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/picopsu.png" alt="PicoPSU power supply"></p>
<p>You can find different brands and versions of the PicoPSU, some are better quality than others. I have two different brands, the original and a cheaper knockoff, both performing very well and they save quite a bit of power contrary to running with a normal power supply that typically requires at least 10 watts more.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am using a cheap Intel knockoff quad port NIC found on Ebay like this one:</p>
<p><img src="https://unixsheikh.com/includes/img/intel-quad-nic.png" alt="Intel Quad NIC"></p>
<p>Now before you start condemning me for using low end hardware, I know it is better to use quality hardware, especially on a network that you care about, but this tutorial is about how you can get away with using fairly cheep hardware and still get an extremely useful product that will continue to serve you well for many years - at least that is my experience.</p>
<p>I recommend that you look for a low power mini ITX board with hardware <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/amd64.html">supported by OpenBSD</a> such as an Intel Celeron or Intel i3 processor. These boards are typically cheap, less power hungry, and they don't take up very much space. I don't recommend using the Intel Atom CPU if you have a gigabit network as they usually choke because they can't handle the amount of traffic, but your milage may vary. Also, I have never had any luck finding any useful AMD boards because the CPU usually would require much more power than the Intel counterpart - however my experience with AMD is mostly outdated and I haven't used AMD for many years. I also don't recommend older dual core Intel CPU's, they will work perfectly, but they also require more power.</p>
<p>Oh, and then you need a couple of cheap gigabit switches too for the segmented LANs, at least if you have more than one computer you want to connect to the same LAN :)</p>

<h2 id="the-network">The network</h2>
<p>A router is basically a device that regulate network traffic between two or more separate networks. The router will ensure that network traffic intended for the local network doesn't run out into the wild on the Internet and traffic on the Internet, that is not intended for your local network, stays on the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Just for information, a router is sometimes also referred to as a gateway, which generally is alright in layman's terms, but in truth a real gateway joins dissimilar systems. An example of a gateway would be a device that joins a PC network with a  telecommunications network.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we're building a router and we have 4 different but similar networks to work with. One is the Internet and the other three are the internally segmented LANs. Some people prefer to work with virtual LANs, but in this tutorial I'm going to use the quad port NIC from above. You can achieve the same result by using multiple one port NICs if you prefer that, you just have to make sure that you have enough room and free PCI slots on the motherboard. You can also use the Ethernet port on the motherboard itself, but it depends on the driver and support for the device. I have had no problems using the typical Realtek PCI gigabit Ethernet controller that normally comes with many motherboards even though I recommend Intel over Realtek.</p>
<p>Of course you don't need to segment the network into several parts if you don't need that, and it will be very easy to change the things I setup in this tutorial, but I have decided to use this approach in order to show you how you can protect your children by segmenting their network into a separate LAN that not only gets ad and porn blocking using DNS (all the segments gets that), but you can even whitelist the parts of the Internet you want them to have access to. The last part about whitelisting is difficult and generally not recommended unless your children are very small and only requires very limited access, but it is doable with some work.</p>
<p>This is an illustration of the network we're going to setup:</p>
<pre><code>
                       Internet
                          |
                    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
                    ISP Modem (WAN)
                      10.24.0.23
                          |
                       OpenBSD
                      10.24.0.50
                  (router/firewall)
                          |
     -------------------------------------------
     |                    |                    |
    NIC1                 NIC2                 NIC3
192.168.1.1          192.168.2.1          192.168.3.1
LAN1 switch          LAN2 switch          LAN3 switch
     |                    |                    |
     -- 192.168.1.2       -- 192.168.2.2       -- 192.168.3.2
     |  Grown-up PC       |  Child PC1         |  Public web server
                          |
                          -- 192.168.2.3
                          |  Child PC2
</code></pre>
<p>The IP addresses that begins with 10 are whatever IP addresses your ISP router gives you, in my case it looks similar to the above. The IP addresses beginning with 192 are IP addresses that we're going to use in our local network.</p>
<p>I have not dealt with any kind of wireless connectivity in this setup. Wireless chip firmware is notoriously buggy and exploitable and I recommend you don't use any kind of wireless connections if you can do without. If you do require wireless connections I strongly recommend that you disable wireless access completely from the ISP modem or router (if possible), and then buy the best wireless router you can find and put it behind the firewall in an isolated segment instead. That way should your wireless device ever be compromised you can better control the outcome and limit the damage. You can further setup the wireless router such that any devices connected to it have their own IPs that pass directly through the wireless router, but at the same time block traffic directly originating from the router itself. That way you can prevent the wireless router from "phoning home". You can also get a wireless adapter supported by OpenBSD and have your OpenBSD machine run as the actual access point, however I much prefer to segment the wireless part to either a separate wireless router or another OpenBSD machine serving as a wireless access point behind the firewall itself. Also, as of writing (as far as I know) none of the OpenBSD wireless drivers are fully without problems.</p>

<p>Many applications can be updated automatically and without any user interaction. This is commonly considered a good practice from the security point of view, since it allows for quick distribution of patches for critical vulnerabilities. However, automatic updates also carry an additional risk because they allow the software developers to push arbitrary code to users’ machines. Unfortunately, users often have no choice but to trust the developers that they will only use the update channel for its intended purpose and that they will protect it from malicious third parties.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we’ll show that this trust might sometimes be misplaced. Specifically, we’ll show how one torrent client and three adblockers surreptitiously installed the FakeMBAM backdoor through automatic updates. We reverse engineered this backdoor and describe its inner workings in the second part of this post.</p>



<h2>An unexpected infection vector</h2>



<p>We recently <a href="https://blog.avast.com/fake-malwarebytes-installation-files-distributing-coinminer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on a fake Malwarebytes installer</a> that we detected on over 100,000 machines protected by Avast. This installer attempted to pass itself off as the legitimate Malwarebytes installer, mimicking it to a great extent – it was distributed under the same filename, it used the same icon and it created a Malwarebytes installation directory containing legitimate PE files digitally signed by Malwarebytes. However, that was all just a pretense, because the installer did not actually install Malwarebytes. In fact, the installer’s main purpose was to open a backdoor to attacker-controlled servers in order to give its operators the ability to push additional malicious payloads to the infected machines.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="829" height="509" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo.png 829w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo-300x184.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/map_logo-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px"><figcaption>A map illustrating the distribution of Avast users protected from the FakeMBAM backdoor. The backdoor is most active in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In our first report, we stated that we did not know how this fake installer was being distributed. Since then, we spent some time reverse engineering the malware and investigating its infection vector. We found that the fake installer was pushed to the victims’ machines through automatic updates of one torrent client (<code>download[.]studio</code>) and three adblockers (<code>netshieldkit[.]com</code>, <code>myadblock[.]com</code> and <code>netadblock[.]com</code>). Listed on the websites of these applications are three different companies that are supposedly behind these applications, “Sigma Software”, “GRAND MEDIA, TOV” and “Birmon Software”. However, based on high code similarities and shared infrastructure (and on the fact that they all distributed the very same piece of malware), we consider it very likely that there is one actor behind all four applications.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Download Studio</h3>



<p>To investigate the infection vector used to distribute the fake installer, we first turned to the metadata that was submitted to us when we detected the installer in the wild. This provided us with two important clues: The installers were supposed to be executed with the command line arguments <code>/SP- /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /NOCANCEL /NOICONS</code>, by a process named <code>dstudio-gui.exe</code>. The first clue suggested that the installer was not supposed to be spread through social engineering, because the above arguments instruct Inno Setup to install software silently in the background. The second clue hinted at the possible suspect: Download Studio.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="699" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-1024x699.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-1024x699.png 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-300x205.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website-768x524.png 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_website.png 1163w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A screenshot of the Download Studio product page.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Download Studio is a free torrent client popular in Russia and Ukraine. It features an embedded library of torrent files, offering a wide selection of movies, software, video games, music and more. As is usually the case with torrent downloaders, there is a lot of copyrighted material that can be easily downloaded for free using this software, which seems to be the main reason why it is so widespread. Download Studio is detected by some anti-malware software as a potentially unwanted program (PUP) or as riskware, because it encourages illegal behavior and puts its users at risk through downloading torrents of unknown origin.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="639" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-1024x639.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-1024x639.png 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-300x187.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot-768x479.png 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ds_screenshot.png 1234w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A screenshot of Download Studio’s movie library.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To clear up some potential confusion, let us state that there is also another piece of software named Download Studio: <a href="http://www.conceiva.com/products/downloadstudio/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a download manager developed by Conceiva</a>. Apart from the name, this software has nothing in common with the torrent client described in this blog post and there is therefore no reason to doubt its legitimacy. In the rest of this blog post, the name Download Studio will denote the torrent client described in the previous paragraph.</p>



<p>Since Download Studio can be used to download various software, it would make sense to think that the fake Malwarebytes installer was distributed through it as a regular torrent file (after all there were 609 results when we searched for “Malwarebytes” inside Download Studio). However, that would not explain the command line arguments that we observed in the wild. They simply indicated that running the installer was not a user-initiated action and that the user might not have been aware of the installer at all. Furthermore, the number of users that we protected from the fake installer matched our estimates of the number of Avast users running Download Studio, which made it look like Download Studio itself was somehow responsible. Therefore, we decided to reverse engineer it to see if it contained hidden malicious code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We immediately found some evident code similarities with the FakeMBAM backdoor. Both Download Studio and the backdoor were developed using the Qt framework and they both used the very same string obfuscation methods. One of the obfuscation methods was particularly interesting, because it was not very effective at, well, obfuscation. It consisted of XORing the obfuscated string twice with the same mask, so the plaintext was clearly visible in the disassembly.</p>

<p>Other code similarities were found in a piece of code that computed HMAC of custom HTTP headers or in a piece of code that created scheduled tasks using the <code>ITaskService </code>COM interface. We also found that Download Studio contained a string with the exact command line arguments that we mentioned earlier. These arguments were used to execute application updates silently in the background. By reverse engineering Download Studio, we also found that the application updates are supposed to be executed from a temporary directory the name of which can be described by the regular expression <code>ds-\d{7}\.tmp</code>, which further matched our metadata from detections of the fake installer.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EYMmgDsZBnHuIzdKo7GQt5DdYt6l7syDb4q3c1qFhXzhW4qMCp8SuY2yl0csbOzTBRbt-0p5zDqgY5X8BM4SdnQN1b1nSG7neF4-80rOm2-x9HK7ci-S7XagvX8tXUcUJQjwcmb-" alt=""><figcaption>Disassembled snippet of Download Studio, showing the code responsible for execution of automatic updates.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point, it seemed almost certain that the backdoor was distributed through the automatic updates of Download Studio. However, we wanted to be absolutely sure that this was the case, so we monitored the updates and logged the filename and hash of each observed update. This gave us the following list:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>SHA-256</td><td>filename</td></tr><tr><td><code>16d0559067f3cc0ab19e22b935ac90d44897f09f3426f858498dfd7e667c4bda</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>1d77fdc7f1b1efc8bdb0938cacc713baa70a2549412ce0be18adf2ebd133cb70</code></td><td><code>updater-full.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>333dd34d3efc4ded71b36f5fc38bce67de71f80b7fab43358a36e8ba7d4df0f0</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>5822d2b9717cc2a87ba54173587a3808e17f5961f42f5b1702c4a75950ecd4f6</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>6754c5e7d3c03f4e2bf29b013b1a0d532b7f4e8e145da82e6973376785938f65</code></td><td><code>DS-updater-1.8.0.0-full.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>9c112b452ce839536a5cd4a3d8f4999adcb03dc3af5cbd86ca3a477c5b75127b</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b1acc87c7b010f4aafbe03cd70a6452679de07ef31bc2d5701de63d573654615</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b3359c92cd87bd39ecbf8159666f2c7e123903751654bb8aefd714e23f8e7f7f</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>b4039b6a15af681d7c02d1ff798f41023a378668b32132761c8cdffd648a5a5d</code></td><td><code>DS-updater-1.8.0.0.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>c759c6fffe3d32424f8b29b58ee5cb11d68be5f27e50ba1d1a4755fb56602f7d</code></td><td><code>updater.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>dfb1a78be311216cd0aa5cb78759875cd7a2eeb5cc04a8abc38ba340145f72b9</code></td><td><code>MBSetup.exe</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>f2caa14fd11685ba28068ea79e58bf0b140379b65921896e227a0c7db30a0f2c</code></td><td><code>MBSetup.exe</code></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Just based on the filenames alone, the last two entries immediately stand out. Indeed, while all the previous entries correspond to legitimate updates of Download Studio, the last two hashes are the fake Malwarebytes installers that we have been investigating. They were executed in the same way as all the other automatic updates, silently in the background and without the users’ awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that someone tried to infect all users of Download Studio with the FakeMBAM backdoor. While we do not know precisely what happened behind the scenes, there are three possible scenarios that come to mind. The first one would be that the developers of Download Studio wished to “monetize” their large install base in a very unethical way. Code reuse between Download Studio and the FakeMBAM backdoor would suggest that this could be the case. Another explanation is that the backdoor was spread by a group of rogue employees who acted without the knowledge of the rest of the company. Finally, it is also possible that some unknown attacker hacked Download Studio and carried out a successful supply chain attack.</p>



<p>We were looking for some answers and so we reached out to the developers of Download Studio, asking about the backdoor. They claimed that they detected a security incident on their continuous integration server in August 2020 and that they have since thoroughly investigated this incident and put additional security measures in place. They did not respond to our additional inquiries about how many of their users could be impacted by this incident and if they notified the impacted users.</p>



<h3>Adblockers</h3>



<p>Download Studio was not the only software that distributed the FakeMBAM backdoor. We also found three adblockers whose automatic updates were abused in the same fashion. These adblockers are NetShield Kit (<code>netshieldkit[.]com</code>), My AdBlock (<code>myadblock[.]com</code>) and …</p></div></article></div>

<h2 id="flyover-country">Flyover Country</h2>

<p>When I was younger and my family finally made it <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2014/05/upward-immigrant-toy-mobility-in-the-wild-1990s/">to the American middle class</a>, we went on vacations to Europe. Plane travel was a lot more boring in the days before cell phones, and I would spend a significant amount of any given flight tracking the progress of the tiny plane icon on the flickering screen. When Godthab, Greenland, and then the tiny dot labeled Reykjavik appeared on the legend, I knew we were close to our destination across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>For most traveling Americans, until very recently, Iceland was no more than a flyover destination. But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932011_Icelandic_financial_crisis">2008 financial crisis</a>, the eruption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">Eyjafjallajökull</a>, and the filming of Game of Thrones <a href="http://icelandmag.visir.is/article/thingvellir-featured-first-episode-season-4-game-thrones">there</a>, combined with aggressive marketing and low pricing by Iceland’s two airlines have drastically improved Iceland’s standing on the map.</p>

<p>Today, if you talk to any pour-over coffee drinker living within driving distance of an Ikea, there’s a seventy-six bajillion percent chance they’ve been. Since over <a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/10/18/13261804/iceland-tourism-on-the-rise">1.5 million tourists hit Iceland last year</a> it really seems like everyone I know has either been, or is headed north.</p>

<p>In spite of all that, Iceland is still not a country Americans really pay attention to. I mean, we don’t care about most things that aren’t Kardashian, but Iceland, nestled way up against the Arctic Circle with a population smaller than Cleveland, can be easy to overlook.  As such, I had no preconceived notions going in. But, almost immediately I was won over.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-iceland-heres-some-júníus-meyvant">Welcome to Iceland. Here’s some Júníus Meyvant</h2>

<p>What amazed me the most was that there is a USB charging port right next to the TV screen of my Icelandair flight. I’ve flown an average amount, and nowhere yet have I seen this feature in economy class on American planes.</p>

<p>At first glance, this, seems like a totally banal yuppie thing to get excited about. But if you are flying with a smartphone, it’s a HUGE relief not to have to worry about charging in the airport where you land, saving battery, and generally running around like crazy on what should be your vacation or business trip. You just plug in, and you’re ready to go. It’s a really small thing that makes a huge difference in peace of mind for travelers.</p>

<p>As we boarded, Icelandair also played <a href="https://soundcloud.com/recordrecords/junius-meyvant-neon-experience-1">soft mood music</a> from a <a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/icelandair">Spotify playlist</a>. To someone who is used to traveling within the American flight culture, where you’re lucky if the flight attendants throwing $14 bags of peanuts at you hit in the general vicinity of your torso, it was all very new. And, of course, you could track the flight path on your phone free of charge.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/flightrack.PNG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>It so happened that we went to Iceland because Mr. B was invited to a bachelor party there.  In my day, these parties were held at local dive bars where the floor was more Miller Lite than laminate, but that was before Instagram. I decided to tag along for a couple days before the party, because Iceland was so close, and because it’s been a while since I’ve travelled further than the distance between the crib and the couch.</p>

<p>We got in at six in the morning, but even in my red-eyed haze, I could see just how pristine everything at Keflavík Airport was. My freshly-charged phone immediately connected to Iceland’s Vodafone network without a glitch.  “We’re here. Everything is clean and smells like Ikea,” I texted my mom.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/airport.png" width="400"></p>

<p>I had already booked a ticket on <a href="https://www.re.is/flybus/">Flybus</a>, which goes from Keflavík to Reykjavik, online, so all we had to do was get on and wait. I’ve never been brave enough to take public transportation from the airport anywhere I’ve been, including even Israel, where I speak the language, but the website made it so easy. The bus, like the plane, had Wi-Fi, a feature we’d see being offered again and again on buses, in cafes, restaurants, and bookstores, like a lure to trap urban Americans wearing plaid button-downs.</p>

<h2 id="iceland-is-for-humans">Iceland is for humans</h2>

<p>From the get-go, there were a lot of things in Iceland that seemed like they were out of a fairy tale about what an ideal human life should look like, at least from the perspective of someone living in the United States.</p>

<p>For example, on our first day, our guide from <a href="http://www.iheartreykjavik.net/">I Heart Reykjavik</a>, took us on a walk through Reykjavik, stopping at a small building that looked like something out of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. “That’s the prime minister’s office,” she told us. “No guards, nothing. He just goes about his work here.” We walked on, towards another two-story building that looked like an office for a small-to-medium business.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/Althingi.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>It was the national Parliament, the Alþingi. “It’s made up of 48% women,” our guide said.  “We’re just short of 50%,” she continued ruefully. I have to admit, I had a sharp intake of breath. It sounded like an impossible miracle. But in Iceland, equality, and more importantly, humanity, shows itself in lots of different ways.</p>

<p>There is the USB charger so you don’t have to coddle your smartphone like an animal.  In the big picture, there is <a href="https://grapevine.is/mag/articles/2017/05/05/poll-most-icelanders-support-equal-pay-law/">gender equality</a>. Not only do women make up a large percentage of the workforce, but childcare is heavily subsidized, costing something like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/28/iceland-women-feminist-paradise-gender-gap-pay">$180 a month per child</a> for eight hours of childcare, including food. Mr. B and I personally pay $800/month, and I know our daycare is on the cheaper end.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/woke.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>There is also a large <a href="https://grapevine.is/news/2017/05/03/only-3400-unemployed-in-iceland/">social safety net</a>, healthcare, and all the goodies that make Scandinavia – Scandinavia.</p>

<p>Additionally, I felt more like a treasured guest than a potential criminal when passing through Icelandic customs, more than I can say for my trip back to the country where I’m actually a citizen.</p>

<p>But there is a lot of humanity in the small things, too. For example, the tap water is not only potable, but delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/water.jpeg" width="400"></p>

<p>When we went to buy a bottle of water at the supermarket, the clerk looked at us like we were crazy. “You know it’s the same thing in the tap,” she said, motioning for us to put the bottle back. The shower water smells like sulfur, because all of Iceland gets its cold water from a glacier, and hot water from <a href="http://wakeupreykjavik.com/the-icelandic-water/">geothermal heating.</a></p>

<p>Then, there’s the matter of the prisons. The <a href="http://www.icenews.is/2016/05/26/old-prison-in-reykjavik-center-gets-a-new-role/#axzz4gOqBvd8b">old town prison in Reykjavik</a>, which had no wire fence around it, or even bars on the windows, grew too small (it can only house 16 prisoners) and is being reconsidered for repurpose as a cultural center.  The current prison population of Iceland is <a href="http://www.icenews.is/2016/05/26/old-prison-in-reykjavik-center-gets-a-new-role/#axzz4gOqBvd8b">153</a>, or less than one tenth of one percent of the population.</p>

<p>Oh, and everyone speaks nearly perfect English.</p>

<p>It seems very, very hard to find anything wrong with Iceland. Until you get to the financial crisis of 2008, when the three largest banks folded, the currency plummeted, and unparalleled levels of corruption were exposed in the government, leading to massive unemployment and genuine fear and panic.</p>

<p>But even as large and traumatic as that <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/iceland-financial-crisis-bankruptcy-and-economy-3306347">devastating moment of extremely poor judgement for the country</a>, was, Iceland now seems to have passed it, i<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-35485876">f not with flying colors</a>, at least with more wisdom and grace than the U.S. could muster up during its own fall.  It’s true that the krona has fallen and Iceland experienced a brain drain after the crisis. But it’s also true that a restructuring of the economy has led to a significant decrease in unemployment. The bankers that caused the 2008 financial crisis <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-03-31/welcome-to-iceland-where-bad-bankers-go-to-prison">are also in prison</a>, where they “spend their days doing laundry, working out in the jailhouse gym, and browsing the Internet.” “Sometimes they go horseback riding,” our guide said.</p>

<p>The economy has been on the upswing since 2011, particularly with a lot of strength in the tourism sector, which the Icelandic government is heavily pushing - probably the reason all my friends have known about it. The low cost of the airfare to Iceland relative to Europe or even the West Coast in America, thanks to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/03/business/filling-a-trans-atlantic-air-niche.html?pagewanted=all">hub and spoke model</a> (Iceland is a huge place for flights from Europe and the United States to connect, thus maximizing capacity and optimizing costs for travelers), is huge.</p>

<h2 id="from-lice-to-nice">From lice to nice</h2>

<p>How did Iceland get to this point?  Originally settled in the 10th century by Vikings (and any <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/why-people-in-iceland-look-just-like-us-1.1104676">Irish slaves</a> they picked up on the way), the island was not a very hospitable place.  When the settlers first came, there were almost no native animal species, so they had to bring by boat all the livestock they could to survive. There were also few trees, meaning most houses were made of mud and turf. Life was simply miserable for the first thousand years of Iceland’s existence.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/thingvallir.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>Also, the weather in Iceland is terrible. There are two seasons: rain, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laki">lava</a>. Exposed to both the Arctic wind and laid bare to all the vagaries of the Atlantic Ocean, it rains at least a little every day, in spurts. It was sunny for maybe 15 minutes that I was there. On a particularly windy day, we went <a href="http://eldhestar.is/">riding</a> on the <a href="http://www.visiticeland.com/things-to-do/activities/the-icelandic-horse">small, sturdy horses</a> that are descendants of the original horses the Vikings brought over (no imports are allowed to keep the purity of the breed), and all I could think about, instead of focusing on the beautiful, broody landscape of Hveragerði was about how many Vikings died of pneumonia and ear infections.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/us.JPG" alt="viking"></p>

<p>Things got marginally better over the centuries with more established trade routes, but as late as the the 1800s, men were climbing vertical cliffs plunging to the sea to steal sea bird eggs from ledges. Without these natural “pantries”, a large amount of Icelanders would likely have starved. If you weren’t killed by hunger, the climate, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Abductions">random Turkish raiding parties</a>,  there were always the eagles, one of the only native bird species to grace the island.</p>

<p>The economy really kicked into gear when exposed to the economic crosswinds of World War II, and, of course the British and the Americans. Once the economy took off, it’s been going. Iceland is now diversified away …</p></article></div></div>

<li><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-threat-modeling-machine-learning/">Attacks</a>: Some of the attacks I want to investigate, learn about, and try out</li>
</ul>
<p>A few weeks ago while preparing demos for my GrayHat 2020 - Red Team Village presentation I ran across “Image Scaling Attacks” in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-quiring.pdf">Adversarial Preprocessing: Understanding and Preventing Image-Scaling Attacks in Machine Learning</a> by Erwin Quiring, et al.</p>
<p>I thought that was so cool!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-image-scaling-attack">What is an image scaling attack?</h2>
<p>The basic idea is to hide a smaller image inside a larger image (it should be about 5-10x the size). The attack is easy to explain actually:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker crafts a malicious input image by hiding the desired target image inside a benign image</li>
<li>The image is loaded by the server</li>
<li>Pre-processing resizes the image</li>
<li>The server acts and makes decision based on a different image then intended</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal was to hide a husky image inside another image:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>Here are the two images I used - before and after the modification:
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>If you look closely, you can see that the second image does have some strange dots all around. But this is not noticable when viewed in smaller version.</p>
<p>You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/EQuiw/2019-scalingattack">Github</a>. I used Google Colab to run it, and there were some errors initialy but it worked - let me know if interested and I can clean up and share the Notebook also.</p>
<h2 id="rescaling-and-magic-happens">Rescaling and magic happens!</h2>
<p>Now, look what happens when the image is loaded and resized with <code>OpenCV</code> using default settings:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>On the left you can see the original sized image, and on the left the same image downsized to 128x128 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>That’s amazing!</strong></p>
<p>The downsized image is an entirely different picture now! Of course I picked a husky, since I wanted to attack “Husky AI” and find another bypass.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>This can have a set of implications:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Training process:</strong> Images that poisen the training data (as pre-processing rescales images)</li>
<li><strong>Model queries:</strong> The model might predict on a different image than the one the user uploaded</li>
<li><strong>Non ML related attacks:</strong> This can also be an issue in other, non machine learning areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess security never gets boring, there is always something new to learn.</p>
<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>Turns out that Husky AI uses PIL and that was not vulnerable to this attack by default.</p>
<p>I got lucky, because initially Husky AI did use <code>OpenCV</code> and it’s default settings to resize images. But for some reason I changed that early on (not knowing it would also mitigate this attack).</p>
<p>If you use <code>OpenCV</code> the issue can be fixed by using the <code>interpolation</code> argument when calling the <code>resize</code> API to not have it use the default.</p>
<p>Hope that was useful and interesting.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Johann.</p>

<p>Firearms (guns) are one of the hot button issues in the United States and globally. I’m sure it is understandable why — pull the trigger and something dies. Killing is the primary purpose of a firearm. Naturally, this leads many to be fearful of firearms, but should people be fearful?</p>
<p>When I started writing this, I wanted to answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Are firearms inherently unsafe?</p>
<p>Should firearms be banned, as many believe?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s quite ambitious. One may believe you can just find an answer on a website / paper somewhere or is obvious. Unfortunately, the reality is far more complicated and has turned this into my longest article to date.</p>
<p>It’s been said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns don’t kill people, people kill people. <em>– unknown</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many agree and many others strongly disagree. That divisiveness has made firearms a political issue, leading to a plethora of bias studies, inaccurate analysis, and more. Thus, to answer these questions I had to go through the data myself; I pulled <a href="#Data_Tooling">data from the CDC, FBI, RAND, Census and others</a> and completed my own analysis.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Due to the nature of this analysis, it is important to highlight some items upfront.</p>
<p>1. The United States is often the focus throughout the analysis. This is because the United States has an abundance of firearms, a relatively uniform society and the most available &amp; accurate records.</p>
<p>2. This analysis focuses on general trends. Specific situations vary wildly, even in the same region: country, state, county, city, and neighborhood situations vary. As such, I caution making detailed / specific inference, beyond what the data explicitly shows (in the general case).</p>
<p>3. Some important data is lacking, such as socioeconomic status associated with crimes. This makes it very difficult to isolate confounding factors and leads to confusion / lack of definitive answer(s).</p>
<p>The goal of this analysis was to analyze available (and unbiased) data as in-depth as enabled, with no particular outcome in mind. <em>If new data comes in that materially changes what can be inferred, I’ll attempt to update the analysis.</em> With that in mind, I want to highlight that I dive into demographic information and I found some surprises. Politics seems to stifle this topic and in fact the truth. Instead I went to the data, I hope you can find it as interesting as I do.</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is not for all men, but only for those who seek it.<br>
– Ayn Rand</p></blockquote>
<p>If anything in this analysis was missed,<strong> please feel free to reach out or leave comments.</strong></p>


<p>Globally, firearms are highly controlled, particularly in the Europe and Asia. In contrast, the United States has more firearms held by it’s citizens than the rest of the world combined.<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Estimated-of-Firearm-Allocation-by-Country-768x477.png 768w"></a>The real question — do the number of firearms really matter? From the graph above, it’s clear China, Russia and Iran have a high number of military firearms when compared civilian held firearms (and I suspect most civilian held firearms are former military, in countries such as China, Russia ,Iran, India, etc). In contrast, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free world</a>” has an order of magnitude more civilian firearms, when compared to military firearms.</p>
<p>Clearly, what matters to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second world</a>” is having a large military arsenal, when compared to civilian held firearms.</p>
<p>It can be argued an unarmed society allows the military to impose their will, allowing countries to maintain the status quo and avoiding violent revolutions overthrowing the government.</p>
<h2><span id="Homicides_Firearms_Globally"></span>Homicides &amp; Firearms Globally<span></span></h2>
<p>In the “free world,” the main concern surrounding firearms are homicides &amp; suicides, with homicides being the most concerning. Below is a comparison of homicides by firearm deaths per 100,000 people across the globe.</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" alt="" width="1228" height="677" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2.png 1228w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-300x165.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-1024x565.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Homicide-Firearm-Deaths-per-100k-Inhabitants2-768x423.png 768w"></a>When we compare the world, a few things become clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>The America’s, Caribbean and Africa have a much higher firearm homicide rate</li>
<li>The United States has the highest firearm homicide rate of a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first world</a>” country</li>
<li>Europe has the lowest firearm homicide rate globally</li>
</ol>
<p>What’s not clear, is whether or not firearms are really leading the increased firearm homicide rate.</p>
<p>Are homicides just naturally higher in these regions?</p>
<h2><span id="Firearm_Death_Rate_per_Firearm"></span>Firearm Death Rate per Firearm<span></span></h2>
<p>Below is an argument from the Amnesty International’s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>governments [with] poor regulation of the possession and use of <strong>guns lead to violence</strong> and that they must tackle this now through strict controls on guns and effective interventions in communities suffering high levels of gun violence.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/arms-control/gun-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amnesty International</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The key statement is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guns lead to violence</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement above implies a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gun volume and violence are correlated</li>
<li>As the number of guns increase, violence increases</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few ways to invalidate / validate this statement. The clearest method is to simply compare firearm deaths per firearm. If firearms lead to more violence, we should see the ratio of firearm deaths to firearms (firearm deaths / firearms) staying constant (or growing at a constant rate). This ratio should stay or grow at a constant rate because as the firearm count increases, the firearm homicides should increase (keeping the ratio constant). We could also assume a direct correlation if “guns lead to violence” as it would probably occur at some constant rate.</p>
<p>Below you can see the comparison between firearm deaths and firearms:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png" alt="" width="1313" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png 1313w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-300x157.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-768x402.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5.png 1313w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-300x157.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-1024x536.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearm-Deaths-Per-Firearm-by-Country5-768x402.png 768w"></a>As seen in the chart, the Caribbean, South America, Africa have a high number of firearm deaths per firearm, Columbia having one death per five hundred firearms. In contrast, “First World” (Europe and the United States) has a much lower number of fatalities per firearm, the United States having only one death per ten thousand firearms.</p>

<p>For further evidence firearms aren’t correlated with violence, it’s possible to directly compare the number of firearms vs homicides:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" alt="" width="1107" height="687" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5.png 1107w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-300x186.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-1024x635.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Firearms-vs.-Homicides-per-100k-Inhabitants5-768x477.png 768w"></a>Across the bottom of the chart you can see all the countries with high homicide rates. The United States stands out clearly, if firearms were correlated with homicides we’d expect the U.S. to have many more homicides than it currently does. It does not appear more firearms are correlated with more homicides, in fact the trend line shows the opposite to be true (more firearms are correlated to less homicides).</p>
<p>For a final validation, we can compare firearms against homicides and firearm homicides against total homicides. Both should have a similar growth rate, if there was a correlation.</p>

<p>It’s important to note the graph is a logarithmic comparison for homicides and homicides by firearm (firearms per 100k Inhabitants are not logarithmic). The trend line comparison of Total Homicides and Homicides by Firearm is linear, but because the comparison is logarithmic, it appears exponential on the chart.</p>
<p>It is clear as homicides increase, homicides by firearm increase (blue data points). In contrast, when there are more firearms, homicides by firearm remain flat (purple data points), implying more firearms do not cause increase the number of homicides involving a firearm.</p>
<p>Further, you can see the blue star representing the United States homicide rate to homicide firearm deaths is right where it is expected. However, the purple star, representing the United States homicide rate to firearms per 100k inhabitants, is way outside the norm.</p>
<p>To summarize,</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, as the firearm homicide rate increases, the total homicide rate increases; as the prevalence of firearms increase, the homicide rate <span>does not increase</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The United States is clearly the largest holder of firearms in the world, most states have more firearms than entire countries. Fun fact:</p>
<blockquote><p>Texans and the Chinese military have the same number of firearms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, there’s a culture of gun ownership in the United States. When the United States was formed it had just fought a war of independence and regularly combated Native Americans, settling North America by force. Even today, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">United States National Guard</a> is one of the largest militias in the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.<br>
–<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-2/"> Constitution of the United States</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Without diving into politics, the constitution &amp; culture has enabled the United States to be relatively unique. Firearms are regulated, but just barely. Generally, citizens can do everything from carrying a firearms in public to purchasing assault rifles, flamethrowers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miniguns</a>, rocket launcher(s), etc. Often the only requirement is obtaining permit to own weapons, after that you can regularly purchase as many firearms as you’d like.</p>
<p>As seen in the previous section, the United States does have a higher (on average) number of firearm deaths. However, this doesn’t necessarily tell the whole story. In the prior section, we focused on the homicide rate. In the following sections, the focus will expand as uniform data collection, similar social norms and a widespread framework for law makes comparisons much easier.</p>
<p>Some topics we will explore here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suicide vs homicide vs accidental rates</li>
<li>The type of weapons used in homicides</li>
<li>How demographics impact firearm fatalities</li>
<li>How firearm fatalities compare to other fatalities</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Suicides_Homicides_in_the_United_States"></span>Suicides &amp; Homicides in the United States<span></span></h2>
<p>First, it is also important to highlight just how small the number of firearm related homicides really are, when compared to all deaths. On average, the total (suicide, homicide &amp; accidental) number of firearm related fatalities account for about 1.33% of all deaths in the United States (firearm related homicides account for ~0.44% of all deaths) and it varies wildly between states.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important item to discuss is that this is the “<em>firearm fatality rate</em>“, often conflated with the “<em>firearm homicide rate</em>” by political pundits. While all fatalities are unfortunate, most American’s would argue there is a different between <em>suicides</em> and <em>homicides</em>. Some states, such as Washington, support medically assisted suicides (for the terminally ill).</p>

</p>
<p>There’s a popular book called “JavaScript: The Good Parts.” And there’s a common meme around the relative size of that book versus “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIf3EJh.jpg"></p><p>Haskell is in my opinion a far more well designed and coherent language than JavaScript. However, it’s also an old language with some historical baggage. And in many ways it’s a bleeding edge research language that sometimes includes… half-baked features. And due to an inconsistent set of rules around backwards compatibility, it sometimes will break code every six months, and sometimes keep strange decisions around for decades.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>True mastery of Haskell comes down to knowing which things in core libraries should be avoided like the plague.</p><p>* foldl<br>* sum/product<br>* Data.Text.IO<br>* Control.Exception.bracket (use unliftio instead, handles interruptible correctly)</p><p>Just as some examples</p></div>— Michael Snoyman (@snoyberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/1321049221697544193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>After a request and some tongue-in-cheek comments in that thread, I decided a longer form blog post was in order. I’m going to start off by expanding on the four examples I gave in that tweet. But there are many, many more examples out there. If there’s more interest in seeing a continuation of this series, please let me know. And if you have pet peeves you’d like me to address, input will be very welcome.</p>
<h2>What is a “bad part”</h2>
<p>Very rarely is there such a thing as a language feature, function, type, or library that is so egregiously bad that it should never, ever be used. Null is of course the billion dollar mistake, but it’s still incredibly useful in some cases. So when I say that something is a “bad part” of Haskell, I mean something along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rarely-useful feature has been promoted to a position of prominence</li>
<li>A function has major downsides that are not documented</li>
<li>There’s an unexpected performance implication</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a large tendency in the Haskell community to be overly literal in responding to blog posts. Feel free to do that to your heart’s content. But this caveat serves as a word of warning: I’m not going to caveat each one of these with an explanation of “yes, but there’s this one corner case where it’s actually useful.”</p>
<h2>Why attack Haskell?</h2>
<p>Since I’m a Haskeller and advocate of the language, you may be wondering: why am I attacking Haskell? I don’t see this as an attack. I <em>do</em> wish we could fix these issues, and I think it’s a fair thing to say that the problems I’m listing are warts on the language. But every language has warts. I’m writing this because I’ve seen these kinds of things break real world projects. I’ve seen these failures manifest at runtime, defeating yet again the false claim that “if it compiles it works.” I’ve seen these become nefarious time bombs that disincentivize people from ever working with Haskell in the future.</p>
<p>I hope by calling these out publicly, I can help raise awareness of these problems. And then, either we can fix the problems at their source or, more likely, get more widespread awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>Also, because it feels appropriate, I’m going to take a more jovial tone below. I personally find it easier to beat up on a language I love like that.</p>
<h2>foldl</h2>
<p>Duncan Coutts <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2014/04/fixing-foldl/">already did this one</a>. <code>foldl</code> is broken. It’s a bad function. Left folds are supposed to be strict, not lazy. End of story. Goodbye. Too many space leaks have been caused by this function. We should gut it out entirely.</p>
<p>But wait! A lazy left fold makes perfect sense for a <code>Vector</code>! Yeah, no one ever meant that. And the problem isn’t the fact that this function exists. It’s the <strong>name</strong>. It has taken the hallowed spot of the One True Left Fold. I’m sorry, the One True Left Fold is strict.</p>
<p>Also, side note: we can’t raise linked lists to a position of supreme power within our ecosystem and then pretend like we actually care about vectors. We don’t, we just pay lip service to them. Until we fix the wart which is overuse of lists, <code>foldl</code> is only ever used on lists.</p>
<p>OK, back to this bad left fold. This is all made worse by the fact that the true left fold, <code>foldl'</code>, is not even exported by the <code>Prelude</code>. We Haskellers are a lazy bunch. And if you make me type in <code>import Data.List (foldl')</code>, I just won’t. I’d rather have a space leak than waste precious time typing in those characters.</p>
<p>Alright, so what should you do? Use an alternative prelude that doesn’t export a bad function, and does export a good function. If you really, really want a lazy left fold: add a comment, or use a function named <code>foldlButLazyIReallyMeanIt</code>. Otherwise I’m going to fix your code during my code review.</p>
<h2>sum/product</h2>
<p>The <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> functions are implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>. Well, actually <code>foldMap</code>, but list’s <code>foldMap</code> is implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>, and lists are the only data structure that exist in Haskell. “Oh, but <code>foldr</code> is the good function, right?” Only if you’re folding a function which is lazy in its second argument. <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are both strict in both of their arguments.</p>
<p>If you’re not aware of that terminology: “strict in both arguments” means “in order to evaluate the result of this function/operator, I need to evaluate both of its arguments.” I can’t evaluate <code>x + y</code> without knowing what <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are. On the other hand, <code>:</code> (list cons) is lazy in its second argument. Evaluating <code>x : y</code> doesn’t require evaluating <code>y</code> (or, for that matter, <code>x</code>). (For more information, see <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/all-about-strictness/">all about strictness</a>.)</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say. “What if I have a custom data type with a custom typeclass instance of <code>Num</code> that has a custom <code>+</code> and/or <code>*</code> that is in fact lazy in the second argument! Then <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> are perfect as they are!”</p>
<p>That’s true. Now go off and write your own <code>lazySum</code> and <code>lazyProduct</code>. 99 times out of 100, or more likely 999,999 times out of 1,000,000, we want the fully strict version.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t matter, GHC will optimize this away.” Maybe. Maybe not. Stop relying on GHC’s optimizer to convert horribly inefficient code into not efficient code. (But I digress, we’ll talk about why the <code>vector</code> package is bad another time.)</p>
<h2>Data.Text.IO</h2>
<p>I’ve already covered this one once before when I told everyone to <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/12/beware-of-readfile">beware of <code>readFile</code></a>. In that blog post, I talk about a bunch of <code>String</code> based I/O functions, especially the titular <code>readFile</code>, which is obnoxiously exported by <code>Prelude</code>. Those are bad, and I’ll reiterate why in a second. But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is arguably far worse. The reason is that there’s pretty good awareness in the community that <code>String</code>-based I/O is bad. Even though the <code>String</code> part is the least of our worries, it does a good job of scaring away the uninitiated.</p>
<p>But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. We’re all told by people who think they can tell people how to write their Haskell code (<em>cough</em> me <em>cough</em>) that we should exorcise <code>String</code> from our codebases and replace it in all cases with <code>Text</code>. Attacking the <code>Text</code> type is a topic for another time. But the problem is that by cloaking itself in the warm embrace of <code>Text</code>, this module claims more legitimacy than it deserves.</p>
<p>The only module worse in this regard is <code>Data.Text.Lazy.IO</code>, which should be buried even deeper.</p>
<p>OK, what exactly am I on about? Locale sensitive file decoding. It’s possible that this has been the number one example of a Haskell bug in the wild I’ve encountered in my entire career. Not the spooky memory leak. Partial functions like <code>head</code> randomly throwing exceptions are up there, but don’t quite rise to prominence.</p>
<p>You see, when you are dealing with file formats, there is typically an actual, defined format. YAML, XML, JSON, and many others give a lot of information about how to serialize data, including character data, into raw bytes. We want to be consistent. We want to write a file in one run of the program, and have it read in a separate run. We want to write the file on a Windows machine and read it on a Linux machine. Or we want to interact with programs in other languages that read or write data in a consistent format.</p>
<p>Locale sensitive file encoding and decoding laughs in our face. When you use <code>Data.Text.IO.readFile</code>, it plays a mind reading game of trying to deduce from clues you don’t care about which character encoding to use. These days, on the vast majority of systems used by native English speakers, this turns out to be UTF-8. So using <code>readFile</code> and <code>writeFile</code> typically “just works.” Using functions from <code>Data.Text.IO</code> looks safe, and can easily get hidden in a large PR or a library dependency.</p>
<p>That’s when all hell breaks loose. You ship this code. You run it in a Docker container. “Oops, you forgot to set the <code>LANG</code> env var, Imma crash.” But it’s worse than that. Typically things will work well for weeks or months, because it can often be a long time before someone tries to encode a non-ASCII character.</p>
<p>The same kind of thing happens regularly to Stack. Someone adds a new feature that writes and reads a file. The code passes all integration tests. And then someone in Russia with a weird Windows code page set and a Cyrillic character in their name files a bug report 2 years later about how they can’t build anything, and we sheepishly tell them to run <code>chcp 65001</code> or build in <code>c:\</code>.</p>
<p>Friends don’t let friends use <code>Data.Text.IO</code>.</p>
<p>“Oh, but <code>putStrLn</code> is fine!” Yeah, maybe. It’s also potentially slow. And it will throw a runtime exception due to character encoding mismatches. Just use a good logging library. That’s why we have one in <code>rio</code>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Since so many people have asked: instead of <code>readFile</code>, I recommend using <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-16.20/rio-0.1.19.0/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a>, which is available from <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>.</p>
<h2>Control.Exception.bracket</h2>
<p>This is by far the least objectionable of the bad things in this list. I included it because the entire original tweet was inspired by a coworker telling me about a bug he ran into because of this function.</p>
<p>Async exceptions are subtle. Very, very subtle. Like, super duper subtle. I’ve devoted a large percentage to my Haskell teaching career towards them. Async exceptions are a concept that don’t truly exist in most other languages. They require rewiring the way your brain works for …</p></div></div>

<p>Call me arrogant, but I’d rather optimize my indoor environment than try to spend more time in the capricious outdoors. I think it’s defeatism to give up on improving our indoor spaces and resign ourselves to the fickle weather and seasons. </p>
<p>If I was going to create an ideal environment for a human, I think there are several things I would include that we routinely fail to include in our homes and offices.</p>
<h3 id="lighting">Lighting</h3>
<p>Our indoor lighting situation usually sucks. The fact that “natural lighting” is a selling point in real estate shows how terrible a job we are doing in this department. We rely on the sun naturally providing us with sufficient light, and if it’s an overcast day or the days have grown shorter in the winter, then I guess we’re shit out of luck. </p>
<p>Usually, indoor areas are around 50-500 lux. This is hundreds of times dimmer than the sunlight. Clearly, we weren’t designed to thrive in such dim environments, and science does verify a connection between brighter light and alertness. If we don’t want to be sleepy like it’s nighttime, we shouldn’t light our rooms like it’s nighttime. For some, the effects of dim lighting go beyond simple lethargy and, especially in the winter, cause serious mood problems like seasonal affective disorder or the winter blues. This is common, but it’s not necessary. Bright light, particularly blue light, can also generally boost mood and may be a comparable stimulant to caffeine. (Those who are prone to mania should be careful, as intense light can trigger mania or hypomania in those predisposed.) Brighter lighting can also help circadian rhythm issues (which I, for example, have struggled with for years), both by entraining your circadian rhythm so your body better knows when it’s day, and by shortening it if it’s too long. </p>
<p>Lighting isn’t as expensive as it used to be, so we can do better than we have in the past. The cost of electricity for LED lighting is now negligible, and the only real factor is the cost of the bulbs themselves. Reaching for the full 100,000 lux of sunlight would still be prohibitively expensive, but going for at least 10,000 lux is doable with only a few hundred dollars. I won’t go into specifics here, but you can get more information on specific lighting setups <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hC2NFsuf5anuGadFm/how-to-build-a-lumenator">here</a> or <a href="https://meaningness.com/metablog/sad-light-lumens">here</a>. In particular, get bulbs with a color temperature close to sunlight (5600k), but make sure the bulbs have a <span>good<span>good means 90+</span></span> Color Rendering Index (CRI), otherwise the light will feel harsh.</p>
<p>I recommend putting any bright lighting you buy for your home on electrical timers so you don’t accidentally leave them on during the evening and screw up your sleep. You may also want to set your phone/computer brightness on a timer, if you can. The goal is to mimic the natural day/night cycle of our evolutionary environment, but without all the pesky volatility of nature. You can get programs like f.lux too, which reduce the amount of blue light emitted by your device in the evening, but in my experience this isn’t good enough and reducing the actual brightness of the device at night is also important.</p>
<p>“But what about vitamin D? Just go outside!” This is terrible advice, and I hear it too often. Sunlight is a powerful carcinogen, and vitamin D supplements are not, and they’re cheap. </p>
<h3 id="carbon-dioxide">Carbon dioxide</h3>
<p>Carbon MON-oxide is the deadly one you probably already have a monitor for in your house. Carbon DI-oxide is the feeble cousin of carbon monoxide, but it still has a negative effect on human health: <span>high (but common)<span>1,000 ppm or higher</span></span> levels impairs our ability to think. Just what you don’t want in an office. High levels may also have a negative long-term impact in other areas of our health. </p>
<p>Hold your breath. When it sucks and you decide to start breathing again, it’s carbon dioxide buildup, not lack of oxygen, causing you to feel panic and the need to breath. Carbon dioxide is a toxin. And we breath it out into poorly ventilated rooms, where the levels can rise to double or triple what they are <span>outdoors<span>around 400 ppm</span></span>.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown significant (temporary) cognitive impairments due to carbon dioxide levels over 1,000 ppm, but such levels are <span>common<span>I recently bought a carbon dioxide meter and found such levels in my home.</span></span> in poorly ventilated shared spaces. Fortunately, the solution is simple: open a window. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work when it’s raining, or when it’s too hot outside, or when it’s too cold outside… In particular, I have to contend with Canadian winters, which means opening the window is a valid strategy for a minority of the year unless I buy an expensive heat recovery ventilator. I don’t have a good solution for mitigating carbon dioxide buildup in the winter. Let me know if you do.</p>
<p>And, by the way, plants won’t work. They won’t suck up nearly enough carbon dioxide. You would need hundreds of plants per person, or roughly a dozen full-size trees per person, to offset the carbon dioxide exhaled by humans in a room.</p>
<p>A fun fact: if we don’t stop pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, then in about a century, carbon dioxide <em>outdoors</em> may reach cognitively impairing levels. Then what do we do? </p>
<h3 id="temperature-and-humidity">Temperature and Humidity</h3>
<p>High/low humidity and high/low temperature both lead to discomfort and lower scores on concentration measures. People generally have temperature under control, or at least it’s something they’re aware of. Humidity is less common to measure, but a $10 hygrometer should help you get your indoor space to the ideal 30-50% humidity range if it isn’t already. Air conditioners also tend to reduce humidity as well as temperature, so air-condition in the summer and use a humidifier in the winter.</p>
<p>At night, drop the temperature a few degrees if you can; It’s easier to sleep in a cool room. I wonder how many hours of sleep have been reclaimed already due to the advent of smart thermostats.</p>
<h3 id="background-noise">Background Noise</h3>
<p>I imagine this factor is more subjective than the others, but too loud is distracting, even aggrivating; too quiet makes your sniffles and sighs painfully audible to others, and so is distracting. Uneven background noise like traffic is worse than the uniform background noise of white noise or trickling water. Bad background noise leads to poorer cognition and focus.</p>
<p>It’s easy to be bothered by noise and not realize it until the noise stops and a wave of relief finally makes you aware of how annoyed you were by the sound. Noise issues are happily easy to control: earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones will generally do the trick. It would be utopic to eliminate bothersome noise from the environment altogether, but it’s not necessary. </p>
<h3 id="segregation-of-activities">Segregation of Activities</h3>
<p>A heroin addict who normally takes their dose in their car decides one day to inject in their bathroom. They die of an overdose, even though they took the same amount they normally do. Why? Our brains maintain associations with different environments. If you normally inject heroin when you get in your car, then your body starts to prepare you for the drug as soon as you get in the car. Drug tolerance, then, is partly environmental. (This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1196296/">actually happened</a> and happens regularly.) Your mind and body are affected by your environment due to Pavlovian conditioning. When the bell rings, the dog salivates. When the lunch bell rings, so do you. </p>
<p>One common piece of advice given by doctors to insomniacs is to only use your bed for sleeping and for sex, and it’s good advice. If you use your bed for reading, studying, and watching TV, then your mind will not form a strong association between the bed and sleep, and you will have a harder time falling asleep. </p>
<p>Likewise, if you do all your slacking off at the same desk you do your work at, you will probably have a harder time focusing. Even having your smartphone within your field of view while you work has been shown to reduce focus. So it wouldn’t hurt to have different areas for work and play, and to not eat at your desk. (And even different user accounts on your computer for work and non-work, if you don’t find that idea to be a pain in the ass like I do.)</p>
<p>We also form associations not just with space, but with time. Hence another piece of common sleep hygeine advice: go to sleep at the same time every night. Your body will learn to expect sleep at that time. Likewise, people who eat at the same time every day eat with their bodies prepared to receive food, and so are less likely to become obese. Studies have shown this. Unfortunately, setting every aspect of your life to a clock can make you feel like a robot, so I usually don’t tolerate such rigidity in my life. But it’s worth thinking about.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brighter lights for your poor eyes</li>
<li>Better ventilation for your poor lungs</li>
<li>Optimal temperature and humidity for your poor skin</li>
<li>Less distracting background noise for your poor ears</li>
<li>Activity-specific areas for your poor brain</li>
</ul>
<p>I also think the aesthetics of most of our indoor environments could use an upgrade, but I don’t have much to say on the subject besides simply saying so. (Though I would bet: green lush &gt; grey drab.)</p>
<p>We sometimes act like we are just <span>machines<span>caffeine in ⟶ code out</span></span>, but we are not. We’re mushy creatures with delicate bodies and delicate minds, too. And we evolved for one specific environment. There is no guarantee that the indoor environment which is cheapest to produce is going to be just as good for us as a bespoke imitation of our evolutionary environment, and in fact it is not. I think life would be more pleasant if people took these factors more serously when designing indoor environments, and our work would be more efficient and less prone to mistakes.</p>

<p>A recently published book in France warns about how digital devices are seriously affecting the neural development of children and young people.</p>
<p>The text is called <em>The digital cretin factory</em> and it was written by Michel Desmurget, director of research at the French National Institute of Health.</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-54554333.amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, the author of the work, which has become a bestseller in his country, assures that today’s young people are the first generation in history with a lower IQ than the previous one.</p>
<p>“Researchers have observed in many parts of the world that IQ increased from generation to generation.  This was called the ‘Flynn effect’, in reference to the American psychologist who described this phenomenon.  But recently, this trend began to be reversed in several countries ”, says the researcher.</p>
<p>“In those countries, digital natives are the first children to have a lower IQ than their parents.  It is a trend that has been documented in Norway, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, France, etc. ”.</p>
<p>Although the specific factors involved in this phenomenon have not yet been determined, it has been proven that the time a child spends in front of a screen would have an important effect on their IQ.</p>
<p>Thus, according to the author, when the use of television or video games increases, IQ and cognitive development tend to decrease.</p>
<p>This would directly affect the main foundations of our intelligence, such as language, concentration, memory and culture in general, which would end up causing a significant drop in academic performance.</p>
<h2>Why is this happening?</h2>
<p>According to Desmurget, dependence on screens and digital devices is associated with a decrease in the quality and quantity of family interactions, as well as a decrease in the time spent on other activities that can be more enriching.</p>
<p>Sleep disruption, overestimation of attention, intellectual under-stimulation (the brain cannot unfold its full potential) and the adoption of an excessively sedentary lifestyle are also involved.</p>
<p>Michel Desmurget, with studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of California, criticizes the enormous amount of time that today’s children spend in front of digital devices.</p>
<p>“On average, almost three hours a day for 2-year-olds, about five hours for 8-year-olds and more than seven hours for adolescents,” he explains.</p>
<p>“This means that before reaching the age of 18, our children will have spent the equivalent of 30 school years in front of recreational screens or, if you prefer, 16 years of full-time work!  It is simply crazy and irresponsible ”.</p>

<h2><a href="https://chrisseaton.com/">Chris Seaton</a>, 28 October 2020</h2>


</header>

<p>There’s a proposal to add <em>Software Transactional Memory</em>, or <em>STM</em>, to the Ruby programming language. This is part of a wider effort to add better support for concurrency and parallelism in Ruby, and in particular the idea of <em>ractors</em>. A concept has been <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3652">implemented</a> by Koichi Sasada.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/ruby-stm/testBoard.gif" width="50%">
<figcaption>An animation of the algorithm we're going to use as an example of STM - we'll explain this later on</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This article gives some context on what STM is, how you use it, and why you might want to use it. We’ll show an application which is well-suited to STM and we’ll use this to talk about the benefits, issues, and some open questions.</p>

<p>We’ll finish by setting a challenge for STM in Ruby.</p>

<p>I wrote the first half of my PhD on STM, and the second half on Ruby, so I’ve got quite a bit of experience with both and the idea of their combination is very interesting to me.</p>

<h2 id="why-might-we-want-an-stm">Why might we want an STM?</h2>

<p>Let’s say we’re a bank managing many bank accounts. Each account has a total. We get a never-ending stream of requests to move a sum of money <code>m</code> from an account <code>a</code> to account <code>b</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Something not everyone may know about Ruby is that <code>x += y</code> is equivalent to writing <code>t = x; x = t + y</code>. We’ll write that out in full to make that clear to ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>

<p>We’ve got a lot of transfers to run through, so we’ll have multiple threads processing these transfers.</p>

<p>We’ve got a few problems here now. With all these threads running at the same time, what happens if two threads are putting money into your account concurrently?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span>

<span># thread 1                        # thread 2</span>
<span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
  <span># balance = 100</span>
                                  <span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
                                    <span># balance = 100</span>
<span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
  <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
                                  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
                                    <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two transfers have run, but your balance is 110. The other 10 has been lost - this is called a <em>lost update</em>, meaning it’s as if the update was never made.</p>

<p>Also consider what happens if the thread crashes after taking money from <code>a</code> but before putting it into <code>b</code>? The transfer would be applied partially and again we’d lose money.</p>

<p>We need to use some kind of <em>synchronization</em> on our accounts. Ruby has <em>mutual exclusion locks</em> or <em>mutexes</em>, so we can try using those.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Does this work? What if we process a transfer from account 1001 to account 1002 on one thread at the same time as processing a transfer from account 1002 to 1001, so the other way around, at the same time?</p>

<p>The first thread will try to lock 1001 and then 1002. The second thread will try to lock 1002 and then 1001. If the first thread gets as far as locking 1001, and the second as far as locking 1002, then both will be waiting for the opposite lock and will never release the lock they already have. We will be in <em>deadlock</em>.</p>

<p>If we always acquired locks in the same order, by collecting them up first and sorting them, we could fix this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>].</span><span>sort</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>y</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in both transfers account 1001 is locked first and 1002 is locked second. That will work.</p>

<p>We have to make up a somewhat artificial requirement to explain the next issue, but consider if for some good reason we wanted to transfer to one account if we had a lot of money, and a different account if we only had a little money. Maybe if we’re rich this month we donate to charity, otherwise we unfortunately need to save for ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if account balance &gt; 1000
  transfer 10 to charity
else
  transfer 10 to savings
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll talk about accounts <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, now, and a threshold of money <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>It’s starting to get very complicated. And this locks more than it needs to - it locks both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> but then only uses one of them. If you use <code>b</code> in the end, ideally another thread could be serving a transfer to <code>c</code> at the same time, but you’ve locked it and it can’t. Imagine if instead of two potential accounts it was thousands and you had to lock them all. Imagine if you couldn’t work out at all which account you’d be transferring to until you started the transfer - then you’d never be able to process two transfers at the same time.</p>

<p>At this point as well we’re likely to start to make errors trying to do all this locking and ordering of locks and things.</p>

<p>Stepping back and taking it all in, we can draw up some requirements for what we need.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>atomicity</em> - that all writes in the transfer are applied or none are applied</li>
  <li><em>consistency</em> - meaning that our data structures are always valid - the total sum of money never changes</li>
  <li><em>isolation</em> - meaning one transfer does not interfere with another</li>
  <li><em>durability</em> - meaning that when applied the transfer is available to all subsequent transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally a library or the language could do this all for us. We’d like to be able to write almost what we originally wrote, but with just an annotation to make the code inside a block atomic, consistent, isolated, and the result durable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>atomically</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what a <em>transactional</em> memory can let us do. It will automatically monitor what you read and write inside the <code>atomically</code> block, which is a <em>transaction</em>, and will make sure it is either applied fully or not, that the balance of the whole system is always consistent, that transactions do not see the result of each other partially applied, and that writes appear and stay.</p>

<p>It may be implemented using the code we eventually arrived at ourselves, or it could do something else instead. In practice how it is often implemented is that
reads and writes are stored in a log, then at the end the transaction works out if anyone else has written locations that you’ve read. If they have then the values you read are no longer valid, so your transaction <em>conflicts</em> with another, is <em>aborted</em> and retries, reading the locations again. When it eventually does not conflict with any other transactions it is <em>committed</em> and succeeds. This means you don’t need to lock everything up-front, which means you avoid the problem of what happens if you may potentially need every account. Locking everything up-front is called <em>pessimistic locking</em>. We’re moving to <em>optimistic locking</em></p>

<p>Koichi’s <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> STM for Ruby, in combination with his proposed <em>ractors</em> (similar to <em>actors</em>) would look like this.</p>

<p>He’s using a <code>Ractor</code> but you can think of it as a thread for the purposes of this article. Instead of an array of account balances, we now have an array of <code>TVar</code> objects that contain values. A <code>TVar</code> is a <em>transactional variable</em>. Only these variables are transactional - not any other Ruby value you read or write. His design requires that the <code>TVar</code> objects you’re going to use are passed into the <code>Ractor</code>, due to rules about sharing that aren’t relevant for this article.</p>

<p>This looks good, doesn’t it!</p>

<h2 id="a-more-complex-application">A more complex application</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a larger application, in order to illustrate further and to talk about some issues and open questions. The <a href="https://github.com/chrisseaton/ruby-stm-lee-demo">code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s say it’s our job to lay out the wires on a circuit board. We get a board with <em>pads</em> (connections to components mounted on the board) and a list of <em>routes</em> that we need to draw between these pads. There are a great many pads and routes, there isn’t much space on the tiny board, and another catch is that it’s very expensive to have wires crossing each other. Let’s say it’s exponentially more expensive for more deeply stacked wires.</p>

<p>In this minimal example we we can see two routes, and how they have to cross each other.</p>

<p>This example is a processor module and shows what kind of scale we might want to be working at. This board has many longer routes which are more likely to conflict.</p>

<p>This example is a memory module. It has many shorter routes which we may expect to conflict less.</p>

<p>We’ll use this test board, which is somewhere between all these extremes.</p>

<p>There’s an algorithm to lay each routes, and it actually produces an optimal solution for an individual route, but not for all routes. It’s called <em>Lee’s algorithm</em> and was published back in 1960. We’ll …</p></article></div>

<p>Addressing is a fertile ground for incorrect assumptions, because everyone's used to dealing with addresses and 99% of the time they seem so simple.
Below are some incorrect assumptions I've seen made, or made myself, or had reported to me.
(If you want to look up an address for a UK postcode or vice-versa to confirm what I'm telling you, try the <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/postcode-finder/">Royal Mail Postcode Finder</a>)</p>

<!-- Composition of building numbers -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>An address will start with, or at least include, a building number.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, WC2E 9DD, United Kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there is a building number, it will be all-numeric.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 1A Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</p>

<p>4-5 Bonhill Street, London, EC2A 4BX</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No buildings are numbered zero</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 0 Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, at the very least no buildings have negative numbers</strong></p>

<p>Guy Chisholm provided this counterexample: Minusone Priory Road, Newbury, RG14 7QS</p>

<p>(none of the databases I've checked render this as -1)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We can put those funny numbers into the building name field, as no buildings have both a name and a funny number</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Idas Court, 4-6 Princes Road, Hull, HU5 2RD</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a building name, there won't be a building number (or vice-versa)</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Flat 1.4, Ziggurat Building, 60-66 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8QX, United Kingdom</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building number will only be used once per street</strong></p>

<p>The difference between 50 Ammanford Road, Tycroes, Ammanford, SA18 3QJ and 50 Ammanford Road, Llandybie, Ammanford, SA18 3YF is about 4 miles (<a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=SA18+3QJ+to+SA18+3YF">Google Maps</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's line with a number in an address, it's the building number.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Flat 18, Da Vinci House, 44 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8FH, United Kingdom</p>

<p>You also get suite numbers, floor numbers, unit numbers, and organisations with numbers in their names.</p>

<p>Adrien Piérard contributes an address from Japan with fifteen digits in six separate numbers (five if you count the zip code as a single number). The format is: 980-0804 (zip code), Miyagi-ken (prefecture) Sendai-shi (city) Aoba-ku (ward) Kokubuncho (district) 4-10-20 (sub-district-number block-number lot-number) Sendai (building name) 401 (flat number).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, the first line starting with a number then</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 3 Store, 311-318 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BN</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building will only have one number</strong></p>

<p>Benton Lam offers this address from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - it has both a number on its road (14) and in its group of buildings (3): 15/F, Cityplaza 3, 14 TaiKoo Wan Road, Island East, HKSAR</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The number of buildings is the difference between the highest and lowest building numbers</strong></p>

<p>Tibor Schütz points out building numbers may be skipped - for example, on a street where even-numbered buildings are on one side, odd numbers on the other; multiple buildings sharing the same number (such as where a new house has been built) and buildings with more than one number.</p>

<p>Cyrille Chépélov and Sami Lehtinen tell me in Antibes, France and rural Finland some buildings are numbered based on the distance from the start of the road - such as Longroad 65 for the building 750m from the start of longroad.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If the addresses on the left of the road are even, the addresses on the right must be odd</strong></p>

<p>Cyrille Chépélov points out that in places, <a href="https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=48.857415,2.467167">Boulevard Théophile Sueur, Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France</a> has evens-only on both sides. The two sides are also in different cities and Départements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building name won't also be a number</strong></p>

<p>Ben Tilly reports on Ten Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA - which is not, reportedly, the same as 10 Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, at least you can omit leading zeros</strong></p>

<p>Shaun Crampton reports living at 101 Alma St, Apartment 001, Palo Alto - where apartments 1 and 001 were on different floors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A street with a building A will not also have a building Alpha</strong></p>

<p>Douglas Perreault reports he lived in a block within a condo association; it was a large association, with blocks A through Z then Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Theta. Mail and deliveries were often misrouted from block Alpha to block A and vice-versa. His address at the time was: 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Tampa, FL 33613</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- Composition of street names -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A street name won't include a number</strong></p>

<p>8 Seven Gardens Burgh, WOODBRIDGE, IP13 6SU (pointed out by Raphael Mankin)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but numbers in street names are expressed as words, not digits</strong></p>

<p>Jan Jongboom reports streets can be numbered in the Netherlands - for example, Plein 1944 in Nijmegen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a numbered street and a house number, there will be a separator between them</strong></p>

<p>Another from Jan Jongboom: Gondel 2695, Lelystad, means area Gondel, street 26, number 95</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street names always end in descriptors like 'street', 'avenue', 'drive', 'square', 'hill' or 'view'</strong></p>

<p>They don't always - for example: Piccadilly, London, W1J 9PN</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but when they do have a descriptor there will only be one</strong></p>

<p>A street name can be entirely descriptors: 17 Hill Street, London, W1J 5LJ or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_Road">Avenue Road, Toronto, Ontario</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but when they do have a descriptor it will be at the end</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>OK, but if there's a descriptor it'll be at the start or end of the street name.</strong></p>

<p>Kirk Kerekes spent several years using an address of the form "2 mi N then 3 mi W of Jennings, OK 74038" which regularly got successful deliveries. Mike Riley used to mail the Very Large Array radio telescope at "50 miles (80 km) West of Socorro, New Mexico, USA"</p>

<p>Sam pointed me to <a href="http://www.menomoneefallsnow.com/news/99857214.html">Menomonee Falls</a> where houses are addressed using Milwaukee County's grid system instead of house numbers - giving addresses like N88 W16541 Foobar St.</p>

<p>Andy Monat sent the following address example, from a <a href="http://ciapa.tulane.edu/uploads/1_EE_2012_Acceptance_Packet_INFORMATION-1340749206.pdf">semester abroad program at Tulane University </a>: CIAPA, 50 meters north of the Hypermas/Walmart of Curridabat, San Jose, Costa Rica. Adrien Piérard and Luke Allardyce point out street names are seldom used in Japan - instead, districts and blocks and lot numbers are used (more info on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">Wikipedia entry for the Japanese addressing system</a>).  A <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/592.cfm">2002 World Press Review report</a> gave this sample address: From where the Chinese restaurant used to be, two blocks down, half a block toward the lake, next door to the house where the yellow car is parked, Managua, Nicaragua. Shaun Crampton sent <a href="https://vianica.com/nicaragua/practical-info/14-addresses.html">an article with more details and examples of the Nicaraguan system</a>. Stig Brautaset pointed out <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14806350">a BBC article about post in Kabul</a> gives this example: "Hamid Jaan, behind Darul-Aman palace". Nathan Fellman reports similar addressing is used in Nicaragua and Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Paul Puschmann and Tibor Schütz pointed out the city of <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratestadt">Mannheim in Germany is sometimes called Quadratestadt (City of Squares)</a> as the city centre is arranged in a grid, with blocks assigned a letter (along the north-south axis) and a number (along the east-west axis) then buildings numbered by block number. So an example address at numbers 6 to 13 on block R 5 would be: Institut für Deutsche Sprache, R 5, 6-13, D-68161 Mannheim </p>

<li><p><strong>A road will have a name</strong></p>

<p>Plenty of roads like driveways, onramps and the aisles of carparks don't have names. Some roads in Japan also don't have names, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">the prevalent addressing system works on districts, subdistricts, blocks, lots and lot numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Peter Kenway points out in America some homes are addressed as Rural Routes, where numbers are allocated to boxes on a route covering multiple roads. For example: Box 1234, R.R. 1, Winthrop, ME 04364.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A road will only have one name</strong></p>

<p>Many different roads, from Goswell Road in London to Regent Road in Edinburgh, make up the 410 mile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_road_%28Great_Britain%29">A1</a>. And while there may only be one "1 Goswell Road" and only one "1 Regent Road" there are multiple buildings numbered 1 on the road designated A1.</p>

<p>Roads may also be named in multiple languages. For example, in Ireland roads may be named in both English and Irish</p></li>

<p><span>Written: 28 Oct 2020 by <i>Jeremy Howard</i></span></p><blockquote>
<p><em>Update Oct 20, 2020</em>: NumFOCUS <a href="https://numfocus.org/blog/jeremy-howard-apology">has apologized</a> to me. I accept their apology. I do not accept their assertion that “At the time of the interview, the committee had not determined that there was a violation of the code of conduct, only that there were two complaints filed and being examined.” The email to set up the call said “We would like to schedule a meeting so that we can discuss the results of our investigation with you” - nothing further. During the call, the committee stated the list of violations, and said “that is what the reporters stated, and what we found”. I asked why they didn’t take a statement from me before that finding, and they said “we all watched the video, so we could see for ourselves the violation”. The committee offered in their apology email to me to have a follow-up discussion, and I declined the offer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary: NumFOCUS found I violated their Code of Conduct (CoC) at JupyterCon because my talk was not “kind”, because I said Joel Grus was “wrong” regarding his opinion that Jupyter Notebook is not a good software development environment. Joel (who I greatly respect, and consider an asset to the data science community) was not involved in NumFOCUS’s action, was not told about it, and did not support it. NumFOCUS did not follow their own enforcement procedure and violated their own CoC, left me hanging for over a week not even knowing what I was accused of, and did not give me an opportunity to provide input before concluding their investigation. I repeatedly told their committee that my emotional resilience was low at the moment due to medical issues, which they laughed about and ignored, as I tried (unsuccessfully) to hold back tears. The process has left me shattered, and I won’t be able to accept any speaking requests for the foreseeable future. I support the thoughtful enforcement of Code of Conducts to address sexist, racist, and harassing behavior, but that is not what happened in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In my recent JupyterCon keynote, “I Like Jupyter Notebooks” (re-recording provided at the bottom of this post, if you’re interested in seeing it for yourself), I sought to offer a rebuttal to Joel Grus’ highly influential JupyterCon presentation “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a>”. Joel claimed in his talk that Jupyter is a poor choice for software development and teaching, and I claimed in my talk that it is a good choice. The NumFOCUS committee found me guilty of violating their code of conduct for having not been “kind” in my disagreement with Joel, and for “insulting” him. The specific reasons given were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I said that Joel Grus was “wrong”</li>
<li>I used some of his slides (properly attributed) and a brief clip from one of his videos to explain why I thought he was wrong</li>
<li>That I made “a negative reference” to his prior talk</li>
<li>I was also told that “as a keynote speaker” I would “be held to a higher standard than others” (although this was not communicated to me prior to my talk, nor what that higher standard is)</li>
</ul>
<p>Code of Conducts can be a useful tool, when thoughtfully created and thoughtfully enforced, to address sexism, racism, and harassment, all of which have been problems at tech conferences. Given the <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996">diversity issues in the tech industry</a>, it is important that we continue the work of making conferences more inclusive, particularly to those from marginalized backgrounds. Having a code of conduct with explicit rules against violent threats, unwelcome sexual attention, repeated harassment, sexually explicit pictures, and other harmful behavior is the first step towards addressing and stopping those behaviors. The JupyterCon code provides the following examples of unacceptable behavior, none of which are at all similar to what I did (i.e. saying that someone was wrong on a technical topic, and explaining how and why):</p>
<ul>
<li>Violent threats or violent language directed against another person</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop</li>
</ul>
<p>My experience with the NumFOCUS code of conduct raises a few key issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CoC enforcement process involved conflicting &amp; changing information, no opportunity for me to give input, the stress of a long wait of unknown duration with no information about what I was accused of or what would happen next, and the committee members violated their own CoC during the process</li>
<li>There were two totally different Codes of Conduct with different requirements linked in different places</li>
<li>I was held to a different, undocumented and uncommunicated standard</li>
<li>The existence of, or details about, the CoC were not communicated prior to confirmation of the engagement</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend avoiding requirements of politeness or other forms of “proper” behavior, but should focus on a specific list of unacceptable behaviors. The JupyterCon CoC, however, is nearly entirely a list of “proper” behaviors (such as “Be welcoming”, “Be considerate”, and “Be friendly”) that are vaguely defined</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend using a CoC that focuses on a list of unacceptable behaviors. Both the codes linked to JupyterCon have such a link, and none of the unacceptable behavior examples are in any way related or close to what happened in this case. But NumFOCUS nonetheless found me in violation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would rather not have to write this post at all. However I know that people will ask about why my talk isn’t available on the JupyterCon site, so I felt that I should explain exactly what happened. In particular, I was concerned that if only partial information became available, the anti-CoC crowd might jump on this as an example of problems with codes of conduct more generally, or might point at this as part of “cancel culture” (a concept I vehemently disagree with, since what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”). Finally, I found that being on the “other side” of a code of conduct issue gave me additional insights into the process, and that it’s important that I should share those insights to help the community in the future.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The rest of this post is a fairly detailed account of what happened, for those that are interested.</p>
<h3 id="my-talk-at-jupytercon">My talk at JupyterCon</h3>
<p>I recently gave a talk at <a href="https://jupytercon.com/">JupyterCon</a>. My partner Rachel gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frc7FgheUj4">talk at JupyterCon</a> a couple of years ago, and had a wonderful experience, and I’m a huge fan of Jupyter, so I wanted to support the project. The conference used to be organized by O’Reilly, who have always done a wonderful job of conferences I’ve attended, but this year the conference was instead handled by <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>.</p>
<p>For my talk, I decided to focus on Jupyter as a literate and <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/">exploratory programming environment</a>, using <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>. One challenge, however, is that two years earlier Joel Grus had given a brilliant presentation called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a> which had been so compelling that I have found it nearly impossible to talk about programming in Jupyter without being told “you should watch this talk which explains why programming in Jupyter is a terrible idea”.</p>
<p>Joel opened and closed his presentation with some light-hearted digs at me, since I’d asked him ahead of time <em>not</em> to do such a presentation. So I thought I’d kill two birds with one stone, and take the opportunity to respond directly to him. Not only was his presentation brilliant, but his slides were hilarious, so I decided to directly parody his talk by using (with full credit of course) some of his slides directly. That way people that hadn’t seen his talk could both get to enjoy the fantastic content, and also understand just what I was responding to. For instance, here’s how Joel illustrated the challenge of running cells in the right order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png">
</figure>
<p>I showed that slide, explaining that it’s Joel’s take on the issue, and then followed up with a slide showing how easy it actually is to run all cells in order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png">
</figure>
<p>Every slide included a snippet from Joel’s title slide, which, I explained, showed which slides were directly taken from his presentation. I was careful to ensure I did not modify any of his slides in any way. When first introducing his presentation, I described Joel as “a brilliant communicator, really funny, and wrong”. I didn’t make any other comments about Joel (although, for the record, I think he’s awesome, and highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130">his book</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-code-of-conduct-violation-notice">The Code of Conduct violation notice</h3>
<p>A week later, I received an email telling me that two CoC reports were filed regarding my JupyterCon keynote presentation. I was told that “The Code of Conduct Enforcement Team is meeting tomorrow to review the incident and will be contacting you to inform you of the nature of the report and to understand your perspective”.</p>
<p>The CoC wasn’t mentioned at all until after I’d been invited to speak, had accepted, and had completed the online registration. I had reviewed it at that time, and had been a bit confused. The email I received linked to a <a href="https://jupytercon.com/codeofconduct/">JupyterCon Code of Conduct</a>, but that in turn didn’t provide much detail about what is and isn’t OK, and that in turn linked to a different <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS Code of Conduct</a>. A link was also provided to <a href="https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT">report violations</a>, which also linked to and named the NumFOCUS CoC.</p>
<p>I was concerned that I had done something which might be viewed as a violation, and looked forward to hearing about the nature of the report and having a chance to share my perspective. I was heartened that JupyterCon documented that they follow the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct/response-and-enforcement-events-meetups">NumFOCUS Enforcement Manual</a>. I was also heartened that the manual has a section “Communicate with the Reported Person about the Incident” which says they will “Let the reported person tell someone on the CoC response team their side of the story; the person who receives their side of the story should be prepared to …</p></div></div></div>

It doesn't matter how large your application gets, each page only downloads what it needs, which is actually pretty uncommon in the React ecosystem.</p><p>React apps are typically built two ways: bundle everything into one enormous file (yikes!) or code split into multiple bundles to load on demand. The apps that code split usually send down a very large build manifest, listing every asset you could possibly need. That means as you add files and pages to your site, the footprint of <em>every page</em> grows.</p><p>Remix never loads more code than the page the user is looking at. You can have 10 or 10,000 routes, the footprint for each remains constant. Just because you added some routes to the photo viewer doesn't mean the contact page gets bigger over the network.</p><h3 id="beyond-heavy-javascript-in-the-browser">Beyond heavy JavaScript in the browser</h3><p>Do you ever look at some of the pages on your website and think "why does this need to download any JavaScript at all?". We do too. Go ahead and open the dev tools on this page you're reading right now.</p><p>Yeah, you, open the dev tools.</p><p>That's right, no JavaScript! This is a marketing page with nothing interactive but links. There's no reason to load JavaScript here. You might think "but wouldn't you be able to speed up the transitions if you loaded in a client side router?" Great question. The answer is, not always.</p><p>Open the devtools again. You'll note in the network tab that we've already loaded in the "/buy" page with a link response header. When you click "buy" (please click buy), the browser already has the page and will navigate there immediately. It can't get faster than that.</p><p>With Remix, you have full control of how your app is delivered at every route. Load a bunch of JavaScript for a really interactive page, or skip it for a static page. Preload a page you think they'll navigate to, or only load that page when they navigate to it. It's all up to you.</p><h3 id="closing-the-gap-between-production-and-development-builds">Closing the gap between production and development builds</h3><p>Remember that one time you were implementing dark mode and put a <code>window.matchMedia</code> in state? Remember how everything was awesome until you deployed and then suddenly the production server was crashing? That's right, there is no window on the server and you weren't server rendering in dev!</p><p>Remember when you pushed some new CSS to production and your elements started bouncing around because your CSS lib was moving style tags around in production but not dev?</p><p>Remember when the requests for code split resources in development seemed fine but in production they were widly different and included way more in them than expected?</p><p>Production bugs live in the delta between development and production environments. Remix closes that gap.</p><p>Remix server renders the same in development as production, loads CSS the same (<code>&lt;link/&gt;</code>, ofc) and code splits the same. How can we do this? We only build the page you're looking at in development, so we can build it like production in a few milliseconds.</p><h3 id="a-refreshing-take-on-css">A refreshing take on CSS</h3><p>Remix lets you use the CSS skills you already have. While we love the innovation that has happened in the CSS-in-JS space, and you can use them in Remix, we provide a back-to-basics approach with a twist.</p><p>One of the trickiest parts of CSS and highly dynamic websites is knowing when to apply it and when to remove it. Because of nested routes, we know the layouts that are being rendered and which aren't. As the user navigates around Remix automatically loads and unloads the styles for the layouts on the page.</p><p>It might sound like no big deal at first, but once you try it you'll realize it's quite powerful.</p><p>Remix also adds a few improvements to CSS like auto prefixing and nesting, and support for tailwind out of the box, but other than that, we keep it simple.</p><h3 id="so-much-more">So much more</h3><p>Perhaps the most unique thing about Remix is that there's hardly any API at all. It gets out of your way wherever it can to allow you to use the web and React the way they were each designed. You have control over every entry point into your app, from the initial request handler to the deepest matching route's meta tags. No plugins, no complicated rendering abstractions, just React and HTTP as designed.</p><h3 id="who-is-remix">Who is Remix?</h3><p>We're Michael Jackson (no, not that one) and Ryan Florence. We've been running the company <a href="https://reacttraining.com/">React Training</a> since 2015.

        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

<p>2020-10-26</p>

<p>For some weeks now I've been fantasizing about creating this blog. I've thought about creating an HTTP server from scratch just to serve it on a Linode instance, writing a static blog engine to generate the HTML from Markdown, besides every other kinds of over-engineering just for fun.</p>

<p>I've also compiled a list with a dozen blogs I enjoy the most. Then I've tried to distill what are their qualities that makes me enjoy them, and how I may achieve those in my own blog.</p>

<p>Well, as you may see, this is my first post. Doing all of the above lead me to not start any blog at all.</p>

<p>This may be called "analysis paralysis", "over-engineering" or "perfect is the enemy of the good". Whatever it may be, I'm done with it now.</p>

<p>The most valuable thing is to produce something and put it out in the world. All the planning, engineering, thinking exists just to support that. With no realization, no "getting started", ultimately there's no value to be generated at all.</p>

<p>This is obvious in hindsight, but it's very easy to forget this lesson.</p>

<p>So, what have <em>you</em> been putting off through planning and fantasizing? What is keeping you from just <em>doing</em> what you want to do? Can't you get started right now or are you avoiding it by doing easier things? And by doing what you are doing, are you generating any value for yourself or for anyone?</p>

<p>To see it in action, we declare an enum of all possible actions.
Of course, these can be way more complicated in the real world use-case.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]</span>

<p>We build a chain from a sample of actions.</p>

chain<span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>actions<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then generate a few actions.</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>for</span> action <span>in</span> chain<span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>take</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> action<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which gives us the following output.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span><span data-user="root" data-host="localhost"></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span>cargo run --example traffic

<p>Notice how after each <code>SignIn</code> there's a <code>ListTodos</code>, which means <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>L</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>I</mi><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(ListTodos|SignIn)=1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Built model can represent inherent rules of our application.
Some series of actions will not be generated, those having probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which is a lot better than uniformly generated random data.</p>
<p>Some combination of actions might not be possible, because they'd break business rules.
Those can be filtered out, or left in to test invalid requests.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>For founders, this question comes up a lot:</p><blockquote>“I have too many startup ideas. I don’t know which idea to focus on.”</blockquote><p>It certainly did for me. </p><p>I have been building SaaS products for the last few years, with bad to mediocre results. Each one taught me something new. Each one revealed one or two factors about the idea that I wish I knew BEFORE working on it.</p><p>For example, if there is a HUGE population with the problem I'm solving, then there's a better chance of me surviving despite incumbents and competitors. Larger pie, more slices to go round.</p><p>If I had known how to evaluate these ideas beforehand, I would have saved a lot of time. It won't be a guarantee of success, but it would have helped increase my odds.</p><p>I wanted to know what else I should know before starting work on an idea, so I researched articles, podcasts and videos with successful founders to find out how they evaluate ideas.</p><p>The result is a <strong>30-point checklist</strong>, curated from over 40 founders, that I want to share with you below. </p><p>Having a list makes it easy, and even fun, to evaluate your ideas in a structured and repeatable way. Think of it as <strong>due diligence</strong> you're doing before investing your time in your idea.</p><h2 id="but-ideas-don-t-matter-execution-does-">"But ideas don't matter. Execution does!"</h2><p>The intention of this advice is good, but, I feel this is misleading.</p><p>Given two ideas, executing on the one that has a better chance of succeeding will yield better results. Executing on a bad idea wastes time, money, and motivation.</p><p>Would you not want to know if an idea is a "good idea" before you spend lots of time and money trying to validate it?</p><p>If you think evaluating an idea before investing time and money in it isn't practical, then tell that to angel investors. They have to - they can't afford to give away money based on hunches. In their world, it's called due diligence.</p><blockquote>"Ideas mean everything and nothing at the same time. They mean everything, because you can 10x your odds of success by simply picking a better one. They mean nothing, because with bad execution you'll achieve nothing, no matter how good the idea." — Alex West, <a href="http://cyberleads.co/">cyberleads.co</a></blockquote><h2 id="the-saas-idea-evaluation-checklist">The SaaS idea evaluation checklist</h2><p>So here's the list I'm using. I have grouped them into 3 groups:</p><ul><li>Must-haves: Don't even start without having all of these.</li><li>Should-haves: The more you have of these, the better your chances.</li><li>Nice-to-haves: Not essential, but really helps if you do have them.</li></ul><h3 id="must-haves">Must-haves</h3><p>1. <strong>Solves a very specific problem</strong>. What's the specific problem you are aiming to solve?</p><p>2. <strong>Targets a very specific niche</strong>. Which specific group of people has that problem?</p><p>3. <strong>Has a large enough market</strong>. How big is this market? Is it enough to meet your business goal? A large market also means there's room for competitors.</p><p>4. <strong>Will generate profit</strong>. How much will it cost to run this business, and will you be able to turn a profit? Obvious, but a surprising number of founders don't work this out until much later!</p><p>5. <strong>Can operate profitably without the founder</strong>. Can this business grow profitably without you?</p><h3 id="should-haves">Should-haves</h3><p>6. <strong>Solves my own problem</strong>. Are you building this for yourself? Great start if you are!</p><p>7. <strong>"Hair on fire" problem</strong>. Will your customers need your solution urgently? Or is it not that important?</p><p>8. <strong>Frequently occurring problem</strong>. How often does someone have this problem? Hourly, daily, or at most weekly, would be best.</p><p>9. <strong>Growing market with this problem</strong>. More and more people are having this problem every day. More and more people will want your solution.</p><p>10. <strong>This is a mandatory problem</strong>. For example, this there's been a change in law and your customers need a solution. Like GDPR.</p><p>11. <strong>Customers are small businesses</strong>. These are the best customers to have because they have money, are motivated to spend, and has short lead times.</p><p>12. <strong>Founder has built an audience in target group</strong>. Do you already have followers or subscribers that have this problem.</p><p>13. <strong>Can be launched quickly</strong>. The faster you can launch, the quicker you can learn, and the quicker you get to revenue.</p><p>14. <strong>Clear customer acquisition channel</strong>. You can think of at least one obvious way to reach your target customers and offer your solution.</p><p>15. <strong>Founder - market fit</strong>. Do you know this market well?</p><p>16. <strong>Founder - product fit</strong>. Are you the right person to create this solution? Do you need to build a team?</p><p>17. <strong>Founder unfair advantage</strong>. Are you one of only a handful of people who can build on this idea? E.g. you own a patent.</p><p>18. <strong>You love serving this market</strong>. Will you enjoy talking to and serving this group of customers day in and day out? Do you genuinely want to help them?</p><p>19. <strong>Market is proven</strong>. Are people already paying money to solve this problem? Are your competitors making tonnes of money?</p><p>20. <strong>Arduous but not impossible</strong>. Is this a problem that not many people want to solve because it's so troublesome? Is it a solution that requires a lot of "<a href="http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html">schlep</a>"?</p><p>21. <strong>Unique value proposition</strong>. Are you providing novel solution to the problem? Perhaps focusing on a small part of the bigger problem and providing a focused, but effective, solution?</p><p>22. <strong>Can be a sellable asset</strong>. Can this business become an asset that you can sell later?</p><p>23. <strong>No monopolies</strong>. Are the incumbents monopolies that can wipe you out in 2 seconds?</p><h3 id="nice-to-haves">Nice-to-haves</h3><p>24. <strong>Market is highly motivated</strong>. The market is willing to spend money on anything that will improve their lives or work.</p><p>25. <strong>The market has the purchasing power</strong>. They have the money to spend on your solution.</p><p>26. <strong>Able to pre-sell the solution</strong>. Are you able to pre-sell the solution, as a way to validate demand?</p><p>27. <strong>The problem is not sexy</strong>. Sexy products get people excited, but also attracts more competitors. There's money being made on problems that don't get mentioned in TechCrunch or Wired.</p><p>28. <strong>The solution is simple</strong>. Is your solution simpler to understand and use than your competitor's?</p><p>29. <strong>Target customers exist as communities</strong>. Do your customers hang out online together? This helps with word of mouth traffic.</p><p>30. <strong>Quick time to first customer</strong>. Are you able to get your first paying customer within 4 weeks? Or quicker, relative to your other ideas?</p><h2 id="how-to-use-this-checklist">How to use this checklist</h2><p>To make it easy for you, I have created a checklist in a Google Sheet with all the criteria above. Just make a copy of it and then use it to quickly tick off attributes of your idea, and to find gaps in research that you may need to do. I've included one idea as an example - a simple Shopify analytics app for store owners.</p><p><strong>✅ </strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/101Hi6atV5cY3R4Fb39jWv7slS2Tth3Ti54fAMrVODno/edit?usp=sharing"><strong>Get the SaaS Idea Evaluation Sheet here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Here's how I use the scoring sheet:</p><ul><li>As a way to score and compare my ideas before I pick the next one to work on.

						<p>Now that 2020 is here, let’s look at what we can expect from the next decade in software. As Web developers, our solutions can help shape the organizations we work for. The tools we build and the architectural decisions we make have a compounding effect on society at large. What are the new trends, and will they help empower or enslave people?</p>
<h2>The Old Trends</h2>
<p>The trends in the last 10-20 years have led to more and more <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2017/08/20/centralization-and-open-source/">centralization of the Web</a>, consolidation of power in the hands of the largest services (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Reddit) and their extended ecosystems. Between these and the large publications, the “independent Web” has suffered a tremendous setback.  Most people and organizations trust large corporations with proprietary algorithms to manage their data, identity and brand. This has led to <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2019/03/08/how-qbix-platform-can-change-the-world/">massive new issues for individuals and society</a>, involving governments and corporations, and how we all relate to one another. Attempts to resolve these issues have spawned some projects to <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2017/08/30/the-future-of-decentralization/">decentralize the Web</a>.</p>
<p>When the Web was born, browsers rendered HTML documents, and there was very little support for client-side programming. Whatever Javascript support was introduced over the next decade was inconsistent because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a>, and led to <a href="http://www.jqueryvsmootools.com/">Javascript libraries</a> to bridge the gap, of which jQuery emerged as the winner. The last 10 years saw the rise of <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, new versions of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">Javascript</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">HTML5 Web APIs</a>, which finally made front-end Web programming a powerful proposition on the most widely deployed platform in the world.</p>
<h2>Client-First Web Apps</h2>
<p>As Javascript was maturing, a conventional wisdom has developed among most Web developers, that you should render the HTML on the client side, and then progressively enhance it with Javascript. This was considered best practice and recommended by pretty much every authority from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">2009</a> to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">2018</a>.</p>
<p>In this decade, Web developers will turn this conventional wisdom on its head, and start to consider progressive enhancement to go the other way:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, develop static HTML, CSS and Javascript</li>
<li>Make Javascript fetch data from servers, render it on the client</li>
<li>Progressively enhance the site for older environments (Server-rendered HTML)</li>
</ol>
<p>What follows are multiple reasons for why this is the better approach going forward. <span>This one shift in how we approach Web development will have profound technological and societal implications.</span></p>
<h2 id="distributing-software">Distributing Software</h2>
<p><strong>1. Separation of concerns.</strong> It pays to decouple the rendering of an interface from the delivery of code / markup. That way we are not tied to one type of app delivery — that of a server on the web sending our executable code. We are able to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading">sideload apps</a>, download them from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources">app stores</a>, and update specific files when they have changed. And we use one language for each task, too: JS is the code. HTML / Handlebars / etc. can be used for templates / markup. CSS is used for presentation. JSON or XML is used for data. After you have done this, if you want to pre-render HTML on a server for AJAX, you can, but will start to feel “dirty” as you’ll be coupling things unnecessarily again. Things are going this way as <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-10-15-free-headless-cms/">headless CMSes</a> are making an appearance, while <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>, <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> represent other ways of delivering code through app stores.</p>
<p><strong>2. Trust. </strong> You can’t trust what code is running remotely (although Signal <a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">has been experimenting</a> with using <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/innovative-technology-for-cpu-based-attestation-and-sealing">Software Guard Extensions</a> by CPU makers, originally designed for DRM, to go the other way and ensure what code runs on a server). But even if you can, you have no guarantee some other process won’t steal or corrupt your data. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">Trusted Computing Base</a> should not include arbitrary amounts of remote sites shipping code at any time. Decoupling how the code is loaded (see point #1) onto your client allows you or your user agent to verify checksums and certify that it is indeed the code you think it is. And it is that code that should be managing your data and using the personal keys on your device. Package managers and app stores will be able to distribute code that has been audited by third-party security firms, and people will be able to trust them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Decentralization of Code.</strong> As the next decade unfolds, we will find that&nbsp;code bases don’t necessarily have to live shrink-wrapped on a specific server. Rather, clients can use multiple interoperable software modules and versions and can have multiple app stores and distributors in the future helping maintain repos and package managers for end-users and organizations. We will probably see automated package management become more user friendly in the 2020s, as we already have a docker container culture, we have browser based package managers etc.</p>
<h2 id="data-ownership">Data Ownership</h2>
<p><strong>4. Decentralization of Data.</strong> This is the big one in terms of effect on society. By having web servers render your webpage, you are implicitly locking yourself and your organization into the type of model where the servers store and access the data in a private database. They have enough data to render everything, apply access control rules to manage what you can read and write, and so on. Instead, we as a society need to empower people and their client side apps, and push the logic of fetching data, caching it and assembling it to the <a href="https://continuations.com/post/108271329110/tedxnewyork-big-and-bot-policy-proposals">user agents</a>. We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities</a> / <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/">access tokens</a> for data instead of a centralized site rendering HTML. <span>In this way, always inverting the progressive enhancement is an <em><span>activist</span></em> position to change society against the abuses of power </span><a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2019/03/08/how-qbix-platform-can-change-the-world/">like the ones listed here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Reliability</strong> After the 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris, countries around the world expressed solidarity with the French people. French colors were flown, but similar-sized attacks at the same time by ISIS in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/world/middleeast/beirut-lebanon-attacks-paris.html?smid=tw-nytimesworld&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">Beirut</a> were totally forgotten. Facebook rolled out a feature to customize one’s profile with the French flag superimposed, but only the French flag. So we used the Qbix Platform to quickly build a small app called <a href="https://customizemypic.com/">customizemypic.com</a> to allow anyone to change their profile picture to a flag of their choice. The goal was to make a statement and express solidarity with people in Beirut, Baghdad and other areas hard hit by terrorism. Today, that same app is no longer able to do its core function because Facebook <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/">removed any way for users to give permissions to apps</a> to upload a photo on their behalf. This is what happens when you rely on third parties to announce what you can and cannot do with your own profile picture. The most extreme reliability is achieved by an <a href="http://offlinefirst.org/">offline-first</a> approach, which is a close cousin of the client-first trend that will grow in the 2020s.</p>
<p><strong>6. End to End Encryption.</strong> Server-side rendering perpetuates a culture where the server has all the data unencrypted. Even if the data is encrypted at rest, the served holds all the decryption keys and is one central target for hackers, government agencies, and advertisers. Rendering things client-side goes hand-in-hand with a culture of people storing their own keys on devices of their choice, and letting key management and password management be the domain of operating systems and trusted computing bases, not random websites.</p>
<h2 id="Data Delivery">Data Delivery</h2>
<p><strong>7. Bandwidth.</strong> Ever since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm8FAHGJB3M">Steve Jobs presented WebObjects</a>, we have wanted sites to render dynamically. Well, that often involves looping through various items and rendering each one. It is extremely wasteful to send the HTML results of rendering hundreds of items to a client, when you could have just sent the data, which would then be “hydrated” into 5. templates by the client. However, I can understand pre-rendering just the items above the fold (if one could estimate this number, not knowing the size of the window on the first request).</p>
<p><strong>8. Caching Issues.</strong> Often, you have subtle and pervasive changes on every page when a person is logged in vs out. (I should remark that “logging in” into a site itself is an artifact of “centralized” thinking, but I digress.) Their avatar might be rendered in various places. New links are shown that might not be available otherwise. And new information may be shown that access control and discovery suggestions determines they can see. If you render everything on the served, there is no way to cache most of the fragments of the page, because they are changing. If you render client-side, all this comes for free.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps for Web Developers</h2>
<p>So by now you may be convinced that “client-first” is a good design pattern and progressive enhancement can be implemented later, by “speeding up” the first render, and by making it available to “dumb” crawlers and user agents who don’t execute Javascript in 2020. Here is how that would actually look, in actionable terms:</p>
<p><strong>9. Preloading. </strong>Okay, now that you are rendering everything client-side, you can implement a mechanism to preload data from the server. Perhaps put all the JSON in one file and send it over on the first render. Which — remember — happens only when you use a Web Browser to visit a page directly, a very specific scenario. Every other request besides that, including subsequent requests from a web browser, don’t need this preload. It’s an extra flair you can add for that specific use case. So the preloaded data comes and your Javascript will already have it and will render the HTML synchronously and quickly.</p>
<p><strong>10. Static Site Generation. </strong>The most popular static site generators today are still pretty narrow in their use-case. They help with blogs and publishing, eg <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, etc. But if you already have a dynamic site, you can sort of transform it into a static site by having a server-side script request some (dynamically specified) set of pages and render them to some related static html documents, and then begin sending 301 redirects on the dynamic pages to permanently tell browsers to go to the static pages in the future. (Because rewriting all links in your site may be infeasible). This approach runs into problems I described in point 5 — so a naive approach would only work for publicly accessible pages …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Small things matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Know where things are. Naming is crucial.</li>
<li>A piece of code should be where you expect to find it. If not, refactor to get it there.</li>
<li>Don't litter your code with comments and commented-out code that "capture history or wished for the future".</li>
<li>Standardization is important.</li>
<li>Have the discipline to follow the practices. To frequently reflect upon your work — and be willing to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>"In code, refactor mercilessly". Reminds me of a simple writing tip: Imagine that you are paid for each word that you remove, while still keeping the meaning. That's how you write well.</p>
<p>Craftsmanship is the way to write good code. How do we learn it? Knowledge and work. Gain the knowledge (principles, patterns, practices, heuristics) and grind that knowledge into yourself by working hard and practicing.</p>
<p>You could know it all, but without the hard work, you wouldn't be able to put it to practice. Practice and fail. And then try again.</p>
<p>You could skip the case studies in this book, in which case you've read another 'feel good' book about writing good code. Then you've learned nothing. But you can pay close attention to even the smallest details and follow along closely, then you'll learn quite a lot.</p>

<p>If you keep making a mess, it'll slow you down in the long run.</p>
<p>We read more code than we write, so we should make it easier to read — even if that makes it harder to write. But since we can't write it without reading it, we're actually making it easier to write as well. But this is over the long term.</p>
<p>We don't just write clean code. We have to maintain it as well. So keep it clean.</p>

<ul>
<li>Names should reveal intentions. If it requires a comment to explain, it's not a good name</li>
<li>"Avoid Disinformation"</li>
<li>Be very careful with similar names — it can be very misleading (breaking the above rule!)</li>
<li>"Make Meaningful Distinctions" — different names for different things. <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> could be <code>source</code> and <code>destination</code> — much better names.</li>
<li>"Noise words are redundant". <code>variable</code> should never appear in a variable name, don't put <code>string</code> in the name of a string, don't make two variables like <code>thing</code> and <code>theThing</code>. Distinguishing names is important.</li>
<li>"Use Pronounceable Names"</li>
<li>"Use Searchable Names"</li>
<li>"Avoid Encodings" — never actually seen this before.</li>
<li>
<p>"Avoid Mental Mapping" — Just because you know what it means, doesn't mean that someone else will.</p>
<ul>
<li>Class names should be nouns or noun phrases, not verbs.</li>
<li>Method names should be verbs or verb phrases. Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be prefixed with <code>get</code>, <code>set</code>, or <code>is</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Don't Be Cute" — Say what you mean. Jokes are only fun for you and those in on them.</li>
<li>"Pick One Word per Concept" — If you write <code>fetch</code> and not <code>retrieve</code>, stick with it.</li>
<li>"Don't Pun"</li>
<li>"Use Solution Domain Names" — You can use technical terms</li>
<li>"Use Problem Domain Names" — When there are no technical terms, use the name from the problem domain.</li>
<li>"Add Meaningful Context" — If you see an address form, you might see 'state' as a variable. But if you see 'state' alone somewhere, would you assume that it's related to an address? Here, meaningful context could be naming it <code>addrState</code>.</li>
<li>"Don't Add Gratuitous Context"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Functions should be small.</li>
<li>They should do only one thing.</li>
<li>One Level of Abstraction per Function.</li>
<li>Code should be able to read from the top to bottom. This is <em>The Stepdown Rule</em>.</li>
<li>General rule for switch statements: "they can be tolerated if they appear only once, are used to create polymorphic objects, and are hidden behind an inheritance".</li>
<li>Use descriptive names.</li>
<li>The fewer arguments the better.</li>
<li>They should have no side effects.</li>
<li>They should either do something or answer something. Not both.</li>
<li>Exceptions &gt; Returning Error Codes</li>
<li>Extract Try/Catch blocks into functions of their own.</li>
<li>Error handling is one thing.</li>
<li>Don't Repeat Yourself. The more duplicates, the more has to be changed when necessary. And more room for errors.</li>
<li>You don't have to get all of this perfect in your first try. It is as writing. You can edit and refine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chess, for practical purposes, is solved. Using online platforms players can compare their moves against optimal moves generated by chess engines/AI’s. Centipawn Loss (CPL) is a measure of how suboptimal one’s move is. A centipawn is equal to <code>1/100th</code> of a pawn, meaning a CPL of <code>100</code> indicates the player made a move that lost the equivalent to <code>1</code> pawn. A CPL of <code>100</code> does not necessarily mean you lost a pawn unnecessarily; CPL also takes into account positions and potential mates. <a href="https://lichess.org/faq#acpl">Average Centipawn Loss</a> (ACPL) is the average CPL across a given game. ACPL is a positive number between 0 and infinity. An ACPL near 20 is excellent indicting near perfect play, whereas an ACPL above 300 either means you’re a 3 year old toddler or purposefully losing the game. Being able to calculate ACPL raises the question, is ACPL correlated to one’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">rating</a>?</p>

<details><summary>In-depth CPL explanation</summary>

<div>

    <p>Let’s examine the following board</p>

    <p><img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/even_game.PNG" alt="Even chess game"></p>

    <p>Both sides have similar pieces and similar positions. <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a> gives this board a score of <code>-0.69</code> (i.e. black is up <code>69/100th</code> of a pawn or <code>69</code> Centipawn’s).</p>

    <p>The optimal move is to move your bishop to <code>b4</code>.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/optimal_move.PNG" alt="Average Centipawn Loss vs Rating"></p>

    <p>That board is evaluated at <code>-0.71</code>.</p>

    <p>If instead we played the bishop to <code>c3</code>, Stockfish will reevaluate the board to <code>-0.89</code>.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/bad_move.PNG" alt="Average Centipawn Loss vs Rating"></p>

    <p>Since the optimal move resulted in a board evaluation of <code>-0.71</code> and our move achieved an evaluation of <code>-0.89</code>, our move receives a CPL of <code>-71 - -89 = 18</code>.</p>

  </div>
</details>

<figure>
  <img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/acpl_vs_rating.PNG" alt="Average Centipawn Loss vs Rating">
  <figcaption><b>Fig 1</b>: Rating vs ACPL per game <sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="a15"><a href="#f15">[1.5]</a></sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The graph shows a negative correlation between rating and ACPL (ACPL decreases as rating increases) which follows common sense; as a player gets better they tend to perform moves that are closer to the optimal.</p>

<p>ACPL, as most performance indicators, require context. A player can achieve an ACPL of 20 in a variety of ways. They can immediately blunder their queen and attempt to stretch out the inevitable<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> or they can play an excellent game.</p>

<p>Instead of looking at rating vs ACPL, we’ll look at rating vs move types. Online chess platforms tend to classify moves into several broad categories: best move, good move, inaccuracy (CPL between <code>50-100</code>), mistake (CPL between <code>100-300</code>) and blunder (CPL <code>&gt;200</code>).</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://kwojcicki.github.io/img/posts/errors_vs_rating.PNG" alt="Errors vs Rating">
  <figcaption><b>Fig 2</b>: Rating vs Errors per game <sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">[1]</a></sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As one would expect, the number of blunders (game losing moves) drastically decreases with rating. It is unclear if the actual CPL per blunder decreases or increases with rating.</p>

<p>What is interesting is how mistakes stay relativity even, this may be due to the examined games being from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#:~:text=and%20regular%20ratings.-,Blitz,minutes%20or%20less%20per%20player.&amp;text=The%20USCF%20defines%20blitz%20chess,and%2010%20minutes%20per%20player.">blitz variant</a> of chess. Since the players have a limited time to think they are likely making moves that are good in the short term (<code>3-5</code> moves ahead), but may be suboptimal in <code>10+</code> moves. Realistically, it will be difficult for humans to ever eliminate all mistakes and inaccuracies from their play, but concentrating on reducing one’s blunders even by <code>25%</code> yields incredible gains in ones rating.</p>



<p>In both graphs, it is evident that the correlation factor between errors/ACPL and rating is low. Both are metrics that can be used to estimate the players’ rating in a range, but are unideal to accurately judge a player’s performance. Nonetheless, it is difficult to dispute the notion that better players have better ACPL.</p>



<p><b id="f1">[1]</b> A sample of <code>~2500</code> games was taken using <a href="https://lichess.org/api">Lichess’s API</a>, resulting in <code>~5000</code> ACPL samples being used. Players were pooled in buckets based on their ELO (i.e. the ACPL was averaged for players across <code>700-719</code>, <code>720-739</code> etc). <a href="#a1">↩</a></p>

<p><b id="f15">[1.5]</b> There is a peculiar uptick in ACPL at the very upper ranks likely due to low sampling of <code>2900+</code> rated games. <a href="#a15">↩</a></p>

<p><b id="f2">[2]</b> One can imagine a scenario where the player immediately blunders their queen, causing their initial ACPL to be very high. As the game progresses, since the game is in such a dire position, all the player’s available moves will be roughly of the same quality, meaning any move the player makes will have a CPL close to 0. Eventually, as the number of moves grows larger the initial spike in CPL will be averaged off. <a href="#a2">↩</a></p>

                    <p>Posting on Hacker News is like a box of chocolates – you never know what you’re gonna get. I’ve been submitting since 2017 and never had more than one point. So I stopped trying.</p><p>A month ago, I got access to OpenAI API. After ten minutes of tinkering, I’ve got an idea: what if I could make it write good Hacker News titles for my blog posts? I quickly looked up the most favorited posts, designed the prompt in plain English, and generated my first title. It looked weird. I even doubted for a few minutes if it’s worth sharing. But I was curious – so I closed my eyes and hit submit.</p><p>The post went to the moon with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24547098">229 points and 126 comments</a> in one day. Fascinated, I continued generating titles (and what would you do?). In three weeks, I got to the front page five times, received 1054 upvotes, and had 37k people come to my site.</p><p>Below is everything I’ve learned building a Hacker News post titles generator with OpenAI API, designing GPT-3 prompts, and figuring out how to apply GPT-3 to problems ranging from sales emails to SEO-optimized blog posts. At the end of the post, I cover the broader implications of GPT-3 that became obvious only after a month of working with the tool. If you’re an entrepreneur or an investor who wants to understand the change this tech will drive, you can read my speculations there.</p><p>If you have no idea what I’m talking about, read more about GPT-3 in <a href="https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2020/05">Gwern’s post</a> first, or check <a href="https://beta.openai.com/">OpenAI’s website</a> with demo videos. In my work, I assume you’re already familiar with the API on some basic level.</p><p><em>Oct 28 update: After I published the draft, 23 people asked how to apply GPT-3 to their problems. To help them get started with the OpenAI API, I started building the first GPT-3 course that covers everything I learned – from use cases to prompt design.

As there were no tutorials on approaching the problem, I went to the playground and began experimenting.</p><h2 id="generating-new-titles">Generating new titles</h2><h3 id="1-finding-the-data">1. Finding the data</h3><p>First, I wanted to see if I could make GPT-3 generate engaging post titles at all. To do that, I needed two things:</p><ol><li>Write a prompt that concisely describes the problem that I want to solve.</li><li>Feed the API some sample data to stimulate the completion.</li></ol><p>I went ahead and searched for the most upvoted HN posts of all time. In a few minutes, I’ve got <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?query=&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=story">an Algolia page</a> with a list of links. But after skimming through them, I figured out that upvotes wouldn’t work. They are mostly news and poorly reflect what kind of content the community values.</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.18.27-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.18.27-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.18.27-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.18.27-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.18.27-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?query=&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=story">Most upvoted HN posts of all time.</a></figcaption></figure><p>Disappointed, I discarded upvotes as a metric. I needed something that would describe the value people get from the post. Something like... bookmarks?</p><p>I quickly looked up <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351073">the most favorited HN posts</a>. The idea was simple: people don’t bookmark news. They favorite things they want to explore later.</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.21.11-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.21.11-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.21.11-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.21.11-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.21.11-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/hacker-favourites-analysis">Most favorited HN posts of all time.</a></figcaption></figure><p>The next step was to grab the data from the list, insert it into the playground, and write a clear and concise prompt.</p><p><em>I actually grab data from the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351073">dang’s comment</a> rather than the original post; his list was a global one.</em></p><h3 id="2-designing-a-prompt">2. Designing a prompt</h3><p>The best way to program the API is to write a direct and straightforward task description, as you would do if you were delegating this problem to a human assistant. </p><p>Here’s how my first prompt looked like:</p><blockquote>Generate viral titles for Hacker News (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a>) posts. The titles have to be provocative and incentivize users to click on them.</blockquote><p>Data-wise, I needed to clean up the list slightly, get rid of irrelevant stuff like IDs, and choose up to five titles to use as a sample – OpenAI team suggests that selecting three to five titles works best for text generation. If you feed the API more examples, it picks up wrong intents and generates irrelevant completions.</p><p>In a few minutes of Google Sheets work, the cleanup was done, and I had a data set of the most favorited HN post titles of all time. I put together my first prompt and clicked “Generate.”</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.29.16-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.29.16-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.29.16-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.29.16-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.29.16-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Cleaned up titles of most favorited HN posts of all time.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="3-tinkering-with-completions">3.

The best stuff comes after dozens of experiments, sometimes after generating completions with the same parameters many times with the Best Of parameter and writing another GPT-3 classifier to discover a good one. Moreover, you need to test the prompt’s quality, data samples, and temperature (“creativity” of responses) individually to understand what you need to improve. </p><p><em>If you’re looking for prompt design tips, head on to chapter 2 of the post.</em></p><p>Here’s a list of experiments I’ve done:</p><ul><li>Edited the prompt many times, including and excluding adjectives from the task description. I tried “catchy,” “provocative,” “thought-provoking,” and many others. The best configuration I’ve got was “Write a short, thought-provoking, and eye-catching post title for a Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/) submission.”</li><li>Split the prompt into two sentences, separating the task and its description. Discovered that one-sentence long prompts work best for simple tasks.</li><li>Played with data samples.

The best results came at .9, while anything less than .7 was repetitive and very similar to the samples. Titles generated with temperature 1 were too random and didn’t look like good HN titles at all.</li></ul><p>To judge the quality of completions, I’ve come up with a question: “If I saw this on HN, would I click on it?” This helped me move quickly through experiments because I knew what bad results looked like.</p><p>After half an hour of tinkering, I’ve got the following completion: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-9.54.17-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>My first good GPT-3 completions for HN titles.</figcaption></figure><p>That’s when I realized that I’m onto something. From the list of generated titles above, I’d click on at least three links just out of curiosity. Especially on “A developer’s guide to getting in shape.”</p><p>What’s even more interesting, the completion above was a result of fine-tuning the API. Title8, What You Love Is Not Your Life’s Work, was originally a part of another completion that was lame. So I cut out the bad stuff, added Title8 to my data sample, and continued generating from there.</p><p>The next step was to see if I could make GPT-3 create a custom title for my blog post.</p><h2 id="generating-custom-titles">Generating custom titles</h2><h3 id="1-changing-the-method">1. Changing the method</h3><p>To make GPT-3 generate custom titles, I needed to change my approach. I was no longer exploring new, potentially interesting headlines but figuring out how to make a good one for a post that was already written. To do that, I couldn’t just tell the API, “hey, generate me a good one.” I needed to show what a good one actually is and give GPT-3 some idea of what the post is about.</p><p>The first thing I changed is the prompt. This was relatively easy because I applied the same model of thinking again – “What would I tell a human assistant if I had to delegate this problem?”</p><p>Here’s a prompt that I used:</p><blockquote>Write a short, thought-provoking, and eye-catching post title for Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/) submission based on a blog post’s provided description.</blockquote><p>One unexpected benefit from tinkering with the prompt is the clarity of thought. When you’re dealing with GPT-3, there’s no way to make it work if you don’t know what you’re doing. You need to express your thought in clear terms. It’s a brilliant natural constraint and one of the most underrated benefits of GPT-3: when you must state clearly what you want to do, you begin to better understand the problem.</p><h3 id="2-updating-the-data">2. Updating the data</h3><p>After I designed a new prompt, I had to update my data set. I went back to my previous experiment, selected five titles from the list of most favorited posts of all time, and wrote a clear and concise description for each of them. Lastly, I wrote a description of my own work that I wanted to generate the title for. I left the title field blank and hit “Generate.”</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-10.35.59-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Updated data set for generating custom HN titles.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="3-experimenting-with-titles">3. Experimenting with titles</h3><p>This time, the completions were shockingly good.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>
On Monday I launched my newsletter on Substack, <a href="https://mvpsprint.substack.com/">The MVP Sprint</a>. I'm chronicling my journey to validate an idea and build an MVP - adapting the popular <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">Design Sprint</a> methodology to the startup launch process.
</p>

<p>
Going into it, I didn't know what to expect. I've never built in public like this before. I've shared articles in the past that were met with nothing but crickets. But this one was different.
</p>

<p>
<b>I've gained 108 subscribers in the first 48 hours since launch</b>.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to share the blueprint I followed and the metrics it produced to help out future newsletter newbs like myself.
</p>

<h3>Where did I share it?</h3>
<p>Everywhere I could think of! Here's some details on individual channels:</p>

<h4>Indie Hackers</h4>
<p>
I shared <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/after-4-brain-surgeries-i-left-my-6-figure-tech-job-now-i-m-launching-a-startup-in-public-87e569e566">this post</a> in the "Building in Public" group. This seemed like the most relevant place to share it, but with 359 members, I wasn't sure if it would get many eyeballs.
</p>

<p>
As of right now, it has 34 upvotes, 26 comments, and 811 views. Not bad! It started off quite slow, seemed to pick up steam after the IH email newsletter went out, and then picked up a lot more after  <a href="https://twitter.com/IndieHackers/status/1320899528862633985">this shoutout from the @IndieHackers Twitter account</a>.
</p>

<h4>Twitter</h4>
<p>
I shared <a href="https://twitter.com/AnotherTimJones/status/1320801476491595780?s=20">a tweet storm from my personal twitter account</a> to my modest group of &lt;300 followers (at the time). A few of my friends gave me Twitter shoutouts and retweeted me.
</p>

<h4>Linkedin</h4>
<p>
I shared a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjones4413/">my personal Linkedin</a>. It currently has 72 reactions, 20 comments, and 3,318 views within the news feed.
</p>

<p>
I also tried out the new Linkedin stories, but had &lt;15 views in the first 24 hours. I probably won't do this again. 
</p>

<h4>Reddit</h4>
<p>
I posted in the following subreddits:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/jie5an/how_do_you_come_up_with_ideas_for_tech_startups/">r/startups</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Startup_Ideas/comments/jie8l1/a_startup_idea_is_just_a_recipe/">r/startup_ideas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/jielur/after_4_brain_surgeries_i_left_my_6figure_tech/">r/EntrepreneurRideAlong</a> - This one did particularly well with &gt;180 upvotes and 54 comments.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I did my best to give as much value as possible within the posts themselves - only with a modest link at the end to the newsletter. And I tweaked the content for each subreddit to make it more relevant.
</p>

<p>
Outside of a few haters, folks on Reddit were super supportive. I received lots of friendly DM's and emails from people saying they loved the story and even wanted to help out.
</p>

<h4>Instagram</h4>
<p>
I threw together some images on Figma and shared a 2-part story on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anothertimjones/">my personal Instagram</a> where I have 585 followers. Outside of a few supportive messages from friends, I can't really pull out the IG contribution to subscriber count.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p><i>These are the same assets I used for my Linkedin story.</i></p>

<h4>Medium</h4>
<p>
I tried <a href="https://themvpsprint.medium.com/cooking-up-a-recipe-in-the-startup-kitchen-3597cdcd5f4b">syndicating my first article to Medium</a>. So far it has 12 views and 3 "reads". Not sure if I'll continue this or not. Long-term I'll want to harness the SEO benefits on my own domain and syndicated content without a canonical tag won't do me any favors there.
</p>

<h4>Substack Stats</h4>
<h5>Engagement on <a href="https://mvpsprint.substack.com/p/choose-a-problem">the first article </a>:</h5>
<p><img alt="Article 1 stats" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/do0vbqz18/image/upload/v1603899472/MVP%20Sprint/article%201%20stats.png">
</p>

<p>
The view count feels accurate, but I'm not reading much into the "40 free signups after reading this". Maybe this means lots of people subscribed without reading?
</p>

<h5>Here's the breakdown of visits and and signups by channel:</h5>
<p><img alt="Article 1 stats" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/do0vbqz18/image/upload/v1603899619/MVP%20Sprint/substack%20stats.png">
</p>

<p>
<b>A few thoughts:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm guessing that "direct" visitors was actually less than 343. I suspect that some of these are from Instagram (where I didn't include a direct link) and some from users where the referral header wasn't set.</li>
<li>The signup column doesn't add up to even half of my total subscribers, so I'm not reading much into that.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Future Channels</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Twitter</b> - I'm new to using Twitter in a professional sense, but it's no secret that this <i>could</i> and <i>should</i> be a great channel for me moving forward. I just have to invest in it and find my voice.
</li><li><b>Reddit</b> - Reddit feels like it could be a great tool, but I'll have to experiment with how to consistently engage in a way that drives value and doesn't feel spammy. 
</li><li><b>Linkedin</b> - I have a pretty deep Linkedin network so I'll keep tapping into that.
</li><li><b>Product Hunt</b> - After I have maybe 5-10 articles, I'm planning on spinning up my own landing page and newsletter "stack". At that point, I'll probably throw it up on Product Hunt.
</li></ol>

<h3>Some closing thoughts</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>People want to support you</b> (if you give them the chance) - I sometimes feel awkward asking for help. Maybe some of you are the same. But I realized from this experience that not only can be people be extremely helpful, but they <b>thoroughly enjoy helping</b>, maybe even a bit of  living vicariously through the startup journey.
</li><li><b>Reply to everyone</b> -  I did my best to reply to almost everyone that commented on a post. Not only does this cultivate a deeper connection with readers, but I think it helps to boost the engagement flywheel.
</li></ul>

<p>
That's it! Any advice for me moving forward? <a href="https://twitter.com/anothertimjones">Shoot me a DM on Twitter!</a>

To continue the analogy of business partnership being like marriage, I'd married someone that I'd only been on a few dates with and barely knew. I partnered out of insecurity with someone who talked a good game and seemed strong in the areas I felt weak.This insecurity cost me $$$</p><figure id="w-node-76af6d16a676-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f8750eb6f143d07b654067a_partnership-2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We met through an entrepreneurship course online and became accountability partners soon after. With him being in New Jersey and me in NYC, we were close enough to be able to meet in person once every few months.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Through being accountability partners we became aware of each other's strengths and complementary skill sets, him with marketing and me with product design and branding.<br></p><p>As background, before <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a> was born I had another Shopify store selling graphic design products that was paying all my bills and generating a good living. I considered that business my ‘Freedom vehicle’ as it allowed me to quit my Architecture job but I wasn’t passionate about doing it long-term.<br></p><p>I <em>was</em> deeply passionate about personal development during this time and was always reading and finding ways to upgrade my skills and productivity. I felt like I’d found the cheat code to life and wished I’d been introduced to it sooner. Before I quit my architecture job, I set myself a task to <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/the-22-books-that-helped-me-quit-my-job" target="_blank">read 22 books around specific topics so I would be ready for the world of entrepreneurship.</a><br></p><p>The <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/journal" target="_blank">Self Journal</a> was later born from my personal struggle for years of finding a planner that would both keep me organized and also help me reach my most important goals.<br></p><p>I decided I wanted to turn the journal I built for myself into a product to sell, because it seemed whenever I showed it to someone they wanted to buy it.&nbsp; I didn’t think this product would be the start of something bigger, I just wanted to bring this product to life.</p><p>It was then I thought having someone who knew sales and marketing would be beneficial so I asked ‘A’ to partner with me on it. He also had his own journaling structure&nbsp; so I felt it was a common interest.<br></p><p><strong>In retrospect, I partnered out of my insecurities around marketing and selling myself. </strong></p><h6>Most entrepreneurs don't have business problems, they have emotional problems disguised as business problems —<strong> and so I disguised my fear of putting myself out there with a business partner.&nbsp;</strong><br></h6><p>And so it began.<br></p><p>The original name we came up with for the company was “Self Improvement Labs”... but I <em>hated</em> it. One weekend when ‘A’ was gone I knew I had to come up with something better to replace it with<em>.</em></p><p><em>(because I don’t like when people criticize something without giving a reasonable alternative).</em><br></p><p>In those 2 days I came up with the idea for <a href="https://lttlmg.ht/bestself">BestSelf</a>, bought the domain BestSelf.co and created a whole branding package. Thankfully there was no pushback, ‘A’ agreed it was a better name and we moved forward.<br></p><p>We launched the Kickstarter campaign in August 2015. I had experience with launching Kickstarter campaigns in the past and so I had a formula for how to do it which helped us a lot. You can read how we did it <a href="https://littlemight.com/articles/kickstarter-step-by-step" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></p><p><strong>We funded in 28 hours and over the course of 34 days we raised over $322,000 which was enough to both create the product for backers and launch the entire business.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5ea0cb1d0f854b10467cf739_5e2a2251be4a7438101d60a6_image.png" alt="funding progress graph"></p></figure><p>We launched our online store in January 2016 and the business continued to grow.

Then the pandemic starts and you find out what your relationship is really made of.<br></p><p>By late 2016, while professionally things were still good with the business, cracks began appearing in our personal relationship… the 2016 election was a definite factor here. That was the first time it became clear how differently we saw the world and how opposite our backgrounds were.<br></p><p>In 2017, we’d hired out the majority of his role in marketing and by April 2018 he had stepped away from all business operations - informally anyway.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By informally I mean there was never a discussion of him passing the baton and stepping out, he just suddenly was no longer there. But he was still taking as much money out of the company as I was -- or more.<br></p><p><strong>As you can imagine being a 50/50 partner where one partner is working full-time and the other is completely disconnected is tough — really tough. I was essentially hamstrung on big decisions and company direction. </strong></p><p>And anything I could decide could be overwritten or debated even after I thought it was settled. The same went for team members, as every now and again he'd jump on calls, start giving advice or instruction (without knowing what was even happening) and cause frustration and confusion with team members. </p><p>By early 2019, I was becoming resentful as our distributions were still 50/50 <strong>but I wasn’t getting any salary for the 60+ hour weeks of time I was putting in. </strong>When I brought it up to him, as if he were my boss, he would say <em>“I don’t equate time with value,”</em> yet he wasn’t giving either to the company.<br></p><p>At the same time as he would reject my salary request, he’d post stuff like this on his Instagram:</p><figure id="w-node-be8cd5eaae18-3448d0da"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea0c87d3db0d2d23479ff47/5f873b98bd121731d6cf0d21_3-hour-week.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h6>Here's a tip, if someone’s telling you running a business is easy — they’re either lying, or trying to <strong>sell</strong> you something.<br></h6><p>In the case of ‘A’, it was both.<br></p><p>Each video “guru” post he’d share taking credit for work that wasn’t his &nbsp;felt like a slap in the face — not just to me but,&nbsp; more importantly, to the team. <strong>Being under-paid (or not paid at all) is one thing, but having my value be dismissed on top of that was actually the bigger issue -- and was the beginning of the end.</strong><br></p><p>I ended up removing him on all social media platforms in mid 2019 because posts like the one above were triggering me.<br></p><p>By July 2019, we finally agreed on a modest salary for me in lieu of taking distributions which I would be made up for later.

We will compare the two at the end and see how performant each and when we can use one and not the other in terms of speed especially if we’re processing a large CSV file. In the last blog post, we talked about <a href="https://www.ezzeddinabdullah.com/posts/how-to-clean-text-data-at-the-command-line" target="_blank">how to clean text data at the command line</a> that I recommend to have a look at.</p><h2>Downloading COVID&nbsp;data from covidtracking</h2><p>Let's first download recent coronavirus data across the United States from <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/download">COVID Tracking Project</a> which is a volunteer organization dedicated to collecting and publishing the data required to understand the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. Btw, The data is published under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons CC BY 4.0</a> license.</p><p>Let's do this by downloading the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv">CSV&nbsp;file manually</a> or using <em>curl</em>:</p><div><pre>$ curl -LO https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv
</pre></div><p><strong>-LO </strong>is a combination of <strong>-L&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>-O</strong></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>-L </strong>is used to make sure if the URL&nbsp;has changed to another location, <em>curl</em> will redo the request on the new redirection link</li><li><strong>-O </strong>this option is used to create an output file of the same name of the requested file name which is <strong>all-states-history.csv </strong>here</li></ul><h2>Printing the CSV&nbsp;file headers</h2><p>Let's first print what column names we have for this <em>all-states.history.csv </em>file:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -n all-states-history.csv

</pre></div><p>As you can see, using <strong>csvcut </strong>with the option <strong>-n </strong>can list all the headers we have with their associated order which can help us select some specific columns that we're interested in.</p><h2>Selecting specific columns</h2><p>In this tutorial, we're interested in four columns and these are their descriptions as reported by the COVID&nbsp;Tracking&nbsp;Project:</p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>data:&nbsp;Date on which data was collected by The COVID Tracking Project.</li><li>state: Two-letter abbreviation for the state or territory.</li><li>positive: Total number of <strong>confirmed plus probable cases</strong> of COVID-19 reported by the state or territory</li><li>death:&nbsp;Total <strong>fatalities with confirmed OR probable COVID-19 case diagnosis</strong><br></li></ol><p>Let's see how we can get the first 10 lines of these 4 columns in our CSV&nbsp;file at the command line:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c date,state,positive,death all-states-history.csv | head | csvlook 
|       date | state | positive |  death |
| ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| 2020-10-26 | AK    |   14,413 |     68 |
| 2020-10-26 | AL    |  185,322 |  2,866 |
| 2020-10-26 | AR    |  106,727 |  1,833 |
| 2020-10-26 | AS    |        0 |      0 |

| 2020-10-26 | DC    |   16,812 |    642 |
</pre></div><p>So <strong>csvcut </strong>with the option <strong>-c </strong>is used here to select the upcoming columns separated by commas. These 10 lines look better aligned with <strong>csvlook</strong></p><p>Note that we could've done that with either of the following commands:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c 1,2,22,4 all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m CA |head | csvlook
$ csvcut -c 1-2,22,4 all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m CA |head | csvlook
$ csvcut -c 1-2,positive,4 all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m CA |head | csvlook
</pre></div><p>Meaning you can select the columns with their numbers or ranges or a combination of numbers and column names as strings.</p><p>Take care that this CSV&nbsp;data may differ from yours if you're using the recent data from the COVID&nbsp;Tracking Project on another day than the day this tutorial was written.</p><h2>Filtering information</h2><p>Let's now filter out COVID&nbsp;data at California state:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c date,state,positive,death all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m AL | head | csvlook

</pre></div><p>We used here <strong>csvgrep</strong> with the option <strong>-c </strong>to select the column that we’re filtering which is the <em>state </em>here to match <em>AL</em> using <strong>-m </strong>option that matches the pattern we search for.</p><p>I'd like to make sure of this data, so I&nbsp;went to Google and asked how many cases we have at Alabama and this is the answer:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f988fc5968f41509e41fbfe_Screen%20Shot%202020-10-27%20at%2011.22.07%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image by the Author</figcaption></figure><p>Looks like the data reported by the COVID Tracking Project is close to what Google is reporting having 186K positive cases and 2892 fatalities.</p><p>If you also put another column to show the increase in the positive cases from the previous day, you'd find:</p><div><pre>$ csvcut -c date,state,positive,24,death all-states-history.csv | csvgrep -c state -m AL | head | csvlook

<p>As part of a continued series of blog posts themed about “Relational databases and NoSQL”,
Dr. Michael Stonebraker and I co-authored a new blog post just published on
<a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/universal-relation-data-modelling-considered-harmful">EnterpriseDB’s blog</a>.</p>
<p>This post discusses the “Universal Relation” data model, which has become trendier recently under
the name of “Single Table Design”, and is frequently used and recommended in DynamoDB. We discuss a sample
DynamoDB application, and run a benchmark analyzing potential conflicts with DynamoDB transactions.

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> All right, so, it’s my pleasure today to sit down and have a conversation with Dominick LoBraico about email. In particular, we’re going to talk about a system that Dominick architected and led the development of called Mailcore, which is Jane Street’s own homegrown mail server. </p><p> And I think this is interesting on its own because email is an interesting topic and the whole architecture behind it, but I think it’s also a lens into some interesting questions about software design and how you manage infrastructure, some questions about how you make this choice of when you build your own thing and when you use standard, existing tools, and also some interesting questions about how programming language plays a role in systems design.</p></div>

<h2 id="000048">00:00:48</h2>

<p>Hi, Ron.</p>

<h2 id="000049">00:00:49</h2>

<p>Hey, DLo. So, to get started, can you tell us a little bit about how email works?</p>

<h2 id="000054">00:00:54</h2>

<div><p>Sure. Yeah. So email is based on an old and venerable protocol on the Internet called the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, SMTP, and SMTP… you can kind of think of it as playing the role that the Postal Service plays in delivering regular mail. It is a way for one server that wants to deliver a message somewhere, to hand that message off to another party, who can get it to its final destination, whether that is the eventual destination server itself or some intermediary who can help you get a little bit closer.
</p><p>Email itself came into fruition, as we know today, in the early days of the Internet, and the protocol itself is very simple. You basically have the actual body of the message itself, which has its own separate format and specification, and then you have a set of instructions for expressing who that message is destined for and who it’s coming from, and so one server connects to another.
</p><p>And it says, “I’ve got a message. It’s coming from so and so, and it’s meant to be delivered to some other person. Here’s the body of the message,” and the receiving server can do with that what it will. It can either say, “Great, I’ll take that, and I’ll be responsible for it from here on out.” It can say, “No, I don’t know anything about that person. You have to find somebody else to deliver that to” or reject it for any number of other reasons, like, “This looks like it has a virus,” or “You’re not allowed to connect to me,” or “I’m not available for receiving mail right now.”</p></div>

<h2 id="000217">00:02:17</h2>

<p>And one thing that always strikes me about email is it’s this kind of wondrous artifact from the early Internet, which is a <em>truly</em> open social network. There’s lots of things that people talk about, right? Could we make existing social networks better and more open and all of that, and email, just <em>is</em> from its initial design; and its complete history has been this very open thing, and as you point out, the core protocols and transports are relatively simple, although there is actually a surprising amount of complexity in the RFCs that tell you how to parse a particular email. The overall system is pretty simple, but there’s a lot of complexity in all of the different players who build systems that actually manage and transfer email around and how they deal with the various problems that happen, like spam and people attacking systems via email and all of that. So the foundations are relatively simple, but the emergent complexity of the system is actually pretty high.</p>

<h2 id="000310">00:03:10</h2>

<p>Like with many protocols of the old Internet, it was designed in a time where the world was much simpler than it is today, especially the Internet-connected world. You know, there were probably 50 institutions that had Internet connections or ARPANET connections at the time, and you didn’t really have to worry that anybody was going to be spamming because barely anybody even know what email was in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="000330">00:03:30</h2>

<div><p>When you start and build a new thing, the early properties of the thing that you build can often be really sticky and really matter in a way that’s kind of hard to predict. So this one early property of being open has stayed there. Email is a thing that anyone can participate in. Organizations can build their own infrastructure to connect to it, and through all the rather large transformations that the email system has gone through, that openness remains as a core property.
</p><p>This is the horrible thing about designing to build a new thing,  when you want to design something new, you have to make a bunch of choices, and clearly, you shouldn’t worry about them that much, because probably the thing you build is going to fail and isn’t going to work out, and even if it does, you’re going to learn more about the problem later, and so you shouldn’t worry too much about the early decisions. But also, some of the early decisions, you don’t know which ones are going to turn out to be very hard to change.</p></div>

<h2 id="000413">00:04:13</h2>

<p>That’s right.</p>

<h2 id="000414">00:04:14</h2>

<p>And you’ll be stuck with them until the end of time.</p>

<h2 id="000416">00:04:16</h2>

<p>And in fact, you know, the big players in email today – obviously Google and Gmail, are a really large percentage of the email sending and receiving on the Internet – but they’re still wrestling with some of those early decisions and some of that openness that are architected in, as they try to figure out how they can make email more secure and how they can protect their users and rein in some of the malicious actors on the Internet, and that’s just a hard thing to do while trying to maintain the existing openness that email has; it cuts both ways I guess.</p>

<h2 id="000445">00:04:45</h2>

<p>That openness, in the end, has a lot of value.</p>

<h2 id="000446">00:04:46</h2>

<p>Absolutely. Yeah.</p>

<h2 id="000448">00:04:48</h2>

<p>So the story here is about how you ended up building the system called Mailcore. What did email at Jane Street look like when you first ran into the problem?</p>

<h2 id="000456">00:04:56</h2>

<div><p>So you might think that there’s really not much special about the way Jane Street uses email compared to any other company, and largely, that’s true. I think we have a few special requirements by dint of the fact that we are in a regulated industry, so we have some requirements around logging for compliance purposes every message that is sent or received by somebody at Jane Street.
</p><p>But other than that, our email system looks pretty similar, or has looked, in the past, pretty similar, to the way an email system in any organization might look, and the rough summary is we have some mail gateways that sit on the outside of our network for receiving email from foreign servers, you know, from external parties, and then we have some mail server, or a set of servers, inside of our network that handle all of the complicated business logic around what to do with those messages.
</p><p>So, in some cases, it’s as simple as receive the message and deliver it into the mailbox of the user if we are the intended recipient. In other cases, it is apply filtering for things like spam and viruses and other things that we might want to extract from messages before we deliver them, do expansion for mailing lists. So if you send an email to some group at Jane Street, you want to be able to expand that group name to the actual list of recipient mailboxes to make sure that it actually ends up in the inboxes of the recipients who it’s destined for. And then this extra compliance implication of making sure that we’re logging all of the right messages with all of the right metadata. </p><p>And at the time that I started, the mail infrastructure here was all based on an open source mail server that has its own config language and is pretty widely used on the Internet at large, and we had about 400 or 500 lines of configuration in the most complex case, I think, for this system to get it to do all of these different things that we wanted it to be able to do.</p></div>

<h2 id="000644">00:06:44</h2>

<p>Great. So that sounds like a reasonable approach in terms of how to build oneself a mail system. What problems did we run into with it?</p>

<h2 id="000650">00:06:50</h2>

<div><p>Yeah, so the biggest problem here, at the end of the day, was the complexity required for configuring this system to do all of the things that we needed it to do. So, now, I said 400 or 500 lines of configuration – that probably doesn’t sound like a huge number, but when it’s in a kind of bespoke configuration language that’s unlike the configuration of any other system and unlike any programming language that a developer or engineer at Jane Street would be familiar with, the complexity of 400 or 500 lines in a foreign language is pretty large and can be a little bit imposing to deal with.
</p><p>In particular, we had some scary near-misses where we realized that we had done the wrong thing in terms of archiving some email for compliance purposes that we were supposed to archive, and luckily, in each of those cases, there were mitigating factors such that it didn’t end up being a big deal, but that near-miss gave us a little bit of a scare because we went and looked at the configuration and wanted to understand how we had gotten ourselves into this position, and it was harder than it felt like it should be to understand what had gone wrong and how to fix it.</p></div>

<h2 id="000750">00:07:50</h2>

<p>It’s maybe also worth mentioning that the problem of logging all of your messages for compliance purposes may sound easy, but it’s made more complicated by the fact that Jane Street is a company that operates in lots of different regulatory regimes and has actually different rules for some of the different places it operates. So even the sort of seemingly simple, “Let’s just write everything down” is more complicated than it might appear at first.</p>

<h2 id="000811">00:08:11</h2>

<p>That’s right, yeah. We have different requirements in terms of what has to be written down and what kinds of metadata we need to store and where the extra copies need to be physically located around the world and things like that, which are reasonable sounding when you think about the human aspects of it, you know, when you reason about, okay, yeah, you need a copy for this and a …</p></div></div>

Since then, we’ve gone from a deck and a provisional patent to a team of 12+, a lead drug, and a head brimming with new knowledge and experiences. These are some of my biggest learnings in the last year. </p><h3>Small decisions compound exponentially, especially around team &amp; culture</h3><p>One of the most important things I ever did for our culture was a mistake. The week before a key proof-of-concept study, I decided to completely rework the study design and re-question all of our assumptions. This delayed our timelines and made most of our previous work moot. It also saved the study. </p><p>That was a show not tell moment with our values - it showed the team that truth seeking is the most important thing, and no one has to be scared to tell me if they want to change up something last minute (because I did it myself!). This paved the way to many other close saves. </p><h3>For key relationships, make sure motivations are aligned</h3><p>From investors and advisors to contractors and employees, taking time to understand to fully empathize with their priorities and worries, and not automatically assuming that their motivations are the same as yours, was a hard lesson to embody. As a stereotypical bombastic founder, it was hard for me to comprehend someone <em>not </em>being mission-motivated and not wanting this in the world as badly as I do.</p><p>In hiring, I’ve found that even the most talented person will not perform well if they don’t deeply and truly care about your mission (at least at this stage of the company). In professional relationships, it’s unlikely their motivation is the same as yours, but often motivations can be complimentary. Everything is so much easier when they are. </p><h3>Most catchy startup advice has layers of nuance and conditionals that you wont realize until you’re in the thick of it</h3><p>I hit this one a lot this year, a likely consequence from listening to a few too many startup podcasts. A good example is ‘hire fast, fire fast’. Generally good advice, in my opinion. But no one tells you how difficult it is to execute on that advice, the accusations you’ll face from the person or others, the emotional toll of making a decision that affects someone’s wellbeing, and the ripple effects a firing, even if necessary, can have on the team and how to deal with that. Correct advice? Totally. But far from the full picture. One of my biggest learnings this year was becoming aware of and starting to learn how to predict the nuance and conditionals around things that seem simple from the outside. </p><h3>The line between optimism and naïveté is a wide as a hair </h3><p>To do novel hard things requires optimism that you have some key insight or ability that means you can achieve what others haven’t. You need to be optimistic to trudge through the sludge and to recruit others to your crazy idea long before it’s proven. Naive optimism is so important for building a company and telling a story. But you also need to be paranoid and see around corners. </p><p>Balancing these is difficult - too optimistic and you’ll fall into a trap, too paranoid and you’ll never make a decision. Over the last year, I’ve gained a healthy respect for the challenges ahead of us, moving my natural tendency of optimism a few inches closer to paranoia. I think this will serve us well on this next stage of our journey. </p><p>For me, the hardest part of this was realizing that the optimal balance between optimism and realism differs depending on the situation; what works when facing investors doesn’t work when recruiting, and these two situations differ significantly to the balance you need to hold internally. </p></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p>
      Proposition 24 is a 52-page law that overhauls privacy laws in California. It's so complex that it has split the privacy community, and experts disagree about what it would mean for Californians. Most voices agree Prop 24 has some changes to love, and some to reject. The typical voter is probably very uncertain about whether to vote "Yes" or "No".
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <strong>San Diego Privacy</strong>, a small group of privacy advocates in San Diego, and we'd like to help by offering a neutral analysis. Below you'll find 10 of the biggest issues with Prop 24, along with the main points supporters (the "Yes" side) and opponents (the "No" side) make about that issue.
    </p>
    <p>We suggest you first pick the issues in purple that jump out to you the most. Then, keep count of whether you find the Yes side or the No side more compelling, for the issues you've picked. Last, total up your counts.</p>
    <p>Then, as always, go vote your values.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Update</i></strong>: When you pick the issues below that matter to you, consider <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSWtcqBEbe-SOUUWZ9d7j_M3Ft1ap5CR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">downloading a shareable image</a> of that issue as well, and posting it on social media to generate discussion.</p>

                <strong>Pay for Privacy</strong> means that if you demand privacy, companies can charge you more for goods and services.

        Authors' Note: This is a good place to note that many privacy advocates believe all efforts to collect your data should require affirmative consent from you, rather than using the "opt-out" model where companies collect your data first, and then require you to ask it be deleted or not collected.

            <p>I'm concerned about privacy law <strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                Current privacy laws in California are rarely <strong>enforced.</strong> Only the California Attorney General can enforce California's privacy laws.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>California previous privacy agency was previously closed during budget cuts.</li>
                <li>The California attorney general has signaled that they don't have enough resources for enforcement.</li>
                <li>The California attorney general has asked the legislature to allow individuals the right to sue to enforce their privacy.</li>
              </ul>

                <li>Argues individuals should be able to sue companies to enforce their privacy choices, but Prop 24 left that out.</li>
                  <li>Believes the new enforcement agency established by Prop 24 would be underfunded and ineffective.</li>

              <div>
                <p>
                    Private right of action (the right for individuals to sue) is desired by many privacy organizations, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/why-eff-doesnt-support-cal-prop-24#:~:text=no%20enforcement%20by%20consumers" target="_blank">including the EFF</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Opponents stated their objection to Prop 24's new enforcement agency in <a href="https://youtu.be/DuWspeTzOA0?t=780" target="_blank">their video interview</a> with the Union-Tribune.

        Authors' Note: Privacy advocates feel very strongly that Californians should have the "private right of action," or the right to sue companies to enforce privacy law. It seems to us unlikely that privacy organizations will support overhauls to California's privacy laws without that private right of action being included.

            <p>I'm concerned about <strong>How Prop 24 Was Created</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                Prop 24 is a 52-page law with so much complexity that even experts disagree on its meaning. It was written privately and then submitted directly to voters.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Alastair Mactaggart wrote Prop 24. It has not been reviewed by the legislature.</li>
                <li>Mactaggart invited some industries to provide changes to Prop 24 as it was drafted.</li>
                <li>Mactaggart helped get California's existing CCPA privacy law passed through the legislature.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p><a>What's the deal with Prop 24's origins?</a>

                <p>Yes Side Says:</p>
                <li>Argues privacy laws are under assault by lobbyists, and Prop 24 is the fastest way to stop that.</li>
                  <li>Warns that there isn't enough enforcement of existing privacy laws, and that Prop 24 provides more enforcement.</li>

                <p>No Side Says:</p>
                <li>Argues existing privacy laws only started to be enforced three months ago, and that it's too soon to overhaul those privacy laws.</li>
                  <li>Believes the legislature should write and pass future privacy laws, not private parties.</li>
                  <li>Warns that privacy organizations were excluded from writing Prop 24, but that industries were invited.</li>

      <p>
        Authors' Note: Due to the way this law is being proposed directly to voters, rather than going through the long process of the legislature, there are a lot of experts disagreeing with each other regarding Prop 24's implications.

            <div>
              <p>
                Prop 24 classifies some types of data as "sensitive," such as race, sexual orientation and precise GPS coordinates, and restricts how companies can use them.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Prop 24 sets up a new class of information called Sensitive Information.</li>
                <li>Sensitive information includes: precise geolocation; race; ethnicity; religion; genetic data; private communications; sexual orientation; and specified health information.</li>
                <li>Fines are tripled for violations of the law for children under the age of 16.</li>

		<p>Since I live in a different town from my family, the holidays are the majority of the time I get to spend with my twelve year-old brother (we have a 17 year age gap).</p>
<p>Now that he’s nearly a teenager, he’s almost the age I was when I started thinking independently from family and friends. For me, a big part of that was discovering Paul Graham’s essays. Hopefully one day my brother reads through them (but I won’t force him).</p>
<p>This got me thinking: if I were to recommend them to him, would I want him to read them chronologically? Or should I point him to specific essays based on his interests?</p>
<p>Alternatively, if one were to compile all of Paul’s essays into a collection or a <i>Hackers and Painters</i> sequel, how would it be organized?</p>
<p>So below is my attempt at tagging Paul Graham’s essays by subject matter.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/675336d96deabd0007621a71180bcfb57edb6b11/805fd/images/2020-04-04-porsche_classifier/718.jpg" alt="porsche-718"></p>

<p>Trained using <a href="https://fast.ai/">fastai-v3</a>, <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch</a> and <a href="https://gradient.paperspace.com/">Gradient</a>.
Uses <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/resnet50.html">resnet50</a> and trained on a <a href="https://images.nvidia.com/content/pdf/quadro/data-sheets/192195-DS-NV-Quadro-P5000-US-12Sept-NV-FNL-WEB.pdf">Nvidia Quadro P5000</a>.
Built on <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/app-service/web/">Microsoft Azure Web Services</a>.
Trained on a dataset of publicly sourced images containing 30000 Porsche car models of varying degree of quality.
Porsche cars, specially the latest generations of the Panamera/Taycan, Macan/Cayenne &amp; 911 / 718 can be pretty tricky to tell apart for a layman who isn’t paying very close attention, which is why I wanted to test out what kind of features this deep learning model would pick up.</p>

<h3 id="creating-your-own-dataset-from-google-images">Creating your own dataset from Google Images</h3>

<p>In this tutorial we will see how to easily create an image dataset through Google Images. Note: You will have to repeat these steps for any new category you want to Google (e.g once for dogs and once for cats).</p>
<div><pre>```python
from fastai.vision import *
```</pre></div>
<h4 id="get-a-list-of-urls">Get a list of URLs</h4>

<h5 id="search-and-scroll">Search and scroll</h5>

<p>Go to Google Images and search for the images you are interested in. The more specific you are in your Google Search, the better the results and the less manual pruning you will have to do.</p>

<p>Scroll down until you’ve seen all the images you want to download, or until you see a button that says ‘Show more results’. All the images you scrolled past are now available to download. To get more, click on the button, and continue scrolling. The maximum number of images Google Images shows is 700.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to put things you want to exclude into the search query, for instance if you are searching for the Eurasian wolf, “canis lupus lupus”, it might be a good idea to exclude other variants:</p>

<p>“canis lupus lupus” -dog -arctos -familiaris -baileyi -occidentalis</p>

<p>You can also limit your results to show only photos by clicking on Tools and selecting Photos from the Type dropdown.</p>

<h3 id="download-into-file">Download into file</h3>

<p>Now you must run some Javascript code in your browser which will save the URLs of all the images you want for you dataset.</p>

<p>In Google Chrome press CtrlShiftj on Windows/Linux and CmdOptj on macOS, and a small window the javascript ‘Console’ will appear. In Firefox press CtrlShiftk on Windows/Linux or CmdOptk on macOS. That is where you will paste the JavaScript commands.</p>

<p>You will need to get the urls of each of the images. Before running the following commands, you may want to disable ad blocking extensions (uBlock, AdBlockPlus etc.) in Chrome. Otherwise the window.open() command doesn’t work. Then you can run the following commands:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">urls<span>=</span>Array<span>.</span>from(document<span>.</span>querySelectorAll(<span>'.rg_i'</span>))<span>.</span><span>map</span>(el<span>=&gt;</span> el<span>.</span>hasAttribute(<span>'data-src'</span>)?el<span>.</span>getAttribute(<span>'data-src'</span>):el<span>.</span>getAttribute(<span>'data-iurl'</span>));
window<span>.</span><span>open</span>(<span>'data:text/csv;charset=utf-8,'</span> <span>+</span> escape(urls<span>.</span>join(<span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)));</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-directory-and-upload-urls-file-into-your-server">Create directory and upload urls file into your server</h3>

<p>Choose an appropriate name for your labeled images. You can run these steps multiple times to create different labels.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'718'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'718.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'911'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'911.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'cayenne'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'cayenne.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'macan'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'macan.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'taycan'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'taycan.csv'</span>
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    folder <span>=</span> <span>'panamera'</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>'panamera.csv'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will need to run this cell once per each category.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    In [<span>0</span>]:
    path <span>=</span> Path(<span>'data/porsche'</span>)
    dest <span>=</span> path<span>/</span>folder
    dest<span>.</span>mkdir(parents<span>=</span><span>True</span>, exist_ok<span>=</span><span>True</span>)
    In [<span>0</span>]:
    path<span>.</span>ls()
    Out[<span>0</span>]:
    [PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/cayenne'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/panamera.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/cayenne.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/panamera'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/taycan'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/911.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/taycan.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/911'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/macan.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/718'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/718.csv'</span>),
     PosixPath(<span>'data/porsche/macan'</span>)]</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, upload your urls file. You just need to press ‘Upload’ in your working directory and select your file, then click ‘Upload’ for each of the displayed files.</p>

<p><code>uploaded file</code></p>

<h3 id="download-images">Download images</h3>

<p>Now you will need to download your images from their respective urls.</p>

<p>fast.ai has a function that allows you to do just that. You just have to specify the urls filename as well as the destination folder and this function will download and save all images that can be opened. If they have some problem in being opened, they will not be saved.</p>

<p>Let’s download our images! Notice you can choose a maximum number of images to be downloaded. In this case we will not download all the urls.</p>

<p>You will need to run this line once for every category.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">In [<span>0</span>]:
classes <span>=</span> [<span>'taycan'</span>,<span>'panamera'</span>,<span>'macan'</span>,<span>'cayenne'</span>,<span>'718'</span>,<span>'911'</span>]
In [<span>0</span>]:
download_images(path<span>/</span><span>file</span>, dest, max_pics<span>=</span><span>500</span>)

    In [<span>0</span>]:
    <span># If you have problems download, try with `max_workers=0` to see exceptions:</span>
    download_images(path<span>/</span><span>file</span>, dest, max_pics<span>=</span><span>20</span>, max_workers<span>=</span><span>0</span>)
    <span>``</span>`

Then we can remove <span>any</span> images that can<span>'t be opened:</span>
<span>`python In [0]: for c in classes: print(c) verify_images(path/c, delete=True, max_size=500) taycan panamera macan cayenne 718 911`</span>

<span>### View data</span>

<span>    ```python</span>
<span>    In [0]:</span>
<span>    np.random.seed(42)</span>
<span>    data = ImageDataBunch.from_folder(path, train=".", valid_pct=0.2,</span>
<span>            ds_tfms=get_transforms(), size=224, num_workers=4).normalize(imagenet_stats)</span>

<span>    In [0]:</span>
<span>    #If you already cleaned your data, run this cell instead of the one before</span>
<span>     np.random.seed(42)</span>
<span>     data = ImageDataBunch.from_csv(path, folder=".", valid_pct=0.2, csv_labels='</span>cleaned<span>.</span>csv<span>',</span>
<span>             ds_tfms=get_transforms(), size=224, num_workers=4).normalize(imagenet_stats)</span>
<span>    ```</span>

<span>Good! Let'</span>s take a look at some of our pictures then<span>.</span>
<span>``</span>`python

Some of our top losses aren<span>'t due to bad performance by our model. There are images in our data set that shouldn'</span>t be<span>.</span>

Using the ImageCleaner widget <span>from</span> fastai.widgets we can prune our top losses, removing photos that don<span>'t belong.</span>

<span>```</span>

<span>In [0]:</span>
<span>from fastai.widgets import \*</span>

<span>```</span>
<span>First we need to get the file paths from our top_losses. We can do this with .from_toplosses. We then feed the top losses indexes and corresponding dataset to ImageCleaner.</span>

<span>Notice that the widget will not delete images directly from disk but it will create a new csv file cleaned.csv from where you can create a new ImageDataBunch with the corrected labels to continue training your model.</span>
<span>```</span>

<span>In [0]:</span>
<span>db = (ImageList.from_folder(path)</span>
<span>.split_none()</span>
<span>.label_from_folder()</span>
<span>.transform(get_transforms(), size=224)</span>
<span>.databunch()</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>In [0]:</span>

<span># If you already cleaned your data using indexes from `from_toplosses`,</span>

<span># run this cell instead of the one before to proceed with removing duplicates.</span>

<span># Otherwise all the results of the previous step would be overwritten by</span>

<span># the new run of `ImageCleaner`.</span>

<span>db = (ImageList.from_csv(path, '</span>cleaned<span>.</span>csv<span>', folder='</span><span>.</span><span>')</span>
<span>.split_none()</span>
<span>.label_from_df()</span>
<span>.transform(get_transforms(), size=224)</span>
<span>.databunch()</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>```</span>
<span>Then we create a new learner to use our new databunch with all the images.</span>

    <article>

        

        <section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>This post is a bundle of thoughts on the near future of Augmented Reality implementations, ways of integration, and introducing new layers of cognition. We are going to talk about AR as a way of enabling transhumanism by broadening the human cognitive and sensory toolbox.<br>
We are not going to be concerned with what is and what is not technologically possible at the moment.</p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Have you ever taken a walk and thought about all the accessible information on animals, plants, objects, or even people? How much information is available on the internet? How many facts have you encountered and already forgotten?</p>
<p>Ancient Greeks put an active effort into training and maintaining their memorizing capabilities, and already at this stage of progress, human memory is shifting – or has shifted from remembering facts to remembering how and where to find facts. We are keeping less and less information hardcoded in our permanent memory and are in turn learning how to<br>
consume, process, and find useful data in an endless stream of information and misinformation.</p>
<p>A technologically proficient user has access to a vast volume and spectrum of data at his/her disposal, sitting right in the pocket. The human approach to holding knowledge is evolving as we speak. Heck, it started evolving with the invention of speech. But another significant<br>
change is on the cusp of happening. Our mobile phone interfaces, while serving all the information we need, are still detached from us, having considerable latency when we need to find, show, or input data. With the introduction of AR, AI, and human-computer interfaces, everything is about to change. AR or human augmentation in general will make that data<br>
more accessible and drastically lessen the latency needed for the interaction, making the tools feel more and more as part of ourselves.</p>
<p>Imagine walking down the street. You look around to observe people on the street and notifications start popping up alongside people’s heads. For one person the message says:<br>
"You have seen this person three times this week already"; for another one it states:<br>
"You have five mutual connections and common interests".<br>
Those notifications could also tell you if the person is willing to make new connections, based on previously shared data or facial microexpression analysis. Maybe we have gone too far down the rabbit hole for now, but you<br>
get the idea.</p>
<h3 id="definingarandtranshumanism">Defining AR and Transhumanism</h3>
<p>Merriam-Webster defines Augmented Reality as "an enhanced version of reality created by the use of technology to overlay digital information on an image of something being viewed through a device (such as a smartphone camera)". For the purposes of this post, I would like us not to limit reality to human vision alone.</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster has no definition for Transhumanism, but Wikipedia defines it as a philosophical movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.</p>
<p>The two are getting more and more intertwined as technology advances, so I would like us to redefine AR, if only for this post, as "any technology that enhances or expands the human experience of reality", or maybe even as "practical transhumanism".</p>
<h3 id="augmentationtechnologymilestones">Augmentation technology milestones</h3>
<p>These are some freely set milestones for AR technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>LVL 0 – environment emulation via VR – for developmental fast-tracking</li>
<li>LVL 1 – external IO devices – headsets, glasses, gloves</li>
<li>LVL 2 – embedded IO devices – lenses, external neural signal readers</li>
<li>LVL 3 – tapping into existing sensory and neural networks</li>
<li>LVL 4 – registering new input/output devices in neural networks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="degreesofaugmentation">Degrees of augmentation</h3>
<p>For the time being, and at least until we master the LVL 4 milestone described above, we are not creating new sensory or actuation systems, we are only hijacking the existing ones. Hi, Neuralink ;). This means that with every bit of information we gain, we are blocking the bandwidth and use for our existing IO mechanisms.In all fairness, people recovering mobility after a severe head trauma are evidence that the brain could possess enough plasticity to use whatever is thrown at it, given we connect the right dots, have enough time and practice. User age could also be a part of the equation.<br>
Sounds easier than it is, I know.</p>
<p>So, the more we augment our existing senses, the more we obstruct our basic physical-world data flow, the need to set some design restriction guidelines will grow. We still have accidents while using mobile phones or headphones, so the question arises: how could we manage a society full of people that overlap and fully cover their field of vision and hearing?<br>
Some safety rules integrated into the tech would be quite handy. Here is an example of defining degrees of augmentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>No augmentation</li>
<li>Info - can be an overlay, but should not block much sensory bandwidth</li>
<li>Safe communication – headset equivalent</li>
<li>Immersive experience – not safe for driving, safe for outdoors</li>
<li>Fully overlaying sensory input with enabled alerts – public safe zones</li>
<li>Fully overlaying sensory input – only for safe zones at home</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="augmentationusagecategories">Augmentation usage categories</h3>
<h4 id="knowledgemanagement">Knowledge management</h4>
<p>At some point, AR should enable access to data from the internet, which should be retrieved and presented without too much user effort, based on surrounding situations and context. Also, the useful data should be categorized and stored for retrieval at a later time.<br>
The interface should be able to combine relevant data and present solutions, statistics, and probabilities.</p>
<p>This could also enable saving verifiable event recordings, snapshots, and transcripts, real-time language translation, or seeing blueprints and instructions while fixing devices.</p>
<h4 id="extendingsensoryreach">Extending sensory reach</h4>
<p>The human sensory reach is already drastically extended with the use of IoT and the internet in general, but there is so much more of existing tech to be integrated into an AR system to extend human senses. Users could see and feel if their home or possessions are safe, or more generally, sense physical-world information streams in real-time.<br>
For example, physical-world data can be processed in parallel with the user experiencing the immediate surroundings. Thus, the user would, for instance, return home and detect certain objects have been moved, etc.</p>
<h4 id="extendingphysicalactuationactionreach">Extending physical actuation/action reach</h4>
<p>Besides our physical reach, most of us have already experienced controlling or affecting the physical-world at a distance. AR could help make the world around us feel more like an extension of our physical bodies.<br>
We could run automated processes upon visual triggers, i.e. unlock the front door without thinking, or control devices, drones, and robotics with ease.</p>
<h4 id="communicationandindividuality">Communication and individuality</h4>
<p>Communication could also be streamlined. We could have an instant connection with anyone around the world, almost as if standing side by side. Communication could play out on several levels, depending on the level of technological advancement, and could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restrained – messages and recordings with a delay and opportunity for curation</li>
<li>Unrestrained – conservative – real-time audio-visual communication</li>
<li>Unrestrained – progressive – direct thought transfer in a Neuralink-like brain-computer interface manner</li>
</ul>
<p>We could socialize, play games, or work like never before:<br>
imagine coding while sharing your thought process with a colleague, and also having an "AI" assisted IDE.</p>
<h4 id="extendingthecognitiontoolbox">Extending the cognition toolbox</h4>
<p>Given having a portable AR system and a smart enough underlying OS that replicates our surroundings and anticipates our needs OR an efficient enough way of selecting and using computational tools, we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>see object trajectories</li>
<li>have perfect math at our disposal</li>
<li>know objects, plant life, animals, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI or General AI could, if available, also be used as an intermediary to the available cognition toolbox, to serve the necessary tools and results to the end-user.</p>
<h4 id="pastimeandentertainment">Pastime and entertainment</h4>
<p>I won’t go into great detail here, VR games are already immersive and fun, but try to imagine what they would be like if some freedom is added to the mix. As games and entertainment are presumably most likely to require as much immersion as possible, it will be necessary to consider immersion safety.</p>
<h5 id="vrgamesandapsfullyoverlayingsensoryinput">VR games and APS - fully overlaying sensory input</h5>
<p>Cars, stairs, sudden drops, and obstacles are here to stay, so for any device that can write over your sensory input, a way to risk mitigation must be in place.</p>
<h5 id="endusersafetyzonecalibration">End user safety zone calibration</h5>
<p>Imagine you want to play a full-on VR game somewhere. How could you stay safe and not trip over something or fall over some curb? It is simple, you could just walk around your playground to define its contours and limits. A certain amount of space can even be taken out of the outer limits of the playground, any obstacles are reproduced in-game so you can navigate past them. You start the game and play, and in case you move to the outer limits, the game simply starts to fade away.</p>
<h5 id="safesurfaces">Safe surfaces</h5>
<p>OK, but where else could you use 100% augmentation opacity in the real world? The first thing that comes to mind as safe would be walls. You can project stuff in front of almost any wall and be sure that nothing you can’t see will hit you from that direction, or at least as sure as you are now.</p>
<h5 id="contentkillswitch">Content killswitch</h5>
<p>Another useful feature would be to have the immersive content stop when quiet time or rest is needed, as well as if stress levels are critical.</p>
<h3 id="pitfallsofarandhumanaugmentation">Pitfalls of AR and Human augmentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Having no signal or battery</li>
<li>Developing a dependence on AR in everyday life</li>
<li>Losing sense of the physical self</li>
<li>Losing individuality</li>
<li>Identifying the AR OS as a part of the personality</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wecanworkondevelopingartoday">We can work on developing AR today</h3>
<p>I guess we are all well aware of the current limitations of the AR systems, but looking past the non-existing or low tech ways of input and output that we nowadays possess, by emulating non-existing augmentation pathways and …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Pittsburgh, PA — This has been a painful journey. After years of impotent performance and correctness checks in the <a href="https://pelotondb.io/">Peloton</a> database project, we found ourselves in a morass of despair and unmaintainable system code. Previous attempts to rectify the many issues with the system proved to be feckless, even with the most brilliant database students and engineers. Rather than continue on with the desiccated husk of a system on life support, we decided to sacrifice our beloved DBMS on the altar of the database gods and start over. It does not help that a certain bike company was able to capture distilled misogyny in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/business/peloton-bike-ad-stock.html">30 second commercial</a> and thus forever ruining a good name for a DBMS.</p>
<p>Two years have passed since then. We now find ourselves in a new world plagued by a pestilence that feeds on imbecilic apathy and stupidity. Despite this setback, we have persevered and continue forward with our research fueled by our unwavering desire to pursue science. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Database Group</a> is pleased to announce the first page of the <b>NoisePage</b> database management system. This release is still experimental code and thus should <u>not</u> be used in production environments.</p>
<p>There is currently <u>no</u> support for self-driving operations in this release; it does contain the offline <a href="https://github.com/cmu-db/noisepage/tree/master/benchmark/runner">training data collection framework</a> that is needed to train the DBMS’s internal <i>operating unit</i> models.</p>

		<p><b><span size="+1">Introduction</span></b></p>
		<p>It is now 2018, and I really need to rewrite the introduction to this page. I'm currently looking to reduce my reliance at home on vintage hardware, and to lower my electricity bill. I've started using SIMH/VAX heavily, and would love an Alpha emulator for the Apps that I can't move over to SIMH/VAX. Plus from what I'm seeing, current Intel-based systems can emulate an Alpha-Based system faster than the fastest Alpha.</p>
		<p>At this point I don't know why anyone would want to emulate an Alpha.  If you are a hobbyist looking to run OpenVMS, take a look at the <a href="http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/decemulation/vax.html">VAX</a> emulation available, or buy an inexpensive used Alpha.  Having said this I've been watching the ES40 emulator with great interest as at some point this will no longer be true, and at this point it is the emulator with the greatest promise for Hobbyists.</p>
		<p>If you are a commercial user I would seriously recommend looking at an upgrade to Itanium if your applications will run there.  If not I would recommend looking at one of the newer models of Alpha that are still available.  </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>At Human Jobs, we are obsessed with building skills. Not only is continual learning a key driver for career success, it can also be a source of enormous intellectual satisfaction. There are so many quality resources available online, but today we start with our top 5 online courses for building job skills. They cover a variety of subjects, but all are well-taught and will deliver tangible skills you can use in the real world.</p>
<h4>1. <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-tll-005-how-to-speak-january-iap-2018/index.htm"><em>How to Speak</em> </a>from MIT</h4>
<p>This is a legendary course from MIT focused on public speaking skills for job interviews, lectures, and much more. The professor, Patrick Winston is a charismatic speaker himself – I mean, he ought to be if he is teaching the course. Although geared toward an MIT audience, it is packed with useful tips for people of any educational background.</p>
<p>This “course” is technically just one video, so if you don’t have much free time, an hour with Patrick Winston is an hour well-spent. In his own words: “By the end of the next 60 minutes you will have been exposed to a lot of ideas, some of which you will incorporate into your own repertoire, and they will ensure that you get the maximum opportunity to have your ideas valued and accepted by the people you speak with.” The lectures is freely available on MIT Open Courseware.</p>
<p>Don’t go into another job interview without watching <em>How to Speak </em>first.&nbsp;Check it out <strong><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-tll-005-how-to-speak-january-iap-2018/index.htm">here.</a></strong></p>
<h4>2. <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/"><em>Startup School</em></a> from Y Combinator</h4>
<p>If you are thinking of starting a business, <em>Startup School</em> from Y Combinator (YC) will give you the skills and frameworks for evaluating and growing your idea. YC is the top startup accelerator in the US, which means they know what it takes for a clever idea to become a successful business.</p>
<p><em>Startup School</em> is a great introduction to entrepreneurship, and business more generally, because it forces you to think critically about why some startups succeed and others fail. For people with little background in this area, the lectures are very accessible, use little jargon, and are a great entry-point into the space. The lecturers are really candid, and I found it very refreshing for some frank and pointed views on the startup world.</p>
<p><em>Startup School</em> is free, so check it out <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>3. <a href="https://justiceharvard.org/"><em>Justice</em></a> from Harvard</h4>
<p>Michael Sandel is the professor who turns probing moral inquiry into a thrill-ride. <em>Justice</em> offers a whistle-stop tour of different ethical and moral philosophies ranging from the ancients to contemporary philosophers. The course is honestly addictive and always spurred vigorous debate between me ad my friends while watching.</p>
<p>Sandel is a champion of the Socratic method, and his questioning models the kind of critical thought that is so celebrated by humanities students. If sharpening your reasoning skills isn’t enough, then take <em>Justice</em> to challenge your own moral and ethical convictions. Whether you are targeting writing jobs, tutoring jobs, or a career in finance, you will become more analytically and ethically robust after a few lectures of <em>Justice</em>.</p>
<p>Lectures are free from the course website and on YouTube. Check out the course website <a href="https://justiceharvard.org/"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>4. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-2016-essential-training/welcome"><em>Excel Essential Training</em></a> from LinkedIn</h4>
<p>You cannot deny the importance of Excel within the modern economy. Microsoft’s interactive spreadsheet software is everywhere and facility with the program is a huge selling point in job applications. This course from LinkedIn is a thorough introduction to the subjects and it provides a nice interactive format for practicing new techniques. No prior knowledge is necessary, and even people with intermediate Excel skills will benefit.</p>
<p>When I took the course, my Excel skills were reasonably advanced, but I benefitted tremendously from a more detailed understanding of the program. The small tips and best practices I learned have saved me a lot of time and many headaches since finishing the course. Knowledge of Excel will serve you in many different professions, so it is worth committing the hours to become a power user.</p>
<p>Available on LinkedIn Learning <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-2016-essential-training/welcome"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>5. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science"><em>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</em></a> from Harvard/edX</h4>
<p>If you want to learn to code, CS50 is the place to start. This course from Harvard comes with everything: a dynamic professor, extensive resources, logistical help, problem sets with automatic grading, supplementary lectures from teaching fellows, a user-friendly coding environment, and more.</p>
<p>There is a reason CS50 has a cult following among Harvard undergraduates, many of whom take CS50 as their first computer science course. I took CS50 online and found it absolutely exhilarating. It was challenging, but the course structure and resources made it easy to start. At the outset of a programming course, the number of new tools and concepts is often overwhelming for beginners. In my experience, CS50 does the best job at easing you into the field and building some momentum right from the start.</p>
<p>Knowing how to code is an invaluable skill for anyone on the job market, so it should be high on your list of skills to acquire. If you need to be convinced, we have an entire <strong><a href="https://human-jobs.com/2020/10/07/learn-to-code/">blogpost</a></strong> dedicated to coding for humanities people. Taking CS50 is a commitment, but you will not regret it. Free and paid versions are available from edX, so check it out <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h4>6. Bonus Fun/Learning Resource: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9RM-iSvTu1uPJb8X5yp3EQ">Wendover Productions</a> on YouTube</h4>
<p>This isn’t a course, but rather a YouTube channel that offers super high-quality “mini-documentaries” on really interesting topics. Wendover’s videos are pithy and jam-packed with interesting insights. Ever wonder how overnight shipping works? Check out this <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qfeoqErtY">video</a></strong>. Curious about how humans conceptualize risk? Wendover has got you covered <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtX-Ibi21tU">here</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I watch Wendover to understand how the world works, and I always come away with a new insight into the unseen forces that shape our lives. Highly recommended for some fun and educational time on YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9RM-iSvTu1uPJb8X5yp3EQ"><strong>Here</strong></a> is&nbsp;the channel link.</p>
<h3>Never stop learning – build job skills every day</h3>
<p>Learning new things and building skills is a major motivator in my life. I do it for fun, and I do it for the career opportunities that an expanded skillset affords. Tell me in the comments: what skills do you want to build? Do you have any amazing online resources that others should check out?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <blockquote>
<p>This article is in a series of code review articles that take a
deep look at a popular module and discuss its merits, flaws, and
overall fitness for a task.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a> is a solid, battle-tested, replacement for the deprecated <code>require.js</code>. I
recommend it despite the imperfections that I have summarized in this article.</p>
<p>The logic in this package is well thought out and meets my standards. Some of
the more complex functions are arduous to read. This makes collaboration from
the development community difficult and undermines the overall effectiveness of
the project.</p>
<p>The interceptor system is a workable solution for extending the package
functions. Personally, I have wrapped request/response to extend error reporting
and the updates felt natural and a seamless transition.</p>
<p>There are two test runners in the project: Mocha (for node.js) and Jasmine/Karma
(for browser testing). This is unnecessary as both test packages can run both
platforms. A large number of the tests are written for jasmine and will not
run, without modification in the mocha test suite. This prevents me from
showing full code coverage without hacking on the tests (more on this later). </p>
<p>Running <code>npm test</code> takes many minutes and fails, by default, if the developer
does not have the Opera browser installed. I can understand that an exhaustive
integration run in a multi-target package is a long process. Fleshing out the
Mocha test suite to run on the command line in a second npm script would
encourage test-driven refactoring and make many of the improvements I outline
much simpler and safer. Iterative, refactoring tests must be fast, sane, and
meaningful. They need not be exhaustive. The exhaustive testing can be saved
for pre-release and proofing pull-requests.</p>
<p>The current version is <code>0.20.0</code>. There is no explicit roadmap for the project;
however, I do not see a reason for the delay in assigning version <code>1.0.0</code> to this
release.</p>

<p>That is an extremely old version of <code>ws</code>. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/550">It has been

<p>I love <code>lodash</code> for the creativity of its codebase, the way the developers
step up to the challenge of being faster than native, but never user it. NPM
awards <code>lodash</code>‘s prototype pollution (actually polyfills) a <code>High</code> level alert.</p>
<p><code>karma</code> also depends on an old version of <code>chokidar</code>, but <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://paulmillr.com/posts/chokidar-3-save-32tb-of-traffic/">new chokidar is way

<p>I went into all the depth here because it is important to note that while all of
these dependencies are dev only, they are eliminated by just updating the

<p>It is interesting to note that karma detected immediately that I do not have

<p>We’re very excited to release Pyston v2, a faster and highly compatible implementation of the Python programming language.  Version 2 is 20% faster than stock Python 3.8 on our macrobenchmarks.  More importantly, it is likely to be faster on your code.  Pyston v2 can reduce server costs, reduce user latencies, and improve developer productivity.</p>



<p>Pyston v2 is easy to deploy, so if you’re looking for better Python performance, we encourage you to take five minutes and <a href="#availability">try Pyston</a>. Doing so is one of the easiest ways to speed up your project.</p>



<h2>Performance</h2>



<p>Pyston v2 provides a noticeable speedup on many workloads while having few drawbacks.  Our focus has been on web serving workloads, but Pyston v2 is also faster on other workloads and popular benchmarks.</p>



<p>Our team put together a new <a href="https://github.com/pyston/python-macrobenchmarks/">public Python macrobenchmark suite</a> that measures the performance of several commonly-used Python projects.  The benchmarks in this suite are larger than those found in other Python suites, making them more likely to be representative of real-world applications.  Even though this gives us a lower headline number than other projects, we believe it translates to better speedups for real use cases.  Pyston v2 still shows sped-up performance on microbenchmarks, being twice as fast as standard Python on tests like chaos.py and nbody.py.</p>



<p>Here are our performance results:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>CPython 3.8.5</td><td>Pyston 2.0</td><td>PyPy 7.3.2</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging warmup time [1]</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>85s</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging mean latency</td><td>5.1ms</td><td>4.1ms</td><td>2.5ms</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging p99 latency</td><td>6.3ms</td><td>5.2ms</td><td>5.8ms</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging memory usage</td><td>47MB</td><td>54MB</td><td>228MB</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms warmup time [1]</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>105s</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms mean latency</td><td>14.1ms</td><td>11.8ms</td><td>15.9ms</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms p99 latency</td><td>15.0ms</td><td>12.8ms</td><td>179ms</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms memory usage</td><td>84MB</td><td>91MB</td><td>279MB</td></tr><tr><td>Pylint speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.16x</td><td>0.50x</td></tr><tr><td>mypy speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.07x [2]</td><td>unsupported</td></tr><tr><td>PyTorch speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.00x [2]</td><td>unsupported</td></tr><tr><td>PyPy benchmark suite [3]</td><td>1x</td><td>1.36x</td><td>2.48x</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Results were collected on an m5.large EC2 instance running Ubuntu 20.04</figcaption></figure>



<p>[1] Warmup time is defined as time until the benchmark reached 95% of peak performance; if it was not distinguishable from noise it is marked “n/a”.  Only post-warmup behavior is considered for latency measurement.<br>[2] mypy and PyTorch don’t support automatically building their C extensions from source, so these Pyston numbers use our unsafe compatibility mode<br>[3] The PyPy benchmark suite was modified to only run the benchmarks that are compatible with Python 3.8</p>



<h2>Results analysis</h2>



<p>In our targeted benchmarks (djangocms + flaskblogging), Pyston v2 provides an average 1.22x speedup for mean latency and an 1.18x improvement for p99 latency while using a just few more megabytes per process.  We have not yet invested time in optimizing the other benchmarks.</p>



<p>“p99 latency” is the upper 99th percentile of the response-time distribution, and is a common metric used in web serving contexts since it can provide insight into user experience that is lost by taking an average.  PyPy’s high p99 latency on djangocms comes from periodic latency spikes, presumably from garbage collection pauses.  CPython and Pyston both exhibit periodic spikes, presumably from their cycle collectors, but they are both less frequent and much smaller in magnitude.</p>



<p>The mypy and PyTorch benchmarks show a natural boundary of Pyston v2. These benchmarks both do the bulk of their work in C extensions which are unaffected by our Python speedups.  We natively support the C API and do not have an emulation layer, so we are still able to provide a small boost to mypy performance and do not degrade pytorch or numpy performance.  Your benefit will depend on your mix of Python and C extension work.</p>



<h2>Technical approach</h2>



<p>We’re planning on going into more detail in future blog posts, but some of the techniques we use in Pyston v2 include:</p>



<ul><li>A very-low-overhead JIT using <a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM</a></li><li><a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue14757">Quickening</a></li><li>General CPython optimizations</li><li>Build process improvements</li></ul>



<h2>Compatibility</h2>



<p>Since Pyston is a fork of CPython, we believe it is one of the most compatible alternative Python implementations available today.  It supports all the same features and C API that CPython does.</p>



<p>While Pyston is identically functional in theory, in practice there are some temporary compatibility hurdles for any new Python implementation.  Please see <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/wiki">our wiki</a> for details.</p>



<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>



<p>Pyston v2.0 is <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/releases">immediately available</a> as a pre-built package.  Currently, we have packages for Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 x86_64.  If you would like support for a different OS, let us know by filing an issue in our <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>



<p>Trying out Pyston is as simple as installing our package, replacing <code>python3</code> with <code>pyston3</code>, and reinstalling your dependencies with <code>pip-pyston3 install</code> (though see our <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/wiki">wiki</a> for a known issue about setuptools). If you already have an automated build set up, the change should be just a few lines.</p>



<p>Our plan is to open-source the code in the future, but since compiler projects are expensive and we no longer have benevolent corporate sponsorship, it is currently closed-source while we iron out our business model.</p>



<h2>Reaching us</h2>



<p>We are designing Pyston for developers and love to hear about your needs and experiences.  So, we’ve set up a <a href="https://discord.gg/S7gsqnb">Discord server</a> where you can chat with us.  If you’d like a commercially-supported version of Pyston, please <a href="mailto:business@pyston.org">send us an email</a>.</p>



<p>We’ve optimized Pyston for several use cases but are eager to hear about new ones so that we can make it even more beneficial.  If you run into any problems or instances where Pyston does not help as much as expected, please let us know!</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>We designed Pyston v1 at Dropbox to speed up Python for its web serving workloads.  After the project ended, some of us from the team brainstormed how we would do it differently if we were to do it again.  In early 2020, enough pieces were in place for us to start a company and work on Pyston full-time.</p>



<p>Pyston v2 is inspired by but is technically unrelated to the original Pyston v1 effort.</p>



<h2>Moving forward</h2>



<p>We’re on a mission to make Python faster and have plenty of ideas to do so.  That means we’re actively looking for people to join the team.  <a href="https://discord.gg/S7gsqnb">Let us know</a> if you’d like to get involved.  Otherwise stay tuned for future releases and reach out if you have any questions!</p>

<h2><a href="https://chrisseaton.com/">Chris Seaton</a>, 28 October 2020</h2>


</header>

<p>There’s a proposal to add <em>Software Transactional Memory</em>, or <em>STM</em>, to the Ruby programming language. This is part of a wider effort to add better support for concurrency and parallelism in Ruby, and in particular the idea of <em>ractors</em>. A concept has been <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3652">implemented</a> by Koichi Sasada.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/ruby-stm/testBoard.gif" width="50%">
<figcaption>An animation of the algorithm we're going to use as an example of STM - we'll explain this later on</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This article gives some context on what STM is, how you use it, and why you might want to use it. We’ll show an application which is well-suited to STM and we’ll use this to talk about the benefits, issues, and some open questions.</p>

<p>We’ll finish by setting a challenge for STM in Ruby.</p>

<p>I wrote the first half of my PhD on STM, and the second half on Ruby, so I’ve got quite a bit of experience with both and the idea of their combination is very interesting to me.</p>

<h2 id="why-might-we-want-an-stm">Why might we want an STM?</h2>

<p>Let’s say we’re a bank managing many bank accounts. Each account has a total. We get a never-ending stream of requests to move a sum of money <code>m</code> from an account <code>a</code> to account <code>b</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>

  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Something not everyone may know about Ruby is that <code>x += y</code> is equivalent to writing <code>t = x; x = t + y</code>. We’ll write that out in full to make that clear to ourselves.</p>

<p>We’ve got a lot of transfers to run through, so we’ll have multiple threads processing these transfers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>

<p>We’ve got a few problems here now. With all these threads running at the same time, what happens if two threads are putting money into your account concurrently?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>100</span>

<span># thread 1                        # thread 2</span>
<span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
  <span># balance = 100</span>
                                  <span>balance</span> <span>=</span> <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
                                    <span># balance = 100</span>
<span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
  <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
                                  <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>balance</span> <span>+</span> <span>10</span>
                                    <span># accounts[a] = 110</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two transfers have run, but your balance is 110. The other 10 has been lost - this is called a <em>lost update</em>, meaning it’s as if the update was never made.</p>

<p>Also consider what happens if the thread crashes after taking money from <code>a</code> but before putting it into <code>b</code>? The transfer would be applied partially and again we’d lose money.</p>

<p>We need to use some kind of <em>synchronization</em> on our accounts. Ruby has <em>mutual exclusion locks</em> or <em>mutexes</em>, so we can try using those.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Does this work? What if we process a transfer from account 1001 to account 1002 on one thread at the same time as processing a transfer from account 1002 to 1001, so the other way around, at the same time?</p>

<p>The first thread will try to lock 1001 and then 1002. The second thread will try to lock 1002 and then 1001. If the first thread gets as far as locking 1001, and the second as far as locking 1002, then both will be waiting for the opposite lock and will never release the lock they already have. We will be in <em>deadlock</em>.</p>

<p>If we always acquired locks in the same order, by collecting them up first and sorting them, we could fix this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>].</span><span>sort</span>
      <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>locks</span><span>[</span><span>y</span><span>].</span><span>synchronize</span> <span>do</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
          <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>end</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now in both transfers account 1001 is locked first and 1002 is locked second. That will work.</p>

<p>We have to make up a somewhat artificial requirement to explain the next issue, but consider if for some good reason we wanted to transfer to one account if we had a lot of money, and a different account if we only had a little money. Maybe if we’re rich this month we donate to charity, otherwise we unfortunately need to save for ourselves.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if account balance &gt; 1000
  transfer 10 to charity
else
  transfer 10 to savings
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll talk about accounts <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>, now, and a threshold of money <code>t</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>

<p>It’s starting to get very complicated. And this locks more than it needs to - it locks both <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> but then only uses one of them. If you use <code>b</code> in the end, ideally another thread could be serving a transfer to <code>c</code> at the same time, but you’ve locked it and it can’t. Imagine if instead of two potential accounts it was thousands and you had to lock them all. Imagine if you couldn’t work out at all which account you’d be transferring to until you started the transfer - then you’d never be able to process two transfers at the same time.</p>

<p>At this point as well we’re likely to start to make errors trying to do all this locking and ordering of locks and things.</p>

<p>Stepping back and taking it all in, we can draw up some requirements for what we need.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>atomicity</em> - that all writes in the transfer are applied or none are applied</li>
  <li><em>consistency</em> - meaning that our data structures are always valid - the total sum of money never changes</li>
  <li><em>isolation</em> - meaning one transfer does not interfere with another</li>
  <li><em>durability</em> - meaning that when applied the transfer is available to all subsequent transactions</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally a library or the language could do this all for us. We’d like to be able to write almost what we originally wrote, but with just an annotation to make the code inside a block atomic, consistent, isolated, and the result durable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>n</span><span>.</span><span>times</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_next_transfer</span>
      <span>atomically</span> <span>do</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-=</span> <span>m</span>
        <span>accounts</span><span>[</span><span>b</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>m</span>
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what a <em>transactional</em> memory can let us do. It will automatically monitor what you read and write inside the <code>atomically</code> block, which is a <em>transaction</em>, and will make sure it is either applied fully or not, that the balance of the whole system is always consistent, that transactions do not see the result of each other partially applied, and that writes appear and stay.</p>

<p>It may be implemented using the code we eventually arrived at ourselves, or it could do something else instead. In practice how it is often implemented is that
reads and writes are stored in a log, then at the end the transaction works out if anyone else has written locations that you’ve read. If they have then the values you read are no longer valid, so your transaction <em>conflicts</em> with another, is <em>aborted</em> and retries, reading the locations again. When it eventually does not conflict with any other transactions it is <em>committed</em> and succeeds. This means you don’t need to lock everything up-front, which means you avoid the problem of what happens if you may potentially need every account. Locking everything up-front is called <em>pessimistic locking</em>. We’re moving to <em>optimistic locking</em></p>

<h2 id="the-proposed-stm">The proposed STM</h2>

<p>Koichi’s <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17261">proposed</a> STM for Ruby, in combination with his proposed <em>ractors</em> (similar to <em>actors</em>) would look like this.</p>

  <span>Ractor</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>*</span><span>accounts</span> <span>do</span> <span>|*</span><span>accounts</span><span>|</span>

      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>He’s using a <code>Ractor</code> but you can think of it as a thread for the purposes of this article. Instead of an array of account balances, we now have an array of <code>TVar</code> objects that contain values. A <code>TVar</code> is a <em>transactional variable</em>. Only these variables are transactional - not any other Ruby value you read or write. His design requires that the <code>TVar</code> objects you’re going to use are passed into the <code>Ractor</code>, due to rules about sharing that aren’t relevant for this article.</p>

<p>This looks good, doesn’t it!</p>

<h2 id="a-more-complex-application">A more complex application</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a larger application, in order to illustrate further and to talk about some issues and open questions. The <a href="https://github.com/chrisseaton/ruby-stm-lee-demo">code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s say it’s our job to lay out the wires on a circuit board. We get a board with <em>pads</em> (connections to components mounted on the board) and a list of <em>routes</em> that we need to draw between these pads. There are a great many pads and routes, there isn’t much space on the tiny board, and another catch is that it’s very expensive to have wires crossing each other. Let’s say it’s exponentially more expensive for more deeply stacked wires.</p>

<p>In this minimal example we we can see two routes, and how they have to cross each other.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Most people don’t practice taking ideas seriously. I think it’s because most people don’t know how to. I didn’t either, until I stumbled upon an implication.</p>

<p>For example, what would it mean to take compounding seriously?</p>

<p>Ugh. I can feel your aversion. You’ve already heard so much about compounding, how it works, how it’s the eight wonder of the world, etc. etc.</p>

<p>But, familiarity is not the same as taking it seriously.</p>

<p>Say you start with $100, and every year, make 10% more. This compounds, since the extra money is a function of how much you already have. The more you have, the more you get. It’s a positive loop that keeps on increasing.</p>

<p>That’s the familiar interpretation. The earlier you start, the more money you’ll make.</p>

<p>To take this interpretation seriously would mean investing your earnings for a similar return. <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>, and sometimes assumptions break. You don’t make 10% - which means you need to balance your investments somehow. That makes things complicated. However, this complication is not related to compounding.</p>

<p>Taking compounding seriously means taking it a step further. Your net worth is just one implication. What else compounds?</p>

<p>Your life experiences and knowledge. What would it mean to leverage compounding here?</p>

<p>If you’re taking compounding seriously, you’d learn the skills with the greatest return first. That means learning the broadest applicable skills you’d apply throughout your life first. That means learning how to think well - before learning the new fancy tech you want to learn.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes you need a medium to learn the skill better. That makes sense: learn to think well via this new tech you wanted to learn. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3HyeNiEpvbQQaqeoH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purposes are fragile</a> though, and it’s easy to get lost in the tool, instead of the overall goal.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>What makes this example so good is that you’re probably very familiar with compounding. What else are you familiar with, but haven’t realised you’re not taking seriously?</p>

<p>A good way to practice this is to ask this question: What are the implications of (idea) in (field of interest)?</p>

<p>For example, asking myself What are the implications of compounding for my self-directed knowledge base led to the above insight of learning broader skills first.</p>

<p>Here at <a href="https://nextlinklabs.com/">NextLink Labs</a>, we couldn't be more excited about this security-minded offering. Being a company located at the heart between <a href="https://nextlinklabs.com/how-we-work">DevOps and Security</a>, we often encounter problems that, up until the release of  Boundary, required much more complicated tools and processes to solve. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/why-we-built-hashicorp-boundary">Boundary is a tool built to make it simple to grant and maintain access to infrastructure</a>. In true HashiCorp fashion, Boundary accomplishes this in a way that can target any sort of infrastructure, including all the major cloud providers, Kubernetes, and on premise infrastructure. </p>
<p>Specifically, this tool enables access from a public user to many types of hosts and services located in a private network, and integrates with many existing Identity Providers such as Okta, Active Directory Federation Services, Active Directory, and more. </p>

<p>Most modern systems have resources located on a private network for which are going to need to be accessed by end users on a public network.  Examples are vast but a few simple ones are databases, web service hosts, kubernetes nodes, or something similar. </p>
<p>In order to grant users outside the network access to these resources, three things need to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>A VPN or Bastion host needs set up as a gateway to bridge connections onto the resources</li>
<li>The connection must be restricted via firewall rules or similar so when you give a user access to the VPN or Bastion host they only have access to the resources they need and not the entire network</li>
<li>Individual credentials for each resource must be shared (DB credentials, ssh keys, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing things this way brings up a few issues with their own challenges that require solving: </p>
<p><strong>Issues with Onboarding and Offboarding Users</strong></p>
<p>Users must be granted a series of credentials and keys at different layers of the system. Not only is this difficult in and of itself, but when you throw in best practices around key rotations, static credentials, and how you handle dynamic infrastructure like auto scaling groups and kubernetes services, it can quickly become too much to handle.</p>
<p><strong>Problematic, Unclear Visibility into Connections</strong></p>
<p>We consider it a security best practice (and oftentimes a compliance requirement) to have visibility into what users and systems are connected where. This sort of access control record needs to be available in logs for security personnel to review.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult Integration and Tooling</strong></p>
<p>Users may need managed in multiple Identity Providers and other systems. Power users who are attempting to use command line tools or other tooling may find it difficult to work within the constraints of the VPN or bastion host setup</p>
<p>Boundary <strong>solves these issues</strong> by abstracting away much of the complexity and changing the way you think about access to system resources.</p>
<h3>How Boundary Makes it Work</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, HashiCorp Boundary was built to make it easy to grant and maintain access to infrastructure. </p>
<p>So what does that look like in practice? </p>
<p>In initiating a boundary connection, 3 things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Boundary replaces individual Ssh keys and credentials with SSO via OpenID Connect. So the first step is to authenticate a user against an existing IDP (Identity Provider) such as Okta or ADFS.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Boundary checks its list of role based access controls to see if the authenticated user has access to the desired resource.</li>
<li><strong>Connection:</strong> Boundary initiates a connection to this resource. It does so via a client side agent that exposes this connection via localhost. Allowing a seamless experience with existing tools as you can work as if the connection is just a localhost connection. For many types of tools, this can also handle the credentials aspect of using a service so your end user never needs to be shared static credentials that may leak or be exposed.</li>
</ol>

<p>To the end user, they are able to use boundary in several different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>CLI</li>
<li>SDK</li>
<li>REST API</li>
<li>User Interface</li>
<li>Desktop application <strong>(coming soon!)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With options for using Boundary that should appeal to both power users and less technical users, Boundary should provide a great user experience that will not only make your operations and security folks happy, but also provide tremendous value to end users.</p>

<h3>The Key Advantages to Boundary</h3>
<p>We think HashiCorp Boundary is a gamechanger for many organizations. </p>
<p>It is truly a tool set up for the future as it’s architecture supports modern cloud architectures. </p>
<p>HashiCorp says that in solving this common problem their users were experiencing (access to resources in a private network from a public network), they fundamentally changed how they think about solving the problem. </p>
<p>Boundary has many advantages over other ways of handling the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access rules</strong> can be setup and handled as code via their <strong>Terraform provider</strong> (provides all the other benefits of Infrastructure as Code)</li>
<li><strong>Policy</strong> is thought of as “which set of users needs access to which set of services” as opposed to IP based access control  - which is brittle, especially in today’s increasingly ephemeral environments</li>
<li><strong>Access to Session Visibility:</strong> Security Administrators are able to monitor and manage privileged sessions and export the session logs into analytics tooling</li>
<li>Promotes a <strong>zero-trust network security model</strong> as it does not trust the private network and does not give unnecessary access to the private network</li>
<li><strong>Makes onboarding and offboarding users a breeze</strong>. You only need to add or remove users to your Identity Provider. You don’t need to set up VPN or SSH access. You don’t need to grant individual user credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrap up</p>
<p>In summary, we believe HashiCorp Boundary to be an excellent addition to many companies' toolchains. It does an excellent job of automating the setup and access of resources, identities, and access controls as code with Boundary’s Terraform Provider, REST API, CLI, and SDK. We think Boundary solves a common problem most organizations have in a way that enables simplicity for its users and operators while keeping security top of mind.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-warehousing-glossary/data-enrichment/">Data enrichment</a> is a powerful technique for adding valuable context to your customer data, and it’s simple in theory – given a bit of data about a record (e.g. a user's email or the IP of a web session), tell me more information about it so I can take effective action (e.g. map the email domain to a company or map the IP to a geolocation). In practice, however, it can be difficult to integrate a data enrichment process into an existing ELT pipeline, for a few reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintaining Freshness: </strong>How recent are the results being correlated with my data? This may be a function of how often external datasets are loaded or how up-to-date your third-party data provider’s information is.</li><li><strong>Ensuring Consistency: </strong>Once data is enriched with new attributes, can I easily push those attributes to my warehouse and SaaS tools to maintain a synchronized data model?</li><li><strong>Limiting Resource Usage: </strong>Enrichment processes can be expensive in storage costs (to maintain huge third-party data sets), processing time, and API quota usage for paid enrichment services. And enrichment processes shouldn’t unnecessarily repeat the same work over and over again.</li></ul><p>In this post, I’ll share our recipe for enriching our own customer data at Census using the <a href="https://clearbit.com/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Clearbit</a> API, Snowflake External Functions, and <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/product/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">dbt</a> to enrich data correctly and efficiently over large data sets.</p><p>One note before we begin, if you’re new to data enrichment: there’s a key difference between enriching using a dataset and enriching using an API. Some enrichment pipelines make use of third party datasets that can be purchased in their entirety – you can see many examples of these in the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-marketplace/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Snowflake Data Marketplace</a>. This kind of data can be easier to work with because you can rely on your warehouse to efficiently <code>LEFT JOIN</code> to these datasets and materialize the result on a schedule. However, an enrichment API doesn’t give you the full dataset to work with; it replies to your queries (one at a time or in bulk) in a request-reply style to tell you if the API has additional data for the company or person in question. These are more challenging to work with in a data warehousing context, and we built this pipeline so that we can perform both types of enrichment without leaving the comfort of our warehouse SQL environment.</p><h3 id="snowflake-s-external-functions">Snowflake's External Functions</h3><p>External functions are a recentaddition in modern data warehouses. An external function is like a traditional <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/user-defined-functions.html">user-defined function (UDF)</a>, but it allows you to break free of the database sandbox by calling an external handler to calculate results. For example, Redshift has basic support for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_FUNCTION.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">external functions</a> that call Lambda functions to compute their results.</p><p>Snowflake's <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions-introduction.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">external functions</a> call out to an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">AWS API Gateway</a> endpoint to retrieve results, which allows us to connect many different handlers, including Lambda functions. Calls from SQL will be batched into JSON HTTP requests and proxied to the configured handler, which needs to unwrap the batch items, calculate appropriate values, and then return a batch of results as JSON. Setting up a gateway and handlers in AWS for the first time isn’t trivial, but the design allows a lot of flexibility. I won't go through that process in this post but you can read about it in Snowflake's <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/external-functions-creating-aws.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">documentation</a>. We automate this using a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Terraform</a> module, which we hope to open source soon.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="main_content">
          <h3>
ChessCaptcha.</h3>

<p>This is a captcha system where the user either recreates the position of the pieces on the board - <em>non chess savvy users</em> - or she solves a mate-in-one puzzle by putting the piece on the square where it gives the checkmate - <em>chess savvy users only</em>. There is also a no-js fallback that exists mostly as a placeholder for future iterations; don't use it.</p>
        </section><section id="usage">
          <h3>
Usage.</h3>

<h4>Copy the position mode. - Default</h4>
<p>
  In this mode which happens to be the one where the user needs no chess knowledge at all to use, he simply drags the pieces
  into the board trying to replicate the position shown in the image.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://elioair.github.io/chesscaptcha/images/chesscaptchausage.gif">
</p>
<h4>Mate in One mode</h4>
<p>
  Here the user is given a position and where he has to move a piece to create a mating position on the board.
  Only chess players -and maybe computer engines. cough..!- will be able to solve this. It can be used for example in chess sites
  to determine if the user is really a chess player or a simple spammer.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://elioair.github.io/chesscaptcha/images/chesscaptchamatemode.gif">
</p>
<h4>Color Tolerance</h4>
<p>
  If needed you can turn on color tolerance. In this case the validation will be color agnostic and for example the white king will be 
  considered equal to the black king.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">wrote an article about how the SPA pattern has failed to simplify web development</a>. The <em>SPA pattern</em> (Single-Page Apps), I tried to define, was about the React model, which also covers, to a large extent, the model of Vue, Angular, and other frontend frameworks.</p><p>Like any critique, it begs for a prescription and I didn’t give one, other than gesturing toward server-side frameworks like Rails and Django. But I think there are some trends starting to form. I had queued up some time to <em>really dive into the frameworks</em>, but things like <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/12/holly-park.html">walking in parks</a> have taken priority, so here’s just a grand tour.</p><h3 id="opinionated-full-stack-javascript-frameworks">Opinionated full-stack JavaScript frameworks</h3><p>Primarily I’m talking about <a href="https://remix.run/features">Remix</a>, <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/">RedwoodJS</a>, and <a href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz.js</a>, though I’m sure there are similar efforts in the non-React world that are relevant. <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> <em>almost</em> falls into this category, but as far as I can tell, it’s still unopinionated about the data layer and most sites that use Next.js are still going to use a separate API stack. But that’s subject to change, because all of these are moving fast.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that Remix, Redwood, and Next are all backed by companies or foundations, and that Blitz is aiming early on to be a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/blitz-js">sponsor-funded project</a>. These projects, I think, are trying to sidestep the “tragedy of the commons” failures of earlier open source, wherein overworked and unpaid maintainers service a large userbase and eventually burn out and abandon the project.</p><p>To take Remix as an example, it re-ties data loading with routes, and then gives the pretty amazing promise of <em>no client side data fetching by default</em>. These frameworks are also <em>opinionated about status codes and caching strategies</em>. RedwoodJS automatically creates an <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial/side-quest-how-redwood-works-with-data">ORM-like interface using GraphQL and Prisma</a>.</p><p>As context, Remix is backed by the folks from <a href="https://reacttraining.com/">React Training</a>, who are also the folks from <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">React Router</a>, which is as much React pedigree as you can get without joining the team at Facebook. Redwood is run by <a href="https://prestonwernerventures.com/">Preston-Werner Ventures</a>, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, a GitHub founder. Next.js is sponsored and heavily promoted by <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, née Zeit.</p><h3 id="turbolinks">Turbolinks</h3><p>It’s worthwhile to just mention <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>. I didn’t use it until this year, and apparently there were issues with it before, but the pitch for Turbolinks 5 is: <em>what is the bare minimum you need to do to get the SPA experience without any cooperation from your application?</em></p><p>So it’s a tiny JavaScript library that sits on top of an existing server-rendered application and replaces full pageloads with SPA-like partial pageloads. Instead of loading a page from scratch, pages are loaded with AJAX, page contents are replaced, and client-side navigation updates your URLs. Basically, it prevents the ‘blink’ of real page transitions and saves on all othe sorts of costs of fully loading a new page. Turbolinks was spawned from the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> project, and works great with Rails but doesn’t require it.</p><p>In terms of power-to-weight for user experience improvements, Turbolinks is a standout: it adds very little complexity and a tiny size impact for a big user experience improvement.</p><h3 id="server-side-state-frameworks">Server-side-state frameworks</h3><p>These are the spiciest new solution. The main contenders are <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Laravel Livewire</a> (in PHP), <a href="https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/">Stimulus Reflex</a> (for Ruby on Rails), and <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> (on Phoenix, in Elixir).</p><p>The pitch here is: <em>what if you didn’t have to write any JavaScript?</em> It sort of hearkens back to the critique of JavaScript in <a href="https://vimeo.com/5047563">_why’s ART &amp;&amp; CODE talk</a>, that web development is the only kind where you normally have to write in three (or more) languages. These languages also most remnants of “client-side” logic, putting it all on the server side.</p><p>How do they do this? Well, a lot of WebSockets, in the case of Reflex and LiveView, as well as very tightly coupled server interactions. As you can see in the <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">LiveView demo</a>, which I highly recommend, these frameworks tend to operate sort of like reactive DOM libraries on the front end – in which the framework figures out minimal steps to transform from one state to another - except those steps are computed on the server side and then generically applied on the client side. They also do a lot more data storage &amp; state management on the server-side, because a lot of those interactions which wouldn’t be persisted to the server are now at least communicated to the server.</p><p>These frameworks are exciting, and also extremely contrarian, because they are the polar opposite of the “frontend plus agnostic API layer” pattern, and they also wholeheartedly embrace the thing everyone tries to avoid: mutable state on the server.</p><h3 id="modest-progressive-enhancement-javascript-frameworks">Modest progressive-enhancement JavaScript frameworks</h3><p>These are typically used “in addition” to the above, but they certainly deserve a shout-out because I think a wide swath of frontend-programming concerns actually only need a tiny hint of JavaScript. But the main caveat is that <em>they assume that you know JavaScript and the DOM</em>, which are not necessarily universal skills anymore. A lot of developers growing up on React have acquired a real blind spot for native browser APIs.</p><p>The main ones I’ve looked at are <a href="https://stimulusjs.org/">Stimulus</a> (out of the Ruby on Rails camp), <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/">Alpine</a>, and <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmlx</a>. They’re all tiny, and work great in <em>existing pages</em>. I think – and here come the flames – <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</a> also fit into this sphere of progressive enhancement! If you just use good web components - <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aweb-components+org%3Agithub&amp;type=Repositories">only ones that GitHub writes is a good rule of thumb</a> - then they can fit the role of just improving an existing static UI. It’s where you start to use Web Components as an apples-to-apples replacement for full-fledged frontend frameworks is where things seem to get dicey.</p><p>These frameworks have the luxury of operating on a deeply improved web stack, one with fundamental components like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch()</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">MutationObserver</a>. These things were previously at the core of the utility of progressive enhancement frameworks, and now they can just be the utilities that those frameworks build on.</p><hr><p>I’m sure that there are additional patterns out there! But these currents all seem strong right now, and it’s fascinating to see some really divergent and adventurous – and common-sense – approaches start to crop up.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Zoom recently announced that they were going to make end-to-end encryption available to all of their users–not just customers.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>This is a good move, especially for people living in countries with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/02/how-and-why-america-was-hit-so-hard-by-covid-19/">inept leadership that failed to address the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and therefore need to conduct their work and schooling remotely through software like Zoom. I enthusiastically applaud them for making this change.</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The end-to-end encryption capability arrives on the heels of their acquisition of <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> in earlier this year. Hiring a team of security experts and cryptography engineers seems like a good move overall.</p>



<p>Upon hearing this news, I decided to be a good neighbor and take a look at their source code, with the reasoning, “If so many people’s privacy is going to be dependent on Zoom’s security, I might as well make sure they’re not doing something ridiculously bad.”</p>



<p>Except I couldn’t find their source code anywhere online. But they did publish <a href="https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper">a white paper on Github</a>…</p>







<h2>Disclaimers</h2>



<p>What follows is the opinion of some guy on the Internet with a fursona–so whether or not you choose to take it seriously should be informed by this context. It is not the opinion of anyone’s employer, nor is it endorsed by Zoom, etc. Tell your lawyers to calm their nips.</p>



<p>More importantly, I’m not here to hate on Zoom for doing a good thing, nor on the security experts that worked hard on making Zoom better for their users. The responsibility of security professionals is to the users, after all.</p>



<p>Also, these aren’t zero-days, so don’t try to lecture me about “responsible” disclosure. (That term is also <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2015/11/19/responsible-disclosure-is-wrong/">problematic</a>, by the way.)</p>



<p>Got it? Good. Let’s move on.</p>







<h2>Bizarre Design Choices in Version 2.3 of Zoom’s E2E White Paper</h2>



<p>Note: I’ve altered the screenshots to be white text on a black background, since my blog’s color scheme is darker than a typical academic PDF. You can find the source <a href="https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/blob/d3be2a5a3e16be04f1199b92630f180ba79cb51c/zoom_e2e.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Cryptographic Algorithms</h3>

<p>It’s a little weird that they’re calculating a signature over SHA256(Context) || SHA256(M), considering Ed25519 uses SHA512 internally.</p>



<p>It would make just as much sense to sign Context || M directly–or, if pre-hashing large streams is needed, SHA512(Context || M).</p>

<p>At the top of this section, it says it uses libsodium’s <code>crypto_box</code> interface. But then they go onto… not actually use it.</p>



<p>Instead, they wrote their own protocol using HKDF, two SHA256 hashes, and XChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>



<p>While secure, this isn’t <em>really</em> using the crypto_box interface.</p>



<p>The only part of the libsodium interface that’s being used is <code><a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/927dfe8e2eaa86160d3ba12a7e3258fbc322909c/src/libsodium/crypto_box/curve25519xsalsa20poly1305/box_curve25519xsalsa20poly1305.c#L35-L46">crypto_box_beforenm()</a></code>, which could easily have been a call to <code>crypto_scalarmult()</code>instead (since they’re passing the output of the scalar multiplication to HKDF anyway).</p>







<p>Also, the SHA256(a) || SHA256(b) pattern returns. Zoom’s engineers must love SHA256 for some reason.</p>



<p>This time, it’s in the additional associated data for the XChaCha20-Poly1305. </p>



<p>Binding the ciphertext and the signature to the same context string is a sensible thing to do, it’s just the concatenation of SHA256 hashes is a bit weird when SHA512 exists.</p>



<h3>Meeting Leader Security Code</h3>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1746" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-03/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png" data-orig-size="760,733" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-03" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Here we see Zoom using the a SHA256 of a constant string (“<code>Zoombase-1-ClientOnly-MAC-SecurityCode</code>“) in a construction that tries but fails to be HMAC.</p>



<p>And then they concatenate it with the SHA256 hash of the public key (which is already a 256-bit value), and then they hash the whole thing again.</p>



<p>It’s redundant SHA256 all the way down. The redundancy of “MAC” and “SecurityCode” in their constant string is, at least, consistent with the rest of their design philosophy.</p>



<p>It would be a real shame if double-hashing carried the risk of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/382">invalidating security proofs</a>, or if <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/kmd5.pdf">the security proof for HMAC</a> required a high Hamming distance of padding constants and this design decision also later <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/684.pdf">saved HMAC from related-key attacks</a>.</p>

<p>Wait, you’re telling me Zoom was aware of HMAC’s existence this whole time?</p>

<h2>Enough Pointless Dunking, What’s the Takeaway?</h2>



<p>None of the design decisions Zoom made that I’ve criticized here are security vulnerabilities, but they do demonstrate an early lack of cryptography expertise in their product design.</p>



<p>After all, the weirdness is almost entirely contained in section 3 of their white paper, which describes the “Phase I” of their rollout. So what I’ve pointed out here appears to be mostly legacy cruft that wasn’t risky enough to bother changing in their final design.</p>



<p>The rest of their paper is pretty straightforward and pleasant to read. Their design makes sense in general, and each phase includes an “Areas to Improve” section.</p>



<p>All in all, if you’re worried about the security of Zoom’s E2EE feature, the only thing they can really do better is to publish the source code (and link to it from the whitepaper repository for ease-of-discovery) for this feature so independent experts can publicly review it.</p>



<p>However, they seem to be getting a lot of mileage out of the experts on their payroll, so I wouldn’t count on that happening.</p>

The team consists of ex-employees of Uber, Airbnb, Slack, Coinbase, and Microsoft, and collaborates with their Slack community of 900+ members.</p><p>Tuomas is co-founder of Linear, an engineer and experienced entrepreneur with a strong passion for UX. He previously worked at Uber and helped scale mobile engineering from 15 to 400 engineers. Today, Tuomas explains why the team chooses to build community-first.</p><h2>At what stage of the company did you start an online community and why?</h2><p>We started our online community very early, right about when we launched a private alpha. <strong>We don’t want to build our product in isolation</strong> but want to make sure that we’re as close and aligned with our users as possible. Our belief is that <strong>everyone in our team should be exposed to feedback from our users</strong>. Therefore it was critical to have as many channels of communication as possible to ensure this.</p><blockquote><p>Without a continuous feedback channel like the Slack community, we would probably build the wrong things.</p></blockquote><p>Without a continuous feedback channel like the Slack community, we would probably build the wrong things. <strong>Most of the direction comes from our customers</strong> and the chats that we have with them. If we wouldn’t have the community, we’d still go through a customer list and have daily calls with them to get an idea of what they need and what they're after. But it would certainly be slower, and you wouldn't be able to get a quick overview of what people want. </p><p>I think that <strong>the Slack community is a very fast</strong>-<strong>paced feedback mechanism</strong> for the entire team to get a grasp on what's going on, what's working, and what’s not.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab27779f-a23c-46aa-9109-aaa453f9aa77_972x485.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab27779f-a23c-46aa-9109-aaa453f9aa77_972x485.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab27779f-a23c-46aa-9109-aaa453f9aa77_972x485.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:485,&quot;width&quot;:972,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:308918,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><h2>What platform do you use to run your online community?</h2><p>We used to run our community on Telegram but quickly switched to Slack. Additionally, a lot of feedback comes from forms within the application and from emails from users, which we manage with Front.&nbsp;</p><p>Slack is a great mechanism for fast-paced feedback and discussions. We also get bug reports and user questions in this way. Glancing over it gives everyone <strong>a good grasp on how our users are using Linear</strong> and what areas we still need to improve on.</p><p>The <strong>real-time and casual feel</strong> of Slack makes it great for the job. Using a forum for instance would probably increase the barrier to connect easily. We do get a lot of repeat questions through our channels, which takes time to answer, but that also tells us that we could do a better job at documenting our functionality.</p><h2>How do people find out about the community?</h2><p>The Slack community is <strong>open for all</strong>, but we don’t really promote it anywhere, except for a mention in our welcome email. We do have a prominent entry point in the main menu inside our application, but we probably should do a bit more to guide users to the community.</p><h2>How do you keep your community lively and positive?</h2><p>Not too long ago, we started with channels where people can <strong>introduce themselves</strong>, <strong>share stories</strong> about how they started using Linear, or learn about <strong>how other companies are using Linear</strong> to drive their software development. Most other channels are about providing feedback and feature requests or asking questions about particular functionality. <strong>Our whole team is active in those channels and we try to respond to each discussion.</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ef2146b-918e-435e-beff-7d37f00f6bb4_1080x720.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ef2146b-918e-435e-beff-7d37f00f6bb4_1080x720.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5ef2146b-918e-435e-beff-7d37f00f6bb4_1080x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:650777,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>So far, the discussion has always remained positive and courteous. If discussions were ever to change to be rude, we would have to think about publishing community guidelines and enforcing them. I do believe that the positivity in the community is tightly coupled with how people experience Linear. If that were to change we would first have to <strong>look at our product and see where we’ve messed up</strong> the user experience.</p><blockquote><p>Any question is literally our problem. If people have to ask how things work, then we haven't done a good job in the product to explain it.</p></blockquote><p>The time it takes to reply to everything is really <strong>the only downside</strong>. Then again, you want to spend time with your customers so I don’t see it as something annoying. Any question is literally our problem. If people have to ask how things work, then we haven't done a good job in the product to explain it.</p><h2>How did engagement change when you grew from the first 50 members to a few hundred members?</h2><p>Nothing much has changed really as we’ve grown. Except for the volume of feedback and questions. As mentioned before, it’s our belief that everybody on the team should be exposed to feedback from our customers. So everybody was just active on the channels and responding to questions. But at some point, we realized that <strong>the team could no longer keep up</strong> with the amount of feedback and that this unstructured approach would not scale much further.</p><p>We did want to continue to provide awesome support, so we started building out a <strong>customer experience function</strong> at Linear. This ensures that all questions get answered quickly. Either directly by our customer experience lead or by someone else on the team who gets looped into the conversation. This helps us to continue learning from our users in a more efficient and controlled manner.</p><h2>How do you involve your community in improving your product?</h2><p>We use the feedback from our community as <strong>signals that help us prioritize</strong> what we’re working on. Receiving a lot of feedback of a certain type will make us re-prioritize our work and look into that particular problem field.</p><p>Often we do get feedback on existing functionality that we feel is just a good improvement (or a straight-up bug report). This kind of feedback we <strong>try to address immediately</strong>, in order to constantly ship smaller improvements to our users.</p><blockquote><p>We try to surprise and delight our users every now and then with a more elegant solution than they could have imagined.</p></blockquote><p>For all the other feedback, it's important to <strong>understand the underlying problem</strong>. It is therefore <strong>necessary to dive deeper</strong> instead of literally building what our users ask. A particular feature request might be an indication of a deeper reaching problem or limitation of our application. Coming up with a solution to that underlying problem might have <strong>further-reaching effects</strong> than implementing individual asks. This way we try to surprise and delight our users every now and then with a more elegant solution than they could have imagined.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb19929c3-8a7c-40d8-9907-fb9147cf468f_2045x1088.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb19929c3-8a7c-40d8-9907-fb9147cf468f_2045x1088.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b19929c3-8a7c-40d8-9907-fb9147cf468f_2045x1088.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:775,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:476511,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>We usually do quarterly planning on these kinds of high-level directions for the application. The planning makes sure that we’re addressing the needs of our customers with more complicated <strong>long-term projects</strong> as well.</p><p>For substantial additions, we <strong>select a few customers</strong> and invite them to a private Slack channel. We let them try it out and provide feedback before we ship it to the rest of our users. Sometimes we involve our customers very early on to provide feedback already in the design phase. This is all to make sure that we’re <strong>building something that our users want</strong>.</p><h2>One piece of advice you would give to anyone that is building out an early community around a software startup</h2><blockquote><p>You’re building something for your users and not for yourself.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Invest the time as soon as possible</strong>. You will be in a place where you’re rapidly iterating on the product and working very hard. At that point, spending a lot of time to build up and engaging with a community might feel like a distraction, but <strong>it’s well worth it</strong>. After all, you’re building something for your users and not yourself.</p><h2>What are your plans for the future, as a company in general and with your community?</h2><p>We’re focused on building out <strong>the best application for managing software product development</strong>. We’ve started small and are continuously increasing the footprint of what Linear can do and what kind of companies it can support. Our biggest user segment consists of other startup-ups and our plan is to <strong>grow with them</strong>, supporting them with new functionality as they grow. This will require <strong>continuous communications and the building of our community</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You didn’t have to be an investor, you just had to be <em>alive</em> over the last few decades to know that the stock market is far from a predictable or even stable thing.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp#:~:text=During%20the%20dotcom%20bubble%2C%20the,the%20years%201995%20and%202000.&amp;text=Even%20the%20share%20prices%20of,than%2080%25%20of%20their%20value." target="_blank">The bursting of the “Dotcom Bubble”</a> saw the Nasdaq index peak and then fall more than 76% from March 2000 to October 2002 thanks to speculative investment in seemingly miraculous new “internet companies” that couldn’t deliver on outlandish expectations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Hot on the heels of that meltdown came another — <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp" target="_blank">the Great Recession of 2008</a>, triggered by a general lack of regulation in several corners of the financial industry.<br></p><p>Which brings us to today and the most unique crisis that most of us will ever experience — COVID-19. Now considered the herald of the COVID-19 recession, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash" target="_blank">2020 stock market crash, or “Coronavirus Crash,”</a> was a global stock market crash that ran from February 20, 2020, to April 7, 2020, and was the most damaging since the Wall Street Crash of 1929 that kicked off the Great Depression.<br></p><p>If that brief history of economic instability freaked you out a bit, we can’t blame you. But what we <em>can</em> do is help you improve upon one of the few elements of wealth management that you can control — how you choose to allocate your assets to ward off loss through inevitable market fluctuations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So let’s get started by diving a little deeper into the ins and outs of that term “diversification” that we hear so much about and then explore the alternative investments today’s current or aspiring high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) can turn to in order to protect their portfolios.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Why Modern Investors Are Diversifying Into Alternative Investments</h2><p>If the past 20 years have taught us anything about wealth management, it’s that absolutely no single asset class is immune to failing. That’s exactly why modern investors are looking to alternative investment sources to diversify their investment portfolios beyond simple stocks and bonds.<br></p><p>But what exactly does that mean, “diversify”?&nbsp;<br></p><p>When it comes to wealth management, <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-investment">diversification is the process of investing in different types of assets</a> to shield your portfolio from the losses that come with inevitable ups and downs in the stock market. <br></p><p>Diversification actually works <em>because of</em> these natural fluctuations. While every market will flex, it’s extremely unlikely they’ll all flex the same way at the same time — which puts you at less risk of experiencing dramatic losses and in a good position to catch the gains.<br></p><p>Which leads us to our next point: Effective diversification is done with purpose, not by throwing a dart and picking the first asset you hit.<br></p><div><p>A well-diversified portfolio will contain your own unique selection of assets that align with your risk tolerance which still meeting your goals for growth. If you aren’t sure where you stand with your risk tolerance, <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire" target="_blank">try this quiz from Vanguard to help you decide</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, investors who build long-term, carefully-diversified portfolios have a <em>much</em> easier time generating returns and riding out the losses than the high-stakes gamblers who bet all their money on a single asset and often lose big in the stock market.</p></div><p>Next up: Today’s strongest alternative investment types to look for when building your balanced portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Alternative Investments Worth Considering in a Digital-First World</h2><p>Between technological developments and a growing population of <a href="https://www.mx.com/thought-leadership/the-changing-face-of-wealth" target="_blank">adults who are more financially savvy than their predecessors</a>, actively seeking unconventional sources of income, and excited to manage their wealth digitally; we’re witnessing the birth of a new asset class that is changing the investment world.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/digital-asset-investment"><strong>Digital assets are the alternative investment class of the future</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the term “digital asset” can be used to describe digital tokens that represent traditional and even physical assets, in this case we’re talking about assets that exist only in the digital realm.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While digital assets are still a new idea for many investors, they’re just as powerful as any traditional investment asset. Just ask the Winklevoss twins — <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/people/083016/who-are-top-5-bitcoin-millionaires.asp" target="_blank">the world’s first Bitcoin billionaires</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And according to a recent survey of almost 800 financial professionals across the U.S. and Europe, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200609005138/en/Growing-Number-Institutional-Investors-Digital-Assets-Part" target="_blank">institutional investors are very interested in digital assets</a>.<br></p><figure id="w-node-931cd4d59614-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/5f91241956ac2a548b0f0a9e_01-Image%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The most popular digital asset among these investors? Bitcoin — a type of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With that in mind, let’s talk more about cryptocurrency as well as some other popular digital assets you can use to round out your modern investment portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp" target="_blank">Cryptocurrency is digital currency</a> that is secured using cryptography and “backed” by a distributed network of computers. Its decentralized nature means it exists outside the control of any central authority, which increases its transparency but also its general instability (for now).</p><p>Cryptocurrency — often shorted to “crypto” — exists solely in the digital sphere, and it’s leading the way as far as introducing the masses to digital assets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Fidelity has launched a <a href="http://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=Fidelity_Digital_Assets" target="_blank">digital assets subsidiary</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/people/083016/who-are-top-5-bitcoin-millionaires.asp" target="_blank">the crypto-focused investment firm</a> Pantera Capital has delivered a 24,000% return to investors, and investment advisory firm <a href="https://medium.com/@HuttCapital/reflecting-on-cambridge-associates-blockchain-investment-research-piece-d06bc3af0469" target="_blank">Cambridge Associates encouraged investors to try digital assets</a> in their report “Cryptoassets: Venture into the Unknown.”<br></p><p>To get started with crypto, do your research and sign up with a credible exchange that enables you to create a crypto “wallet” and start buying and selling coins. But remember, as easy as it is to dive into crypto, it’s also as easy to mess it up. Learn the lingo and get a running start with this overview from Hacker Noon: “<a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-cryptocurrencies-76027bebb1b1" target="_blank">A beginner’s guide to getting started with cryptocurrencies</a>.”<br></p><h3>Websites&nbsp;</h3><p>There are <em>billions</em> of websites online — which makes websites a <em>huge</em> asset class when you think about them as an alternative investment resource for your portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you want to invest in websites without making website management your full-time job, the best approach for you is probably buying, improving (or just holding), and “flipping” — to use real estate lingo — any type of website that generates income. Often, these include blogs, digital publications, and ecommerce stores.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To find established (and, ideally, money-making) websites that are for sale, you’ll want to look at online website marketplaces. <a href="https://flippa.com/websites" target="_blank">Flippa is quite common</a> and a good place to start.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Domain Names&nbsp;</h3><p>A little more specific than websites are the domain names upon which they exist.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A domain name is a unique address people use to access a website. For example, the domain name of the website you’re reading this on is “kubera.com.”<br></p><p>To revisit the real estate metaphor, domain names are kind of like land in the fast-growing city that is the internet. As more people want their own space on the internet, the more valuable domain names become.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For investor Igal Lichtman, for example, <a href="https://www.kubera.com/blog/what-happens-to-your-domains-when-you-die">the value of his domain names would have amounted to almost $75,000</a> for just a handful of some of his smartest investments — <em>if</em> he had properly prepared his beneficiaries to take ownership of his domains (more on that in the next section!).<br></p><p>While there are several ways to generate income from purchasing domain names — developing a website, displaying ads, etc. — the strategy that makes the most sense for someone who’s interested from an investment standpoint is again a buy/hold/sell approach.&nbsp;<br></p><p>GoDaddy, a recognized domain registrar where you can search for and purchase domain names, has a simple guide that will help you start wrapping your head around <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/5-tried-and-true-tips-for-buying-and-selling-domain-names-for-profit/" target="_blank">the process of buying and selling domain names for profit</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id="w-node-52e775ab4ef0-ac468d02"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ded36b5e942e74b13468d23/5f9124f817272fdbe88f5353_02-Image%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt="HNWI interest in digital assets"></p></figure><p>Remember that these are just some of the most popular digital assets for investors who are just diving into the alternative realm. There are plenty of other options, including trademarks, SaaS platforms, revenue-generating social media accounts, and tons more. In fact, KPMG estimates that <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/03/wealth-managers-can-adapt-to-digital-assets-and-thrive/" target="_blank">there are more than 2,000 digital assets</a> on the market. So if you didn’t click with any of the digital assets we discussed today, stay tuned as we cover more digital assets on our blog in the future — you’re bound to find a good fit for your portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>How to Manage All of Your Alternative Investments</h2><p>While you might be ready for alternative investments, chances are the traditional portfolio management tools you’re used to aren’t up for the challenge.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When you’re ready for a portfolio manager that’s <em>made</em> for the digital world in which we live, turn to Kubera.&nbsp;<br></p><p>At Kubera, we brought together the <a href="https://www.kubera.com/portfolio-tracker">ease of a spreadsheet with the power of high-tech integrations</a> to enable you to manage and optimize every single one of your assets — from traditional investments like stocks and bonds (<a href="https://www.kubera.com/financial-tracking-app">in any currency!</a>) to <a href="https://www.kubera.com/crypto-tracker">alternative assets like crypto, domain names, websites, and more</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And not only that, but <a href="https://www.kubera.com/beneficiary-management">Kubera’s beneficiary management feature also empowers investors</a> to create a secure and streamlined path for passing their investment portfolio down to a pre-determined heir when the time comes.

<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code">The Culture Code</a> by Daniel Coyle starts out with a fascinating example of a bad apple. Here’s a big quote, but I promise it’s worth it.</p>



<blockquote><p>Meet Nick, a handsome, dark-haired man in his twenties seated comfortably in a wood-paneled conference room in Seattle with three other people. To outward appearances, he is an ordinary participant in an ordinary meeting. This appearance, however, is deceiving. The other people in the room do not know it, but his mission is to sabotage the group’s performance.</p><p>Nick is the key element of an experiment being run by Will Felps, who studies organizational behavior at the University of South Wales in Australia. Felps has brought in Nick to portray three negative archetypes: the Jerk (an aggressive, defiant deviant), the Slacker (a withholder of effort), and the Downer (a depressive Eeyore type). Nick plays these roles inside forty four-person groups tasked with constructing a marketing plan for a start-up. In effect, Felps injects him into the various groups the way a biologist might inject a virus into a body: to see how the system responds. Felps calls it the bad apple experiment.</p><p>Nick is really good at being bad. In almost every group, his behavior reduces the quality of the group’s performance by 30 to 40 percent. The drop-off is consistent whether he plays the Jerk, the Slacker, or the Downer.</p><p>“When Nick is the Downer, everybody comes into the meeting really energized. He acts quiet and tired and at some point puts his head down on his desk,” Felps says. “And then as the time goes by, they all start to behave that way, tired and quiet and low energy. By the end, there are three others with their heads down on their desks like him, all with their arms folded.”</p><p>When Nick plays the Slacker, a similar pattern occurs. “The group quickly picks up on his vibe,” Felps says. “They get done with the project very quickly, and they do a half-assed job. What’s interesting, though, is that when you ask them about it afterward, they’re very positive on the surface. They say, ‘We did a good job, we enjoyed it.’ But it isn’t true. They’d picked up on the attitude that this project really didn’t matter, that it wasn’t worth their time or energy. I’d gone in expecting that someone in the group would get upset with the Slacker or the Downer. But nobody did. They were like, ‘Okay, if that’s how it is, then we’ll be Slackers and Downers too.’ ”</p><cite>Daniel Coyle, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code">The Culture Code</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This was a lightbulb moment for me because I see it all the time but I’ve never realized it. </p>



<p>I’ve been in upbeat meetings that were cruising until a downer joined. And I’ve seen miserable Eeyore meetings turn around when an excited person hopped on. </p>



<p>It only takes one Nick. One downer, or one jerk, or one slacker (which often manifests by <em>multitasking</em>). I don’t want to be the Nick. I can’t be the person that brings the group down. </p>



<p>The book goes on to describe an outlier group. Nick couldn’t bog this group down, because it had Jonathan. Jonathan was so good at encouraging and jelling the team that Nick didn’t have an effect. Nick even found himself being helpful almost against his will.</p>



<p>My resolution is to either be the Jonathan, or leave the meeting. If I can’t help but be the Nick, then I shouldn’t be there. They’re better off without me. Jonathan or bust!</p>

<![CDATA[The On-Demand Communication Fallacy]]>

October 28, 2020 | https://curvedlayer.com/2020/10/20/internal-communication.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://curvedlayer.com/2020/10/20/internal-communication.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Well established communication is the most critical factor for the team to work. Without sharing information, we can’t get anything done.</p>

<p>Poorly designed communication brings more harm than any other inefficient process. Let’s take Slack as an example. Slack made it effortless to ask anyone in the team at your convenience. You don’t know the date of the next release? You’re one question away from knowing it.</p>

<p>Although this is a powerful concept, there are numerous downsides to it. Instead of surfacing relevant information, we “actively query” knowledge from humans on-demand.</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-on-demand-communication">Problems with on-demand communication</h3>
<p>Active Information Seeking is commonly used in social media. With algorithms forming the feed, new and engaging content is always there for you. No matter when you open the app.</p>

<p>Real-time chat apps are using a similar model. Except in the team environment, you don’t need “engaging” content. All you need is painless access to your colleagues.</p>

<h4 id="1--remote-teams">#1 – Remote Teams</h4>
<p>Having the team spread around the world immediately breaks an on-demand information querying model. You can’t rely on people being available whenever you are. You no longer have the luxury to ask people anytime.</p>

<p>A lot of US companies embraced Remote work but only within the US. <span>Limiting communication to a time zone doesn’t solve the fundamental problem. It just removes some symptoms.</span></p>

<p>In the remote environment, communication flow should not depend on individuals. It decreases the overall resilience of the team and slows everyone down.</p>

<h4 id="2--idle-time">#2 – Idle Time</h4>
<p>The time you spend asking people is the time that could be invested better. The time you wait for their response is even more precious. If you value time and speed, on-demand communication should not even be the option.</p>

<p>I’m not even talking about the effects of this model on other people in the team. Every message (information query) sent could break someone else’s flow. And coming back to the flow state would require additional effort + time.</p>

<h4 id="3--pressure--anxiety">#3 – Pressure &amp; Anxiety</h4>
<p>Heavy reliance on real-time communication brings additional emotional pressure. It is especially true for remote teams. There’s no way to know what the person on the other end feels. What might seem like a “friendly question” could be a distraction for others.</p>

<h3 id="passive-consumption--active-seeking">Passive Consumption &gt; Active Seeking</h3>
<p>The opposite of active on-demand communication is passive information consumption. With heavy reliance on systems, passive consumption guarantees relevant information is distributed to the right people at the right time. Setting up passive consumption for a team requires you to look at overall operations on the meta-level. Define who needs what and when.</p>

<p>The marketing team might need to know about the new feature release at least three weeks in advance. Or support engineers might need to know about bug fix deployment right away.</p>

<p>This way, you can set up processes to let relevant information come to people. Instead of people searching for relevant information themselves.</p>

<p>There are a few tools based on this model. For example, <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a> and <a href="http://mailmanhq.com/">Mailman</a> allow choosing the terms for receiving relevant information. No matter when this information became available.</p>

<h3 id="fundamentals-of-information-logistics">Fundamentals of Information Logistics</h3>
<p>The idea of passive information consumption is based on information distribution rules. There are five core principles for information logistics. Each piece of circulating information needs to be examined against them.</p>

<p>It’s important to mention these concepts below aren’t isolated from each other. That means each of them defines the others.</p>

<h4 id="what-kind-of-information">What kind of Information?</h4>
<p>First, it’s important to define the actual knowledge you want to distribute. It can be the date of the upcoming release or feedback from customers, bug reports, etc. Not everything has to be delivered passively.</p>

<h4 id="who-needs-the-information">Who needs the Information?</h4>
<p>When the type of information is defined, it’s time to understand who needs to get it. How to select those people? A good approximation would be answering those questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How motivated are they to get the information?</li>
  <li>How much their duty depends on the information?</li>
  <li>What difference would it make if they won’t get the information?</li>
</ul>

<p>For passive consumption to work, you have to clearly define recipients. But it’s also important not to make the information fully exclusive. There might be other motivated people in the team that you didn’t include.</p>

<h4 id="when-information-is-needed">When Information is needed?</h4>
<p>You have “what” and “who” the next piece is “when”. Different kinds of information should be delivered at different times, depending on the recipient. For example, deploy of the critical bug fix could be delivered instantly. While information about upcoming releases can be delivered in weekly batches.</p>

<p>Determining the right time ensures that the recipient will consume the information. One of the reasons on-demand communication doesn’t work is because the time when the question is asked isn’t comfortable for the person answering.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-right-form-of-information">What’s the right form of Information?</h4>
<p>The form in which you deliver information plays an important role too. Some people prefer information presented visually, while others like long text messages. The same information can be presented as a presentation, visual diagram, text message, charts, etc. It’s another step to ensure the content you share is consumed.</p>

<p>Because sending the long document hoping people read it doesn’t guaranty anything. You can have all the information in the world in one Google Doc, but it would be impossible to read.</p>

<h4 id="what-delivery-channel-to-use">What delivery channel to use?</h4>
<p>Just like the form of information ensures readability, the channel you use to deliver knowledge ensures receivability. Some people prefer Slack messages, emails, or even Issues on GitHub as information delivery channels. It’s up to the recipient to determine which channel would work best for them.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-setup-passive-consumption">How to setup Passive Consumption?</h3>
<p>You can automate pretty much everything with tools like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and recently launched <a href="https://www.ahoyteam.com/">AhoyTeam</a>. Including information distribution at the right time and through comfortable channels.</p>

<p>Actual technical implementation depends a lot on the tools your team uses. For example, do you host your code on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab? Are you using Slack, Twist, or Microsoft Teams? What do you use for Task Management?</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Passive information consumption has many upsides compared to on-demand communication. If you noticed, with the on-demand communication model, there is little or no consideration of other people’s preferences. While in passive consumption, other people’s preference is the only thing that makes the system work.</p>

<p>It takes time to set up, analyze the information flow, define interested people, etc. But the gain is a calmer, more efficient workplace where people do not bother each other for no reason.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/okrs-vs-kpis-explanation-with-examples-for-engineering-teams" data-title="OKRs vs. KPIs: explanation with examples for Engineering Teams.">
<p><em>OKRs vs. KPIs, what are the differences?</em> That’s a common question I hear from managers of Engineering Teams. KPIs are more straightforward to explain than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKRs</a>, which can be tricky and more complex. They don’t mean the same, although they are connected.</p>



<h2>What are KPIs?</h2>



<p><strong>KPI stands for Key Performance Indicators.</strong> In other words, KPIs are a set of metrics that should give you an overview of the area or team’s performance. They need to be measurable and comparable.</p>



<p>If you look at many KPIs, they’re not fulfilling their purpose. Organizations should select as few as possible so that tracking the progress is possible. Besides, all the significant changes in process and company goals should impact the numbers.</p>



<p>Then, managing an area or a team becomes more tangible: when the KPIs show poor performance, it’s time to act. The actions taken should reflect better numbers; otherwise, managers need to find another strategy and act differently.</p>



<h2>What are OKRs?</h2>



<p><strong>OKRs stands for Objective Key Results</strong>. It’s a managing methodology that is popular in Silicon Valey. It’s been widely adopted by companies and startups at scale. It’s also seen as an alternative or complement for strategic planning.</p>



<p>OKRs’ primary purpose is to define Objectives that must align with the business and a set of Key Results. Each Key Result needs to have a measurable number as the goal and a limit date. The limit date means that the goal should be achieved within that time frame.</p>



<h2>What’s the difference between KPIs and OKRs?</h2>



<p><strong>KPIs provide an overview of the area or team for managers, whereas OKRs must focus on its future.</strong> That said, it becomes clear that KPIs are a controlling tool, and OKRs intend to change an organization’s status quo and keep track of its progress by periodic assessment meetings.</p>



<p>It’s crucial to have that in mind when choosing the KPIs and the OKRs. Otherwise, they become useless and can even play against business goals. Let’s see some examples of them</p>



<h2>Examples of OKRs and KPIs for Engineering Teams</h2>



<p>Below there is a list of KPIs examples. However, you can find more examples in my article&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/software-engineering-kpis-how-to-choose-the-best-fitting-metrics">Software Engineering KPIs: how to choose the best fitting metrics</a>.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Deploy Frequency</strong>: it’s a sum of the <a href="https://thenewstack.io/measuring-engineering-velocity-deploy-frequency-as-a-vital-sign-of-devops-health/">number of deploys made by day</a>, week, or month, depending on the organization’s need.&nbsp;<em>It shows how frequently the team — or area — delivers value to the final user</em>.</li><li><strong>Time to Merge</strong>: it measures the number of days a Pull Request remains open or under review. You can find an average or, as I prefer, see the 75th percentile of all pull requests closed in a given period.&nbsp;<em>It shows how performant is the team</em>.</li><li><strong>Time to Recover</strong>: how much time does the application is inaccessible after an error?&nbsp;<em>This metric tells a lot about how engineering teams respond to failures.</em></li></ul>



<p>When thinking of OKRs, Engineering Teams may consider Objectives such as:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Improving the Time to Market of new features</strong></li><li><strong>Lessen the Churn rate of the product</strong></li></ul>



<p>Here are some possible Key Results for&nbsp;<strong>Improving the Time to Market of new features</strong>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase the Deploy Frequency to 37/week until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. Assuming you deploy less than 37 times a week currently, increasing the frequency means you’re delivering more. Delivering more is crucial to achieving a more competitive Time to Market.</li><li><strong>Reduce the 75th percentile of Time to Merge to 3 days until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. Instead of the Median or Average, I prefer using the 75th percentile for Key Results. In other words, it means that 75% of the Pull Requests must be merged up to 3 days after they were opened. The team can achieve it by opening lighter pull requests or engaging in collaborators’ pull requests instead of working on a new work item.</li></ul>



<p>For the second object,&nbsp;<strong>Lessen the Churn rate of the product</strong>, let’s assume you know the primary source of churn comes due to a high number of errors in the application. Then, the Key Results could include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reduce the number of Technical Debts to 15 until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. Let’s say you have 30 Technical Debts currently. It’s a 50% improvement. There are many chances that improving the codebase will positively affect the churn rate and help in the KR of the previous Objective. The cleaner the code, the better it embraces the changes. It means you can reduce the churn and also achieve better Time to Market by gardening your codebase.</li><li><strong>Reduce the Mean Time to Recover to Recover (MTTR) to 3 minutes until &lt;insert the date&gt;</strong>. The team needs to monitor application outages, connectivity problems, 503 errors, and other failures to ensure end-users’ experience is not impacted with more than 3 minutes of instability.</li></ul>



<h2>In short,</h2>



<p>KPIs and OKRs are not the same. They have different purposes. KPIs aim to give managers an overview of how the team or area is working, whereas OKRs focus on providing the team a direction and then tracking its progress.</p>



<p>I presented some examples of KPIs and OKRs for Engineering Teams to illustrate the difference. SourceLevel provides lots of metrics, which may include your KPIs.

      <article>
  
  <div>
        <p>For the past few months I’ve been thinking about how to persuade some of the top philanthropists, investors and thinkers to work on an idea alongside me.</p><p>These ideas aren’t focused on problems that I’ve typically tried to tackle in the past. They’re focused on some of the most significant problems facing the world today: carbon removal, longevity, artificial intelligence, biotech, battery technology... to name a few.</p><h2 id="why-these-challenges">Why these challenges?</h2><p>Now in my early thirties, I want to focus on what I believe are some of the biggest challenges facing the world today. Using everything that I’ve learned over the past decade of launching startups, building machine learning algorithms, and connecting with people that are much smarter than me.</p><p>Seeing initiatives such as the <a href="https://earthshotprize.org/">Earthshot Prize</a>, <a href="https://schmidtfutures.com/">Schmidt Futures</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1284531841651752960?s=21">Chamath’s ‘climate action’ call</a>, I feel there’s never been a better time to focus on the biggest challenges we face as humanity.</p><p>Over the next few months I’ve set myself the challenge of scoping out a solution to these challenges that is worth exploring, then to partner with a domain expert, and start to raise funding.</p><p>So how should I go about building a compelling case?</p><h2 id="creating-good-ideas-clear-thinking-is-clear-writing">Creating good ideas: clear thinking is clear writing</h2><p>You might have seen my <a href="https://st.im/what-i-learned-reading-every-amazon-shareholder-letter/">recent post</a> on how I read every one of Amazon's shareholder letters.</p><p>I chose Amazon for a reason.</p><p>Founder &amp; CEO, Jeff Bezos, is an excellent storyteller. His writing is concise, articulate and authentic. It's rare to find someone who can convey their thinking, mission and vision as articulately as Bezos can. And he places a high level of importance on the skill at Amazon.</p><p>Bezos has been able to instil, defend and evolve his company's thinking and behaviour for two decades, ever since its founding. The only ideas that can survive for that long are the ones that are packaged memorably enough -- and memorably packaging ideas in just a few choice words has long been one of Bezos' strengths.</p><p>One of the most important takeaways I found whilst reading through his shareholder letters was Amazon's use of 'six-page narratives', alongside their 'no PowerPoint' rule.</p><blockquote><em>We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of “study hall.” Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.</em></blockquote><p>Bezos goes onto explain what makes a good memo:</p><blockquote>Here’s what we’ve figured out. Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! They’re trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we’re not coaching them right. The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can’t be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo probably should take a week or more.</blockquote><p>Writing these narratives, or stories, forces those at Amazon to think through their ideas in high-resolution detail. Instead of wasting time with impromptu brainstorming sessions, writing memos ensures that group discussion is based on the critical review of the relevant ideas, not on hypotheticals.</p><p>Most importantly, it makes it impossible to hide any logical inconsistencies in the ideas that people put out there. By imposing a rigorous, standardised template on the process of idea generation at Amazon, Jeff Bezos raises the bar and raises the quality of his team's thinking.</p><h2 id="stories-have-long-been-fundamental-to-the-human-experience">Stories have long been fundamental to the human experience</h2><p>Stories are vivid, coherent and memorable – and are crucial to how we interact with the world. Although the term ‘story’ conjures images of fairy tales and myths, there is little that occurs in our lives around which we do not attempt to weave a narrative. Stories cater to our need for sense-making and our desire to observe causality. In one form or another, they underpin most human decisions.</p><p>One particular model of decision-making – explanation-based theory – emphasises that in certain conditions, individuals start their decision process by developing a causal model to explain the available evidence. To rationalise it, in other words, and put otherwise potentially abstract data into context. In this model, the story that has been created informs the ultimate decision as much as the standalone evidence.</p><p>Trial jurors are more likely to be persuaded by evidence if it is presented in the order of a logical story than if the same evidence is shown in random order. What’s more, the story each individual develops around the evidence will be unique and dependent on their own characteristics, beliefs and experience.</p><p>The juror example is useful when considering the role of narratives in investment decision making. Explanation-based theory is particularly applicable when decisions are large and complex, as investment decisions often tend to be. In fact, investment decision-making is a domain in which stories assume a particular importance in driving, informing and justifying conclusions.</p><p>There are two key reasons for this:</p><p>Complexity: narratives aid our comprehension There is intricacy and complication even in the simplest of investments, and if we start to consider the innovation and product proliferation that have come to define the industry, many investments can be fairly considered unfathomable. Stories are important in allowing investors to both simplify and justify decisions. </p><p>Uncertainty: startups, by definition, are risky. There are many things founders simply can’t plan for. Our surest means of coping with the discomfort is to manufacture meaning by forging a relationship between the data and an explanation – a story, in other words – of why the data is what it is and how it got that way.</p><p>Most investors won’t make a decision without it being supported by some form of story, and that’s understandable; stories are effective and can be very valuable. Now with the pandemic meaning in-person meetings are on hold, crafting a narrative -- with clear supporting evidence -- seems to be the best way for me to forge a connection with any potential investor.</p><p>Using Amazon’s narrative format, I'm sharing some ‘six-pagers’ that will hopefully start to lay the foundations for the next chapter of my life.</p><p>If you’ve read this blog before, you’ll know I'm a fan of networked thought, using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> on a daily basis.</p><p>They've just rolled out a new feature, Obsidian Publish; which, in essence, is a public notebook. I thought it would probably make most sense to share my own <a href="http://publish.obsidian.md/stim">six-page narratives</a> on there.</p><p>I'm still working on them as we speak, so you're getting a pretty raw insight into my thinking, as well as how I formulate or tackle problems.</p><p>I hope you’ll follow me as I start out on this new journey.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603826118326/xmu8PEoSf.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>I just recently started my graduate role 🥳 at  <a target="_blank" href="https://ampersandcommerce.com/">Ampersand UK</a> and it's been amazing, (PS. That is why I have been MIA from blogging) however, prior to that I was involved in a few extracurricular activities before starting my job. Today I want to talk about a few facts I appreciate knowing before starting my tech career. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ox8sJtZb5lw">Listen to me</a>  read the post to you</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fact number 1</strong>, there is a tech community, that is generous, willing and happy to help, or share their ideas and expertise in a wide variety of non-technical and technical topics. If you are like me and have been under a rock, doing things by yourself and not quite finding a community to encourage you in your journey. This would be particularly relieving to know, because, I don't know what it is about seeing people in positions I aspire to be? But for me, it gives me a sense of hope that I can achieve what I set out to do. It's great to know that I am not in this alone! In irony, I was never 😃, I just decided to stick my head out a little and it's paid off tremendously. </p>

<p><strong>Fact number 2</strong>, Mentors are important! For the most part of my journey, I have had what I would refer to as <em>online mentors</em>. People who I haven't met, but I have spent time with their work. Engaging with it and taking away little gems that have helped me one way or the other. But do you know what would have even been more helpful? Having a physical mentor, that I could have both formal and informal conversations with. Someone who is a friend and mentor, who has way more life and work experience than I have. I really do believe having this sort of relationship in your life is mutually beneficial to both mentor and mentee. If you have one atm you are very lucky!</p>

<p><strong>Okay fact number 3</strong> I did mention at the start that I was involved in some extracurricular activities before I started my job. These included</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteering to teach kids how to code</li>
<li>Contributing to open source projects </li>
<li>Starting a  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mycodinghabits/">technical page</a>  on Instagram </li>
<li>Mentoring and</li>
<li>Technical writing as seen on this blog etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually enjoyed doing all of these extracurricular activities, because It was fulfilling. I was spreading knowledge that was extremely helpful to people that needed the help, support, general information or source of inspiration. It felt purposeful, knowing I was serving others in a way that added value.</p>

<p><strong>Fact number 4</strong> is a bit of a debatable fact! Some say to prove yourself in the workplace you have to go <em> <strong>'Above and beyond'</strong></em>  to impress both your colleagues and employer. Others say it's a <strong><em>9-5 no more no less</em></strong>, I am sure you have also heard <strong><em>work smart not hard</em></strong>, and the debate goes on. I was still on the fence on this one until I read an article by <a href="https://hashnode.com/@victoria">Victoria Lo</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://lo-victoria.com/become-a-better-developer-with-self-care">self-care tips</a>  for developers. And I had an <em>Aha moment</em> 🤓, it made sense. The keyword with the whole idea of work-life balance is the word <strong><em>BALANCE</em></strong>. I believe there are grey areas with this concept and it can't be a sharp contrast between managing both your life and work because sometimes one might require more attention than the other. And as professionals we have to adhere to the different demands accordingly, but in this case do it acknowledging the human also needs to be taken care of in order to perform at their most optimal level.</p>

<p><strong> Finally the money fact </strong> I bet a good number of us did not negotiate the salary offer for your first job? 🙋🏾‍♀️ I didn't as well, not necessarily a bad thing, I bet given better knowledge, circumstance, experience or understanding you could have. But what's great about this fact is I can start doing specific things that would help my chances of getting a raise on the job or better feedback. Someone once said if you don't document it, it never happened, and if it never happened there would not be any strong basis for negotiation or solid feedback that is essential for my growth. So a few things I now know to implement towards this fact is</p>
<ul>
<li>To document my progress on the job and how my work might be improving the business or even helping my team in general.</li>
<li>By doing this, scheduled 1:1s with my team lead would be more practical and intentional. This way, asking for feedback or opportunity for growth would be easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons I love where I work is that, this practice of documenting and organizing 1:1s is done using a platform called  <a target="_blank" href="https://lattice.com/">Lattice</a>. With a tool like this, there is a lot of transparency, and its good practice not only for negotiating your salary, but for adding to your career growth, and also appreciating other peoples work in and outside your team.</p>
<p>Is there any other <strong>fact/advise you would like to share with me?</strong> Please write them in the comment section. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Engage with my post </strong> ==&gt; I promise you it cost nothing</li>
<li><strong> Comment below your thoughts </strong> ==&gt; I would really like to hear them</li>
<li><strong> Share with others </strong> ==&gt; lol don't be stingy!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Software is eating the world, and community is eating software</p>

<p>In no particular order, a few predictions for community in the 2020s.</p>

<p>💪 <strong>Community will continue to be a broad term</strong>, but finally people and companies will fully grasp that an audience does not mean the same thing as a community.</p>

<p>🪑 <strong>Community will finally get a seat at the table</strong>, following in the footsteps of customer success from a decade ago. Community will become its own department within orgs, leading to more Heads of Community, Chief Community Officers, and other community leadership roles.</p>

<p>✨ <strong>Continued specialization of roles in community.</strong> Community Manager will turn into Community Engagement, Community Marketing, Community Support, Community Success, etc.</p>

<p>🙋 <strong>And then we’ll see other roles start to merge under community.</strong> Community, customer support, and customer success will overlap and start to blend together. Traditional CS roles will still exist, but more ‘low-level’ support will be offloaded to communities and community teams.</p>

<p>📈 <strong>More and more companies will invest in community early</strong>, hiring their first community roles in their first 10 or 20 employees. Community will be standard for startups started in the 2020s.</p>

<p>💼 <strong>The unbundling of LinkedIn.</strong> What Dribbble is to designers, we’ll see for nurses, marketers, community managers, and every other career vertical, providing community, ‘portfolios’, and better job hunting experiences tailored to the specific type.</p>

<p>🎁 <strong>The unbundling of Reddit.</strong> Every subreddit will get its own dedicated community app, built specifically to serve the unique needs of that vertical. Vertical specificity will win out over general community platforms.</p>

<p>🚗 <strong>Community-driven versions of existing products</strong> and services will continue to be built, eventually taking over those who built without community. See Public vs Robinhood.</p>

<p>📣 <strong>Interactive audio and audio communities</strong> will continue to grow. Spotify will enter the market with their own offering, or acquire an existing player similarly to when they initially entered podcasting.</p>

<p>🕺 <strong>We’ll see innovation in the community platform space.</strong> Everything right now looks like some form of forum or ‘Slack for community’. We’ll see platforms that rethink the idea of community from the ground up, in less structured ways than ‘forums’.</p>

<p>🌍 The explosion of remote work will continue to drive <strong>a greater need for community at every level, online and offline</strong>, locally and globally. Expect more companies to build verticals in Nextdoor’s space.</p>

<p>🤑 <strong>Companies will continue to acquire communities</strong> as starting points for their own. See Outreach + Saleshacker, Stripe + Indiehackers, and DigitalOcean + Scotch.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>More and more companies will build communities of interest</strong>, rather than just customer &amp; support communities. This will enable their communities to reach a wider audience, and ultimately be seen as revenue generators rather than cost centers.</p>

<p>💬 <strong>A number of independent communities will turn into full-fledged businesses</strong> and media ‘empires’ as they grow beyond the community they started with.</p>

<p>🛠 <strong>Consolidation of tools.</strong> We’re currently in a golden age of community, engagement and event tools, but over the next decade we’ll see major players start to lead, acquire competitors, and ultimately ‘win’. We’ll also see existing companies (Salesforce, Slack, etc) invest more in community by acquiring companies that are being built right now.</p>

<p>🙊 <strong>Increased innovation will occur in the moderation space.</strong> As community gets elevated in organizations, companies will finally want to invest in tools to help make moderation easier and less dependent on pure manpower.</p>

<p>🏢 <strong>Companies will treat their internal teams more like communities</strong>, and there will be an expansion of internal community teams, especially at cos with 1,000+ employees. Remote-first companies will set this trend, needing to be more intentional about fostering internal community.</p>

<p>👋 <strong>Continued normalization of internet friends</strong>, people that you met in online communities rather than in-person. This has been normal for a decade or more in the gaming world, but it will bleed over to professional friends and relationships.</p>

<p>🏃‍♀️ <strong>In-person events will come back quickly post-Covid</strong>, but they will be smaller and more intimate, focusing on genuine connection. It will be a while before we see large 500+ person events and conferences again.</p>

<p>📆 <strong>Companies will continue to invest in online events</strong> and engagement as they realize how much larger of a reach they can achieve for lower cost and overhead. In-person conferences will adopt hybrid models, offering virtual access in addition to their physical locations.</p>

Converting from road to air mode (or vice versa) takes between five and ten minutes.</p><p>The Liberty runs on normal gasoline, and has a range of 1315 km (817 miles) on the road. In the air, it can fly 400 – 500 km (250 – 310 milles), and can remain airborne for 4.3 hours.</p><p>The PAL-V Liberty weighs 664 kg (1464 lbs) when empty. Its fuel tank holds 100 liters. The tank of a Honda Accord, just by way of comparison, holds about 53 liters.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><h2>Already 30 orders for this Dutch flying car</h2><p>According to the company, about thirty Dutch residents have already ordered and paid for the Liberty. The list price is just under €500,000 ($587,000).</p><p>At the moment, the granted permission is only for a single vehicle. That means PAL-V cannot yet put their car into full production.&nbsp;The Netherlands Vehicle Authority first needs to ensure that the company can produce every vehicle according to the same quality standards.</p><p>PAL-V has been working on the Liberty since 2007. The European Aviation Safety Agency is still examining the company’s request to have the vehicles certified to fly. The company expects this permission to arrive in 2022.</p><p>The US state of New Hampshire <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/auto/features/article/this-is-the-first-state-in-us-to-allow-flying-cars-on-public-roads/634621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made it legal to drive flying cars on public roads</a> in August of this year.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>See a video of the PAL-V Liberty driving <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/yIjSaEeO2l0" target="_blank">here</a>, and flying (briefly) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/fFW_0C7yFCI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1024x512.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-360x180.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1320x660.jpg 1320w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty.jpg 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="537" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1024x537.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-360x189.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1320x693.jpg 1320w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car.jpg 1408w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-1024x538.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-360x189.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>For a weekly summary of the latest psychology news, subscribe to our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/the-psych-news-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych News Weekly newsletter</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Global warming is quite possibly the greatest challenge we have ever faced.</p><p>A solution involves not only understanding most branches of science, but economics, politics and, more generally, human behaviour. </p><p>To date, even with our advanced technologies, planet earth's climate seems to remain beyond our control.</p><p><a href="https://st.im/six-page-narratives-tackling-worlds-biggest-challenges/">Last week I wrote</a> about the fact that I’ve started to spend a lot of time thinking about some of the biggest challenges we face as humanity. My goal being to narrow these challenges and dedicate the next decade of my life toward realising some of the potential solutions. </p><p>To help me kickstart, I’m publicly writing a series of Amazon-style <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/stim/Public+Obsidian/Six-pagers">six-page memos</a> that I will send to investors, philanthropists and potential co-founders with the ultimate goal of seeing if they’d like to partner, and tackle one of these challenges alongside me.</p><p>So how do I go about it? It won’t be easy, especially in fields where I have limited ‘applied’ or academic experience. I’m using these memos as a stepping stone toward real world experiments, hopefully validating some of my hypotheses.</p><p>Today, there’s an abundance of free information. What remains scarce is insight. Choose any non-trivial topic X, and a cursory Google search will give you evidence for both X and NOT (X). </p><p>So how do you find out what’s really true in the world of climate change? </p><p>That’s where <a href="https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/">thinking from first principles</a> comes in. The basic idea behind this is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up. I’ve found it to be one of the best ways to learn to think for myself, unlock creative potential, and move from linear to non-linear results.</p><p>Over the years there’s been so much fake news from vested interests, and well-meaning but conflicting reports about climate change. Couple this with the fact that attempting to solve it is hugely complex, with many interdependencies. Crafting a meaningful solution will mean not only exploring and understanding most branches of science, but economics, politics and, more generally, human behaviour. </p><p>By breaking each of these down to their basic elements it should help me understand them more thoroughly. Allowing me to build my own ground truths, and focus on the right stuff.</p><p>Why have I <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/stim/Public+Obsidian/Climate+Change">started</a> with climate change? </p><p>Simple: time, and the lack of it. </p><p>Scientists are telling us that on current trends by the middle of this century, vast swathes of the world will be experiencing uninhabitable temperatures for weeks on end. In essence, making them no-go zones. &nbsp;This means the next decade is make or break. </p><p>Thankfully, climate change is starting to gain some real attention. </p><p>People are increasingly paying attention to the fact that:</p><ol><li>We’re experiencing unprecedented lethal <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/heatwaves#tab=tab_1">heat waves</a>. It’s simply getting too hot and too humid for humans to be able to survive in many places.</li><li>Our largest physical structures; ice caps, coral reefs, and rainforests are disappearing before our eyes. Sea levels are rising, literally making the habitable world smaller.</li><li>There will be an <a href="https://www.climateforesight.eu/migrations-inequalities/environmental-migrants-up-to-1-billion-by-2050/">estimated 200 million - 1 billion</a> climate refugees in this century alone. This number of people on the move will be hugely destabilising.</li><li>When you factor in the cost of the environmental damage caused by our continued use of fossil fuels, &nbsp;it makes no economic sense to generate power in the way we have historically. The price of a solar panel, for example, has fallen 90 percent.</li></ol><p>The climate sector has also grown dramatically over the last few years. </p><p><a href="https://lowercarboncapital.com/">LowerCarbon Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.primeimpactfund.com/">Prime Impact</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.palebluedotventures.com/">PaleBlueDot</a> all launched. And several corporates have also announced their corporate venture funds tackling decarbonisation. Many more made net zero commitments.</p><p>Initiatives such as the <a href="https://earthshotprize.org/">Earthshot Prize</a> are attracting some of the world’s smartest thinkers. Chamath Palihapitiya also <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1284531841651752960?s=21">announced</a> the allocation of a “few billion” to solve the problem. He <a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/chamath-palihapitiya/">said recently</a> that he believes the world’s first trillionaire will be someone involved in developing technologies to combat climate change.</p><p>When it comes to philanthropy, there is no one better versed than Bill Gates in understanding how to prioritise dollar impact to maximise lives improved or saved. He’s <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/How-to-Avoid-a-Climate-Disaster">just announced</a> a new book ‘<em>How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need’</em>. </p><p>So the foundation of a meaningful climate change ecosystem is already here.</p><p>This enables the “crazy ones”, or “the ones who see things different” to innovate, to think outside of the box, and to find the support and freedom to dedicate themselves to discovering solutions. </p><p>There’s going to be quite a few footnotes in this post. A lot of people who are much smarter than me have spent a lot of time figuring stuff out. I’m hoping that I’ll be able to stand on the shoulders of these giants. With a set of fresh eyes, and the ignorance that only someone new to the space can have. </p><p>Let’s see if I can connect some dots, and pull together a plan. </p><p>In the remainder of this post, I’m going to cover the basics of climate change, as well as how I’m thinking of approaching it — with scenario planning and probabilistic forecasting. Finally we’ll look at the most promising areas of research in 2020. </p><p>If you're interested, I'd recommend bookmarking the <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/stim/Public+Obsidian/Climate+Change">climate change six-pager</a> —over the next couple of weeks I'll be working on it. With the goal of sending it as soon as possible. </p><h2 id="what-factors-determine-earth-s-climate">What factors determine Earth’s climate?</h2><p>The Royal Society has done a <a href="https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/climate-change-evidence-causes/basics-of-climate-change/">great job</a> of introducing the topic, and much of what is written below is learned from their resources.</p><p>The Sun is the primary energy source for Earth’s climate. </p><p>Some of this sunlight is reflected back into space, predominantly by bright surfaces (e.g. ice and clouds) the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. </p><p>Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat. The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy affects the climate. Small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will change this balance.</p><p>If all the heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth’s average surface temperature would be significantly colder than today. </p><p>Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions, keeping Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere warm. </p><p>Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.</p><p>Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth’s energy balance and thus its climate. We affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces; for example, by clearing forests for farming. The emission of pollutants also affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.</p><p>Scientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth’s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.</p><h2 id="human-activities-have-added-greenhouse-gases-to-the-atmosphere">Human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere</h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. </p><p>In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%.</p><p>More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role. </p><p>Scientists have examined greenhouse gases from the past — by examining air trapped inside ice in Antarctica, we now know that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century. This is after it had stayed in the range of 260 - 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many “ice age” cycles - and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This should already be setting off alarm bells. The change in the last 200 years compared to the past 800,000 years. And the impact from humans. Crazy. </p><p>Measurements of the forms of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of “old” carbon coming from the combustion of fossil fuels, as opposed to “newer” carbon coming from living systems. </p><p>Furthermore, it is known that human activities, excluding land use change, currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. </p><p><strong>These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities.</strong></p><h2 id="climate-records-show-a-warming-trend">Climate records show a warming trend</h2><p>Estimating global average surface air temperature increase requires careful analysis of millions of measurements from around the world, including from land stations, ships, and satellites. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Despite the difficulty in collating the data, quite a few independent teams concluded separately (and unanimously) that global average surface air temperature has risen by about 1 degree celsius since 1900. </p><p>Although the record shows several pauses and …</p></div></div>

        <p>The other day I had a bit of a crisis, I was worried that I was starting to have trouble with my memory. Something had to be wrong! I started to notice (increasingly!) my inability to recall trivial things; for example, the action points from a Zoom call, or a quote from a book that I had read a couple of months ago. Surely this can’t be normal?</p><p>Before calling the doctor’s office I did what any decent hypochondriac would do, and started googling. After clicking through a few pages, I began to feel a bit better. It was normal. Short term (or working) memory <em>is</em> inefficient, and unless I revisit the thing I’m trying to remember a few times, I’m most likely going to forget it. And no, it’s not a side effect of turning thirty. Phew.</p><p>It’s a “feature, not a bug” of how our memory systems are designed. </p><p>Our memory is made up of not one, nor two, but three components: 1) a sensory register, 2) working memory, and 3) long-term memory.</p><p>When I look back at my childhood or I remember some basic words from French, I'm drawing on portions of my brain involved in long-term memory. But when I'm trying to hold a few ideas in mind to connect them together so I can understand a concept or solve a problem, I'm using my working memory.</p><p>With my health crisis averted, I got thinking about technology and its impact (positive and negative) on the way the brain, and memory, function. With all the knowledge I could ever need at my fingertips, alongside note taking apps and the smartphones that are now an extension of our physical being -- am I being lazy or efficient, or a mixture of the two? Much like our overactive fight-or-flight response, has evolution not had a chance to adapt or catch-up with the mind of today versus our ancestors’? </p><h3 id="four-chunks-of-information">Four chunks of information</h3><p>We ‘can’t remember’ things because there is a limit to what we can hold in our working memory. Researchers used to think that it could hold around seven items or chunks, but now it’s widely believed that the working memory only holds about four chunks of information.</p><p>If you’re anything like me you’ll have to repeat something to yourself until you have a chance to write it down. Repetitions are needed so that natural dissipating processes don’t suck the memories away. How many times have you found yourself shutting your eyes to keep other things from intruding into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate?</p><p>I believe that we need to offload from our working memory as soon as possible.</p><p>With the goal historically being, before computers, to move it to long-term memory. If this didn’t happen -- you’d essentially be waving goodbye to that memory. </p><p>Moving a memory from ‘working’ to ‘long-term’ takes time and practice. </p><p>There’s a steep drop in what you remember, anyway. The ‘forgetting curve’, as it’s called, is steepest during the first twenty-four hours after you learn something. Exactly how much you forget, percentage-wise, varies, but unless you review the material, much of it slips down the drain. What you remember after day one has a good chance of still being retained after thirty. </p><h3 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced repetition</h3><p>To improve retention, spaced repetition is typically used. This technique involves repeating what you're trying to retain, ensuring to space the repetition out. Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique for example over a number of days.</p><p>The good news is, our long-term memory has room for billions of items. In fact there can be so many items they can bury each other. It can be difficult for you to find the information you need unless you practice and repeat at least a few times. This allows the synoptic connections in the brain to form and strengthen into a lasting structure.</p><p>Long-term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.</p><p>Having strong foundations in your long-term memory also makes the working memory more efficient, and able to connect dots from wider, more abstract, fields. It gives our thinking ‘richness’ and ‘associative access’. </p><p>Richness refers to the theory that a large number of things we have apparently forgotten all about are still there, somewhere, and add depth to our thinking. Associative access means that your thoughts can be accessed in a number of different ways by semantic or perceptual associations  — memories can be triggered by related words, by category names, by a smell, an old song or photograph, or even seemingly random neural firings that bring them up to consciousness.</p><h3 id="offloading-memory">Offloading memory</h3><p>But now, of course, we don’t bother to do all of the hard work of committing many things to our long-term memory. We have devices -- and the internet -- to remember stuff for us.</p><p>When I think back to when I started journaling on my iPad and laptop, as well as using apps like <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> that are focused on ‘<a href="https://st.im/ive-become-obsessed-with-networked-thought/">networked thought</a>’, it is interesting<strong> </strong>to hypothesise how they have potentially impacted the fundamental chemistry or feedback loops in my brain. </p><p>For me, they have helped reduce my cognitive load by letting me off-load much of what goes on in my brain to an external entity. In this day and age, this recall memory has become less necessary. Recognition memory is more important (i.e. the ability to judge that a currently present object, person, place, or event, has previously been encountered or experienced).</p><p>Research has shown that the internet functions as a sort of externalised memory. “When people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself,” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21764755">as one study puts it</a>. </p><p>If you know that you ‘know’ something, and you know how to retrieve it (thank you Google) that performs pretty much the same function as having a brain stuffed with lots of long-term memories. And the new ‘networked thought’ apps allow us to make interesting connections between these various bits of stored knowledge in much the same way that a well-stocked memory does.</p><h3 id="using-our-second-brain">Using our second brain </h3><p>So I wouldn’t say we are losing our ability to remember, as I posed at the start of this post. I think people (me included) just don’t do enough work to move stuff from our working memory into our long-term memory. </p><p>Our decreased reliance on recall memory and our &nbsp;ever-decreasing attention spans may not be the disaster that I first feared.</p><p>I think that the internet and apps focused on network thinking do assist us. They do act as a second brain. And I think that &nbsp;makes us more efficient.</p><hr><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sarandywestfall_photo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Sarandy Westfall</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/memory?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Thanks to <a href="https://jonathangifford.com/">Jonathan</a> for reading through early drafts of this post.<br>For discussion, check out this post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24917721">Hacker News</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a popular book called “JavaScript: The Good Parts.” And there’s a common meme around the relative size of that book versus “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide.”</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wIf3EJh.jpg"></p><p>Haskell is in my opinion a far more well designed and coherent language than JavaScript. However, it’s also an old language with some historical baggage. And in many ways it’s a bleeding edge research language that sometimes includes… half-baked features. And due to an inconsistent set of rules around backwards compatibility, it sometimes will break code every six months, and sometimes keep strange decisions around for decades.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>True mastery of Haskell comes down to knowing which things in core libraries should be avoided like the plague.</p><p>* foldl<br>* sum/product<br>* Data.Text.IO<br>* Control.Exception.bracket (use unliftio instead, handles interruptible correctly)</p><p>Just as some examples</p></div>— Michael Snoyman (@snoyberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/1321049221697544193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>After a request and some tongue-in-cheek comments in that thread, I decided a longer form blog post was in order. I’m going to start off by expanding on the four examples I gave in that tweet. But there are many, many more examples out there. If there’s more interest in seeing a continuation of this series, please let me know. And if you have pet peeves you’d like me to address, input will be very welcome.</p>
<h2>What is a “bad part”</h2>
<p>Very rarely is there such a thing as a language feature, function, type, or library that is so egregiously bad that it should never, ever be used. Null is of course the billion dollar mistake, but it’s still incredibly useful in some cases. So when I say that something is a “bad part” of Haskell, I mean something along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rarely-useful feature has been promoted to a position of prominence</li>
<li>A function has major downsides that are not documented</li>
<li>There’s an unexpected performance implication</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a large tendency in the Haskell community to be overly literal in responding to blog posts. Feel free to do that to your heart’s content. But this caveat serves as a word of warning: I’m not going to caveat each one of these with an explanation of “yes, but there’s this one corner case where it’s actually useful.”</p>
<h2>Why attack Haskell?</h2>
<p>Since I’m a Haskeller and advocate of the language, you may be wondering: why am I attacking Haskell? I don’t see this as an attack. I <em>do</em> wish we could fix these issues, and I think it’s a fair thing to say that the problems I’m listing are warts on the language. But every language has warts. I’m writing this because I’ve seen these kinds of things break real world projects. I’ve seen these failures manifest at runtime, defeating yet again the false claim that “if it compiles it works.” I’ve seen these become nefarious time bombs that disincentivize people from ever working with Haskell in the future.</p>
<p>I hope by calling these out publicly, I can help raise awareness of these problems. And then, either we can fix the problems at their source or, more likely, get more widespread awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>Also, because it feels appropriate, I’m going to take a more jovial tone below. I personally find it easier to beat up on a language I love like that.</p>
<h2>foldl</h2>
<p>Duncan Coutts <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2014/04/fixing-foldl/">already did this one</a>. <code>foldl</code> is broken. It’s a bad function. Left folds are supposed to be strict, not lazy. End of story. Goodbye. Too many space leaks have been caused by this function. We should gut it out entirely.</p>
<p>But wait! A lazy left fold makes perfect sense for a <code>Vector</code>! Yeah, no one ever meant that. And the problem isn’t the fact that this function exists. It’s the <strong>name</strong>. It has taken the hallowed spot of the One True Left Fold. I’m sorry, the One True Left Fold is strict.</p>
<p>Also, side note: we can’t raise linked lists to a position of supreme power within our ecosystem and then pretend like we actually care about vectors. We don’t, we just pay lip service to them. Until we fix the wart which is overuse of lists, <code>foldl</code> is only ever used on lists.</p>
<p>OK, back to this bad left fold. This is all made worse by the fact that the true left fold, <code>foldl'</code>, is not even exported by the <code>Prelude</code>. We Haskellers are a lazy bunch. And if you make me type in <code>import Data.List (foldl')</code>, I just won’t. I’d rather have a space leak than waste precious time typing in those characters.</p>
<p>Alright, so what should you do? Use an alternative prelude that doesn’t export a bad function, and does export a good function. If you really, really want a lazy left fold: add a comment, or use a function named <code>foldlButLazyIReallyMeanIt</code>. Otherwise I’m going to fix your code during my code review.</p>
<h2>sum/product</h2>
<p>The <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> functions are implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>. Well, actually <code>foldMap</code>, but list’s <code>foldMap</code> is implemented in terms of <code>foldr</code>, and lists are the only data structure that exist in Haskell. “Oh, but <code>foldr</code> is the good function, right?” Only if you’re folding a function which is lazy in its second argument. <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are both strict in both of their arguments.</p>
<p>If you’re not aware of that terminology: “strict in both arguments” means “in order to evaluate the result of this function/operator, I need to evaluate both of its arguments.” I can’t evaluate <code>x + y</code> without knowing what <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are. On the other hand, <code>:</code> (list cons) is lazy in its second argument. Evaluating <code>x : y</code> doesn’t require evaluating <code>y</code> (or, for that matter, <code>x</code>). (For more information, see <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/all-about-strictness/">all about strictness</a>.)</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say. “What if I have a custom data type with a custom typeclass instance of <code>Num</code> that has a custom <code>+</code> and/or <code>*</code> that is in fact lazy in the second argument! Then <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> are perfect as they are!”</p>
<p>That’s true. Now go off and write your own <code>lazySum</code> and <code>lazyProduct</code>. 99 times out of 100, or more likely 999,999 times out of 1,000,000, we want the fully strict version.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t matter, GHC will optimize this away.” Maybe. Maybe not. Stop relying on GHC’s optimizer to convert horribly inefficient code into not efficient code. (But I digress, we’ll talk about why the <code>vector</code> package is bad another time.)</p>
<h2>Data.Text.IO</h2>
<p>I’ve already covered this one once before when I told everyone to <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/12/beware-of-readfile">beware of <code>readFile</code></a>. In that blog post, I talk about a bunch of <code>String</code> based I/O functions, especially the titular <code>readFile</code>, which is obnoxiously exported by <code>Prelude</code>. Those are bad, and I’ll reiterate why in a second. But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is arguably far worse. The reason is that there’s pretty good awareness in the community that <code>String</code>-based I/O is bad. Even though the <code>String</code> part is the least of our worries, it does a good job of scaring away the uninitiated.</p>
<p>But <code>Data.Text.IO</code> is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. We’re all told by people who think they can tell people how to write their Haskell code (<em>cough</em> me <em>cough</em>) that we should exorcise <code>String</code> from our codebases and replace it in all cases with <code>Text</code>. Attacking the <code>Text</code> type is a topic for another time. But the problem is that by cloaking itself in the warm embrace of <code>Text</code>, this module claims more legitimacy than it deserves.</p>
<p>The only module worse in this regard is <code>Data.Text.Lazy.IO</code>, which should be buried even deeper.</p>
<p>OK, what exactly am I on about? Locale sensitive file decoding. It’s possible that this has been the number one example of a Haskell bug in the wild I’ve encountered in my entire career. Not the spooky memory leak. Partial functions like <code>head</code> randomly throwing exceptions are up there, but don’t quite rise to prominence.</p>
<p>You see, when you are dealing with file formats, there is typically an actual, defined format. YAML, XML, JSON, and many others give a lot of information about how to serialize data, including character data, into raw bytes. We want to be consistent. We want to write a file in one run of the program, and have it read in a separate run. We want to write the file on a Windows machine and read it on a Linux machine. Or we want to interact with programs in other languages that read or write data in a consistent format.</p>
<p>Locale sensitive file encoding and decoding laughs in our face. When you use <code>Data.Text.IO.readFile</code>, it plays a mind reading game of trying to deduce from clues you don’t care about which character encoding to use. These days, on the vast majority of systems used by native English speakers, this turns out to be UTF-8. So using <code>readFile</code> and <code>writeFile</code> typically “just works.” Using functions from <code>Data.Text.IO</code> looks safe, and can easily get hidden in a large PR or a library dependency.</p>
<p>That’s when all hell breaks loose. You ship this code. You run it in a Docker container. “Oops, you forgot to set the <code>LANG</code> env var, Imma crash.” But it’s worse than that. Typically things will work well for weeks or months, because it can often be a long time before someone tries to encode a non-ASCII character.</p>
<p>The same kind of thing happens regularly to Stack. Someone adds a new feature that writes and reads a file. The code passes all integration tests. And then someone in Russia with a weird Windows code page set and a Cyrillic character in their name files a bug report 2 years later about how they can’t build anything, and we sheepishly tell them to run <code>chcp 65001</code> or build in <code>c:\</code>.</p>
<p>Friends don’t let friends use <code>Data.Text.IO</code>.</p>
<p>“Oh, but <code>putStrLn</code> is fine!” Yeah, maybe. It’s also potentially slow. And it will throw a runtime exception due to character encoding mismatches. Just use a good logging library. That’s why we have one in <code>rio</code>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Since so many people have asked: instead of <code>readFile</code>, I recommend using <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-16.20/rio-0.1.19.0/RIO.html#v:readFileUtf8"><code>readFileUtf8</code></a>, which is available from <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio"><code>rio</code></a>.</p>
<h2>Control.Exception.bracket</h2>
<p>This is by far the least objectionable of the bad things in this list. I included it because the entire original tweet was inspired by a coworker telling me about a bug he ran into because of this function.</p>
<p>Async exceptions are subtle. Very, very subtle. Like, super duper subtle. I’ve devoted a large percentage to my Haskell teaching career towards them. Async exceptions are a concept that don’t truly exist in most other languages. They require rewiring the way your brain works for …</p></div></div>

<h2>Different from Chandrayaan 1</h2>



<p>SOFIA detected water on the Moon’s non-polar regions, and in areas of sunlight, making it different from ISRO Chandrayaan 1’s&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/how-nasa-and-chandrayaan-discovered-water-on-the-moon/">discovery of water ice</a>&nbsp;inside dark, cold craters on the lunar poles.</p>



<p>The water SOFIA found is locked in the lunar soil and rocks. Interestingly, NASA’s M3 instrument on Chandrayaan 1 had&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120929095219/http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/38_Klima_NLSI_2012.pdf">seen hints</a>&nbsp;of such trapped water in non-polar regions, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/clark1.html">as did Cassini</a>. But unlike SOFIA, those missions couldn’t tell if what they had detected was water or just hydroxyl groups (H2O vs OH).</p>



<p>Chandrayaan 1 dropped an impact probe on the Moon 12 years ago and did&nbsp;<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2010/2430.html">find water</a>, as in H2O. But it too is different from SOFIA’s findings because the probe detected water in the Moon’s thin atmosphere, not on the surface.</p>



<h2>Scientific not exploratory importance</h2>



<p>NASA PR spinned the announcement as the water being a promising source for future missions in creating sustainable habitats. But that’s not the case since this trapped water is in trace amounts, less than even the driest deserts on Earth. However, finding out where this water comes from or how it’s created has implications for understanding&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">the Moon’s origin</a>, which itself is tied to Earth’s.</p>



<p>The one area where the results have some exploratory relevance is understanding how water is transported on the Moon, so as to get a better handle on where on the Moon such resources are deposited. But the substantially more water ice present on the lunar poles continue to be the prime target for enabling sustainable human presence on the Moon.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="675" src="https://i0.wp.com/jatan.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3cc0f-water-ice-moon-map-m3.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Illustration showing water ice in eternally dark craters on the Moon’s south pole (left) and north pole (right) as discovered by ISRO’s Chandrayaan 1 spacecraft.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7218">Credit: NASA</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Alongside the SOFIA findings, NASA mentioned&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1198-9#_blank">another result</a>&nbsp;that does have exploratory significance. Researchers using data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have identified several craters smaller than a kilometer which are eternally dark polar and can thus host water ice. The sheer number of such small craters increases the expected amount of water ice on the Moon.</p>



<p>As per previous observations by the Chandrayaan 1 orbiter and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists estimated the Moon’s poles to host&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/Mini-RF/multimedia/feature_ice_like_deposits.html">more than 600 billion kg</a>&nbsp;of water ice, enough to fill at least 240,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. As the next logical step, Chandrayaan 2 orbiter is&nbsp;<a href="https://jatan.space/chandrayaan-2-is-creating-the-highest-resolution-map-of-the-moon/">quantifying the amount of water ice</a>&nbsp;on the lunar poles and mapping it as we speak, and its findings should include these smaller craters.</p>



<p>Once we have such data, these smaller, dark craters will likely be better targets for future missions as they’d be easier to explore and extract water from than large craters like Shackleton.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> (MCMC) is a powerful class of methods to sample from probability distributions known only up to an (unknown) normalization constant. But before we dive into MCMC, let’s consider why you might want to do sampling in the first place.</p>
<p>The answer to that is: whenever you’re either interested in the samples themselves (for example, inferring unknown parameters in Bayesian inference) or you need them to approximate expected values of functions w.r.t. to a probability distribution (for example, calculating thermodynamic quantities from the distribution of microstates in statistical physics).
Sometimes, only the mode of a probability distribution is of primary interest. In this case, it’s obtained by numerical optimization so full sampling is not necessary.</p>
<p>It turns out that sampling from any but the most basic probability distributions is a difficult task.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">Inverse transform sampling</a> is an elementary method to sample from probability distributions, but requires the cumulative distribution function, which in turn requires knowledge of the, generally unknown, normalization constant.
Now in principle, you could just obtain the normalization constant by numerical integration, but this quickly gets infeasible with an increasing number of dimensions.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling">Rejection sampling</a> does not require a normalized distribution, but efficiently implementing it requires a good deal of knowledge about the distribution of interest, and it suffers strongly from the curse of dimension, meaning that its efficiency decreases rapidly with an increasing number of variables.
That’s when you need a smart way to obtain representative samples from your distribution which doesn’t require knowledge of the normalization constant.</p>
<p>MCMC algorithms are a class of methods which do exactly that.
These methods date back to a <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b3d/c9438227f747e770a6fb6d7d7c01d98725d6.pdf">seminal paper by Metropolis et al.</a>, who developed the first MCMC algorithm, correspondingly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm">Metropolis algorithm</a>, to calculate the equation of state of a two-dimensional system of hard spheres. In reality, they were looking for a general method to calculate expected values occurring in statistical physics.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I introduce the basics of MCMC sampling; in subsequent posts I’ll cover several important, increasingly complex and powerful MCMC algorithms, which all address different difficulties one frequently faces when using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Along the way, you will gain a solid understanding of these challenges and how to address them.
Also, this serves as a reference for MCMC methods in the context of the <a href="https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-09-20-monad-bayes-1.html">monad-bayes</a> series.
Furthermore, I hope the provided notebooks will not only spark your interest in exploring the behavior of MCMC algorithms for various parameters/probability distributions, but also serve as a basis for implementing and understanding useful extensions of the basic versions of the algorithms I present.</p>
<h2>Markov chains</h2>
<p>Now that we know why we want to sample, let’s get to the heart of MCMC: Markov chains.
What is a Markov chain? Without all the technical details, a Markov chain is a random sequence of states in some state space in which the probability of picking a certain state next depends only on the current state in the chain and not on the previous history: it is memory-less.
Under certain conditions, a Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution of states to which it converges after a certain number of states. From that number on, states in the Markov chain are distributed according to the invariant distribution.</p>
<p>In order to sample from a distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, a MCMC algorithm constructs and simulates a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, meaning that, after an initial “burn-in” phase, the states of that Markov chain are distributed according to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
We thus just have to store the states to obtain samples from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>For didactic purposes, let’s for now consider both a discrete state space and discrete “time”.
The key quantity characterizing a Markov chain is the transition operator <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which gives you the probability of being in state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i+1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> given that the chain is in state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Now just for fun (and for illustration), let’s quickly whip up a Markov chain which has a unique stationary distribution.
We’ll start with some imports and settings for the plots:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>%</span>matplotlib notebook
<span>%</span>matplotlib inline
<span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np
<span>import</span> matplotlib<span>.</span>pyplot <span>as</span> plt
plt<span>.</span>rcParams<span>[</span><span>'figure.figsize'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
np<span>.</span>random<span>.</span>seed<span>(</span><span>42</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Markov chain will hop around on a discrete state space which is made up from three weather states:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>state_space <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>"sunny"</span><span>,</span> <span>"cloudy"</span><span>,</span> <span>"rainy"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a discrete state space, the transition operator is just a matrix.
Columns and rows correspond, in our case, to sunny, cloudy, and rainy weather.
We pick more or less sensible values for all transition probabilities:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>transition_matrix <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array<span>(</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>0.6</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                              <span>(</span><span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.4</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                              <span>(</span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rows indicate the states the chain might currently be in and the columns the states the chains might transition to.
If we take one “time” step of the Markov chain as one hour, then, if it’s sunny, there’s a 60% chance it stays sunny in the next hour, a 30% chance that in the next hour we will have cloudy weather, and only a 10% chance of rain immediately after it had been sunny before.
This also means that each row has to sum up to one.</p>
<p>Let’s run our Markov chain for a while:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>n_steps <span>=</span> <span>20000</span>
states <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span>n_steps<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    states<span>.</span>append<span>(</span>np<span>.</span>random<span>.</span>choice<span>(</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> p<span>=</span>transition_matrix<span>[</span>states<span>[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
states <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array<span>(</span>states<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can monitor the convergence of our Markov chain to its stationary distribution by calculating the empirical probability for each of the states as a function of chain length:</p>

<h2>The mother of all MCMC algorithms: Metropolis-Hastings</h2>
<p>So that’s lots of fun, but back to sampling an arbitrary probability distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It could either be discrete, in which case we would keep talking about a transition matrix <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, or be continuous, in which case <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> would be a transition <em>kernel</em>.
From now on, we’re considering continuous distributions, but all concepts presented here transfer to the discrete case.</p>
<p>If we could design the transition kernel in such a way that the next state is already drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we would be done, as our Markov chain would… well… immediately sample from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Unfortunately, to do this, we need to be able to sample from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which we can’t.
Otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this, right?</p>
<p>A way around this is to split the transition kernel <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into two parts:
a proposal step and an acceptance/rejection step.
The proposal step features a proposal distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, from which we can sample possible next states of the chain.
In addition to being able to sample from it, we can choose this distribution arbitrarily. But, one should strive to design it such that samples from it are both as little correlated with the current state as possible and have a good chance of being accepted in the acceptance step.
Said acceptance/rejection step is the second part of the transition kernel and corrects for the error introduced by proposal states drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo mathvariant="normal">≠</mo><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q \neq \pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It involves calculating an acceptance probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_\mathrm{acc}(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and accepting the proposal <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with that probability as the next state in the chain.

<p>All right, now that we know how Metropolis-Hastings works, let’s go ahead and implement it.
First, we set the log-probability of the distribution we want to sample from—without normalization constants, as we pretend we don’t know them. Let’s work for now with a standard normal distribution:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In this article, I want to explore an interesting pattern that I am seeing more and more in JavaScript code which allows you to return multiple values from a function.</p>
<p>You probably know already that JavaScript does not support multiple return values natively, so this article will actually explore some ways to “simulate” this behavior.</p>
<p>One of the most famous usages of this pattern I have seen recently is within <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html">React Hooks</a>, but before delving into that, let’s see what I mean with “multiple return values” by exploring this concept in other languages.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-return-values-in-other-languages"><a href="#multiple-return-values-in-other-languages" aria-label="multiple return values in other languages permalink"></a>Multiple return values in other languages</h2>
<p>Two languages that come to my mind which natively support multiple return values are Lua and Go. Let’s implement a simple <em>integer division</em> function that returns both the <em>quotient</em> and the <em>remainder</em>.</p>
<h3 id="lua"><a href="#lua" aria-label="lua permalink"></a>Lua</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a simple implementation in Lua. It’s definitely worth mentioning that <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/5.1.html">Lua’s official documentation</a> defines multiple return values as <em>“An unconventional, but quite convenient feature”</em>:</p>
<div data-language="lua"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>intDiv</span> <span>(</span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>local</span> quotient <span>=</span> math<span>.</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span>dividend <span>/</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>local</span> remainder <span>=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder
<span>end</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<h3 id="go"><a href="#go" aria-label="go permalink"></a>Go</h3>
<p>Here’s some equivalent code in Go:</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code><span>package</span> main

<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span>

<span>func</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  quotient <span>:=</span> dividend <span>/</span> divisor
  remainder <span>:=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see in these 2 code snippets, functions can return more than 1 value and this can be very convenient in cases where you logically have produce multiple outputs in a computation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: a more realistic implementation in Go, would take into account errors (e.g. division by 0) and add an extra return value to propagate potential errors. We shouldn’t worry too much about this for the sake of this article, but it is definitely worth mentioning that multiple return values in Go shine when it comes to error propagation and error handling. We will touch a bit more on this later in this article to see how this idea can be applied to JavaScript as well, especially in the context of Async/Await.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-multiple-return-values-in-javascript"><a href="#simulating-multiple-return-values-in-javascript" aria-label="simulating multiple return values in javascript permalink"></a>Simulating multiple return values in JavaScript</h2>
<p>So, as we said early on, JavaScript does not natively support a syntax to return more than one value from a function. We can workaround this limitation by using <em>composite values</em> like arrays or objects.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-return-values-with-arrays"><a href="#multiple-return-values-with-arrays" aria-label="multiple return values with arrays permalink"></a>Multiple return values with arrays</h3>
<p>Let’s implement our <code>intDiv</code> in JavaScript by using arrays as return types:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>intDiv</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span>dividend <span>/</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> <span>[</span>quotient<span>,</span> remainder<span>]</span>
<span>}</span>

console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Here we are just printing the result of a division, but let’s assume we want to handle the two return values individually, how do we <em>reference</em> those?</p>
<p>Well, the return value is an array so we can simply access the two elements in the array using the indices <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> result<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
<span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> result<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This syntax is arguably verbose and definitely not very elegant. Thankfully, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">ES2015 array destructuring assignment</a> can help us here:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>[</span>quotient<span>,</span> remainder<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This is much nicer to read and we also trimmed away 2 out 3 lines of code, big win!</p>
<p>As nice as it is, this implementation has an important shortcoming: return values are positional, so you need to be careful and respect the order while destructuring.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-return-values-with-objects"><a href="#multiple-return-values-with-objects" aria-label="multiple return values with objects permalink"></a>Multiple return values with objects</h3>
<p>An alternative implementation could use objects as return value, let’s see how:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>intDiv</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>dividend<span>,</span> divisor</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span>dividend <span>/</span> divisor<span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> dividend <span>%</span> divisor
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that here we are using another syntactic sugar from ES2015 (Enhanced object literal syntax) that allows us to define objects very concisely. Prior to ES2015, we would have defined the return statement as <code>{quotient: quotient, remainder: remainder}</code>.</p>
<p>With this approach we will be able to use our <code>intDiv</code> function as follows:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> quotient <span>=</span> result<span>.</span>quotient
<span>const</span> remainder <span>=</span> result<span>.</span>remainder
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Again, this is a bit too verbose and ES2015 has another fantastic syntactic sugar to make this nicer:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> quotient<span>,</span> remainder <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>quotient<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>remainder<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>This syntactic sugar is called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring">Object Destructuring Assignment</a>. With this approach we are now independent from the position of return values (we can swap the position of <code>quotient</code> and <code>remainder</code> without side effects). This syntax also lets you rename the destructured variables, which can very useful to avoid name collisions with other local variables, or just to make variable names shorter or more descriptive as we please. Let’s see how this works:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> remainder<span>:</span> r<span>,</span> quotient<span>:</span> q <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>intDiv</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Quotient = </span><span><span>${</span>q<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Remainder = </span><span><span>${</span>r<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Here we are not dependent by values position, but by their names in the returned object. If you are designing an API with multiple return values, it’s up to you to figure out which trade off will be the best to guarantee a proper developer experience.</p>
<p>Ok, now you should have a good idea on how to simulate multiple return values in JavaScript. In the next section we will see some more realistic examples that take advantage of this pattern.</p>
<h2 id="some-more-realistic-use-cases"><a href="#some-more-realistic-use-cases" aria-label="some more realistic use cases permalink"></a>Some more realistic use cases</h2>
<p>As mentioned early on, this technique has been recently popularized by React hooks, so we are gonna explore this use case first. Later we will see other two cases related to Async/Await.</p>
<h3 id="react-hooks"><a href="#react-hooks" aria-label="react hooks permalink"></a>React Hooks</h3>
<p>React hooks are a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html">new feature proposal</a> available from <em>React v16.7.0-alpha</em> that lets you use state and other React features without having to write a class.</p>
<p>The first and most famous React hook present is called <strong>State Hook</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works with an example, let’s build a CSS color viewer component.</p>
<p>Here’s how our component is going to look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://loige.co/content/4c8fe2a31135971902611822ca2f3df2/css-color-viewer-demo.gif" alt="CssColorViewer React component demo"></p>
<p>And here’s the code used to implement this:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> useState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span>

<span>function</span> <span>CssColorViewer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>cssColor<span>,</span> setCssColor<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>'Blue'</span><span>)</span>
  

  <span>const</span> <span>onCssColorChange</span> <span>=</span> <span>e</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setCssColor</span><span>(</span>e<span>.</span>target<span>.</span>value<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>input value<span>=</span><span>{</span>cssColor<span>}</span> onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onCssColorChange<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>div
        style<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span>
          width<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>
          height<span>:</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span>
          background<span>:</span> cssColor<span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>}</span>
      <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>div<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see this component in action and play with the code on <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/9lzyov54lr">CodeSandbox</a>.</p>
<p>For the sake of this article, we are going to focus only on the <code>useState</code> call, but if you are curious to understand better how the hook itself works internally I really recommend you read the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html">official State Hook documentation</a>. I was personally curious to understand how multiple <code>useState</code> calls could maintain the relationship with the specific state attribute (since there’s no explicit labelling or reference). If you are curious about that too, well you should read the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-does-react-associate-hook-calls-with-components">Hooks FAQ</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889">Dan Abramov’s recent article about Hooks</a>.</p>
<p>Back to the <code>useState</code> call in our example, now!</p>
<p>The <code>useState</code> hook acts like a factory: given a default value for the state property (<code>'Blue'</code> in our case), it will need to instantiate for you 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the current value for the specific state property (<code>cssColor</code> in our case)</li>
<li>a function that allows you to alter the specific property (<code>setCssColor</code> in our case)</li>
</ul>
<p>React developers decided to handle this requirement by simulating multiple return values with an array.</p>
<p>Combining this with array destructuring and proper variable naming, the result is an API that is very nice to read and to use.</p>
<p>This React feature is still very experimental and subject to change at the time of writing, but it already sounds like a big deal for the React community to make the code more expressive and reduce the barrier to entry to start adopting React.</p>
<p>The point I want to make is that, in this specific case, the multiple return values pattern plays a big role towards this goal.</p>
<h3 id="converting-callbacks-api-to-asyncawait"><a href="#converting-callbacks-api-to-asyncawait" aria-label="converting callbacks api to asyncawait permalink"></a>Converting callbacks API to Async/Await</h3>
<p>Recently I found another great use case for the multiple return values pattern while trying to convert a callback oriented API into an equivalent Async/Await API.</p>
<p>To make this part clear, I am going to explain very quickly an approach I use to convert callback based APIs into functions that I can use with Async/Await.</p>
<p>Let’s take this generic example:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>input<span>,</span> callback</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  
  
  <span>callback</span><span>(</span>error<span>,</span> response<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To convert this function into something that can be used with Async/Await we have to essentially <a href="https://loige.co/to-promise-or-to-callback-that-is-the-question/"><em>promisify</em></a> it. There are libraries to do it and, if you are using Node.js you can even use the builtin <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original"><code>util.promisify</code></a>, but that’s something we can do ourselves by just creating a <em>wrapper</em> function like the following one:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>doSomethingPromise</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>resolve<span>,</span> reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span>input<span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>error response</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>error<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>reject</span><span>(</span>error<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>resolve</span><span>(</span>response<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In short, our wrapper function <code>doSomethingPromise</code> is immediately returning a <code>Promise</code>. Inside the body of the promise we are invoking the original <code>doSomething</code> function with a callback that will be resolving or rejecting the promise based on whether there’s an <code>error</code> or not.</p>
<p>Now we can finally take advantage of Async/Await:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> response <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>doSomethingPromise</span><span>(</span>input<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this will throw in case of error, so make sure you have it in a <code>try/catch</code> block to handle the error correctly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are curious about <em>promisifying</em> callback-based functions, I have <a href="https://loige.co/to-promise-or-to-callback-that-is-the-question/">an entire article</a> dedicated to this topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my specific use case, I was using a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter">twitter client</a> library that follows this conventions:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
client<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'statuses/user_timeline'</span><span>,</span> params<span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>callback</span>…</code></pre></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>There’s a reason why change aversion in users is so often spoken about in the world of digital consumerism <span>— </span>human beings love their comfort zones. In the grand scheme of things, we seek out what is familiar to us for a sense of security.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Keeping your software product updated is important, but it’s also important to make sure the perfective changes you make are within the bounds of what your users are familiar and comfortable with.</p>
<p>Now, what kinds of changes might we be referring to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The types of changes that can be introduced in a software product are changes in infrastructure, functionality, and interface. Among them, interface changes incite the biggest reactions from users. That’s because it’s the most forefront part of a product that they see and interact with <span>— layout, tabs, fonts, colors, buttons, animation, etc</span>.</p>
<p><span>When introducing changes in this aspect of your product, both psychology and history say you should take it slow.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Psychology Tells Us&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>To discuss why sudden and major UI changes backfire from a psychological point of view, we have to address change aversion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been many cases where consumers refused to adapt to a new product, even if it was objectively “better”. One good example would be the introduction of the <a href="https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/"><span>Dvorak keyboard</span></a> in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Even&nbsp;though the Dvorak keyboard promoted objectively better physical ergonomics, people refused to move from the QWERTY keyboard <span>—</span> simply because they were used to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<h3><strong>Users Want to Feel Smart</strong></h3>
<p>It’s widely taught by UIUX experts like Rohan Puri and Robert Youmans, that users are aversive to change because “change makes them feel dumb”. When using your product, users want to feel in control, like they know what they’re doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially for neurodivergent users, big and sudden changes in UI can be disorienting. When you change things around all at once, you’re also making your users relearn what they’d previously mastered before <span>— and that takes time and energy. In other words, you’re giving them work to do.</span></p>
<p>If you’re an app or web developer, always remember that your users aren’t sitting next to you, watching you iterate and develop from scratch. Your interface may seem simple to you because you’ve familiarized with it as you worked on it, but that’s not the case for them.</p>
<h3><strong>Value is Invisible</strong></h3>
<p>Confirming many real-life cases, a study by Rosman et al on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262411663_On_user_behaviour_adaptation_under_interface_change"><span>user behaviour adaptation under interface change</span></a> found that it takes many tries for a user to feel comfortable enough with an interface that was initially unfamiliar to them, before they “conﬁdently choose it and realise the potential beneﬁts”.</p>
<p>Because the bulk of your revamp’s value is neither visible nor instantly detectable, more impatient users might poorly estimate the efﬁciency of your improved UI and “prematurely abandon it” in that particular time frame.</p>
<p>After all, if they don’t see an increase in value, why would they like that you changed what was already working for them?</p>
<h2><strong>What History Tells Us</strong></h2>
<p>Negative feedback from a large number of users can spread like wildfire on social media. Needless to say, that can be really detrimental to your brand and product.</p>
<p>If you’re a startup just starting out with a small user base, you have more leeway for major UI redesigns while you figure out your brand and voice. As your product grows, however, so does the need to prioritize your users’ preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some companies with really big user bases learned the hard way so we don’t have to.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What Happened with Digg</strong></h3>
<p>In 2010, Digg, a news aggregate site very much like reddit, launched a redesign that caused them to lose 35% of their users nearly instantly.</p>
<p>In the Digg v4 update, the site was heavily revamped visually and functionally. Among many of the sudden changes, the downvote button was removed, users could no longer save posts to favorites or posts videos,&nbsp; their Upcoming page was gone, and the overall focus was shifted from user-submitted content to publisher-submitted content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This major change didn’t just disorient their users. It took control away from them. With the new system, posts by publishers and sponsors flooded the front page, while posts by regular users were practically invisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of this? A mass exodus. Users either flooded the site with protest links (many of which were links to Reddit, their biggest competitor) or immediately migrated to Reddit.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What Happened with eBay</strong></h3>
<p>Once, eBay decided to change the background color of many of their site’s pages from bright yellow to white. Even though this change may seem like an obvious aesthetic choice today, it caused a ruckus on the internet (and in the team’s mailbox) when it first happened, forcing them to revert to yellow.</p>
<p>eBay didn’t give up on their vision, though. They came up with a strategy to go subtle, and designed an algorithm that faded the background from yellow to white, one shade at a time, over a few months. This time, the internet was still. The change was taking place so gradually that their users didn’t notice it was happening.</p>
<h2><strong>How Do You Safely Revamp?</strong></h2>
<p>Now that storytime is over, let’s talk about what we can learn from them. How can you revamp your product while being wary of change aversion?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, getting complaints from users doesn’t mean you should stop updating your app or website. <span>M</span>aintenance is necessary for your product to thrive and continue thriving.<span> The secret lies in </span><em><span>how</span></em><span> you execute it.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Change Little and Often</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of giving your users a whole new interface to relearn at one go, introduce a little change at a time. Habits take time to unlearn. Giving users one small redirection at a time is a lot less disorienting and burdensome for them.</p>
<h3><strong>Give Users a Heads-up&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Before you launch your redesign, give users time to prepare for it. This will dampen the impact of the launch and reduce the risk of shocking them into frustration with your product.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Spell Out the Values</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, values are invisible. Users don’t always immediately see the benefits of your new interface when they first try it. Instead of waiting for them to figure the maze out on their own, give them the lowdown on how the changes you’ve implemented are designed to solve the problems they face.</p>
<h3><strong>Provide Guidance</strong></h3>
<p>Part of spelling out the values of your redesign is by easing your users’ transition to your new interface. When you provide tutorials and demonstratives, you’re also teaching them how the new design improves their experience on your app or website.</p>
<h3><strong>Provide Options</strong></h3>
<p>It’s always good to give your users the option to switch back to the old interface. Provide them a toggle switch or button to revert to the old version, and place it somewhere easily accessible.</p>
<h3><strong>Welcome Feedback</strong></h3>
<p>Give your users an outlet or channel through which they can directly communicate with your team. Whether it’s a form on your website, or simply an email address they can write to specifically for complaints and feedback, it’s always good to let your users know that you’re listening.</p>

<p><strong>In this article I will introduce you to a new software stack that can be thought of as a spiritual successor to the MEAN or MERN stack. The technologies in the SJGAR stack were carefully combined to create something where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Focus on your customers, on business value and the developer experience. Do more, and keep things simple.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you want to find out why the mix of Serverless, JavaScript, GraphQL, AWS and React could be interesting to you please read on.</strong></p>

<p>I remember writing software in the period roughly between 2005 and 2015 where sometimes it could feel like every week something new was thrown at us. We were transitioning from desktop to the web and then cloud and mobile. We were just getting good at Object-oriented programming when a shift towards Functional Programming required us to rethink our mental models around our code. Cloud scale computing brought us from solely using SQL databases to study and use NoSQL databases. We went from embracing XML and SOAP to transitioning to JSON.</p>
<div><p><h3>Focus on your customers, on business value and the developer experience. Do more, and keep things simple.</h3></p></div>

<p>Looking at JavaScript alone there was also a lot of turmoil. The language started almost as a toy language to glue together simple elements on a web page. Then it slowly but steadily grew into becoming the most widely used programming language on the web. It even moved on beyond the browser and started to conquer the server with Node.js. A realm where Java and .NET were dominant before, now had to create some room for people starting to use JavaScript on the server.</p>
<p>On the web, framework after framework was becoming popular. Much to the point where they are still being refactored away ten years later. I remember moving from jQuery to Backbone or Knockout. I used Ember a bit and then also Angular. All of these seemed to offer some improvements over what was previously there. There were still enough rough edges however. It was clear we were not there yet.</p>

<p>In 2015, I got the chance to work on a corporate startup project that was completely greenfield. We set out to create a platform with web and mobile apps with state-of-the-art user experience, and we wanted to fail or succeed fast. This meant we had to ensure a short time to market. We had to focus on developer experience and productivity. After having tried some pieces of technology on smaller projects, this was the perfect chance to put them together and figure out if they would play nicely together. In theory, it should all work, but previous experience had shown that you really need to start using them for a decent amount of time to figure out if the new advantages will really outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<div><p><h3>It worked. It really worked.</h3></p></div>
<p>We built a web application using React and an accompanying mobile app using React Native. The backend was built using AWS Serverless technologies. We used DynamoDB as the single source of truth for data. The built-in event triggering system was used to run some Node.js code in a Lambda to stream this data to a managed Elasticsearch cluster, so we could support the search and query capabilities we needed. We created a GraphQL API using the reference server implementation graphql-js (Apollo Server and Client weren't a thing back then). Again this was run in Lambda. To make sure the web application was performant enough for our end users we used a Lambda to implement Server Side Rendering (Gatsby and Next.js also weren't a thing back then). We also used the Serverless framework, a bit shaky at that time, to write our infra as code.</p>
<p>With a handful of full stack engineers we were able to deliver this project successfully to production. We could deliver new versions of our microservices independently, and we would do this multiple times a day.</p>
<p>It worked. It really worked.</p>
<p>We started with almost zero costs for infrastructure. The most expensive service was the Elasticsearch service. The other services would easily service our first customers on the free tier. I think we never spent over 100 euros a month. Without Elasticsearch it would probably not have been higher than 10 euros a month. We launched and started running ad campaigns to lure customers to our new offering. For these ad campaigns we were spending over a thousand euros per month. It was clear that we now could go to the business and tell them we could do innovation projects with IT running costs of close to zero.</p>
<p>I remember we were able to move some logic from the web app to the authentication provider (we used Auth0 back then since Cognito was still a bit too new) by just copying some JavaScript code. Similarly, we were able to move code from frontend to backend. More generally we were able to take what we learned in a certain context, and apply it to a different one. JavaScript allowed us to learn a single programming language and write code for the Web, Mobile and Cloud. React allowed us to use a single framework to structure applications and do the state management for both Web and Mobile. Using Flexbox we could even apply the same UI layout system in these apps. With the complex and time-consuming nature of layout work, it was great that we were able to reuse our knowledge and tools to enjoy a great productivity boost.</p>
<p>Going Serverless meant we did not have to spend time on managing servers. The code and the system would just work. No disks filling up, no security patches to be applied, no certificates to be updated. AWS had given us a platform with great performance and stability. Everything would just run.</p>
<p>After running this project in 2015 and 2016, in the end it was shuttered because it did not align with our business goals. Only later I came to realize this set of technologies would stand the test of time, and would do so pretty well.</p>
<div id="okay-this-thing-needs-a-name"><h3><a href="#okay-this-thing-needs-a-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="okay this thing needs a name permalink"></a>Okay. This Thing Needs A Name.</h3></div>
<p>Fast-forward a bit to when I joined my current team and company early 2019. We formed a new innovation department and dreamed of a future where we helped turn our 175-year-old financial company into a fintech. Teaming up with the department that was our business counterpart, in the first year we built and delivered a total of fourteen projects with a relatively common two pizza team. In the previous nineteen years of my career I had never witnessed anything like this. We built smaller projects like landing pages, but also large ones like a new platform to sell houses using data and AI. We also built a fairly complex API to serve as the backend for an IoT driven car insurance. We even managed to surprise ourselves and win a hackathon in our first year with a mobile app for planting trees.</p>
<div><p><h3>Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</h3></p></div>
<p>Many things fell into place to make this a success. For one, it were the amazing people we joined. I consider myself lucky to this day that we met them and were able to make all of these things happen. It was almost as if we started in a performing phase as a team, skipping the forming, norming and storming phases altogether.</p>
<p>Besides the people the technology played an important role here. Five years after having first used this set of technologies it was clear that they still were around. Not only were they still around, they had become even stronger with a bigger community supporting them.</p>
<p>What was really cool was that we were able to deliver all these different types of applications using basically the same architecture. For the IoT insurance, the API we delivered we implemented a lightweight event sourced system using mainly DynamoDB and Lambda. We later added a future event system where we combined DynamoTTL and Step Functions to combine high and low resolution timers, all of which were inspired by a set of blog posts and a tweet we found on the web.</p>
<p>For the housing platform we combined Cognito, Azure AD, DynamoDB, Lambda, AppSync, S3 and CloudFront to deliver a platform that was highly performant. Gatsby helped us leverage React’s power to build statically rendered, SEO-friendly pages, hosted on S3 and made available to the wide internet using CloudFront and Route53. On the backend we created a GraphQL API to, on the one hand, power the build-time data requirements. On the other hand it also powered the real-time admin panel we needed for providing customers support.</p>
<p>There were many more projects that used very similar architectures. Five years after first having used these technologies we were still able to use them to build modern applications. In our hiring process I remember seeing the smiles on the faces of the engineers when we would mention our tech stack.</p>
<div><p><h3>Which parts are going to be successful for at least the next five years?</h3></p></div>
<p>There was this one thing I noticed though. Whenever I wanted to explain our technology stack, I was summing up this combination of technologies one by one. Time after time saying things like “Our stack is JavaScript based, uses the React ecosystem and runs on AWS Serverless... And oh yeah we use GraphQL as a BFF for our apps.” A couple of days later I would say something like “We build apps using React and use JavaScript/TypeScript. Our APIs are running on AWS Lambda using NodeJS.”. And then many more variations of these sentences.</p>
<p>Okay. This thing needs a name.</p>
<p>Back in the days we had the LAMP stack, and some time after that there was the MEAN stack. Acronyms that became part of our vocabulary to help explain the stack we were using, or even inspired greenfield projects to combine these technologies. People would think, hey, I recently have been hearing a lot of buzz around the MEAN …</p></div></div></div>

      <p>Oct 27, 2020</p>

      <p>
	In my <a href="https://zinascii.com/2020/the-amd64-fbt-handler.html">previous
	post</a> I described how FBT intercepts function calls and
	vectors them into the DTrace framework. That laid the
	foundation for what I want to dicuss in this post: the
	implementation of the <code>stack()</code> action and
	built-in <code>arg</code> variables. These features rely on
	the precise layout of the stack, the details of which I
	touched on previously. In this post I hope to illuminate those
	details a bit more with the help of some visuals, and then
	guide you through the implentation of these two DTrace
	features as they relate to the FBT provider.
      </p>

      <h2>A Correction</h2>

      <p>
	But first I must make a correction to my last post. It turns
	out the FBT handler <b>does not</b> execute on the IST stack.
	It runs on either the thread’s stack or the CPU’s high-level
	interrupt stack depending on the context of the kernel
	function call, but never on the IST.
	Rather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation">KPTI</a>
	uses the IST stack as a scratch space to perform its
	trampoline into the real handler. This little detail is
	important. Functions like <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code>
	have zero chance of working if run with the IST stack, for
	reasons which become obvious later. This also explains why the
	AMD64 handler pulls down the stack
	during <code>pushq&nbsp;%RBP</code> emulation: if it’s working
	on the same stack as the thread/interrupt, then it must make
	room for <code>RBP</code>. I can explain better with a visual.
	First, the diagram from the last post.
      </p>

      <figure>
	  
	  <figcaption><a name="fig1-int3-pre-handler">Figure 1. INT3 thread/interrupt state pre-handler</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	On the left we have a kernel thread, interrupt thread, or
	high-level interrupt running on CPU. On the right we have the
	“interrupt context” of the breakpoint exception, using the
	IST. The image is correct in that there are two different
	stacks in play, but what’s running on the right-hand side is
	not the <code>brktrap</code> handler. The right-hand side is
	running the KPTI trampoline, ensuring a CR3 switch when moving
	between the user/kernel boundary. The trampoline also provides
	a facsimile of the processor frame to the interrupted thread’s
	stack, making it none the wiser that KPTI was ever on the
	scene. So all the action happens on the left side, but what
	does the stack look like as we transition through the #BP
	handler on our way to <code>dtrace_invop()</code>?
      </p>

      <figure>
	  
	  <figcaption><a name="fig2-pre-fbt-stack">Figure 2. stack state from #BP to pre dtrace_invop()</a></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	In phase ① <code>mac_provider_tx()</code> is
	calling <code>mac_ring_tx()</code> while it is under FBT entry
	instrumentation. The last thing on the thread’s stack is the
	return address, and the CPU is about to execute
	the <code>int3</code> instruction.
      </p>

      <p>
	Phase ② is immediately after the CPU has finished execution of
	the <code>int3</code> instruction. The processor (via the
	spectre of the KPTI trampoline) has pushed a 16-byte aligned
	processor frame on the stack and has vectored into
	the <code>brktrap()</code> handler.
      </p>

      <p>
	Phase ③ is after some amount of execution of
	the <code>brktrp()</code> and <code>invoptrap()</code>
	handlers—remember, the #BP handler for DTrace mimics a #UD.
	This last phase shows the state just before the call
	to <code>dtrace_invop()</code>. At this point we’ve grown an
	entire <code>regs</code> structure on the stack and stashed a
	copy of the return address on top of this. The later used to
	populate <code>cpu_dtrace_caller</code>, a variable which
	becomes important later.
      </p>

      <h2>The stack() Action</h2>

      <p>
	The separation of probes and actions is a vital aspect of
	DTrace’s architecture. A firm boundary between these two makes
	DTrace more powerful than it ever could be if they were
	tightly coupled. Think about it, I can ask for the call stack
	in any probe, not just the probes that deem that information
	useful. The probes give you access to a context, and the
	actions give you access to data in that context. To limit the
	execution of actions to specific probes would limit the
	questions you can ask about the system. With this design the
	number of questions you can ask is virtually endless. And it
	turns out one of the more useful questions to ask is: “what
	the hell is running on my CPU”?
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>stack()</code> action allows you to record the call
	stack that lead to the probe site. In the context of FBT this
	will record the call stack of the kernel thread or interrupt
	executing an entry or return from this kernel function. You
	can also access the userland stack of a thread
	via <code>ustack()</code>, but I don’t cover that here.
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>stack()</code> action is implemented by
	the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code> function. To get there
	from <code>dtrace_invop()</code> requires a couple of more
	calls in the DTrace framework. Ultimately, the call stack to
	get there looks like this.
      </p>

	</div>
	<figcaption>call stack between dtrace_getpcstack() and dtrace_invop()</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
	The implementation of <code>stack()</code> really starts
	with <code>DTRACEACT_STACK</code> inside
	of <code>dtrace_probe()</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
	The first argument is the address of the array used to store
	program counter values (aka function pointers). This array
	starts at some offset into the current DTrace buffer. The
	second argument if the size of that array. The third argument
	is the number of “artificial frames” on the stack, more on
	this later. The fourth argument is used to determine if the
	first (topmost) program counter in the call stack is the value
	passed in <code>arg0</code> to <code>dtrace_probe()</code>. An
	“anchored” probe is one that has a function name specified
	when calling <code>dtrace_probe_create()</code>. For example,
	the FBT provider uses the name of the kernel function as the
	probe’s function name, thus it is anchored on the kernel
	function. The profile provider, however, specifies no probe
	function name; it is not anchored and is a bit of a special
	case. I address this at the end of the post.
      </p>

      <p>
	This brings us to the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code>
	function. But first I’ll expand
	on <a href="#fig2-pre-fbt-stack">figure 2</a> to show our
	stack state as of source line 60 of the function.

      <p>
	To build the call stack we first need to be able to walk the
	stack. Luckily, illumos keeps frame pointers in the kernel,
	making this easy. But in this particular situation there is
	more to consider. First, we might have two stacks in play: the
	high-level interrupt’s stack as well as the stack of the
	thread it interrupted. Second, the DTrace framework and FBT
	provider have put their own frames between this code and the
	function that tripped this probe; we must exclude these
	“artificial” frames from the result. Finally, we need to make
	sure not to walk off the stack and into space, both for
	correctness and safety. Speaking of the stack,
	the <code>stacktop</code> variable is pointing to the “top” of
	the stack in terms of memory (on x86 stacks grow downwards).
	Logically speaking, <code>stacktop</code> is the bottom of the
	stack and the <code>dtrace_getpcstack()</code> frame is the
	top.

      <p>
	Make sure to skip over any artificial frames.
	The <code>aframes</code> value is based on information given
	by the provider at probe creation time
	(<code>dtrace_probe_create()</code>/<code>dtpr_aframes</code>)
	as well as knowledge inherent to the DTrace framework. These
	two know how many frames they have each injected between
	the <code>stack()</code> action and the first real frame; we
	sum the values to know how many total frames to skip.
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>caller</code> variable is a bit more subtle; and

<![CDATA[GitHub should stand up to the RIAA over YouTube-dl]]>

October 27, 2020 | https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://funnelfiasco.com/blog/2020/10/25/youtube-dl-github-riaa/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/riaa-blitz-takes-down-18-github-projects-used-for-downloading-youtube-videos/">GitHub took down the repository</a> for the youtube-dl project. This came in response to a request from the RIAA—the recording industry’s lobbying and harassment body. youtube-dl is a tool for downloading videos. The RIAA argued that this violates the anticircumvention protections of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While GitHub taking down the repository and its forks is true to the principle of minimizing corporate risk, it’s the wrong choice.</p>



<p> Microsoft—currently the world’s second-most valuable company with a market capitalization of $1.64 trillion—owns GitHub. If anyone is in a position to fight back on this, it’s Microsoft. Microsoft’s lawyers should have a one word answer to the RIAA’s request: “no”. <em>(full disclosure: I own a small number of shares of Microsoft)</em></p>



<h2>The procedural argument</h2>



<p>The first reason to tell the RIAA where to stick it is procedural. The RIAA isn’t arguing that youtube-dl is infringing its copyrights or circumventing its protections. It is arguing that youtube-dl infringes YouTube’s protections. So even if it is, that’s YouTube’s problem, not the RIAA’s.</p>



<h2>The factual argument</h2>



<p>I have some sympathy for the anticircumvention argument. I’m not familiar with the specifics of how youtube-dl works, but it’s at least possible that youtube-dl circumvents YouTube’s copy protection. This would be a reasonable basis for YouTube to take action. Again, YouTube, not the RIAA.</p>



<p>I have less sympathy for the infringement argument. youtube-dl doesn’t induce infringement more than a web browser or screen recorder does. There are a variety of uses for youtube-dl that are not infringing. Foremost is the fact that some YouTube videos are under a license that explicitly allows sharing and remixing. Archivers use it to archive content. Some people who have time-variable Internet billing use it to download videos overnight.</p>



<p>So, yes, youtube-dl can be used to infringe the RIAA’s copyrights. It can also be used for non-infringing purposes. The code itself does not infringe. There’s nothing about it that gives the RIAA a justification to take it down.</p>



<h2>youtube-dl isn’t the whole story</h2>



<p>youtube-dl provides a focal point, but there’s more to it. Copyright law is now used to suppress instead of promote creative works. The DMCA, in particular, favors the large rightsholders over smaller developers and creators. It essentially forces sites to act on a “guilty until proven innocent” model. Companies in a position to push back have an obligation to do so. Microsoft has become a supporter of open source, now it’s time to show they mean it.</p>



<p>We should also consider the risks of consolidation. git is a decentralized system. GitHub has essentially centralized it. Sure, many competitors exist, but GitHub has become the default place to host open source code projects. The fact that GitHub’s code is proprietary is immaterial to this point. A FOSS service would pose the same risk if it became the centralized service.</p>



<p>I saw a quote on this discussion (which I can’t find now) that said “code is free, infrastructure is not.” And while projects self-hosting their code repository, issue tracker, etc may be philosophically appealing, that’s not realistic. Software-as-a-Service has lowered the barrier for starting projects, which is a good thing. But it doesn’t come without risk, which we are now seeing.</p>



<p>I don’t know what the right answer is for this. I know the answer won’t be easy. But both this specific case and the general issues they highlight are important for us to think about.</p>

				<h3 id="pants-2-0-0-the-first-stable-release-of-the-pants-v2-open-source-build-system-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0, the first stable release of the Pants v2 open-source build system, is out now!</h3><p>There are so many tools in the Python development ecosystem. You might use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> to resolve dependencies, <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> to run tests, <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> and <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for lint checks, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> and <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a> for auto-formatting, <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> for type checking, <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for interactive sessions, <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a>, <a href="https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pex</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for packaging, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> for code generation, and many more. Not to mention any custom tooling you've built for your repo. </p><p>Installing, configuring and orchestrating the invocation of these tools<strong>—</strong>all while not re-executing work unnecessarily<strong>—</strong>is a hard problem, especially as your codebase grows. The lack of a robust, scalable build system for Python has been a problem for a long time, and this has become even more acute in recent years, with Python codebases increasing in size and complexity. </p><p>Fortunately, there is now a tailor-made (pun intended) solution: <strong>Pants v2</strong>!</p><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is designed from the ground-up for fast, consistent builds. Some noteworthy features include:</p><ul><li>Minimal metadata and boilerplate</li><li>Fine-grained workflow</li><li>Shared result caching</li><li>Concurrent execution</li><li>A responsive, scalable UI</li><li>Unified interface for multiple tools and languages</li><li>Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/render1603750306032.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Pants running multiple linters in parallel</figcaption></figure><p>Read on to learn more about Pants v2, and what it means for your Python codebase.</p><hr><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2><p>We started the original open-source Pants project back in 2011. At the time, we were frustrated by slow, flaky Scala builds. The leading strategy for scaling was to hand each developer a RAM stick and a screwdriver... Surely this was a problem we could tackle with software! Thus Pants v1 was born. </p><p>Pants v1 was quite successful, and was adopted at cutting-edge tech companies such as Twitter, Foursquare, Square and others. But we still weren't satisfied: The APIs were clunkier than we would have liked, the UI was overly chatty, caching was hard to get right, and concurrent execution had to be special-cased. We knew there were plenty of performance and stability improvements to be had, if we could only unlock them. </p><p>We learned a lot from our years of work on Pants v1, and knew that we could design something new and better, leaning on our experience with v1 while addressing the drawbacks of that system. Luckily, at the same time as we began thinking about this hypothetical next system, a new motivating problem emerged: Python builds.</p><h2 id="python-builds-today">Python builds today</h2><p>As you probably know, Python has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Not only is it used to build a wide variety of server applications, via frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, but it's also the language of choice for data scientists, thanks to powerful libraries and tools such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. </p><p>Python hits a sweet spot of simplicity and power, but there is a big problem - there is no truly great scalable build tool for Python, and this is becoming a real pain point as Python repos grow like never before. &nbsp;</p><p>Python builds today involve manually invoking a wide variety of tools. Each tool has to be installed, configured and invoked in just the right way, often while sequencing the output of one tool into input of another. Knowing how to use each tool in a given scenario is complicated and burdensome. </p><p>Sure, you can hack around the problem for a while with some combination of shell scripts, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">Makefiles</a>, <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a>, and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. But even a small code change might require you to run a huge amount of sequential build work. Re-executing the same processes with the same inputs over and over again is a frustrating waste of time and resources. &nbsp;And these solutions start to break down as your codebase grows.</p><p>Perhaps you experimented with more complex build systems, such as <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or <a href="https://v1.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v1</a>. &nbsp;But it's laborious to maintain all that BUILD metadata, all for a sub-par experience not optimized for Python. Not to mention the difficulty of implementing your own custom build logic. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe you've been tempted to split up your codebase into multiple interdependent repos, each with their own "smaller" builds. But that creates an even thornier problem, namely how to manage those interdependencies. Having to propagate changes across codebase boundaries can slow development down to a crawl, and leave you with the worst of both worlds - slower processes and a fragmented, unmanageable codebase.</p><p>A great build system for repos - of all sizes - that include Python code would support fine-grained invalidation and caching, so that it only executes the build work actually affected by a change. It would support concurrent local and even remote execution, to greatly speed up work by using all available CPU. It would be easy to adopt in a small repo, but would scale up as your codebase grows. It wouldn't require huge amounts of boilerplate metadata, and it would be easy to extend with custom build logic. </p><p>Well, Pants v2 is that system! </p><h2 id="introducing-pants-v2">Introducing Pants v2</h2><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is a completely new open-source build system, inspired by our work on Pants v1. &nbsp;We've been developing and testing it for the last couple of years, and it's finally ready for prime time!</p><p>A key factor in the design of Pants v2 was a set of lessons we learned from Pants v1 and other existing systems, such as Bazel. Among them: that ease of use and performance matter, boilerplate is annoying, concurrency and caching require hard design work, and most people will need custom logic at some point.</p><h3 id="lesson-1-ease-of-use-and-performance-both-matter">Lesson #1: Ease of use and performance both matter</h3><p>When designing software you often find yourself making tradeoffs between ease of use and performance. But in a build system, both are vital. The Pants v2 execution engine - which is the performance-critical heart of the system - is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, for raw speed. And the domain-specific build logic is written in familiar, easy to work with, type-annotated Python 3. This helps make Pants v2 easy to extend, without compromising performance. </p><p>Pants v2 also runs a daemon that memoizes fine-grained build state in memory, for even faster performance. This daemon watches for changes to your source files and precisely invalidates its state on the fly to ensure that the minimum amount of work happens the next time you build.</p><h3 id="lesson-2-writing-build-metadata-is-a-real-drag">Lesson #2: Writing build metadata is a real drag</h3><p>Some build tools are slow because they don't have enough information about the structure of your code to intelligently perform incremental work. Others have gone too far in the other direction, requiring a huge amount of metadata and boilerplate in BUILD files, especially relating to your code's dependencies. </p><p>Pants v2 offers the best of both worlds - intelligent, fine-grained incremental work, without the boilerplate. It does so by assuming sensible, magic-free defaults, inferring dependencies from the import statements in your code, and supporting plugins for custom inference logic. Stay tuned for an upcoming post on exactly how Pants achieves this!</p><h3 id="lesson-3-design-for-caching-concurrency-and-remoting">Lesson #3: Design for caching, concurrency and remoting </h3><p>Writing build logic that can be cached and executed concurrently and remotely is very hard. You have to be very careful about not producing or consuming side-effects, and it's extremely difficult to tack that on later. And unless you design your APIs with care, supporting these kinds of features often places severe restrictions on what your build logic may safely do. </p><p>In Pants v2, build logic is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a> Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">async coroutines</a>. So a build rule can depend not only on its inputs, but can also await on new data at runtime - all of which is precisely tracked for invalidation and caching. This gives us the best of both worlds: logic that is properly isolated from side-effects, and is therefore amenable to caching, concurrent execution and remoting, while still allowing the use of natural control flow.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/caching.gif" alt=""><figcaption>We run both tests, then add a syntax error to one test and rerun; the unmodified test uses the cache and is isolated from the syntax error.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="lesson-4-almost-everyone-needs-to-customize-their-builds">Lesson #4: Almost everyone needs to customize their builds</h3><p>Most teams have custom build steps, so extensibility is a key feature in any build system. Pants v2 is built around a <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview">plugin architecture</a>. You can write your own rules using the same API as the built-in functionality. So your custom build logic will enjoy the same fine-grained invalidation, caching, concurrency and remote execution abilities as the core Pants code.</p><h2 id="pants-2-0-0-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0 is out now!</h2><p>All this leads me to the happy announcement that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pantsbuild.pants/2.0.0/">Pants 2.0.0</a>, the first stable release of Pants v2, is out now! 2.0.0 is the culmination of years of design and development work, and many months of beta testing at several organizations. So we're really happy, proud (and relieved…) to finally have it ready for general use. </p><p>You can see what Python tools Pants currently supports <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python">here</a>. There are also commands for querying and understanding your dependency graph, and a robust help system. &nbsp;We're adding support for additional tools and features all the time, and it's straightforward to implement your own. Beta users have already written their own logic for Cython and docker, for example. </p><p>Now is a great time to adopt Pants 2.0.0! The team that developed Pants v2 is <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">ready to help you</a> onboard, answer any questions, and even pair with you to help you write any custom build logic. We're also eager to get feedback, bug reports and suggestions for what features we should focus on in the next weeks and months of development.</p><p>Pants v2 is developed by a helpful open source community, is funded by a 501(c)6 non-profit, and has excellent support available. If you have a growing Python codebase, and want to take Pants 2.0.0 for a spin, <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">let us know</a>. We'd love to fit you with some new Pants today!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>A frequently recurring staple of Hacker News is the <em>personal computing rant</em>: modern computers are black boxes, far too locked down.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> We long for our desktop computers, the early-2000s computing paradigm, and we want to take back control of our data.</p> <p>I sympathize greatly with this view. For the past five years, I have exclusively run Arch Linux. I love the early-2000s style of personal computing: text-heavy interfaces, words rather than icons, uniform keyboard shortcuts everywhere. I do nearly all my computing in emacs. It is feature rich, and no product manager is ever going to change the experience, interface, or shortcuts. My workspace allows me to be <em>fast</em>. Contrary to much modern software, emacs responds instantaneously to my keystrokes. Every action has an immediate effect, clear on the page, with no background process ambiguity. This is enormously satisfying. I would characterize this computing environment as a spiritual descendant of the typewriter: on its own, it is a dumb machine, but when you command it, it becomes a powerful extension of you. The user experience is given by speed, smoothness, reliability, and nothing else.</p> <p>On the other hand, you’ve got iPhones and iPads. These are not machines that you command – on the contrary, you might argue that all their notifications command you. With touch interfaces, facial recognition, and voice control, these are machines that are meant to merge with you. Instead of becoming an <em>extension</em> of you, it becomes <em>part</em> of you. Instead of you commanding it, it is meant to anticipate your commands. Where is the data? How does it work? Who knows. They’re total black boxes, effectively indistinguishable from magic, whereas your Linux Desktop is a DIYable simple machine.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p> <p>Many contemporary writers think of personal computing as one paradigm that is gradually evolving. I disagree: I think there are two, deeply different paradigms of personal computing, reflecting deeply different desires.</p> <ul> <li>Machine as extension of the self (your Windows XP Desktop).</li> <li>Machine as part of the self (your iPhone).</li> </ul> <p>Plenty of devices exist in the space in-between. Android phones try to give you some control back over your device, by which they necessarily preclude themselves from truly being <em>part</em> of you. Modern versions of OS X, with the touchbar, Siri, and integrations into all your other Apple devices, are starting to make the leap from extending the self to being part of the self.</p> <p>As a genre, the personal computing rant comes out of the correct view that these are all forms of personal computing, but it fails to recognize that within this broad umbrella, we’ve seen paradigms arise that differ in both intent and the human desire they’re meant to meet. It’s not that one class of devices is replacing the other. They are fundamentally different, and one paradigm succeeds where the other falls short of meeting the consumers’ needs. The terminal never met the needs of those who want Amazon Alexa, and vice-versa.</p> <p>I live in the in-between. I happily imagine a world where my Apple Watch monitors my glucose and blood oxygen, my Eight Sleep quantifies my rest, I mark up documents on giant touchscreens, but I sit on a clacky IBM keyboard to write code and blog posts in a terminal that hasn’t changed in twenty years. While your iPhone might meld with your mind by quantifying and anticipating your every need, my terminal melds with my mind by being fast, constant, and <em>always</em> correct. Each has its place, and I would never trade one for the other.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

  <p>
    Recent work by Dabney et al. suggests that the brain represents reward predictions as probability distributions
    <d-footnote>
      Experiments were conducted on mice using single-unit recordings from the ventral tegmental area.
    </d-footnote><d-cite key="dabney2020distribtionmice"></d-cite>.
    This contrasts against the widely adopted approach in reinforcement learning (RL) of modelling single scalar
    quantities (expected values).
    In fact, by using distributions we are able to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making process.
    Uncertainty is especially important in domains where making a mistake can result in the inability to recover
    <d-footnote>
      Examples of such domains include autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and the financial markets.
    </d-footnote>. Research in risk-aware reinforcement learning has emerged to address such problems
    <d-cite key="morimura2010risksensitive,chow2018riskconstrainedrl"></d-cite>.
    However, another important application of uncertainty, which we focus on in this article, is efficient exploration
    of the state-action space.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The purpose of this article is to clearly explain Q-Learning from the perspective of a Bayesian.
    As such, we use a small grid world and a simple extension of tabular Q-Learning to illustrate the fundamentals.
    Specifically, we show how to extend the deterministic Q-Learning algorithm to model
    the variance of Q-values with Bayes' rule. We focus on a sub-class of problems where it is reasonable to assume that Q-values
    are normally distributed
    and derive insights when this assumption holds true. Lastly, we demonstrate that applying Bayes' rule to update
    Q-values comes with a challenge: it is vulnerable to early exploitation of suboptimal policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    This article is largely based on the seminal work from Dearden et al. <d-cite key="dearden1998bayesianqlearning"></d-cite>.
    Specifically, we expand on the assumption that Q-values are normally distributed and evaluate various Bayesian exploration
    policies. One key distinction is that we model $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, while the
    authors of the original Bayesian Q-Learning paper model a distribution over these parameters. This allows them to quantify
    uncertainty in their parameters as well as the expected return - we only focus on the latter.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty</h4></div>
  <div><p>
    Since Dearden et al. model a distribution over the parameters, they can sample from this distribution and the resulting
    dispersion in Q-values is known as <b>epistemic</b> uncertainty. Essentially, this uncertainty is representative of the
    "knowledge gap" that results from limited data (i.e. limited observations). If we close this gap, then we are left with
    irreducible uncertainty (i.e. inherent randomness in the environment), which is known as <b>aleatoric</b> uncertainty
    </p><d-cite key="kiureghian2007aleatoric"></d-cite><p>.

    </p><p>
    One can argue that the line between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty is rather blurry. The information that
    you feed into your model will determine how much uncertainty can be reduced. The more information you incorporate about
    the underlying mechanics of how the environment operates (i.e. more features), the less aleatoric uncertainty there will be.

    </p><p>

    It is important to note that inductive bias also plays an important role in determining what is categorized as
    epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty for your model.
    </p><p>

    <b>Important Note about Our Simplified Approach:</b></p><p>

    Since we only use $$\sigma^2$$ to represent uncertainty, our approach does not distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

    Given enough interactions, the agent will close the knowledge gap and $$\sigma^2$$ will only represent aleatoric uncertainty. However, the agent still
    uses this uncertainty to explore.

    This is problematic because the whole point of exploration is to gain
    knowledge, which indicates that we should only explore using epistemic uncertainty.
    </p></div>


  

  <p>
    Since we are modelling $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, we begin by evaluating the conditions under which it is appropriate
    to assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  <a href="#section-1" id="section-1"></a>
  <h2>When Are Q-Values Normally Distributed?</h2>

  <p>
    The readers who are familiar with Q-Learning can skip over the collapsible box below.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Temporal Difference Learning</h4></div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Temporal Difference (TD) learning is the dominant paradigm used to learn value functions in reinforcement learning
      <d-cite key="sutton1988tempdiff"></d-cite>.
      Below we will quickly summarize a TD learning algorithm for Q-values,
      which is called Q-Learning. First, we will write Q-values as follows <d-cite key="Sutton2017ReinforcementIntroduction"></d-cite>:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \overbrace{Q_\pi(s,a)}^\text{current Q-value} =
      \overbrace{R_s^a}^\text{expected reward for (s,a)} +
      \overbrace{\gamma Q_\pi(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})}^\text{discounted Q-value at next timestep}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      We will precisely define Q-value as the expected value of the total return from taking action $$a$$ in state $$s$$ and following
      policy $$\pi$$ thereafter. The part about $$\pi$$ is important because the agent's view on how good an action is
      depends on the actions it will take in subsequent states. We will discuss this further when analyzing our agent in
      the game environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the Q-Learning algorithm, we sample a reward $$r$$ from the environment, and estimate the Q-value for the current
      state-action pair $$q(s,a)$$ and the next state-action pair $$q(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})$$
      <d-footnote>
        For Q-Learning, the next action $$a^{\prime}$$ is the action with the largest Q-value in that state:
        $$\max_{a^{\prime}} q(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime})$$.
      </d-footnote>. We can represent the sample as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) = r + \gamma q{(s^\prime,a^\prime)}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The important thing to realize is that the left side of the equation is an estimate (current Q-value), and the right side
      of the equation is a combination of information gathered from the environment (the sampled reward) and another estimate
      (next Q-value). Since the right side of the equation contains more information about the true Q-value than the left side,
      we want to move the value of the left side closer to that of the right side. We accomplish this by minimizing the squared
      Temporal Difference error ($$\delta^2_{TD}$$), where $$\delta_{TD}$$ is defined as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \delta_{TD} = r + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime) - q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The way we do this in a tabular environment, where $$\alpha$$ is the learning rate, is with the following update rule:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) \leftarrow \alpha(r_{t+1} + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime)) + (1 - \alpha) q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      Updating in this manner is called bootstrapping because we are using one Q-value to update another Q-value.
    </p>
  </div>

  

  <p>
    We will use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) as the foundation to understand when Q-values are normally
    distributed. Since Q-values are sample sums, then they should look more and more normally distributed as the sample size
    increases <d-cite key="lecam1986clt"></d-cite>.
    However, the first nuance that we will point out is that rewards must be sampled from distributions with finite variance.
    Thus, if rewards are sampled distributions such as Cauchy or Lévy, then we cannot assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    Otherwise, Q-values are approximately normally distributed when the number of <b><i>effective timesteps</i></b>
    $$\widetilde{N}$$ is large
    <d-footnote>
      We can think of effective timesteps as the number of <b>full</b> samples.
    </d-footnote>.
    This metric is comprised of three factors:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      $$N$$ - <b>Number of timesteps</b>: As $$N$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\xi$$ - <b>Sparsity</b>: We define sparsity as the number of timesteps,
      on average, a reward of zero is deterministically received in between receiving non-zero rewards
      <d-footnote>
        In the Google Colab notebook, we ran simulations to show that $$\xi$$ reduces the effective number of timesteps by $$\frac{1}{\xi + 1}$$:
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/brandinho/bayesian-perspective-q-learning/blob/main/Sparsity.ipynb">
          Experiment in a <span>Notebook</span>
        </a>
      </d-footnote>.
      When sparsity is present, we lose samples (since they are always zero).
      <!-- As sparsity increases, we essentially lose samples since they are always zero. -->
      Therefore, as $$\xi$$ increases, $$\widetilde{N}$$ decreases.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\gamma$$ - <b>Discount Factor</b>:
      As $$\gamma$$ gets smaller, the agent places more weight on immediate rewards relative to distant ones, which means
      that we cannot treat distant rewards as full samples. Therefore, as $$\gamma$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <div><h4>Discount Factor and Mixture Distributions</h4></div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We will define the total return as the sum of discounted future
        rewards, where the discount factor $$\gamma$$ can take on any value between $$0$$ (myopic) and $$1$$ (far-sighted).
        It helps to think of the resulting distribution $$G_t$$ as a weighted mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <d-math block="">
        G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^2 r_{t+3} + ... + \gamma^{N-1} r_{t+N}
      </d-math>

      <p>
        When we set $$\gamma \lt 1$$, the mixture weights for the underlying distributions change from equal weight
        to time-weighted, where immediate timesteps have a higher weight. When $$\gamma = 0$$, then this is
        equivalent to sampling from only one timestep and CLT would not hold. Use the slider
        to see the effect $$\gamma$$ has on the mixture weights, and ultimately the mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <div>
        <div>

      </div>

      <p><label for="barGammaMixture">$$\gamma$$ = <span></span></label></p>

  </ul>

  We combine the factors above to formally define the number of effective timesteps:

  <d-math block="">
    \widetilde{N} = \frac{1}{\xi + 1}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\gamma^{i}
  </d-math>

  <p>
    Below we visually demonstrate how each factor affects the normality of Q-values
    <d-footnote>
      We scale the Q-values by $$\widetilde{N}$$ because otherwise the distribution of Q-values
      moves farther and farther to the right as the number of effective timesteps increases, which distorts the visual.

                <p>Take <strong>Uncle Bob's</strong> Clean Architecture and map its correspondences with <strong>Gary Bernhardt's</strong> thin imperative shell around a functional core, and you get an understanding of how to cheaply maintain and scale software!</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a> did. It's not every day that I find such clear insight.</p>
<p>I am honored to have found his <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/#clean-architecture-python">presentation</a> and <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/slides/2014-07-pyohio/clean-architecture/">slides</a> explaining  <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture</a> and Gary Bernhardt's PyCon talks of <a href="https://archive.org/details/pyvideo_422___units-need-testing-too">2011</a>, <a href="https://pycon-2012-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fast_tests_slow_tests.html">2012</a>, and <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries">2013</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhodes offers such a distilled view, that he can show you these crucial concepts in 3 slides of code. I will go ahead and summarize what he said and add a tiny bit of my insight.</p>
<p>Copyright of all Python code on this page belongs to <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a>, and copyright of the diagram belongs to <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</a>. I use these under (hopefully) fair use (nonprofit and educational).</p>


<p>First of all, we need to be on the same page, in order to be able to understand each other. Here are the words I'll use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function: I use "function" or "pure function" to refer to a Python "function" that only uses its parameters for input, returns a result as output, and does not cause any other side-effects (such as I/O). <ul>
<li>A pure function returns the same output given the same inputs.</li>
<li>A pure function may be called any number of times without changing the system state - it should have no influence on DB, UI, other functions or classes.</li>
<li>This is very similar to a mathematical function: takes you from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> and nothing else happens.</li>
<li>Sadly we can't have only pure functions; software has a <strong>purpose</strong> of causing side-effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedure, Routine, or Subroutine: A piece of code that executes, that may or may not have side effects. This is a "function" in Python, but might not be a "pure function".</li>
<li>Tests: automated unit tests. By "unit" I mean not necessarily just a class, but a behavior. If you want, see more details in <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we have a piece of code that prepares a URL, then gets some data over the network (I/O), then validates the result (a word definition) and returns it.</p>
<p>This is a bit much: a procedure should ideally do one thing only. While this small-ish procedure is quite readable still, it is a metaphor for a more developed system - where it could be arbitrarily long.</p>
<p>The current knee-jerk reaction is to <em>hide</em> the I/O operations somewhere far away. Here is the same code after extracting the I/O lines:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 2</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>

    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>

<span>def</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>     <span># I/O</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>           <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>data</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Listing #2, the I/O is extracted from the top-level procedure. </p>
<p>The problem is, the code is still <strong>coupled</strong> - <code>call_json_api</code> is called whenever you want to test anything - even the building of the URL or the parsing of the result.</p>
<p><strong>Coupling kills software.</strong></p>
<p>A good rule of thumb to spot coupling is this: Can you test a piece of code without having to mock or dependency inject like Frankenstein?</p>
<p>Here, we can't test <code>find_definition</code> without somehow replacing <code>call_json_api</code> from inside it, in order to avoid making HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Let's find out what a better solution looks like.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 3</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>)</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>  <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>url</span>

<span>def</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>):</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the procedure at the top (aka. the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> of the program) is handling the I/O, and everything else is moved to <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> (<code>build_url</code>, <code>pluck_definition</code>). The <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> are easily testable by just calling them on made-up data structures; no Frankenstein needed.</p>
<p>This separation into an <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and <span><strong>functional core</strong></span> is an encouraged idea by Functional Programming.</p>
<p>Ideally, though, in a real system, you wouldn't test elements as small as these routines, but integrate more of the system. See <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a> to understand the trade-offs.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture chart</a> (Copyright Robert C. Martin aka. Uncle Bob) :
<img alt="The Clean Architecture" src="https://danuker.go.ro/images/CleanArchitecture.jpg"></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Use Cases</strong></span> and <span><strong>Entities</strong></span> (red and yellow circles of the chart) map to the <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> we saw earlier - <code>build_url</code> and <code>pluck_definition</code> from Listing 3, and the <span><strong>plain objects</strong></span> they receive as parameters and send as outputs. <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Interface Adapters</strong></span> (green circle) map to the top-level <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span>  from earlier - <code>find_definition</code> from Listing 3, handling only I/O to the outside (Web, DB, UI, other frameworks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jj7ave/the_grand_unified_theory_of_software_architecture/gabst6z/?context=3">Update 2020-10-28</a>: A "Model" object in today's MVC frameworks is a poisoned apple: it is not a <a href="https://khanlou.com/2014/12/pure-objects/">"pure" object</a> or <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Humble%20Object.html">"humble" object</a>, but one that can produce side effects like saving or loading from the database. Their "save" and "read" methods litter your code with untestable side-effects all over. Avoid them, or confine them to the periphery of your system and reduce their influence accordingly (they are actually a hidden <span><strong>Interface Adapter</strong></span>) due to interacting with the DB.</p>
<p>Notice the arrows on the left side of the circles, pointing inwards to more and more abstract parts. These are procedure or function calls. Our code is called by the outside. <strong>This has some exceptions. Whatever you do, the database won't call your app. But the web can, a user can through a UI, the OS can through STDIN, and a timer can, at regular intervals (such as in a game).</strong> <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>The top-level procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>gets the input, </li>
<li>adapts it to simple objects acceptable to the system,</li>
<li>pushes it through the functional core,</li>
<li>gets the returned value from the functional core,</li>
<li>adapts it for the output device,</li>
<li>and pushes it out to the output device.</li>
</ol>
<p>This lets us easily test the functional core. Ideally, most of a production system should be pure-functional.</p>

<p>If you reduce the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and move code into the <span><strong>functional core</strong></span>, each test can verify almost the entire (now-functional) stack, but stopping short of actually performing external actions.</p>
<p>You can then test the imperative shell using <strong>fewer integration tests</strong>: you only need to check that it is <strong>correctly connected</strong> to the functional core.</p>
<p>Having two users for the system - the real user and the unit tests - and listening to both, lets you guide your architecture so as to <strong>minimize coupling</strong> and build a more <strong>flexible system</strong>.</p>
<p>Having a flexible system lets you implement new features and change existing ones <strong>quickly and cheaply</strong>, in order to <strong>stay competitive as a business</strong>.</p>
<p>Comments are much appreciated. I am yet to apply these insights, and I may be missing something!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2020-10-28:</strong> I have tried out this methodology in some small TDD Katas, and together with TDD, it works great. But I am not employed right now, so I can't say I've <em>really</em> tried it.</p>

<p>Posted by admin on 28 October 2020 at 06:15 CET. Latest update on 28 October 2020 at 17:02 CET.</p>
<p>A greedy bunch of bastards calling themselves "Voodoo Bear" sent an <a href="#mail">email</a> to my private email address announcing a DDoS attack aimed at TinyCert to take place, starting Monday 2 November 2020. They seem to be under the impression that there is a large company with deep pockets behind TinyCert, which I suppose is flattering. TinyCert is just a pet project of mine, that I find useful for myself and figured others might find it useful too.</p>
<h3>Ransom demands</h3>
<p>As you can see from the <a href="#mail">email below</a>, they are demanding a "small" $1000 ransom to call off the attack, increasing their demands by $1000 per day they are not met. TinyCert has been up for 6 years now and costs me about $200 per year to run ($1200 thusfar) and the total amount of <a href="https://www.tinycert.org/donate">donations</a> in that time has been $75, as I guess not enough people found it useful enough to consider donating. Thus, even if I <i>could</i> pay the ransom, I would not want to. If the site goes down, so be it, the version I use privately will be unaffected anyway.</p>
<h3>What can I do about it?</h3>
<p>Realistically, nothing. I could change the IP address by moving to another host or hosting provider, so that the attack goes to the wrong place. That would probably not be effective, at least not for very long. Besides, I would much rather the moronic dipshits waste their time and effort by attacking my little pet project rather than going after somebody who might actually pay them. Heck, if anything, they're saving me money if I have to shut down the site.</p>
<h4>Cloudflare?</h4>
<p>Using Cloudflare or similar services is not an option. The dumb idiots indicate they will attack the network directly (most likely the IP address of the server TinyCert is running on, rather than the actual network of my hosting provider). Since it is a very lightweight server, as TinyCert requires very little in terms of server resources, it won't hold up against a proper DDoS attack for any significant length of time. If anything, it will be interesting to see how well it holds up. For Cloudflare's protection to be effective, the IP address would first have to be changed (which in itself is easily done - I guess the criminals overestimate how much work it is to migrate a small website), but the Cloudflare SSL proxy is not suitable in the free tier. This is because the free tier does not allow the use of a custom certificate and TinyCert uses <abbr title="HTTP Public Key Pinning">HPKP</abbr>. There is also no way I could afford the higher tier that allows that.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1321320999678136325">offered Cloudflare's assistance</a> at no cost if needed. I hope it will not be necessary, but kudos to him and Cloudflare for their work and the kind offer.</p><h4>Open source?</h4>
<p>It has been suggested that I open-source the TinyCert codebase and allow people to have their own local versions, which of course wouldn't be affected. This too is not an option. Parts of the codebase are licensed to me personally and providing the source to them would be a breach of that license. Swapping that out for open source code would be possible, but time consuming and labour intensive and not something I am willing to do.</p>
<h3 id="mail">The actual email received</h3>
<p>Here is a copy of the email, for anybody who is interested.</p>
<div>
	<p>
		From: Robert Clark &lt;robertclark@coronaxy.com&gt;<br>
		Subject: If www.tinycert.org is important to you, you must read this<br>
		Date: Wed, 28 Oct 2020 02:13:37 +0000
	</p>
	<div><p>
		PLEASE FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO SOMEONE IN YOUR COMPANY WHO IS ALLOWED TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS!</p><p>
		==========================================</p><p>
		We are the Voodoo Bear and we have chosen www.tinycert.org as target for our next DDoS attack.<br>
		Please perform a google search for "Voodoo Bear" to have a look at some of our previous work.</p><p>
		Your network will be subject to a DDoS attack starting at 2020 November 2nd (Monday).</p><p>
		THIS IS NOT A HOAX, and to prove it right now we will start a small attack on www.tinycert.org that will last for 30 minutes.<br>
		It will not be heavy attack, and will not cause you any damage so don't worry, at this moment.</p><p>
		This means that your website, e-mail and other connected services will be unavailable for everyone.</p><p>
		We will refrain from attacking your servers for a small fee.<br>
		The current fee is $1000(USD) in bitcoins (BTC). The fee will increase by 1000 USD for each day after deadline that passed without payment.</p><p>
		Please send Bitcoin to the following Bitcoin address (cAsE-SeNsitIve):</p><p>
		[address removed]</p><p>
		You can easily buy bitcoins via several websites or even offline from a Bitcoin-ATM. We suggest you coinmama.com or https://buy.coingate.com/ for buying bitcoins.</p><p>
		Once you have paid we will automatically get informed that it was your payment. Please note that you have to make payment before the deadline or the attack WILL start!</p><p>
		If you decide not to pay, we will start the attack on the indicated date and uphold it until you do, there's no counter measure to this, you will only end up wasting more money trying to find a solution (Cloudflare, Sucuri, Imperva and similar services are useless, because we will hit your network directly).</p><p>
		We will completely destroy your reputation and make sure your services will remain offline until you pay.<br>
		We will also download your database and do as much damage as possible.</p><p>
		Do not reply to this email, don't try to reason or negotiate, we will not read any replies.</p><p>
		Once you have paid we won't start the attack and you will never hear from us again.</p><p>
		Please note that Bitcoin is anonymous and no one will find out that you have complied.</p><p>

<p>I literally laughed out loud at the first sentence, as it indicates how clueless these numbskulls are. Maybe I'll forward the email to my budgerigars, as they are the only other living beings in here, though I'm not sure they're qualified to make any decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> some users have reported receiving similar emails. On the one hand, that is a good thing, as it reduces the likelihood of (persistent) follow-through on the part of these scumbags. On the other hand, the more widespread this is, the more likely it is that somebody will give in and pay up. If you receive a threat like this, do not comply. It will only encourage them that their actions are successful and marks you as being susceptible to caving in to pressure.</p>
<p>So, Mr. "Clark" or "Voodoo Bear", whatever you hilariously pitiable imbeciles call yourselves, you can just fuck off. I have not for a nanosecond considered giving in to your demands, even if I could. You wanna waste your time to take down my pet project? Be my guest. My taking the time and effort to Write this page is the only thing you have "achieved" as you're not getting a penny from me. And thank you for thinking TinyCert something worthy of extortion - that means I must've done something right in creating it.</p>
<p>Well, there you go. It's been fun while it lasted. This is why we can't have nice things.</p>

<p><strong>MulticoreWare is a software development company that works on video compression, ML, heterogeneous computing, and championed the open-source x265 encoder in the past. They are now driving the x266 project to create an open-source VVC (Versatile Video Coding) encoder and use their experience from their UHDKit product to make it the premier open-source VVC encoder.</strong></p>




<h2><span id="Who_is_MulticoreWare"></span><strong>Who is MulticoreWare?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://multicorewareinc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="MulticoreWare (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MulticoreWare</a> is a multi-faceted company with expertise in different verticals such as high-performance Video Compression, AI &amp; Video Analytics, ADAS (Automated Driver Assistance), etc. A common thread through these verticals is their ability to design and write high-performance code for various computing platforms. MulticoreWare’s background and experience are cool, in my opinion, and how they’ve nurtured and built a strong team in a very complex niche is admirable.</p>



<p>With teams in the US, India, China, and Germany, MulticoreWare is well-placed to don the role of a thought-leader in the open-source video codec world.</p>



<p>Let’s see why and what their plans are!</p>



<h2><span id="The_Road_To_x266_%E2%80%93_An_Open_Source_VVC_Encoder"></span><strong>The Road To x266 – An Open Source VVC Encoder</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG announced three new video codecs – VVC (Versatile Video Coding), EVC (Essential Video Coding), and LCEVC (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding). Of these three, VVC or H.266 is touted as the successor to H.265 (HEVC) and promises 50% more compression efficiency over HEVC but comes at a much higher complexity. Here’s a <a href="https://ottverse.com/vvc-evc-lcevc-mpeg-video-codecs/">brief explanation of all three</a> on OTTVerse.</p>



<p>But, first, let’s take a look at HEVC and the x265 encoder.</p>



<h3><span id="x265_and_HEVC"></span><strong>x265 and HEVC</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>MulticoreWare announced the <a href="https://x265.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">x265 project</a> back in 2013, and it was a success. x265 allowed video compression teams worldwide to get their hands on an efficient, standards-compliant HEVC encoder. x265 was made available under the open-source <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNU GPL v2 license</a> and also offered by MulticoreWare under Commercial License Agreements.</p>



<p>But, having a good encoder clearly wasn’t enough. Because, fast-forward 7 years, and unfortunately, HEVC is still embroiled in patent-wars that seem destined to give it a “death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEVC’s situation is rather unfortunate considering that HEVC had interesting features such as the use of quadtree-decomposition, large block sizes, the concept of TU, PU, and CUs, the Sample Adaptive Offset filter, new picture types, and several innovations which made it possible to compress 4K videos quite efficiently (in comparison to H.264/AVC).</p>



<h3><span id="The_x266_Project"></span><strong>The x266 Project</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Riding on the back of their x265 success, MulticoreWare has decided to pioneer the x266 project along the x265 project lines they worked on earlier. x266 will be an open-source project with the MulticoreWare video compression team’s full attention and the backing of an industry-consortium.</p>



<p>As with any new codec, there are always early adopters (both programmers and companies) willing to give it a try, evaluate, file tickets, and contribute code. But, to get the ball rolling, you need a reliable encoder that is not only standards-compliant but also reasonably fast and with enough presets and knobs to make the early-adoption both valuable and exciting (in a geeky-sense!)</p>



<p>I spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivakumarasu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shivakumar Narayanan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shivakumar Narayanan</a>, Senior Director – Marketing and Product Management at MulticoreWare, about the consortium, and this is what he had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Similar to when we did this for x265 consortium, to get key consortium members on board and invest in the development of this codec. These members will be founding partners with benefits when the codec (rather encoder is ready to release for the open-source world). Consortium members being strategic, will also play an important role in the shaping of this codec as well as prioritization of functionalities as it would pertain to their and their customers’ interests.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Industry involvement bodes well for the open-source community because <strong>video encoder implementation is both an art and a science.</strong></p>



<p>It helps to have a proficient team that understands and implements concepts such as wavefront parallelism, multi-threading, intrinsics, etc. to make codec implementations practical and useful. And, of course, people with “golden eyes” to spot issues with video quality as they occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MulticoreWare has such a team, and I feel they’ll bring their experience from x265 to the x266 development.</p>



<h3><span id="Expertise_from_UHDKit"></span><strong>Expertise from UHDKit</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Another product in MulticoreWare’s portfolio is <a href="https://x265.com/uhdkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UHDKit</a>. It is an extended encoding library built on top of the x264 (AVC) encoder and x265 (HEVC) encoder libraries. It has a better performance and feature-set than the vanilla x264, x265, and svt-av1 encoders. UHDKit comes in-built with powerful features such as a “control system for video compression” that dynamically adjusts settings to achieve better video quality based on the computing platform’s spec. </p>



<p>Additional features include fast ABR encoding (to get the bitrate ladder faster!) and high-performance live encoding, all this on software, without any requirement for additional hardware accelerators. It can be used as a standalone encoding library or can be invoked via the FFmpeg framework, which makes it seamlessly integrate into any software encoding/ transcoding pipeline.</p>



<p>I am sure some of this expertise from building UHDKit will rub off on the x266 encoder development.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_I_Get_my_hands_on_x266"></span><strong>How Do I Get my hands on x266?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Currently, MulticoreWare is working closely with x266 Consortium members and after a few months, it will be available to them.</p>



<p>Upon enquiring about the open-source implementation, here’s what MCW had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>For the larger open source community, it will be made available when we have reached critical mass required for its first release. As we near readiness, we will update here on how you can get hold of it.</em></p></blockquote>

  <p><span>08 Apr 2020</span></p><p>When you run the Ubuntu installer, there’s an option to dual-boot Ubuntu with an
existing Windows installation. There’s also an option to encrypt your Ubuntu
installation, but <em>only if you erase everything and install ubuntu</em>. There’s no
automatic way to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 with encryption. And while
there are plenty of tutorials for dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows, many of them
are outdated – often referencing an MBR partition table – and almost none of
them seem to address encrypting your Ubuntu partition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dual-booting with encrypted storage should not be this hard in 2020.</p>

  <p>–Me, while figuring out how to do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality, once you figure it out, it’s not that hard. The tricky thing is that
this isn’t well-documented <strong>anywhere</strong>! So I’m hoping to fix that with this
tutorial blog post. Honestly, if you know enough about Ubuntu to set up a
dual-boot with Windows, it’s only a little bit harder to do it with encryption.
I prepared this tutorial on a Dell Latitude e7450, and I fine-tuned it when I
tested it on my Dell Precision 5510. So it should work with almost no
modification on most Dell systems, and with only minor modifications
(particularly around BIOS setup) on most other types of computers.</p>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>To write this guide, I compiled information from several sources. Here are some
of the most useful references I found:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon/db2c9e5f6cc73bb37812a19a40e137bc">XPS 15 9560 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon">luispabon</a>. I followed these notes pretty
closely, but modified some partition sizes and names based on other guides.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon/221bdb597cf32b46c50ffab96dbec08a">XPS 15 9570 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon">mdziekon</a>, upon which the above is based.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019">Full Disk Encryption HowTo 2019</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is a great resource, but deals with
encryption without dual-booting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ManualFullSystemEncryption">Manual Full System Encryption</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is longer, and isn’t focused on
dual-booting, but provides great details on the way certain things work.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that this method doesn’t encrypt <code>/boot</code>. While there are
valid reasons for encrypting /boot, the graphical installer does not encrypt it
when you do a graphical install with LUKS. As such, I’m matching that precedent,
and keeping the simplicity of an unencrypted /boot partition. Thus, the guide
I’ve compiled below is just about the <strong>simplest way to have a LUKS encryption
with dual-boot.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-encryption-is-important">Why encryption is important</h2>

<p>I began using encrypted storage on all my personal computers 5 or 6 years ago
after noticing that all the companies I’d worked for required it, and had good
reason to. Laptops get lost and stolen all the time. They’re high-value items
that are small and easy to carry. And when a thief gets your laptop, there’s
tons of valuable information on it that they can use or sell. Even if you use a
password to log in, it’s easy for an attacker to gain access to your data if
your disk isn’t encrypted – for example, by using a live USB stick. And once
they have that data, they might get access to online accounts, bank statements,
emails, and tons of other data. For me, an encrypted hard disk isn’t optional
anymore – its a necessity.</p>

<h2 id="an-overview">An Overview</h2>

<p>So what are we going to do? This tutorial will help you set up a system to
<strong>dual-boot Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10</strong>. (I haven’t tested it, but it should
work with most other modern versions (~16.04+) of Ubuntu or Windows.) The system
will use a GPT hard disk with UEFI (your BIOS must support UEFI). The Ubuntu
partition will be encrypted with LUKS.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The Windows partition can optionally
be encrypted with BitLocker. I’m going to keep the Ubuntu installation as close
to a “default” installation as possible – no fancy tricks like a separate
<code>/home</code> partition, but it should be somewhat easy to add that yourself if you
really want to.</p>

<p>I’m going to start with a blank hard disk, installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu
from scratch. If you already have Windows installed and you want to keep it, you
should be able to shrink your windows partition and join us in phase 3 (though
you might want to skim phases 1 and 2 to understand what we did).</p>

<p>To give you a broad overview of where we’re headed, here’s what we’re going to
do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prepare the installation media and computer</li>
  <li>Install Windows 10</li>
  <li>Create an encrypted partition for Ubuntu</li>
  <li>Install Ubuntu</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, as with any new OS installation, you should back up any important
data before proceeding. <strong>The instructions below will erase all the data on your
hard disk.</strong> Proceed at your own risk; I’m not responsible for any damage or
data loss.</p>



<p>Since we’re installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu from scratch, we’ll need a USB
stick for each. If you don’t already have a computer running Ubuntu or Windows,
making the installation media will be a little harder – but there are tutorials
for that and I’ll let you figure it out on your own.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Windows Installer USB stick.  The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/">Windows
10 Media Creation Tool</a> from a
computer that’s already running Windows.</li>
  <li>Create an Ubuntu 20.04 USB stick. The easiest way is to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">download the
ISO</a> and use the Startup Disk Creator on a
computer that’s already running Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great! We’ve got our USB sticks ready to go! One final thing before we get
started – we need to make sure our BIOS is set up correctly. In particular, we
want to make sure we’re using UEFI to boot our OS.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/dell-bios.jpg" alt="The Dell BIOS"></p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Ensure your computer is running the latest BIOS available. This is important
because an out-of-date BIOS can have bugs, and those bugs sometimes affect
things like UEFI, non-Windows operating systems, or other components we’ll be
touching.</li>
  <li>Edit your BIOS settings. The following names are probably specific to Dell
BIOS, but other manufacturers will have similar settings.
    <ol>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Boot Sequence</code>, make sure your <code>Boot
List Option</code> is set to <code>UEFI</code>.</li>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Advanced Boot Options</code>, I disabled
<code>Legacy Option ROMs</code>. It’s important that both OSes install in UEFI mode.
(You can probably enable this when installation is complete if you care).</li>
      <li>Under <code>Security</code>, <code>TPM Security</code> must be enabled if you
want to easily set up BitLocker in Windows.</li>
      <li>I disabled <code>Secure Boot</code>. I’m not sure if this is absolutely required, and
you can try leaving it on or re-enabling it when you’re done if you want.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that our BIOS is configured for UEFI, we’re going to set up our hard disk.</p>

<div>
<p><b>For this tutorial, your BIOS must support UEFI!</b></p>
<p>Most modern computers support this, but if yours doesn't this tutorial won't
work for you. You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing only Linux with encryption using the graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Installing only Windows with encryption.</li>
  <li>OR Dual-booting Linux and Windows without encryption using Ubuntu's graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Finding another tutorial or figuring out how to do this with an MBR disk.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol start="5">
  <li><strong>Completely erase</strong> your hard disk and set it up for UEFI by doing the
following.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
    <ol>
      <li>Boot your Ubuntu USB stick and use <code>Try without installing</code>.</li>
      <li>Open a terminal. Make it fullscreen while you’re at it.</li>
      <li>Figure out what your primary hard disk is called. It will probably be
either <code>/dev/sda</code> or <code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>. Importantly, it’s <strong>not</strong> <code>/dev/sda1</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1p1</code> – those are partitions of the disk. One way to figure out what
yours is called is to run <code>lsblk</code> and look at the disk size. Throughout the rest
of this guide, I’m going to refer to <code>/dev/sda</code>. <strong>If yours is not
<code>/dev/sda</code>, replace <code>/dev/sda</code> with your own (perhaps <code>/dev/sdb</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>) for the rest of this guide.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <p>Run the following commands. This will initialize the drive as a GPT drive
and create a 550M EFI system partition formatted as FAT32.</p>

        <div><div><pre><code>$ sudo su
# sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda
# sgdisk --new=1:0:+550M /dev/sda
# sgdisk --change-name=1:EFI /dev/sda
# sgdisk --typecode=1:ef00 /dev/sda
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>OK, phase 1’s complete. We have our installation media ready to go and the
computer’s BIOS and hard drive is set up correctly. Next, we’ll install Windows.</p>

<h2 id="phase-2-install-windows">Phase 2: Install Windows</h2>

<p>In this phase, we’re going to install Windows. Note that when we do this, we’re
going to leave some unallocated space to install Linux later. This is a good
approach because the Windows installer will mess with our partitions a little
bit, and its easier to let it do so before finalizing our Linux partitions.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/windows-installer.jpg" alt="The Windows installer"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Boot from your Windows Installer USB stick.</li>
  <li>Choose a <code>Custom (advanced)</code> install to get to the Windows partitioning tool.</li>
  <li>Create a new partition. The size of this partition should be the amount of
disk space you want to use for Windows. In this example, I did 80G since the SSD
on my computer is relatively small. If unsure, do about half of your hard
disk.</li>
  <li>Windows will warn you that it is going to create an extra system partition.
This is good.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Install Windows onto the partition you just made. There’s no need to format
any partitions – the Windows installer will take care of that for you.</li>
  <li>When the Windows installation is finished, log in and enable BitLocker on
drive <code>C:</code>. This will automatically create yet another partition on your disk
(a Windows recovery partition) - which is why we’re doing it before
partitioning for Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you can start using Windows. But I’d avoid doing too much setup
or personalization yet so you don’t have to do it again if something goes wrong
below. If you want to double check your partitions, this is what you’ll be left
with after installing Windows and enabling BitLocker:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo sgdisk --print /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 500118192 sectors, 238.5 GiB

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048         1128447   550.0 MiB   EF00  EFI
   2         1128448         1161215   16.0 MiB    0C01  Microsoft reserved ...
   3         1161216       167825076   79.5 GiB    0700  Basic data partition
   4       167825408       168900607   525.0 MiB   2700
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="phase-3-partition-the-drive-for-ubuntu">Phase 3: Partition the drive for Ubuntu</h2>

<p>This is the trickiest phase since this is where we need to manually set up our
encrypted disks for Ubuntu. We’re going to make it work very similar to …</p></div></div>

        <p>To talk about what no-code is good for, we need to first take a digression on what makes no-code fundamentally different from “yes-code” software.</p>
<h2 id="the-grain-of-abstractions">The grain of abstractions</h2>
<p>Software – yes-code software – has been around for a while. One of the things we’ve learned as an industry is how to write software <em>that gracefully evolves</em>. We’re not perfect – sad, legacy systems still proliferate – but we as a technical industry have learned how to build and evolve software systems against changing requirements and constraints that span years and decades.</p>
<p>When we first solve a problem with software, we write some code against the constraints of that particular day. We don’t necessarily know how the problem is going to change. Maybe there will be different customers or stakeholders tomorrow, or maybe the product will expand to serve a related, but different, problem space. We need to be able to change software to accommodate changing circumstances without rewriting it, and that is fundamentally what <em>software engineering</em> is: how to change software systems. <em>Change</em> is the name of the game.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten decent at change. We’ve built tools like Git and patterns like continuous integration and code autoformatting to make it easier to change code and remain stable. We’ve learned how to operate large software teams, especially in open source. We’ve also learned to use better abstractions. Abstractions are conceptual wrappers that isolate different parts of a codebase – say, a data source from a user interface – so that one part may change while another doesn’t. In general we have started to figure out how to make the DNA of software systems resilient against the changing tides of time.</p>
<p>No-code seems to reject a lot of those learnings, for better or worse. I haven’t seen any no-code company or product that allows source control (and I’ve seen many no-code companies, but you’re welcome to prove me wrong.) I have yet to find no-code products that allow for natural construction of abstraction between layers of a no-code workflow. No-code software is also scarily ill-prepared for large scale development: we have software systems being worked on by tens of thousands of engineers – what does it look like for a team of 1000 engineers to be working on a set of thousands of no-code workflows? Chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional software has learned the abstractions and patterns that make software resilient and adaptable to change and scale. No-code software is not ready for changing constraints nor development scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite these limitations, I think no-code has a few niches where making tradeoffs in adaptability and scale allows no-code tools to be much, much better. So, given this, <em>when is no-code useful?</em></p>
<h2 id="1-transitionary-ephemeral-software">1. Transitionary, ephemeral software</h2>
<p>The obvious answer, and one I had before our conversation, was <em>transitionary</em> software, software with <em>a defined lifetime</em>. If your software system has a finite, pre-defined lifetime and team, it doesn’t need to worry about changing constraints or team growth. It just needs to worry about solving a problem well, now.</p>
<p>Lots of software has predictably finite lifetime: a product prototype for an early-stage company, a game or app used as a part of an interactive online ad, a quick sketch or solution to patch a particularly urgent problem in a product, an app built for an event or a conference or a recruiting cycle or a quarterly goal tracker… all of these are projects with a pre-defined, maximum lifetime. They don’t need to last or grow or change – they just need to work now, and by giving up some of the adaptability of software abstractions of code, no-code software benefits from way faster prototyping speed. This is a plus.</p>
<p>I think we see lots of finite-time software in transitions. Transitions from having no product to having a product, in a prototype. Transitions in the process of brainstorming a solution and trying multiple designs. Software with a finite shelf life is a good fit for no-code tools.</p>
<h2 id="2-high-churn-code">2. High-churn code</h2>
<p>There’s another category of software for which long-term maintainability matters little – code with high churn.</p>
<p>By high churn, I mean that requirements are changing almost daily, and very little of the code written today will exist in a month or a quarter’s time. If the code you write today doesn’t have to last and evolve, because something new is going to take its place tomorrow, what matters is the speed to build, not resilience to change.</p>
<p>There’s lots of high-churn code in businesses. Marketing websites and landing pages, data pipelines for analytics, e-commerce storefronts, marketing campaigns, payment portals – requirements for these kinds of solutions change quickly enough that code is constantly being rewritten, and if code needs to <em>be replaced</em> more than it needs to <em>last</em>, no-code tools are a great fit.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-same-mistakes">Avoiding the same mistakes</h2>
<p>I think “no-code” is a misnomer. It leads us to think that no-code software is the start of a trend in which general software will involve less coding, and software engineering will become easier. This is not the case. Software engineering is not about building solutions, it’s about evolving them. But change resiliency over time is not the focus of no-code tools, and I think that’s ok.</p>
<p>I think no-code tools are instead an extension of a different trend: <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/text/">reifying workflows</a>. Business processes and workflows used to be documented in Word docs strewn about the office or on a shared folder, or even just passed down by oral tradition in companies. Now, we have tools that allow us to build these workflows, talk about them, edit them, and share them more concretely. This is a huge boon for more repeatable business processes and for getting things done quickly! I think this is the true win of no-code tools: concretizing workflows.</p>
<p>If no-code wants to be a serious competitor against “traditional” software – though I don’t think it should try – no-code needs to learn from the mistakes of early software. No-code tools need to understand that products and software systems need to live on for decades against changing teams and requirements, and against products and companies and standards that die out and get replaced. This requires a cultural shift, a tooling shift, and a new class of abstractions in our toolbelt as no-code engineers. Anytime we try to introduce more tooling and abstraction to no-code, I think no-code gets just a little more “code” in it. And perhaps that’ll bring us right back to where we started, discovering that code is good.</p>
<p>After all, the world is complex. And when we build software against the complexity of the world, that <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/complexity-conservation/">complexity needs to go somewhere</a>. Software is complex, but only as much as the world it attempts to make sense of.</p>
<p>It feels like we’re getting off the edge of a discovery phase of no-code, and into a time when we’re starting to understand what problems no-code tools are great for. I think it’s important that no-code tool builders focus on those strengths, or risk falling into the trap of repeating the software industry’s mistakes from the ground up.</p>

<h2>OfferMarket launched today on Product Hunt, and we failed miserably.</h2>

<div><p>
We tried launching on Product Hunt today, if that's what you'll call it. We half-assed it. We put together our launch post and asked a few friends to upvote.&nbsp;<span>6 hours in and we have 3 referrals to our site from Product Hunt.</span></p><p>

One person we asked for an upvote replied "I just like sold my soul to give you an upvote", here's what they were referring to in the sign up with Twitter authentication flow:
</p></div>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.offermarket.us/uploads/1/3/1/0/131040874/published/twitter-authorize-an-application-copy.jpg?1603845762" alt="Picture"></a></p>
</div>
</div>



<p>
Then we tried to have some people find us on Product Hunt, but they couldn't because their search doesn't work...<br>
</p>

<div>
<div>
<p><a><img src="https://www.offermarket.us/uploads/1/3/1/0/131040874/published/producthunt-offermarket-search-no-results.png?1603845954" alt="Picture"></a></p>
</div>
</div>



<div><p>
So that's when we realized we probably were not going to be raising much awareness on Product Hunt this time around. It also made it clear that Product Hunt either has some bugs or performance issues, or the only people whose product launches percolate to the top of the daily rankings do one or both of the following:</p><ul>
<li>know a lot of people already on Product Hunt and build a following on Product Hunt before launch</li>

<li>coerce a lot of friends, family and others for upvotes</li>
</ul><p>
Which doesn't lend much credibility to the platform as a utility for finding valuable tools.</p><p>

Moving on then. We'll try again next time. We hope you enjoyed our post-mortem and how not to launch on Product Hunt.

<h2>Part 1: Introduction</h2>



<h3>Summary</h3>



<p>Game BASIC for Sega Saturn is a homebrew development kit that allows you to program games for the Sega Saturn using the BASIC programming language.&nbsp; If you’re familiar with the PlayStation’s Net Yaroze platform, think of this as the Saturn’s answer to it – just cheaper and easier to get started with.</p>



<p>Game BASIC’s use of the BASIC language makes for a very low barrier to entry in terms of programming skill.&nbsp; Though the Saturn is notoriously difficult to program for, Game BASIC makes it easy to get started and is surprisingly powerful, allowing very easy sprite manipulation and straightforward 3D polygon implementation.&nbsp; It even includes an adapter cable that allows you to communicate with the Saturn from your PC to transfer or save programs and streamline development.  For example, here’s a Pilotwings-esque demo, but in Game BASIC:</p>

</p><figcaption>“Jump” demo, provided with Game BASIC (video courtesy <a href="https://www.satakore.com/sega-saturn-game-basic,,GBSSCD_G_JUMP_A,,GBSS-CD-Jump-Multi-Controller-Version-Bits-Laboratory.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satakore.com</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The caveat?&nbsp; Game BASIC was released only in Japan, so this means a complete setup can be difficult to obtain and all documentation is in Japanese!&nbsp; Moreover, the supporting software that allows you to use your PC for streamlined development was intended for the Windows 95 era and flat out does not install on modern systems. Oh, and the adapter cable that allows you to connect your Saturn to your PC is a 25-pin serial connection!</p>



<p>Who in the world still has both Game BASIC and a Windows 95 PC with a physical serial port? Nobody!&nbsp; (Well, unless you’re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_QU8eaMymo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Vintage Gamer</a>) But if you’re a brave experimenter who’s not afraid to tinker a bit, there are still multiple options to get everything working, even today!&nbsp; You can even do a lot just via emulation.&nbsp; So, let’s head to the Lab and get started…</p>



<h3>What You’ll Need</h3>



<p>There are several options for working with Game BASIC, ranging from quite simple but clunky to work with, to quite powerful and streamlined.&nbsp; Here are the three options:</p>



<h4>The Simple Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A copy of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games (A Japanese or modded console, a Pro Action Replay/<a href="https://ppcenter.webou.net/pskai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pseudo Saturn Kai</a> cartridge, or a Saturn emulator)</li><li>Any Saturn controller</li><li>Plenty of room in the Saturn’s internal memory (if you want to save your programs)</li></ul>



<p>For this option, you’ll run Game BASIC on the Saturn with no PC connection, using only standard Saturn accessories.&nbsp; This is a reasonable choice if you just want to write “Hello, World!”-style programs or play around with the neat games and demos that come with the kit.&nbsp; Theoretically, you can write even the most complex programs this way, but you’ll run into limitations on the size of games you can save to the Saturn’s internal memory.&nbsp; Plus, programming with a virtual keyboard is an absolute pain.&nbsp; Start here if you don’t have the necessary hardware for the other options, or if you just want to poke around a bit and see what this is all about.</p>



<h4>The Enhanced Saturn-only setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>All of the tools from Option 1, PLUS</li><li>Some kind of external expanded memory, such as:<ul><li>A direct-save memory cartridge (e.g., the official Saturn Backup Memory)</li></ul><ul><li>A Sega Saturn Floppy Disk Drive and some 3.5″ floppy disks</li></ul></li><li>A Sega Saturn keyboard OR the NetLink keyboard adapter with a PS/2 keyboard</li><li>Fun peripherals, like the Stunner light gun, 3D Control Pad, multi-tap, and Shuttle Mouse</li></ul>



<p>One of the great things about Game BASIC is how easy it makes it to access the Saturn’s peripherals, including the internal backup RAM, external memory cartridges, and even the Saturn Floppy Disk Drive.&nbsp; With a setup like this, you’ll have plenty of space to save your programs and you can use a real keyboard for text entry.&nbsp; You can even start experimenting with different forms of input, like analog controls and light guns!&nbsp; But without access to the tools a PC provides, it will be difficult to make nice-looking sprites, textures, and 3D models.&nbsp; So, this will still limit what you’re capable of.&nbsp; Regardless, this is a great option for the sheer fun factor of “Hey look! I’m programming with my Saturn!” or if you have no ability to connect your Saturn to a PC.</p>



<p>You can even go this route with a Saturn emulator, giving you easy access to improved keyboard, mouse, and storage options.&nbsp; I’ve confirmed that Mednafen successfully emulates Game BASIC and allows for keyboard and mouse pass-through input, meaning you can do a whole lot of Saturn development with very little barrier to entry.</p>



<h4>The Full Saturn plus PC Setup</h4>



<h5>Required Tools</h5>



<ul><li>A complete Game BASIC for Sega Saturn kit, including:<ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Game BASIC for Sega Saturn disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>A copy of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/game-basic-for-sega-saturn" target="_blank">Windows 95 Tools disc</a></li></ul><ul><li>The special Saturn-to-PC serial cable adapter</li></ul></li><li>A modern PC with a USB port, capable of running a Virtual Machine (I use VirtualBox)</li><li>A copy of Windows XP SP3 32-bit to install on a VM</li><li>A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/USB-Serial-Adapter-Prolific-PL-2303/dp/B003WOWBBW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USB-to-Serial adapter</a> (Must support RS232 with a DB25 connector)</li><li>The ability to play Japanese Saturn games on original hardware (Japanese or modded console, or a Pro Action Replay/Pseudo Saturn Kai cartridge)</li><li>A Saturn controller</li><li>Optionally, any fun Saturn accessories you may want to experiment with (I especially recommend a keyboard or keyboard adapter)</li></ul>



<p>This is the Cadillac option!&nbsp; This is the setup I use, is how Game BASIC was really intended to be used (well, except nobody expected it to be run on a VM, I suppose), and is what the rest of this guide will focus on.&nbsp; With this setup, writing a game is as simple as writing BASIC in a text editor and hitting a couple of buttons to send it to your Saturn, where it immediately shows up on your TV and responds to controller and keyboard input!&nbsp; Seriously, it’s super cool once you get it working…</p>



<p>The Simple and Enhanced Saturn-only setups are extremely straightforward.&nbsp; You just boot Game BASIC like any other Saturn game and get started, so there’s not much configuration to discuss.&nbsp; Regardless of the setup you choose, continue on to Part 2 for a few test programs.&nbsp; But if you want the Full setup, it’s quite a project to get going, so read on to Part 3 for the complete How-To!</p>

<p>If the answer is yes, then keep reading. Chances are that if you program in Python, you will probably fall into one of these silly behaviors.</p>
<p>In the part 1 of this series I’m going to show you 5 things that have a great potential drive you mad in Python. Some of them are very subtle and others are not obvious at all. By learning about them in advanced, you can save hours of debugging time. So brace yourself and let’s go!</p>

<p>I confess that this one has costed me several hours of my life. When used correctly it is very nice but when you don’t, it’s a headache.</p>
<p>In Python you can concatenate strings using not only using the <code>+</code> operator but also implicitly. The following snippet illustrates a very common bug in Python.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>2</span>]: <span>"french "</span> + <span>"bulldog"</span>
Out[<span>2</span>]: <span>'french bulldog'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's fine, <code>&lt;string&gt; + &lt;string&gt;</code> generates a new <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>. But what you may not know is that you can leave <code>+</code> out and Python will still concatenate the string.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>3</span>]: <span>"french "</span> <span>"bulldog"</span>
Out[<span>3</span>]: <span>'french bulldog'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When is this a problem, then? It'll be an issue when you want a list of strings and forget a comma.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>4</span>]: dogs = [<span>"poodle"</span> <span>"french bulldog"</span>, <span>"pit bull"</span>, <span>"american bully"</span>]
In [<span>6</span>]: dogs

<p>Oh, it can get worse. Imagine you have a function that accepts two strings, but the second one is optional.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>11</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>print_pair</span>(<span>a: str, b: Optional[str] = None</span>):</span>
    ...:     print(<span>"a: "</span>, a, <span>"b: "</span>, b)
In [<span>13</span>]: print_pair(
    ...: <span>"First string"</span>
    ...: <span>"Second string"</span>
    ...: )
a:  First stringSecond string b:  <span>None</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You see? The function runs just fine, so that’s not great! Situations like these can hide nasty bugs. The lesson here is clear: be careful when passing strings to functions or using them as list of items.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cv4aHA3NS4YxO/giphy.gif" alt="A dog playing goes #fail"></p>
<p>In 2019, Python 3.8 introduced the walrus operator. This new feature generated a lot of controversies. Some people loved whereas other actually hated it. The goal of this post is not to debate that, so I’ll dive right into what makes walrus confusing.</p>
<p>Before Python 3.8, you could not assign a value to a variable and test if it was “truthy” in the same statement.  For example, see the following example, of reading data from a socket until an empty string is read. This examples is inspired by  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/#capturing-condition-values">one</a>  described in the PEP.</p>
<p>Without <code>walrus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>data = sock.recv(<span>4096</span>)
<span>while</span> data:
    clean_data = clean(data)
    print(<span>"Received data:"</span>, data)
    data = sock.recv(<span>4096</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>walrus</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>while</span> data := sock.recv(<span>4096</span>):
    clean_data = clean(data)
    print(<span>"Received data:"</span>, data)
</code></pre>
<p>That is, you do both the assignment and the checking in the same line by using <code>:=</code>.</p>
<p>In Python we can use tuples to assign values to more than one variable in the same line.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>1</span>]: a, b = <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>

In [<span>2</span>]: a
Out[<span>2</span>]: <span>2</span>

In [<span>3</span>]: b

As a result, <code>(a, b := 16, 19)</code> is the same as <code>(a, (b := 16), 19)</code>. And that explains why a 3-tuple is returned.</p>

<h2 id="be-careful-when-using-with-lists">Be Careful When Using <code>+=</code> With Lists</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/GEObzG7vNeRUs/giphy.gif" alt="A dog falling down the stairs"></p>
<p>Lists in Python are incredibly nice. You can perform all sorts of stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>concatenating multiple lists using <code>+</code> operator</li>
<li>generating a repeated list by using the <code>*</code> operator</li>
<li>concatenate and assign lists using <code>+=</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at an example on how <code>+</code> operator works with the <code>list</code> object. I know you may be tired of such toy examples, but please, bear with me.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>20</span>]: lst = [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]

In [<span>21</span>]: lst_copy = lst

In [<span>22</span>]: lst = lst + [<span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>23</span>]: lst
Out[<span>23</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>24</span>]: lst_copy
Out[<span>24</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Cool, we created a list called <code>lst</code> then we built a new one named <code>lst_copy</code> by pointing it to <code>lst</code>. Then we changed <code>lst</code> by appending <code>[8, 9]</code> to it. As expected, the <code>+</code> operator expanded <code>lst</code> whereas <code>lst_copy</code> remained the same.</p>
<p>In Python one can shorten expressions like <code>a = a + 1</code> as <code>a += 1</code>. As I mentioned in the beginning, you can also use the <code>+=</code> operator with lists. So, let’s give it a shot and re-write our example.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>25</span>]: lst = [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>]

In [<span>26</span>]: lst_copy = lst

In [<span>27</span>]: lst += [<span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>28</span>]: lst
Out[<span>28</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]

In [<span>29</span>]: lst_copy
Out[<span>29</span>]: [<span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>6</span>, <span>7</span>, <span>8</span>, <span>9</span>]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAAATTT!? What happened here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that, like other Python operators, the implementation of <code>+=</code> is defined by the class that implements it. That is, to define <code>+=</code> the <code>list</code> class has defined a <code>object.__iadd__(self, other)</code> magic method. And the way it works is the same as <code>list.extends</code>. </p>
<p>So why has <code>lst_copy</code> been modified? </p>
<p>Because it is not an actual copy of <code>lst</code> but it points to the in memory.</p>

<p>The key takeaway is, don't blindly assume operators will have the same semantics across different classes. </p>
<h2 id="mutable-defaults">Mutable Defaults</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13cbZDgXa23UeQ/giphy.gif" alt="A dog jumping sofas #fail"></p>
<p>I understand that this one might not be new to you. However, it’s unquestionably one of the most dangerous. The case I’m talking about is the usage of mutable default arguments on functions. If you don’t know what this is all about, take a look at the following example.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>35</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>add_fruit</span>(<span>fruit: str, basket: list = []</span>) -&gt; list:</span>
    ...:     basket.append(fruit)
    ...:     <span>return</span> basket
    ...: 

In [<span>36</span>]: b = add_fruit(<span>"banana"</span>)

In [<span>37</span>]: b
Out[<span>37</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>]

In [<span>38</span>]: c = add_fruit(<span>"apple"</span>)

In [<span>39</span>]: c
Out[<span>39</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>, <span>'apple'</span>]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>WAAATT!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, we call the function twice without passing a list to it. The ultimate result is a list with two items, how did that happen?</p>
<p>The reason for this behavior is that when the interpreter defines the function, it also creates the default argument. Then, it binds the object created to the function argument. </p>
<p>In our problem, Python allocated an empty list and bound it to the argument <code>basket</code>. To make things simpler to follow, let’s look at a visual example made with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pythontutor.com/">python tutor</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603048050068/v39uSktN5.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="mutable-1.png"></p>

<p>As you can see, the argument <code>basket</code> is created once and the function points to it during its entire lifetime. The only exception is when you pass another list to it but that won’t change the default. Whenever you call the function again without passing a list to it, it will use the one created when the function was defined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can we avoid this, then?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid this, you must set the argument to <code>None</code> and create a list if none is passed.</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>44</span>]: <span><span>def</span> <span>add_fruit</span>(<span>fruit: str, basket: Optional[list] = None</span>):</span>
    ...:     <span>if</span> basket <span>is</span> <span>None</span>:
    ...:         basket = []
    ...:     basket.append(fruit)
    ...:     <span>return</span> basket

In [<span>45</span>]: b = add_fruit(<span>"banana"</span>)

In [<span>46</span>]: b
Out[<span>46</span>]: [<span>'banana'</span>]

In [<span>47</span>]: c = add_fruit(<span>"apple"</span>)

In [<span>48</span>]: c
Out[<span>48</span>]: [<span>'apple'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Great! Now we create a list whenever no argument is passed to the function, which fixes the bug.</p>
<h2 id="chained-operations-gone-wrong">Chained Operations Gone Wrong</h2>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEduU8I0dHP38CdLW/giphy.gif" alt="A dog playing on grass and failing"></p>
<p>Chained operations are an exceptional feature. It makes the code terse without sacrificing readability. I discuss it in more detail in another blog <a target="_blank" href="https://miguendes.me/5-hidden-python-features-you-probably-never-heard-of">post</a> but to provide you a bit of context let’s see it in action.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span>10</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>20</span> == x == <span>0</span>
<span>False</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>25</span> &gt; x &lt;= <span>15</span>
<span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let's pay close attention to the first example. If Python didn't have this feature, that statement could be re-written as:</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>53</span>]: <span>20</span> == x <span>and</span> x == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>53</span>]: <span>False</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, what happens if we add parentheses to enforce some kind of precedence?</p>
<pre><code>In [<span>51</span>]: <span>20</span> == x == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>51</span>]: <span>False</span>

In [<span>52</span>]: (<span>20</span> == x) == <span>0</span>
Out[<span>52</span>]: <span>True</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait? What on earth has just happened?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we added the parentheses, <code>(20 == x)</code> was evaluated to <code>False</code>. However, the problem is that <code>False</code> is then compared to <code>0</code>.  ̶S̶i̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶<code>̶0̶</code>̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶s̶i̶d̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ ̶a̶ ̶"̶F̶a̶l̶s̶y̶"̶ ̶v̶a̶l̶u̶e̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶a̶r̶i̶s̶o̶n̶ ̶r̶e̶t̶u̶r̶n̶s̶ ̶'̶T̶r̶u̶e̶`̶.̶</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://hashnode.com/@alexmojaki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@alexmojaki</a>, <code>False == 0</code> is <code>True</code> because <code>bool</code> is a subclass of <code>int</code>. For instance, other "Falsy" values such as <code>[]</code> or <code>""</code> are not equal to <code>False</code>.</p>

<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/">Source</a></p><p>Because of this, AWS certifications are in very high demand. I decided a few months ago that it's time for me to step up and at least get the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">Cloud Practitioner certification</a>, and probably others like the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">Solutions Architect Associate</a>.</p><h2>Big AWS Concepts for Developers</h2><p>Let's lay down a couple of definitions to help you as you progress in your AWS education.</p><p>First, what are <strong>cloud computing</strong> and <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong>? In short, this means that instead of you having to physically set up servers and networks in your garage or at your company, you "rent" these from Amazon. Everything you might want to do to run a website <!-- -->—<!-- --> the hardware that runs the server, the database, the storage that holds the frontend and static files, and the domain name configuration <!-- -->—<!-- --> can be done using AWS's networking and computing resources.</p><p>Why does this matter? The main reason is <strong>scalability</strong>: the ability to grow based on demand. AWS alleviates both the cost and logistics of scaling a service or business. Imagine you're running an online store for dog toys on a single server in your garage (you probably bought it on eBay). Suddenly, <a href="https://twitter.com/dog_feelings">Thoughts of Dog</a> tweets about your store and your traffic spikes by twenty times as millions of people try to buy your bespoke artisan chew toys. What's going to happen? Most likely your server will crash due to that much demand. You're frantically searching eBay for another server and some networking equipment, but it will likely cost you a couple thousand bucks and several days to upgrade your server or add additional servers to your network. Ouch! (Incidentally, a show that demonstrates this dilemma perfectly is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a>, which is about startups in the 80s.)</p><p>Services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform came along and revolutionized the industry. Now instead of needing to buy a brand new server, you can click a button and immediately grow your infrastructure. Even better, you can automatically grow and shrink your infrastructure as demand for your site or service fluctuates. This helps keeps costs more predictable and spreads them out over time instead of all at once with big hardware purchases.</p><h2>Key AWS Services for Developers</h2><p>When approaching AWS as a developer, there are a few of the core services that you'll likely encounter right away, so here's a quick overview of those:</p><ul><li><strong>Lambda</strong>: Serverless functions are kind of a gateway for developers into AWS and cloud infrastructure. In AWS, Lambda is the service that runs these functions. Serverless functions let you perform calculations or access databases without having a physical server.</li><li><strong>S3</strong>: S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. This is where you host static files such as HTML, images, or videos.</li><li><strong>Route 53</strong>: Route 53 is where you set up DNS for domain names. "Route" is a reference to US Route 66 and "53" is a reference to TCP or UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed.</li><li><strong>EC2</strong>: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is where you run servers. If you're looking to run an API or a traditional web app using something like Node or Nest, this is what you want.

There are many, many more services relevant to developers, but getting a handle on the basics of these will get you quite a long way.</p><h2>AWS Pitfalls for Developers</h2><p>The two main pitfalls you might run into as you learn AWS (other than its sheer complexity) are <strong>billing</strong> and <strong>identity and access management (IAM)</strong>.</p><p>AWS is not free to use, though there is a free tier and some services are free. Usually these costs are minor for short periods of time, but beware: if you run through a tutorial and then forget to clean up after yourself, you might face a big bill at the end of the month! Be sure to know what costs you're incurring as you do tutorials and try to shut down and delete anything you don't need when you're finished. AWS also lets you create billing alerts that will email you when you've hit a threshold. Here's a great <a href="https://egghead.io/playlists/use-aws-billing-cost-management-dashboard-to-keep-your-aws-bill-to-minimum-ff0f">egghead collection on AWS cost management</a> that will help a lot.</p><p>The other really sticky area in AWS is security. Identity and Access Management (IAM) in AWS is extremely complex. There are many layers of permissions for each service, user, and group. Most tutorials will help you navigate the basic set up that you will need to get things done. Be careful that you're not leaving yourself open to big vulnerabilities as you learn. Not only does that open the door to data theft, but it could also result in huge bills if someone gets a hold of your root account. This doc is kind of scary, but you're going to want to get familiar with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">security best practices in AWS</a> little by little. At the very least, secure your root account and enable MFA.</p><p>For the sake of both billing and IAM, you will likely want to avoid using your employer's AWS account to learn. If your job is the motivation for learning AWS, work with your company on creating a sandboxed account with a given budget.</p><h2>Overview of AWS Certifications</h2><p>While not all certifications in tech are created equal, AWS certifications are extremely valuable. They're designed to minimize false positives and fairly rigorous, so employers know they can use them as a solid benchmark of knowledge. This means they can add some zeroes to your paycheck and set you apart from the average developer.</p><p>There are many different AWS certifications, so let's break down what the options are.</p><p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">Cloud Practicioner exam</a> is considered a <strong>Foundational</strong> exam recommended for people with 6 months of fundamental AWS knowledge. It's high-level and not super technical, but gets your feet with AWS.</p><p>From there, there are three <strong>Associate</strong> level exams, recommended for people with 1 year of experience solving problems and implementing solutions using AWS. These exams have broad scope but shallow depth and break into three paths: Architect, Operations, and Developer. The three exams are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">Solutions Architect Associate</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/">SysOps Administrator Associate</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/">Developer Associate</a></li></ul><p>From there, there are two <strong>Professional</strong> certifications, recommended for people with 2 years of comprehensive experience designing, operating, and troubleshooting solutions using AWS. These exams have broader scope and are quite deep. The Architect path remains, but Developer and Operations combine into DevOps. The two exams are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/">Solutions Architect Professional</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/">DevOps Engineer Professional</a></li></ul><p>There are also six <strong>Specialty</strong> exams, which are very narrow in scope but very deep:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty/">Advanced Networking Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty/">Security Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/">Machine Learning Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-alexa-skill-builder-specialty/">Alex Skill Builder Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/">Data Analytics Specialty</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-database-specialty/">Database Specialty</a></li></ul><p>I decided to get some of these certifications as a way to guarantee that I will actually set aside the time to learn some AWS and have something to show for it. My plan is to get the Cloud Practicioner and then the Solutions Architect Associate. Why not the Developer Associate first? Well, my understanding is that the Solutions Architect Associate is more comphrensive than the Developer Associate, and thus it's easier to get the Developer Associate after getting the Solutions Architect Associate. It also sets you up to get the Solutions Architect Professional, which is extremely difficult and highly coveted (and thus should come with a big pay raise!). The SA-P requires the SA-A, so it makes sense to go that route. I'll update this article when I've got some results.</p><h2>AWS Resources for Developers</h2><p>There are boatloads of resources for learning AWS out there. Some are geared towards infrastructure and networking folks, some are geared towards database admins, some for security teams, and others towards developers. Here are the key resources I've been using and a variety of others I've found useful.</p><h3>My Essential AWS Resources</h3><p>I've found myself relying pretty heavily on these resources in my own AWS journey:</p><ul><li><a href="https://acloud.guru/">A Cloud Guru</a>: A Cloud Guru is hands down the single best resources out there for learning AWS and just about any other cloud technology. I am honestly blown away. Just the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certification-preparation?_ga=2.170270560.1574418745.1603210089-860129520.1602887034">AWS Certification Preparation Guide</a> is worth the cost of admission. I'm working my way through the Developer Learning Path and about halfway through the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner?_ga=2.124181706.1574418745.1603210089-860129520.1602887034">Cloud Practitioner 2020 course</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2020-10-26</small>
        <p>The BEAM is the virtual machine that Erlang and Elixir runs on. It is widely cited as a battle-tested piece of software though I don’t know in which wars it has seen action. It has definitely paid its dues in the telecom space as well as globally scaled projects such as Whatsapp and Discord. It is well suited to tackle soft-realtime distributed systems with heavy concurrency. It has been a good platform chugging along. And with a small team at Ericsson responsible for much of its continuing development it has been managed in a deeply pragmatic way. Erlang has always been a bit of a secret and silent success. Almost no-one uses it if you look at market shares. But among the ones that use it there seems to be a very positive consensus. And then Elixir came and caused a bit of a boom. I think the BEAM has benefited from Elixir and Elixir wouldn’t exist without the BEAM. With that bit of background I’d like to shine a light on some cool developments that I think makes the BEAM more interesting or even uniquely interesting in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-jit-is-here-soon-otp-24">The JIT is here (soon, OTP 24)</h2>
<p>With OTP 24 landing sometime next year we are going to get the a JIT for the BEAM. Based on the project <a href="https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit">AsmJit</a> this will mean that some BEAM code will be translated to native instructions. It will not be the kind of warm-up-for-performance-gains JIT that I’ve heard of in PyPy but rather significantly simpler. The goal of the project was to introduce a JIT that could give performance gains for some cases but would not cause any performance regressions. A pragmatic and laudable approach. Considering this made the Jason JSON-library (written in Elixir) beat the Jiffy JSON-library (written as a C NIF) in <strong>some</strong> tests I think this has the potential to obviate the need for some NIF implementations. Avoiding reaching out to the lower level code that is more capable but more dangerous is a good win.</p>
<p>Anyone running RabbitMQ should look forward to the update as measurements indicate 30-50% increased message throughput. Which is a nice thing to get for no code changes at all.</p>
<p>Pushing the performance of the BEAM closer to native is magnificent. To be clear the BEAM is already quite a good performer. I would put Erlang and Elixir at the abstraction level of languages like Python/Ruby/Node.js. Python and Ruby are poor performers. The Python ML stuff all goes into C++ or similar for performance. I’ve worked a bunch with Python and the things I hear from the Ruby world makes them sound quite equivalent in performance. They are a bit slow and can only <a href="https://underjord.io/more-than-one-thing-at-a-time.html">do one thing at a time</a>. Node.js is a bit different. It can do multiple things at a time, if you append asterisks and squint. It does it largely the same way Python + Gevent does it. This approach is incredibly susceptible to CPU-bound work causing head-of-line blocking. It becomes the single most important consideration for building a performant application “get to IO, don’t compute”. V8 that Node.js runs on is heavily optimized and fast for such a dynamic language. I think the BEAM provides a better approach that can deliver comparable results without as many footguns (opportunities for shooting yourself in the foot). But getting better at the raw crunching is a big gain with this JIT implementation and I look forward to the release.</p>
<h2 id="lumen---static-compilation--wasm">Lumen - Static compilation &amp; WASM</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://getlumen.org/">Lumen project</a> is a huge effort by a gang of open source developers and DockYard to implement a compiler (and more) that can take Elixir and Erlang into the browser. By solving that they end up solving static compilation for Erlang and Elixir as well. So this isn’t compiling and shipping the BEAM to the browser. This is a faithful reimplementation of the BEAM functionality in a way that allows it to be compiled statically. It uses LLVM and requires quite a bit of effort both in development and in wrangling the Web Assembly work group process stuff to make sure that the standard is not entirely run by Object-Oriented Programming needs.</p>
<p>I don’t think Lumen will replace the BEAM. The BEAM has a brilliant track record for long-running services and distributed computing that the Lumen project do not even attempt to achieve right now. Instead the Lumen project will allow Elixir and Erlang to move into spaces where the BEAM might be a bit too heavy and still provide the same guarantees. Typically I see it being good for command line tools, web frontends (super interesting to consider the Actor model going there), serverless/edge computing and potentially with WASM competing with Docker as a delivery mechanism for code in Kubernetes, using something like <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet">Krustlet</a> (<a href="https://player.fm/series/software-sessions/webassembly-on-the-server-with-krustlet">good podcast episode on WASM/Krustlet</a>). It’s probably Cloud Native or something. Who knows.</p>
<p>What gives Lumen the potential to be a better fit in these circumstances is that it can optimize for filesize (by cutting out hot code updates) and it is likely able to start much faster. Lumen is written in Rust. Which seems to be the popular choice around Web Assembly from what I’ve seen. Lumen is still an early release project and not fit for production. But it is beeing actively pushed forward.</p>
<h2 id="nerves---an-iot-platform-with-minimal-suck">Nerves - An IoT platform with minimal suck</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves project</a> is fantastic. I’m a hardware hobbyist, not an IoT dev but I’ve worked a fair bit with Nerves and it is so, so good. What Nerves gives you when working with a Raspberry Pi for example is a way to let your code run all of the device. The BEAM is basically your operating system on top of a minimal Linux installation. The Linux you have is based on the solid foundation of Buildroot so it is quite feasible to modify it as you see fit. The big idea is that if you are running a Linux-level SBC already you might as well build on something that gives you the guarantees of the BEAM.</p>
<p>Beyond that the default setup encodes a lot of good embedded practices by default so that you avoid bricking devices with firmware updates, you get easy support for pushing firmware over the network or USB and much, much more.</p>
<p>There are a ton of good libraries for sensors and assorted hardware, as well as the common protocols like GPIO/SPI/I2C/UART. Networking support is well considered and has been reworked since I first started using Nerves a few years back (and it worked well then too). BLE is getting more and more good support recently.</p>
<p>The project also created <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/nerveshub">NervesHub</a> which is a solution for managing a fleet of devices by securely providing firmware updates, allowing the switching on of a remote console on devices if that’s a need on your product. I think the most recent stuff is a UI revamp and some serious work on binary diffed patches to minimize firmware update sizes for data-constrained deployments.</p>
<p>This is very much a production project and people are shipping hardware with Nerves. It keeps marching forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-beam-can-be-your-entire-application">The BEAM can be your entire application</h2>
<p>Saša Jurić, author of the much-acclaimed Elixir in Action book has produced a library called <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/site_encrypt">site_encrypt</a>. It allows you to handle LetsEncrypt configuration without a separate webserver or actually using certbot.</p>
<p>Now this library is good and meaningful in its own right but the underlying idea is why I bring it up. The BEAM can be your entire application. This is something I’ve realized over time. Where in Python you would reach for Gunicorn to run you Django app and Nginx to protect Gunicorn from the big bad world.. The BEAM is made for this. Introducing an intermediate layer of Nginx (or another HTTP server) might actually be detrimental in that you now have two things you need to configure correctly and two pools of multi-core processing workers that care about this request/response cycle and can independently screw it up.</p>
<p>The BEAM was always built for this. OTP has a lot weird corners where you find interesting libraries such as <code>wx</code> for WxWidgets (window management) and <code>ssh</code> for both SSH client and server work I believe. Because it is meant to be delivered as a full solution. It can run and manage multiple different types of work inside of it. Gracefully. It doesn’t replace Kubernetes for the large deployment or polyglot environments. But it might very well mean you don’t actually need to go there early. Or you can reduce how much Ops you need in your Dev. If your entire stack is Elixir or Erlang front to back I think you have empowered your developers significantly.</p>
<p>There is already a move towards this where tools are converging that give us a lot of things out of the box that we’d otherwise need to move outside our application for. These are pragmatic 80-90% solutions. The normal solutions are still all there if you need to reach for them. But maybe you don’t. I see these as moves in the same vein:</p>
<ul>
<li>LiveView - We can reduce the amount of frontend we need to build that isn’t BEAM code (Elixir or Erlang), in some cases get rid of it entirely.</li>
<li>Live Dashboard - Application insights right in your application stack instead of pushing them out to another solution.</li>
<li>Phoenix PubSub - Distributed PubSub without requiring coordination via something like Redis.</li>
<li>Phoenix Channels - Distributed PubSub over WebSockets using the above PubSub to coordinate delivery.</li>
<li>Phoenix Presence - Distribute Presence. A CRDT-powered thing for maintaining information about if someone is connected to a channel or not, like chatrooms and online/offline. Using Channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering complexity by keeping the solutions in a system you understand well is potentially very powerful. At some point many projects will need to pick up external dependencies such as Nginx, Redis or whatever. But I think there is something compelling about building your application inside a system that can do all of it quite well. Elixir and Phoenix already have significant mind-share in the startup world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this ends up being a very popular solution for startups. No frontend-specific code for the MVP, no New Relic or Mixpanel bill we make do with the Live Dashboard. Distribution is Erlang distribution + Swarm/Horde/Libcluster or something …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>27th October 2020</p>


<p><strong>TL;DR: I am stopping work on Notebag.</strong> It is causing me lots of stress and guilt and I currently
have neither the capacity nor the will to update it right now and for the foreseeable future.
It is available free and open-source <a href="https://github.com/pretzelhands/notebag">on GitHub.</a> You can extend it!
If you bought your license in the past 30 days, send me an email with your order number and I'll refund it.</p>

<hr>

<p>So. Here we are. The irony of my last two blog posts being about the start and end of something is not lost
on me. I know that a few of you are probably confused, angry and perhaps even a bit sad right now, and I
apologize in advance. And some critical voices that have been haunting me around the internet have finally
been proven right.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you why exactly I am stopping work on Notebag, what will happen to it and where I will
be going from here.</p>
<h2>The Why</h2>
<p>One or two of you reading this might perhaps know what it's like when you start a new project. You come
up with a concept! Ideas burst through your head! You are itching to tear the world apart and make
things come alive exactly the way you imagined them. This is an absolute high of productivity and you
hack away until late at night, only to get up early next morning and get right back into it.</p>
<p>That was me. </p>
<p>That's how Notebag started, doubly fueled by the fact that the world in 2020 is .. something else
and I was shit-out-of-luck in terms of freelancing contracts. So I clung to the one thing I had and put
all of my energy into it and I worked to make it into something I thought was nice.</p>
<p>I pushed and pushed each day. Bigger! Better! More features!</p>
<p>And this worked well for a while, until the inevitable tiredness came creeping in. So I put Notebag on the
backburner. New freelancing contracts finally started trickling in and I found myself busy with two kinds of
work: The one paying my bills and the one I did on Notebag.</p>
<p>It was a struggle. Every day after work I tried to pour some of my remaining energy into Notebag, but nothing
happened. I failed to implement the most basic things and bit by bit, this intense feeling of guilt set in.</p>
<p>In time, I started avoiding Twitter. Because everytime I tweeted, I felt like someone out there would be
judging me. Why wasn't I reporting progress on Notebag? What was I even up to? And so I withdrew to the confines
of Telegram and ignored Twitter. DMs came in asking and I was too scared to reply.</p>
<p>Worst of all, I was and am building this subconscious pressure on myself that I am not really allowed to work on anything
else. Why would I work on <code>Project X</code> when Notebag fans are clamoring for updates? That makes me a bad person, no? This
has led me to a state where I was afraid to program outside of my contracts. Not a great spot to be in.</p>
<p>When you are not happy with things, you should change them. I am not happy with how Notebag is currently holding
a soft stranglehold on my life and so I am changing it.</p>
<h2>The What</h2>
<p>What does all of this mean for Notebag's future? First of all, I have <a href="https://github.com/pretzelhands/notebag">published the source code.</a>
It's MIT-licensed and on GitHub, free for everyone to download, build and play with. In my wildest dreams of course there
would be a shining community hero that rises up and picks up where I left off. But that is unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>So at least as a consolation, Notebag in its entirety is available for everyone, for all time, for free. If someone is
seriously willing to make pull requests and improve the code, I am happy to release signed builds with those changes
included. If anyone has specific questions about the architecture and why my code is so bad, I will gladly answer them.</p>
<p>This is, I think, the most elegant solution. It at least guarantees that the code doesn't just gather dust on my machine,
forever unreachable for any interested person. </p>
<p>And since there is still the occasional sale of a license, I offer anybody who bought their license in the past 30 days
(after September 27) a full refund, no questions asked. To avail this, just <a href="https://pretzelhands.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5038353c3c3f10202235242a353c38313e34237e333f3d6f2325323a3533246d1e3f24353231377562600235243922353d353e24756260023536253e34">send me an email</a>
or send me a Twitter DM.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Notebags future probably does not hold many further improvements. I still use it as my personal preferred
note-taking app, because that was its purpose. It works for me and my workflow and I hope that other people will keep
on using it or maybe learn a thing or two from the source code.</p>
<p>Personally I only have one or two side projects, but I'll probably put them on indefinite hold. Clean slate.
There's a few other hobbies I've been meaning to get around to and I think right now is a good time to do that. And
perhaps, somewhere down the line an idea will strike me and I'll give in to the itch to build again. But the time for
that is not right now.</p>
<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>I would again like to apologize to anyone who put high hopes into this app. Turns out that the detractors who pointed out
my legacy of abandoned apps were onto something! It sucks to be known for this, but maybe one day that will change. Or
maybe it won't.</p>
<p>As it is, Notebag will keep working in its usual state for the foreseeable future. But maybe <code>Au revoir</code>, doesn't have
to mean goodbye forever. Not that I have any hopes of picking it back up, but if 2020 has taught the world anything,
it's that life is unpredictable.</p>
<p>For my final point I'd like to give a special shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/Clo__S">@Clo__S</a>, who aside from being
an early adopter and wonderful source of feedback was probably Notebag's most vocal fan. Thanks for all the support along
the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    
                  <p><img src="https://chaordic-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/productivity-1995786_960_720.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To productively build serverless &amp; distributed systems, we need to adopt new practices, some which may seem counterintuitive at first. This post will suggest five concrete practices to up your game.</p>
<p>Let’s jump in, roughly in order of importance:</p>
<h4 id="1-prefer-running-your-system-in-the-cloud-over-local-emulation">1. Prefer running your system in the cloud over local emulation</h4>
<p>Local development is sacred cow for many developers, being able to deploy, run and test an application or system on your laptop. But the reality of modern distributed systems is that some things cannot easily be emulated locally, if at all.</p>
<p>It is not for a lack of trying: systems running on Kubernetes are often emulated with Docker Compose or Minikube, with varying levels of success. For AWS Serverless, we have AWS SAM and LocalStack.</p>
<p>There are however a few issues with this type of emulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of maintaining emulation is high, since you effectively maintain two stacks - one for local development, and one for “real” deployment.</li>
<li>Emulation isn’t the real thing: you will find configuration drift, small or large differences in the behaviour of your stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, our experience of trying to maintain emulation is that the costs far outweigh the benefits. That effort should instead be put towards the ability to deploy local code quickly to the cloud environment, or where possible, connect a locally running process to a real environment in the cloud.</p>
<p>One of the great benefits of Serverless in particular, is that the cost of creating and provisioning <em>Feature Environments</em> is approaching zero. Moving local development to the cloud is a low-cost proposition.</p>
<h4 id="2-cicd-pipelines-are-not-enough-local-deployment-automation-is-crucial">2. CI/CD Pipelines are not enough, local deployment automation is crucial</h4>
<p>Given our stance on local emulation, the next instinct to suppress is that of relying on CI/CD to manage deployments to feature environments. If we rely entirely on CI pipelines for our ongoing development work, we end up wasting large amounts of time waiting for CI pipelines to build and deploy.</p>
<p>If instead, CI &amp; local development workflows can share as much as possible of deployment infrastructure, we should be able to reduce/remove this bottleneck on development, while also minimizing the duplicated effort of maintaining two types of automation.</p>
<p>In summary, any developer should trivially be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy or connect locally built resources to their own feature environment in seconds with a single command from their laptop.</li>
<li>Deploy only the unit of deployment which has changed.</li>
<li>Have a development experience that is practically indistinguishable from “local development”.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-for-aws-serverless--function-as-a-service---monolithic-functions-are-ok">3. For AWS Serverless &amp; “Function-as-a-Service” - monolithic functions are OK</h4>
<p>The first thing many teams do when they first start using AWS Lambda, is that they create separate deployable functions for every type of function invocation. For instance, a REST API gets a function for every single endpoint on the API. However, if you think in terms of <em>Domain Driven Design</em>, this might mean you end up with a number of functions that logically make up a single <em>Bounded Context</em>.</p>
<p>There are also practical considerations: as an example, AWS CloudFormation has a default limit of maximum 200 resources per stack. When you start adding up the multiplicative effect of the resources required for a Serverless application, you quickly realise that this is a limit that can be easily reached. Sticking to a service per Bounded Context, that acts as the target for multiple types of Lambda invocations is a sensible thing to do. Doing this will also reduce the automation and coordination overhead.</p>
<h4 id="4-consider-adopting-a-monorepo-with-tooling-appropriate-for-monorepos">4. Consider adopting a monorepo, with tooling appropriate for monorepos</h4>
<p>Let us start with a caveat emptor: monorepos without using appropriate tooling can be a disaster of slow CI pipelines &amp; low productivity. The upside is that some amazing and battle-tested tooling for monorepos exist these days (a personal favourite is <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>, which originated from Google).</p>
<p>Without a monorepo, building distributed systems can be painful.</p>
<p>With dozens of repositories, code navigation for larger changes spanning multiple services become painful. Another thing that quickly becomes painful is dependency management, code sharing &amp; reuse. It is not uncommon to find that different components have different, mutually incompatible dependencies, which become painful to upgrade.</p>
<p>A monorepo negates these pains, while also making things such as security audits easier to conduct and address.</p>
<p>However, to avoid the “rebuild the universe” problem with monorepos, you need tooling that solves three problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change detection &amp; dependency-graph tracking.</li>
<li>Dependency-graph based rebuilds (rebuild only what has changed and what is invalidated by the change).</li>
<li>Build caching.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-implement-all-three-pillars-of-observability">5. Implement all three pillars of observability</h4>
<p>Observability in control theory is defined as the ability to infer the internal state of a system by from knowledge about its external outputs. In practice, this is the triumvirate of event logs (log aggregation &amp; analytics), metrics (for alerting) &amp; tracing (driving visualization). Most organizations today skew heavily towards event logs only, with maybe some metrics, but very few do all three well.</p>
<p>In a distributed systems world, doing all three pillars of observability well means that the time to detect, find and address bugs and other issues can be cut down to a fraction of what it would otherwise be. Furthermore, great observability will also improve developer productivity, since we can better understand the state of our entire system.</p>
<p>This is perhaps an area where AWS Serverless stands out as a leader. While the Kubernetes eco-system is filled with many options of various complexity and quality, AWS gives us an easy way to achieve a high level of observability at low effort and cost. <em>CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics</em> and <em>AWS X-Ray</em> can provide observability to a Serverless architecture at a relatively low threshold of effort and learning.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It should be obvious by now that Serverless &amp; distributed systems require great discipline in deployment automation. It is unfortunate that many still make the distinction between deployment being an “ops” concern, separate from development.</p>
<p>Dev &amp; Ops in modern systems are intertwined, the level and quality of automation has a great impact on DevEx (Developer Experience), and thus developer productivity. It is not a concern that can be postponed or thought about after the fact: it requires effort initially, and disciplined refinement throughout. If this is done well, you will be able to develop with a speed, reliability and level of productivity that will run rings around the competition.</p>
<p>We will return to this subject in the future to show what a practical Serverless toolchain and reference architecture could look like. Feel free to sign up to our email list below to get notified when we do!</p>

The new field called <code>referer</code> — a misspelling of the word <i>referrer</i> — allowed "the client to specify, for the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained". A great addition to the protocol, but ter-ible spelling 😛</p><p>75 years later, on every website request that is made, there is now a <code>referer</code> header. Barker later <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/alt.folklore.computers/7X75In21_54/JgV9Rw04f-EJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">joke</a>d that he was trying to get the Oxford English dictionary to adjust their spelling..."since my spelling is used several billion times a minute more than theirs" </p><p>SQL queries have been written, databases have been designed, bugs have been introduced...because of how Barker and Fieldings spelled this word. </p><a href="#&quot;in-this-great-future,-you-can't-forget-your-past&quot;" id="&quot;in-this-great-future,-you-can't-forget-your-past&quot;"><h2>"In this great future, you can't forget your past"</h2></a><p>Developing products is inherently path dependent. History matters. Every product decision you've made determines every product decision you're going to make in the future.</p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F147e9b25-92c3-4534-bfef-510315be9d39%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=cb6c5a83-5484-4e3d-8049-e7c40cb03e23" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>Product-Market Fit is where that initial path is set. It is Decision A. At that point, you could've head in any direction. You could turn around quickly, and head in another direction. But the further you go down a particular trail, the further you have to backtrack. The more people you convince to join you on the trail, the more you have to explain why <i>everyone</i> needs to turn around. </p><p>I've found that thinking about your product path dependency is a helpful framework for understanding why your product is the way it is, and how to shape its future. It helps clarify why parts of your product — the product you are building! — stink and are so hard to fix. It clarifies which decisions matter and which do not. </p><p>And it helps you understand how and when you can change that path.</p><a href="#exploring-some-paths" id="exploring-some-paths"><h2>Exploring Some Paths</h2></a><p>Let's explore a few examples of Product Path Dependency at play...</p><a href="#smtp-protocol" id="smtp-protocol"><h3>SMTP Protocol</h3></a><p>Most email clients don't let you retract an email once it's been sent. You also can't edit a sent email. Most email clients — from Superhuman to HEY to Gmail — are built on the assumption that a sent email is a sent email. </p><p>Products have gotten creative to work around this assumption. Superhuman adds a 10 second wait period to allow you to unsend. If both sender and recipient are using Microsoft Exchange, an email can be "recalled". </p><p>But an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">early decision in 1982</a> is largely still dictating how much of the world digitally communicates.  </p><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F902fe272-6f32-4432-8a0f-718df674cc53%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=96299059-f253-4b65-8d7c-138bfc19f900" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>Slack is a great example of what can happen when new entrants aren't burdened by past decisions. Rather than using SMTP, slack uses Websockets. When you send a message, the recipients see the message almost immediately. And you can edit, delete, pin and share the messages you're sending. </p><p>Once you've used Slack, you wonder why email was so static and immutable. It revisited an assumption, and made it painfully visible. </p><a href="#instagram" id="instagram"><h3>Instagram</h3></a><p>There's been a lot of <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/5/21354975/tiktok-clone-instagram-reels-facebook-copycat" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shade</a> thrown at Instagram for attempting to clone hit features like Stories (Snapchat) and Reels (TikTok). Occasionally these clones will work, in the case of Stories, but most of the time they flop.

It is a badge of successfully building something that people want, and an organization that can support it. So if we can't avoid it, what can we do about it? </p><a href="#early-decisions-are-disproportionately-important" id="early-decisions-are-disproportionately-important"><h3>Early Decisions are <i>Disproportionately Important</i></h3></a><p>There is a paradox of early product decision-making. Early decisions are disproportionately important in that all future decisions will rely on it. Yet they are also the ones that need to be made the fastest and given the least consideration. "Try it out and see what sticks." Until it sticks, and then you are left with that decision for a very long time. </p><p>I think there's a way to resolve this tension by making decisions that <i>preserve future optionality</i>. It's somewhat of a hack to avoid making a decision that you will have to unwind in the future.  </p><p>Let's take a user data model as a simple example. When you have no users, designing your data model is easy. You can change on the fly. As you build more features — like your sign up flow — they are built around the assumptions you made in designing your user model. Are you going to collect birthday? Are you going to ask them to use a company email address? Can they invite friends? As you build upon these early product assumptions, they become harder and riskier to change. </p><p>Designing for optionality may take slightly more time, but thinking through some potential options you might want down the line can reduce your path dependence. </p><ul><li>Will Users be part of an Account?</li><li>Will Users need to be Linked via a social graph?</li><li>Will Users need to have multiple Plans?</li></ul><p><img src="https://n2parko.com/api/asset?assetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fa558f675-6d7e-45a3-ade1-174780e3bb29%2FUntitled.png&amp;blockId=38c88d0c-697e-4319-ab5e-a7fd6f9d6881" alt="An image from Notion"></p><p>An option-preserving decision early on can save you months or years of migration work down the line. </p><a href="#competitors-are-forging-their-own-paths" id="competitors-are-forging-their-own-paths"><h3>Competitors are forging their own paths</h3></a><p>Competitors are on a path as well, but it's different from yours. By understanding your competitors path, you can understand what they might do in the future, and what they aren't able to do given their prior decisions. A company geared at large enterprises has likely built a sales team that will be reluctant  to lower prices to sell to startups. A company designed to run on-prem will have quarters/years to migrate to the cloud. </p><p>New entrants are unburdened by decisions of the the past and can move much faster in many more directions. Every so often, revisit the assumptions and "path" that you are on. If you were to start all over again, how might your product and the org look different? Migrations and re-writes can be painful, but better to do so early than to continue to building on a crumbling foundation. </p><a href="#pms-are-the-&quot;product-historians&quot;" id="pms-are-the-&quot;product-historians&quot;"><h3>PMs are the "Product Historians"</h3></a><p>PMs can play an important role in understanding the market, organizational, and technology constraints that of the past, that led to the product today.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>We’re excited to announce the release of version 1.20. The 1.20 release shipped on Oct 26, 2020. This version delivers new features as well as resolving issues for users on version 1.19 and older.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>In addition to bug fixes and user interface improvements, there are a couple of new features and improvements which deserve a spotlight.</p>

<h3 id="saml-saml-saml">SAML, SAML, SAML</h3>

<p>With this release, FusionAuth implements additional parts of the SAML 2.0 standard.</p>

<p>FusionAuth now has support for SAML POST bindings when it is acting as either the SP or the IdP. This allows FusionAuth to integrate with a number of popular commercial off-the-shelf applications and websites, including <a href="https://developers.login.gov/saml/">login.gov</a> and <a href="https://docs.alfresco.com/saml/concepts/saml-overview.html">Alfresco</a>.</p>

<p>FusionAuth also supports the <code>SessionIndex</code> attribute, which is optional, but required by some software applications, notably Artifactory.</p>

<p>Finally FusionAuth now honors the <code>AssertionConsumerServiceURL</code> in a SAML request. Multiple redirect URLs can be configured in the application SAML settings as well.</p>

<h3 id="docker-changes">Docker changes</h3>

<p>In this release, we updated the base image for Docker from <code>alpine</code> to <code>ubuntu:focal</code>. This should not impact functionality, but it’s worth paying attention to if you are building Docker images based on our image.</p>

<p>We made this change because in order to run on <code>alpine</code> without including the GNU C Library (<code>glibc</code>) we had to use a custom build of OpenJDK compiled using the <code>musl</code> C library. Due to some possible performance concerns with this option, we have moved to an official build of JDK provided by AdoptOpenJDK. This build is compiled using <code>glibc</code>. Unfortunately, using the <code>ubuntu:focal</code> image increased the docker image size by approximately 30 MB over the <code>alpine</code> based image. However, until we can obtain official builds from AdoptOpenJDK based upon the <code>musl</code> C library, we are not planning to ship an official FusionAuth image on <code>alpine</code> due to the performance concerns.</p>

<h3 id="additional-admin-user-management-forms">Additional admin user management forms</h3>

<p>In version 1.18, FusionAuth added <a href="https://fusionauth.io/features/advanced-registration-forms/">custom registration forms</a> for users with a paid edition.</p>

<p>In this release, we’ve added a few new forms. These customizations are also only available to customers with a paid edition. (Learn more about <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/">purchasing a paid edition</a>.)</p>

<p>This new feature allows you to customize the form used to add or edit a user from the FusionAuth admin UI. These forms can be configured on a per tenant basis. For instance, you can now require a mobile phone number or require one or many custom fields when a FusionAuth admin is creating a user.</p>

<p>You can also modify the registration creation and update form in the FusionAuth admin UI, including capturing custom data, removing unused fields and adding validation to the custom fields. This form is configurable on an application by application basis.</p>

<p>For instance, if your business logic needs to know a user’s favorite color (or anything else), FusionAuth has you covered:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/release-1-20/custom-edit-registration-form.png" alt="A customized registration editing form."></p>

<p>When combined with FusionAuth’s granular roles, which allow you to create users with limited privileges, you can expose these forms to customer service reps or other users whom you might not want to access the entire FusionAuth admin UI.</p>

<h2 id="bugs-squashed">Bugs squashed</h2>

<p>In addition to these features, there were over ten other bugs squashed and GitHub issues resolved as well. These fixes include changes to JWT contents in certain situations, dashboard user counts, and superfluous log messages. Please see the <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/release-notes/">release notes</a> for the full breakdown of the changes between 1.19 and 1.20.</p>

<p>If you’d like to upgrade your self-hosted FusionAuth instance, see our <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/upgrade/">upgrade guide</a>. If you have a FusionAuth Cloud deployment, open a <a href="https://account.fusionauth.io/" target="_blank">support request from your account dashboard</a> or <a href="https://fusionauth.io/contact" target="_blank">use our contact form</a> and we’ll get your servers upgraded! Or, if you’d like to download and use FusionAuth, <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing/">check out your options</a>.</p>

                                <div><p>Reddit will give employees, with some exceptions, the flexibility to work outside of offices going forward, the company said Tuesday in&nbsp;a blog post.</p>

<p>U.S. employees will now be paid the same, based on high-cost locations like NY or San Francisco, whether they work from those places or not.</p>

<p>â€œMoving forward, teams and team members will have flexibility to explore where they work: in the office, remotely, or a combination of the two,â€� the post said.</p>

<p>For those who do come into the office, the spaces will be look different: Reddit said itâ€™s â€œreimaginingâ€� its office space, without fixed desks and with â€œneighborhoodsâ€� for teams to work together. The newly flexible approach will help Reddit bring in top talent without concerns about relocations, increase workersâ€™ engagement and make their office space more efficient.</p>

<p>Several&nbsp;tech firms, including Facebook and Slack, have said during the pandemic that their workers are free to relocate and work remotely going forward, but they will be paid based on where they live. Stripe Inc. said that it would pay employees who relocate from the Bay Area or New York a one-time bonus of $20,000 â€“ but theyâ€™d also get a pay cut of as much as 10%. Brex, a fintech company based in San Francisco, has also outlined salary reductions for employees who move out of the Bay Area and New York to places like Austin, Texas or Utah.</p>

<p>â€œWe will not be afraid to continuously adapt and evolve our workforce philosophies, programs, and processes,â€� Redditâ€™s post stated.</p>

                <p>This article could have been entitled&nbsp;337,737,600 seconds, but hiding the fact that Prototypo started more than 10 years ago would have been a missed opportunity to show the dedication the team and I, as a founder, put in this project over the years.</p>
<p>Prototypo started as a student project when I studied Graphic Design at H.E.A.R Strasbourg in France. As a non-savvy Type Designer I was frustrated to not be able to complete the typeface projects I had in mind. Typefaces are made of rules and systems, right? Catcha! We can code something that follows rules, so we should succeed in coding fonts. That was the starting point of the next 10 years, and the beginning of the Roller Coaster, a.k.a creating a startup company.</p>
<p>Prototypo is a startup like many others: before having a stable and reliable business model, we put a lot of energy into developing innovative and useful technologies for our users.</p>
<p>But before being a startup, Prototypo is a company. Today we have reached the end of our resources without having found the expected Product Market Fit, and so the Break-even.</p>
<p>After several years of a strong dedication and passion for what we’ve built, we decided to shutdown the company.</p>
<p>Since the first second, I knew that it would be a hard journey with many obstacles on the path. But I regret nothing. The next 337,737,599 seconds were full of great experiences, shared with amazing people.</p>
<p>Thank you for those who supported us along the road, it was a great adventure.</p>

<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story. They’ve been ghosted by candidates. They’ve spent hours trying to convince people to talk to them. They’ve spent even more time getting candidates to the offer stage, only to lose out to the FAANG / startup-du-jour.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re an engineer (no matter how brilliant) who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A …</li></ul></div></article></main></section></div></div>

Once you pass the starting point, which is arguably the hardest step, you start to gain momentum to keep doing the task itself:</p><ul><li>Read one page → Read 10 pages → Finish the first chapter</li><li>Write one sentence → Write an opening paragraph → Write the body</li><li>Wear my running shoes → Walk for 5 minutes → Run for 5 minutes</li></ul><p>As you can see, once you start, it is much easier to continue doing it.

				<h3 id="pants-2-0-0-the-first-stable-release-of-the-pants-v2-open-source-build-system-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0, the first stable release of the Pants v2 open-source build system, is out now!</h3><p>There are so many tools in the Python development ecosystem. You might use <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> to resolve dependencies, <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/">pytest</a> to run tests, <a href="https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/">flake8</a> and <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a> for lint checks, <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> and <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/">isort</a> for auto-formatting, <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a> for type checking, <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for interactive sessions, <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools</a>, <a href="https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pex</a> or <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> for packaging, <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> for code generation, and many more. Not to mention any custom tooling you've built for your repo. </p><p>Installing, configuring and orchestrating the invocation of these tools<strong>—</strong>all while not re-executing work unnecessarily<strong>—</strong>is a hard problem, especially as your codebase grows. The lack of a robust, scalable build system for Python has been a problem for a long time, and this has become even more acute in recent years, with Python codebases increasing in size and complexity. </p><p>Fortunately, there is now a tailor-made (pun intended) solution: <strong>Pants v2</strong>!</p><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is designed from the ground-up for fast, consistent builds. Some noteworthy features include:</p><ul><li>Minimal metadata and boilerplate</li><li>Fine-grained workflow</li><li>Shared result caching</li><li>Concurrent execution</li><li>A responsive, scalable UI</li><li>Unified interface for multiple tools and languages</li><li>Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/render1603750306032.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Pants running multiple linters in parallel</figcaption></figure><p>Read on to learn more about Pants v2, and what it means for your Python codebase.</p><hr><h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2><p>We started the original open-source Pants project back in 2011. At the time, we were frustrated by slow, flaky Scala builds. The leading strategy for scaling was to hand each developer a RAM stick and a screwdriver... Surely this was a problem we could tackle with software! Thus Pants v1 was born. </p><p>Pants v1 was quite successful, and was adopted at cutting-edge tech companies such as Twitter, Foursquare, Square and others. But we still weren't satisfied: The APIs were clunkier than we would have liked, the UI was overly chatty, caching was hard to get right, and concurrent execution had to be special-cased. We knew there were plenty of performance and stability improvements to be had, if we could only unlock them. </p><p>We learned a lot from our years of work on Pants v1, and knew that we could design something new and better, leaning on our experience with v1 while addressing the drawbacks of that system. Luckily, at the same time as we began thinking about this hypothetical next system, a new motivating problem emerged: Python builds.</p><h2 id="python-builds-today">Python builds today</h2><p>As you probably know, Python has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Not only is it used to build a wide variety of server applications, via frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, but it's also the language of choice for data scientists, thanks to powerful libraries and tools such as <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>. </p><p>Python hits a sweet spot of simplicity and power, but there is a big problem - there is no truly great scalable build tool for Python, and this is becoming a real pain point as Python repos grow like never before. &nbsp;</p><p>Python builds today involve manually invoking a wide variety of tools. Each tool has to be installed, configured and invoked in just the right way, often while sequencing the output of one tool into input of another. Knowing how to use each tool in a given scenario is complicated and burdensome. </p><p>Sure, you can hack around the problem for a while with some combination of shell scripts, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">Makefiles</a>, <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tox</a>, and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. But even a small code change might require you to run a huge amount of sequential build work. Re-executing the same processes with the same inputs over and over again is a frustrating waste of time and resources. &nbsp;And these solutions start to break down as your codebase grows.</p><p>Perhaps you experimented with more complex build systems, such as <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or <a href="https://v1.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v1</a>. &nbsp;But it's laborious to maintain all that BUILD metadata, all for a sub-par experience not optimized for Python. Not to mention the difficulty of implementing your own custom build logic. </p><p>Alternatively, maybe you've been tempted to split up your codebase into multiple interdependent repos, each with their own "smaller" builds. But that creates an even thornier problem, namely how to manage those interdependencies. Having to propagate changes across codebase boundaries can slow development down to a crawl, and leave you with the worst of both worlds - slower processes and a fragmented, unmanageable codebase.</p><p>A great build system for repos - of all sizes - that include Python code would support fine-grained invalidation and caching, so that it only executes the build work actually affected by a change. It would support concurrent local and even remote execution, to greatly speed up work by using all available CPU. It would be easy to adopt in a small repo, but would scale up as your codebase grows. It wouldn't require huge amounts of boilerplate metadata, and it would be easy to extend with custom build logic. </p><p>Well, Pants v2 is that system! </p><h2 id="introducing-pants-v2">Introducing Pants v2</h2><p><a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/">Pants v2</a> is a completely new open-source build system, inspired by our work on Pants v1. &nbsp;We've been developing and testing it for the last couple of years, and it's finally ready for prime time!</p><p>A key factor in the design of Pants v2 was a set of lessons we learned from Pants v1 and other existing systems, such as Bazel. Among them: that ease of use and performance matter, boilerplate is annoying, concurrency and caching require hard design work, and most people will need custom logic at some point.</p><h3 id="lesson-1-ease-of-use-and-performance-both-matter">Lesson #1: Ease of use and performance both matter</h3><p>When designing software you often find yourself making tradeoffs between ease of use and performance. But in a build system, both are vital. The Pants v2 execution engine - which is the performance-critical heart of the system - is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, for raw speed. And the domain-specific build logic is written in familiar, easy to work with, type-annotated Python 3. This helps make Pants v2 easy to extend, without compromising performance. </p><p>Pants v2 also runs a daemon that memoizes fine-grained build state in memory, for even faster performance. This daemon watches for changes to your source files and precisely invalidates its state on the fly to ensure that the minimum amount of work happens the next time you build.</p><h3 id="lesson-2-writing-build-metadata-is-a-real-drag">Lesson #2: Writing build metadata is a real drag</h3><p>Some build tools are slow because they don't have enough information about the structure of your code to intelligently perform incremental work. Others have gone too far in the other direction, requiring a huge amount of metadata and boilerplate in BUILD files, especially relating to your code's dependencies. </p><p>Pants v2 offers the best of both worlds - intelligent, fine-grained incremental work, without the boilerplate. It does so by assuming sensible, magic-free defaults, inferring dependencies from the import statements in your code, and supporting plugins for custom inference logic. Stay tuned for an upcoming post on exactly how Pants achieves this!</p><h3 id="lesson-3-design-for-caching-concurrency-and-remoting">Lesson #3: Design for caching, concurrency and remoting </h3><p>Writing build logic that can be cached and executed concurrently and remotely is very hard. You have to be very careful about not producing or consuming side-effects, and it's extremely difficult to tack that on later. And unless you design your APIs with care, supporting these kinds of features often places severe restrictions on what your build logic may safely do. </p><p>In Pants v2, build logic is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure</a> Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">async coroutines</a>. So a build rule can depend not only on its inputs, but can also await on new data at runtime - all of which is precisely tracked for invalidation and caching. This gives us the best of both worlds: logic that is properly isolated from side-effects, and is therefore amenable to caching, concurrent execution and remoting, while still allowing the use of natural control flow.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pantsbuild.org/content/images/2020/10/caching.gif" alt=""><figcaption>We run both tests, then add a syntax error to one test and rerun; the unmodified test uses the cache and is isolated from the syntax error.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="lesson-4-almost-everyone-needs-to-customize-their-builds">Lesson #4: Almost everyone needs to customize their builds</h3><p>Most teams have custom build steps, so extensibility is a key feature in any build system. Pants v2 is built around a <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview">plugin architecture</a>. You can write your own rules using the same API as the built-in functionality. So your custom build logic will enjoy the same fine-grained invalidation, caching, concurrency and remote execution abilities as the core Pants code.</p><h2 id="pants-2-0-0-is-out-now-">Pants 2.0.0 is out now!</h2><p>All this leads me to the happy announcement that <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pantsbuild.pants/2.0.0/">Pants 2.0.0</a>, the first stable release of Pants v2, is out now! 2.0.0 is the culmination of years of design and development work, and many months of beta testing at several organizations. So we're really happy, proud (and relieved…) to finally have it ready for general use. </p><p>You can see what Python tools Pants currently supports <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python">here</a>. There are also commands for querying and understanding your dependency graph, and a robust help system. &nbsp;We're adding support for additional tools and features all the time, and it's straightforward to implement your own. Beta users have already written their own logic for Cython and docker, for example. </p><p>Now is a great time to adopt Pants 2.0.0! The team that developed Pants v2 is <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">ready to help you</a> onboard, answer any questions, and even pair with you to help you write any custom build logic. We're also eager to get feedback, bug reports and suggestions for what features we should focus on in the next weeks and months of development.</p><p>Pants v2 is developed by a helpful open source community, is funded by a 501(c)6 non-profit, and has excellent support available. If you have a growing Python codebase, and want to take Pants 2.0.0 for a spin, <a href="https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community">let us know</a>. We'd love to fit you with some new Pants today!</p>

</section><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="out-with-the-old-skills-in-with-the-new-skills">Out with the old skills, in with the new skills</h2><p>Programming-related jobs have high rates of skill turnover. Over time, the types of skills required by companies hiring software developers change more rapidly than any other profession.</p><p>To demonstrate this, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/4/1965/5858010">researchers</a> analyzed job postings on more than 40,000 online job boards and company websites between 2007 and 2019, controlling for employer, location, and occupation. They defined "new" skills as those that were rare or non-existent in 2007 but prevalent in 2019 and "old" skills as those that were prevalent in 2007 but rare or extinct in 2019.</p><ul><li>While only 30% of all job vacancies required at least one new skill by 2019, <strong>47% of computer and mathematical jobs required at least one new skill</strong> (i.e. a skill that was not common back in 2007)</li><li>This compares to <em>less than 20%</em> of jobs in fields like education, law, and community and social services</li><li>In addition, <strong>16% of jobs in computer and mathematical fields in 2007 required a skill that was obsolete by 2019</strong> (i.e. a skill that was common in 2007 but relatively rare in 2019), more than double any other job category:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/azDsA9n3rx.png"></figure><p>About a third of the change in required skills in computer-related occupations is due to specific new software:</p><ul><li>The fastest-growing software skills between 2007 and 2019 include <strong>Python, R, and Apache Hadoop</strong></li><li>Software that was popular in 2007 but effectively obsolete by 2019 includes QuarkXpress, ActionScript, Solaris, IBM Websphere, and Adobe Flash (ah, finally a name I recognize)</li></ul><p>Data science, machine learning, and AI saw big increases among technology-intensive jobs as well. For example, the number of STEM-related jobs requiring skills in machine learning and AI grew more than 4x from 2007-2017, touching more than 15% of STEM jobs:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/Pc3AjVflhW.png"></figure><p>To better compare rates of skill change across occupations, the researchers came up with a measure of skill change that tracks the absolute growth or decline of various skills within each profession from 2007 to 2019. Occupations whose required skills change rapidly in prevalence among job postings receive a high score, while jobs whose skills do not change much receive a lower score:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/xfeKvOWxo-.png"></figure><ul><li><strong>Computer-related occupations receive the highest score by far, 4.8</strong>. Note that the mean and standard deviation of this measure are ~3 and ~1 respectively, so computer-related jobs are <strong>nearly two standard deviations away from the typical job in America</strong></li><li>Meanwhile, jobs in education and and those involving manual labor have very low skill change scores, typically less than 2.</li></ul><p>We can get even more granular and look at specific job roles. This level of detail makes the difference even more stark (only showing the fastest changing roles):</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/OwoB5xsSdO.png"></figure><p>Web development has the highest rate of skill change <em>among all jobs in the country</em>. Next up are sales engineers, another often technical role. Database administrators, computer network architects, sysadmins, and application developers all make the top 10, and we see many other technical roles among the top 30. The mean and standard deviation are similar here, placing web development <strong>more than 3 standard deviations away from the typical job in America</strong> in terms of skill change over time.</p><p>Suffice to say, <strong>software development is a rapidly changing profession</strong>.</p><p>You might think, however, that skill change would eventually settle down as one becomes more experienced.</p><p><em>You'd be wrong.</em> The skills for software engineering jobs change rapidly throughout the entire career lifecycle:</p><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/7ItjXMaTE-.png"></figure><ul><li>In entry-level roles in computer and engineering occupations all the way through those requiring 12+ years of experience, <strong>the proportion of job postings requiring at least one new skill in 2019 was effectively the same, 40-45%</strong></li><li>In contrast, <strong>29% of entry-level non-computing and engineering roles in 2019 required at least one new skill, but this proportion declines to 24%</strong> for jobs requiring more than four years of experience</li></ul><blockquote>This means that experienced STEM workers seeking employment in 2019 are often required to possess skills that <strong>were not required</strong> when they entered the labor market in 2007 or earlier.</blockquote><p>Software engineers <strong>never</strong> escape the skill-change vortex, even many years into their careers. Experienced engineers must learn and adopt technologies that didn't even exist when they started out. Developers must constantly retool themselves, even well after their <a href="https://whoisnnamdi.com/college-degrees-software-engineers/">formal education</a> ends.</p><h2 id="nothing-s-changed-but-my-change"><a href="https://youtu.be/m1ERvlxgCD8?t=166">Nothing's changed but my change</a></h2><p><strong>College majors associated with faster changing jobs pay more early on.</strong></p><ul><li>In professions with one standard deviation increased skill change, pay is <strong>~30%</strong> higher in the first few years of one's career</li><li>If we exclude both the fastest and slowest-changing fields (Engineering/Computer Science at the high end, Health/Education at the low end), the early earnings premium for faster-changing roles increases to <strong>~60%</strong>:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/heMo13OsG1.png"></figure><p><strong>Fast-changing fields pay better.</strong></p><p>Notice however that the pay advantage declines over time. By the time one approaches the age of 50, the pay premium for working in rapidly changing fields falls dramatically to only 20-30% vs slower changing professions.</p><p>Here's another way to see the eroding pay advantage.

This phenomenon has less to do with one's field of study and more to do with <em>choice of occupation</em>.</p><p>To show this, researchers plotted the earnings premium of various categories workers relative to those with a non-Engineering/Computer Science major working in a non-Engineering/Computer Science job.</p><ul><li>Workers who major in Engineering or Computer Science but work in unrelated fields actually see their earnings advantage <em>compound</em> over time, rather than decline</li><li>On the other hand, regardless of major, individuals who work in Engineering or Computer Science jobs see their earnings advantage erode over the years:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2020/10/OFffH9kBKA.png"></figure><blockquote><strong>Declining relative returns is a feature of STEM jobs, not majors.</strong> The earnings premium for non-STEM majors in STEM occupations starts off near 40%, but declines to 20% within a decade.

A CS major who eschews the profession doesn't earn much more than otherwise similar non-CS majors early on, but eventually out-earns their peers by nearly 20%.</p><p>OK, that's enough about <em>what</em> is happening.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When we started work on the recently released feature <a href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/review-changes">Review Changes</a>, we needed a way to keep a significant part of the edit history of a document in the browser memory to be able to respond quickly to different user interface states. As the user picked various document versions to compare we wanted to be able to quickly reconstruct a specific section of the history of a document. </p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="false"></div></div><figcaption>Review Changes for Sanity Studio. Powered by Mendoza.</figcaption></figure><p>For text diffs, we use the <a href="https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch">diff-match-patch format</a>, and we just assumed someone would have implemented a similarly efficient and compact diff format for JSON documents, but no such luck. If we wanted a general JSON diff format that was super compact and fast to apply, we would have to invent it ourselves. And thus, Mendoza, the totally non-human readable diff format for structured JSON documents, was born.</p><p>Mendoza is:</p><ul><li>Lightweight JSON format</li><li>A flexible format that can accommodate more advanced encodings in the future</li><li>As a Go library for encoding and decoding</li><li>A JavaScript library for decoding</li><li>Efficient handling of the renaming of fields</li><li>Efficient handling of reordering of arrays</li><li>Not designed to be human-readable</li></ul><p>Mendoza differs (hah!) from normal diffs as they are:</p><ul><li>Made for humans to read and understand and based on simple operations (like keep, insert, and delete text)</li><li>Possible to apply even if the source has changed a bit by including some of the contexts around every part that has changed</li><li>Designed for text, and not structured documents</li></ul><p>Now, this is great when you are collaborating with humans on code development and use something like git to track your changes. What it isnâ€™t great for, however, is expressing differences between structured documents (such as JSON) in a compact manner that can be efficiently transferred over the network and parsed in JavaScript inside of browsers.</p><div data-block-key="27e85758c59a"><h2><a id="most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"></a><a href="#most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Most diffs aren't meant for machines</h2></div><p>Most diff formats are made to be human-readable.

The integers are <em>opcodes</em> (short for â€œoperation codesâ€�), 8-bit numbers that correspond to an operation. Opcodes take parameters as strings, positive numbers, or JSON values (that is: the actual data that is changing). The list of available opcodes is as follows, notice that 10-18 are composites of the preceding ones:</p><ul><li>0 <code>Value<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>1 <code>Copy<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>2 <code>Blank<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>3 <code>ReturnIntoArray<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>4 <code>ReturnIntoObject<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>5 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKey<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>6 <code>PushField<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>7 <code>PushElement<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>8 <code>PushParent<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>9 <code>Pop<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>10 <code>PushFieldCopy</code></li><li>11 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>12 <code>PushElementCopy</code></li><li>13 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>14 <code>ReturnIntoObjectPop</code></li><li>15 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKeyPop</code></li><li>16 <code>ReturnIntoArrayPop</code></li><li>17 <code>ObjectSetFieldValue</code></li><li>18 <code>ObjectCopyField</code></li><li>19 <code>ObjectDeleteField</code>â€‹ </li><li>20 <code>ArrayAppendValue</code>â€‹ </li><li>21 <code>ArrayAppendSlice<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>22 <code>StringAppendString<!-- -->â€‹</code></li></ul><p>Mendoza reads these opcodes from the patch and produces the resulting document from them. Depending on the patch, Mendoza might choose not to strictly follow the opcodes but take a simpler path. If every field and value has changed, for example, itâ€™s more efficient just to replace the whole document with the new data without going through all the operations. Or if you have a list of objects where one has moved to another position and changed a key-value, Mendoza will manage to go back to the original and represent the change in a cheap way.</p><p>Mendoza is implemented in Go and can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza">GitHub repository</a>. We have also made <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza-js">a parser for Mendoza patches in JavaScript</a>, that you can use in your own application. </p><p>Of course, you can dive into <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity/blob/a3f7158016d63728a9b435e6ab444ff2b90fd424/packages/%40sanity/desk-tool/src/panes/documentPane/documentHistory/history/timeline.ts#L421">the source code for the Sanity Studio</a> and explore how Mendoza is used there. If you want a slightly simpler use-case, you can also <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store/blob/main/src/patch.ts">check out how weâ€™re using Mendoza to simulate a part of Sanityâ€™s real-time datastore</a> in the browser to power the <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity">real-time preview for Next.js</a>. </p><p>Naming a project is always difficult. Since this project is focused on representing changes between <em>JSON</em> documents I naturally started thinking about names like "JSON differ, JSON changes, JSON patch, â€¦". However, most of these names have already been used by existing projects. While I was muttering "JSON, JSON, JSON" it suddenly turned into "JSON, JSON, Jason, Jason Mendoza".</p><p>Jason Mendoza is a character from the show The Good Place, and while this project has little in common with the stupidest DJ from Florida, at least it's short and catchy.</p><p>Since a Mendoza patch is just describing the effect of a change it is also limited to work for the documents it was based on. It doesnâ€™t come with guarantees for consistency if the document you apply it on has changed from the original in meanwhile. This is one of the tradeoffs that we needed to do to make it really compressed. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Deadlifting 337.5 lbs in my <a href="https://billmei.net/blog/gym-build">home gym</a>.</p>

<p>I wasted years failing at improving my health and fitness by following misguided “common sense” advice. I tried everything: P90X, cross-country running, bodybuilding, HIIT, swimming, BodBot, 2 types of yoga, CrossFit, rowing, personal training, F45, and cycling. None of them worked.</p>

<p>It seemed like everyone around me was getting results, but no matter how hard I tried, I wasn’t able to carry more things, attain a muscular physique, better outrun an emergency, or climb over a fence.</p>

<p>But after hundreds of hours of frustration and disappointment, I finally figured out what was preventing me from achieving the fitness results that I wanted.</p>

<p>I made 10 major mistakes by following “common sense” advice that hindered my progress for years. They are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#mistake-1-not-reasoning-from-first-principles">Not reasoning from first principles</a></li>

  <li><a href="#mistake-10-not-prioritizing-recovery">Not prioritizing recovery</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mistake-1-not-reasoning-from-first-principles">Mistake #1: Not reasoning from first principles</h2>

<h3 id="who">Who</h3>

<p>I learned that everyone’s body is different. A nutrition and exercise program that works for me may not work for you, or vice-versa. Our genetics, physiology, and lifestyles are not the same so do not read this article as “advice” for you. It is advice only for me.</p>

<p>For example, I use more extreme language than other articles on health and fitness, because I find it necessary to go “all or nothing” in forming habits, but this writing style may be counterproductive if it does not fit your predilection; e.g. I’ll say something like “If you miss a workout, you have to <em>start over from the beginning</em>”, and this is not technically true because you can make up for the workout later, but I need to be told that the stakes are much higher than they actually are to motivate myself to stay on track. I regret that nobody was ever this forceful with me. By being too forgiving they gave me an excuse to not take things as seriously as I should have. You may find this writing style off-putting, but I will remind you that this is written for me, not for you.</p>

<p>One way I wasted a lot of time in the beginning is assuming that other peoples’ advice can apply to me, but it can’t. What worked was to figure out what first principles apply to my situation, and then build up a strategy from there to solve my individual needs, and not copy or follow someone else’s advice from the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>Why are health and fitness important? Physical health is required to operate in the physical universe. It’s the wellspring from which all other actions depend. Therefore, to improve your cognition, mood, relationships, career, morals—work out.</p>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>

<p>Ground truth comes from physics. The irreducible first step is Force = Mass × Acceleration. This is an inviolable law of the universe. Force production is therefore the only objective performance metric. All other secondary goals (weight loss, flexibility, cardiovascular health, etc.) are therefore relevant only when they are on the critical path to improving force production.<sup id="fnref:critical-path" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:critical-path">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Maintaining health is expensive, and biological organisms do not spend more resources than marginally required by their environments, because any wasteful organism will be evolutionarily outcompeted by a more resource-conserving rival. Therefore, any increase in wellness must be proportional to a preceding increase in stress. This leads us to the second step, the <a href="#mistake-4-doing-exercise-instead-of-training">Stress Recovery Adaptation cycle</a> (SRA), which I will describe later. Any strategy that does not follow this is disallowed by biology.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-2-taking-action-instead-of-planning">Mistake #2: Taking action instead of planning</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important not to overthink things—just take action! You’ll figure it out as you go.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No plan survives contact with the enemy.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just Do It.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are all wrong. It turns out that planning is <em>really, really</em> important. I did not expect this, but having an appropriate plan <em>makes or breaks</em> your success.</p>

<p>Based on what I learned from entrepreneurship and the “Lean Startup Approach”, I assumed that a mediocre plan with great execution is better than a great plan with poor execution. This is not true for health and fitness.</p>

<p>A mediocre plan with great execution is not better than a great plan with poor execution. A mediocre plan with great execution achieves <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>Good planning is the difference between achieving all your goals, and achieving <em>nothing at all</em>. Action is irrelevant to outcome.</p>

<p>The problem with bad plans is that taking the <em>wrong</em> action gives you negative progress. “Just Do It” is harmful advice, because it gives you the illusion of progress while actually accomplishing nothing, or taking you in reverse.<sup id="fnref:reverse" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:reverse">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It took years for me to learn this because the vast majority of exercise programs are not good. It was only by luck that after years of trying many different programs I finally found one that worked. The probability that the average personal trainer you pick after walking into a random commercial gym can design the right program is effectively nil.</p>

<p>To understand why planning is more important than action, I have to explain four other mistakes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mistake #3: Not planning all the way until the end</li>
  <li>Mistake #4: Doing exercise instead of training</li>
  <li>Mistake #5: Listening to experts</li>
  <li>Mistake #6: Following a plan not designed for me</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mistake-3-not-planning-all-the-way-until-the-end">Mistake #3: Not planning all the way until the end</h3>

<p>Strenuous exercise is not required for success in modern civilization. Thus, the vast majority of people lack any adaptation to physical stress, with the result that even a tiny amount of exercise will produce results. This gives the misleading impression that exercise is “easy” because almost anything you do in the beginning will work; but “doing anything” eventually causes you to stall out very quickly when the early progress ends, you get frustrated, and then you quit.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://billmei.net/books/practical-programming-for-strength-training/">Practical Programming for Strength Training</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Virtually anything that makes a novice work harder than bed rest will produce positive results. As a result, many people have an erroneous impression of the quality of their training system. Single sets, multiple sets, high volume, high intensity, super slow, supersets, giant sets, gnarlmonster sets – quite literally anything resembling a training program will produce better results than no program at all in novice trainees. <strong>This is known as “the novice effect,” and must be considered when training this population.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what happened to me: I tried cross-country running which worked for a bit until it didn’t, then I got discouraged and quit. Then I tried P90X which also worked for a bit until it didn’t, then I got frustrated and quit. And so on ad infinitum.</p>

<p>After I understood the novice effect, I could see that the key to a successful fitness program is not about how effective it is for beginners, but about how effective it is for people at all skill levels from beginner to olympian.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-4-doing-exercise-instead-of-training">Mistake #4: Doing exercise instead of training</h3>

<p><em>Exercise</em> is about physical activity. Almost any strenuous physical action you take can be classified as <em>exercise</em>, no matter if it is helpful or harmful in the long term.<sup id="fnref:exercise-vs-training" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:exercise-vs-training">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Training</em> is about long-term goal-directed progress. It requires that you set an objective, measurable goal you can achieve (e.g. deadlift 200lbs, run 1 mile in under 20 minutes, finish 1st in my city’s tennis tournament). If an external observer cannot unambiguously say whether you succeeded or failed at your goal<sup id="fnref:failure" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:failure">4</a></sup>, then you also cannot tell whether your day-to-day actions are beneficial or harmful to your long-term goal, hence this is not <em>training</em>.<sup id="fnref:fire-your-trainer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fire-your-trainer">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The reason for this distinction is the biological first-principle that determines whether you will succeed or fail in the long-term: the <strong>Stress Recovery Adaptation cycle</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/815fe3b43867cf07a9398a20126ed188b57f3071/be6bc/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-primary.png" alt="One iteration of the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Performing exercise creates stress on the body, which diminishes your biological capabilities for a short time. As you eat and sleep, your body repairs itself during recovery, plus some additional extra capacity (adaptation) to handle future stress."></p>

<p>x and y axes exaggerated for emphasis in all of these graphs.</p>

<p>Performing <em>exercise</em> creates <em>stress</em> on the body, which diminishes your biological capabilities for a short time. As you eat and sleep, your body repairs itself during <em>recovery</em>, plus some additional extra capacity (<em>adaptation</em>) to handle future stress.</p>

<p>The stress is an external signal to your body that your environment must be more dangerous than it previously assumed, so your body tries to adapt to enable you to have a better chance of staying alive going forward.</p>

<p>Doing a workout that isn’t any harder than what you did before does not lead to additional adaptation, because you didn’t signal to your body that your environment is more dangerous than it previously assumed:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e279ba0e443b829d621c6490a4f5d66e69e78fa1/85ff1/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-not-enough.png" alt="Undertraining in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Insufficient stress creates a small drop in performance, but when you recover there is no additional adaptation above baseline. Hence, there is no performance improvement."></p>

<p>Biological organisms do not spend more resources than marginally required by their environments, because any wasteful organism will be evolutionarily outcompeted by a more resource-conserving rival. Thus, a lack of stress is a signal to your body that your environment must be safer than it previously assumed, so your body tries to conserve resources by decreasing its athletic capability:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/336a6ad7d7c8eefa02ca3dab85b92e046704afb9/ee30a/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-atrophy.png" alt="Atrophy in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. When you skip a workout, no stress is applied, and performance slowly diminishes below baseline because your muscles atrophy. The result is a decrease in performance."></p>

<p>Conversely, too much stress that exceeds your body’s ability to recover will just result in your cells breaking down without being properly repaired:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1fd88d0c95cbd5f093e41cdd5ac7628b54b9a72a/151b4/assets/blog/img/fitness_sra-too-much.png" alt="Overtraining in the Stress Recovery Adaptation (SRA) cycle. Too much stress creates a sharp performance drop-off that can't be recovered from properly. This leads to performance to revert to a level smaller than your original baseline, and hence is a performance decline."></p>

<p>Thus, the key to effective <em>training</em> is to carefully tune the amount of stress per <em>exercise</em> into the “Goldilocks zone” where you receive just enough stress to trigger an adaptation response, but not too much stress that you can’t recover, and not too little stress where you don’t trigger any adaptation response.</p>

<p>If you repeat this over a long time horizon, you get this classic (but incorrect!) graph that everyone draws, which you’ll see if you google this topic:</p>

Just as you recover to a higher baseline, you perform another workout to apply additional stress, and in order to move your fitness baseline even higher"></p>

<p>There is a key mistake made by everyone else who draws this graph. The big problem with the above diagram is that once you’ve adapted to a higher baseline, a larger amount of stress is required to trigger further adaptation!</p>

<p>Trying to exert the same stress on a higher baseline does not trigger adaptation, because your body has gotten used to it and the stress …</p></article></div>

<p>Our friends over at ICmasters have delved into the package of the Apple A14 Bionic. The die size has been unmasked, and it stands in at 88mm<sup>2</sup>. Despite cramming in 11.8 billion transistors, the die size is incredibly small thanks to utilization of TSMC’s 5nm process node.</p>

<p>The march of progress is not all rosy. Apple’s chips have historically achieved 90%+ of the process node’s theoretical density in their processors. This generation stands out by missing that mark by a large amount. A14 comes in at a cool 78% effective transistor density when compared to theoretical density. Despite TSMC claiming a 1.8x shrink for N5, Apple only achieves a 1.49x shrink.</p>

<p>This is not due to a failure of TSMC or Apple. These companies are clear leaders for the manufacturing and design of semiconductors respectively. Instead, this failure to convert theoretical to effective density stems from the slow death of SRAM scaling. SRAM is extensively used throughout a processor from registers to caches. Geoffrey Yeap of TSMC claims that the typical mobile SoC which consists of 60% logic, 30% SRAM, and 10% analog/IO.</p>

<p>TSMC’s N5 node diverges from prior shrinks by showing signs of slowing SRAM scaling. Despite being a full shrink with logic, the SRAM is a 1.35x shrink. This figure is overstated as it will end up being even lower once other the other assist circuitry is accounted for. Hence TSMC’s guidance of chip area reduction at 35%-40% with N5. SemiAnalysis expects this to be a trend that will persist with new nodes. TSMC and Samsung are already demonstrating 3D stacked SRAM which will help alleviate the issue of density.</p>

<p>3D Stacking is not the silver bullet. Cost scaling has begun slowing dramatically. With TSMC N5 wafer pricing in the ~$17k range, it is clear cost per transistor has not fallen. Even if SRAM scaling kept up, the cost per transistor would still have remained flat from N7 to N5.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Serious defects happen, despite the best efforts of QA departments. Here’s what you can learn from real world screw-ups, so you can avoid making the same mistakes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Accidents in software development and testing have brought headlines ranging from hilarious to horrific. Back in 2013, for example, millions of PayPal users were tickled to learn that the long-standing online payment system had erroneously awarded more than $92 quadrillion – yes, <em>quadrillion</em> – to another user. Yet software mishaps have also been blamed for devastating incursions into credit rating services, massive billing mistakes by health insurers, and tragically, even fatal airplane crashes.</p>
<p>The rise of <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-mobile-testing-gotchas-you-need-to-know-about/">mobile devices and software apps</a> has also helped to bring software issues more out into public view. On sites like Apple’s App Store and Google Play, consumers rate mobile apps and sometimes leave bug reports, thereby themselves participating in software testing, albeit after the app has already seen the proverbial light of day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/3-lessons-from-big-software-failures/">Software testing accidents happen</a> all the time, and most go unheralded except by company managers, software developers and testers, and any end users directly impacted.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, companies are tightlipped about the causes of software flaws, even when the error gains public attention. If you’ve kept up with the progress of any mobile apps in online stores, you’ll see that a bug related to this-or-that was fixed in a subsequent release, although nobody would tell you why the bug got there or why it wasn’t eradicated earlier through the company’s quality assurance testing<em>.</em></p>
<p>If you’re a software developer or tester, you already know that bugs can slip through the cracks at any of the manifold stages of software testing. There can’t be a tech person on Earth, however, who’s experienced every single sort of software disaster.</p>
<p>Here are five tips gleaned from lessons learned by seasoned testers and developers, along with the nitty-gritty details on real-life examples of software projects gone awry. Let’s take the positive approach here, with the useful takeaways, rather than indulge wholly in schadenfreude.</p>
<h3>Tip #1: Enforce a culture of testing at every level</h3>
<p>“Software testing is not foolproof by any means. Apple, Microsoft, Zoom, and almost any company with an app in an app store keeps releasing updates with fixes to holes and flaws in both functionality and security,” maintains David Galownia, CEO of the <a href="https://www.slingshotsoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slingshot</a> software and app development firm.</p>
<p>“Even when companies have rigorous testing processes, problems can slip through anyway,” Galownia adds. “You’re talking hundreds of thousands of lines of code and untold numbers of different ways users can use the software. It’s impossible to test them all.”</p>
<p>If a software error is relatively innocuous and rarely evident, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/improve-your-debugging-strategies/">chasing it down through testing</a> can be a highly frustrating experience, anyhow. Galownia recalls a time early in his company’s history when testers kept trying, again and again, to discover the cause of a bug in a client’s software.</p>
<p>“For a long time, we couldn’t duplicate the bug no matter what we did. We tested every scenario we could think of, tested with multiple browsers, and put multiple eyes on it,” Galownia remembers. “When we eventually did stumble on to the cause of the error, we found it happened during a unique series in which the user went forward exactly seven steps in a process, then went back exactly four steps using the backspace button, and then went forward clicking something else. Once we finally found that out, it was an easy fix.”</p>
<p>Due to all the potential complexities involved, the CEO recommends “enforcing a culture of testing at every level.”&nbsp; Testing should start with “developers testing their own code and only saying they’re done when they themselves believe they have no bugs,” &nbsp;Galownia elaborates.</p>
<p>“Ideally, at that point a QA analyst is testing, but project and product managers should also test. Designers even should test and finally the client or end users should test in an alpha or beta setting,” Galownia says. The key is to have multiple different types of people who come at your software at different angles.</p>
<h3>Tip #2: Negotiate test deadlines</h3>
<p>We don’t live in an ideal world, though. All too often, projects aren’t given as much time for testing as developers and testers think they need.</p>
<p>In one particularly egregious case, a major statewide health insurance company expanded a new software system before it was ready to go full scale. As a result, more than <a href="https://www.ciklum.com/da/blog/5-famous-software-glitches-which-could-be-avoided-with-good-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">25,000 customers were enrolled</a> in the wrong health care plans; the knowledge became public when a<a href="https://abc11.com/system-failure-blue-bross-shield-health-insurance/1158471/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> company whistleblower</a> approached a local TV network affiliate. Documents suggested that the insurance company management were aware of technical issues and testing delays for months, but they got impatient and deployed the software anyway.</p>
<p>Alan Zucker, founding principal at <a href="https://pmessentials.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Management Essentials</a>, once grappled with his own time crunch. He was managing the development of a specialized accounting program that integrated the processing of a dozen applications.</p>
<p>The accounting program Zucker worked on required the building of a processing hub that received and shared information with the other applications. The accounting process was executed daily, weekly, and monthly with specific timing requirements.</p>
<p>“Our project timeline was very short because the company needed to quickly enable this capability,” Zucker says. “We did not have time to run an end-to-end monthly test that would allow us to replicate the process. So we created a testing strategy where we simulated the processing cycle.&nbsp; Rather than having the process triggers execute based on the cycle clock, we manually executed the workflow.”</p>
<p>So far, so good. In test, everything worked fine. But executing the cycle the first time in production turned out to be a different matter. “Everything fell apart. In order to have the information loaded the application and available to the accountants by 8:00 a.m. the process first process executed at midnight and the second process kicked off at 2:00 a.m. Well, the first process did not take 30 minutes as expected. It took over two hours to complete,” Zucker recalls.</p>
<p>“The cascading impacts were disastrous,” Zucker says. “We had to take the application out of production and start over. We made the decision to execute a full end-to-end test simulating the actual daily, weekly, and monthly processing cycles.&nbsp; We spent nearly two months fixing the bugs and retesting the application suite.”</p>
<p>Zucker learned three lessons from this debacle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a robust and well considered testing strategy early in the project is essential when building a complicated system;</li>
<li>Simulating a process cycle using test data is a not a substitute for real end-to-end testing;</li>
<li>Compressing project schedules to meet externally mandated timelines can be disastrous. Project managers need to negotiate deadlines and expectations with their project sponsors.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tip #3: Users come first</h3>
<p>Software problems are often caused by not enough testing, agrees David (Grue) DeBry, CTO and co-founder at web startup company <a href="https://www.volleyapp.com/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volley</a>. Yet the opposite problem – too much testing – can lead to needless product delays.</p>
<p>Culprits behind excessive testing are often “code cowboys,” or “engineers going off the rails by throwing out code,” says DeBry, whose 20 years of industry experience also includes visual effects development for a string of Hollywood movies.</p>
<p>The “code cowboys” can become so driven by their own needs for meeting defined engineering processes that they lose sight of why the software is being developed in the first place.</p>
<p>“Unit tests. Smoke tests. Regression tests. The list goes on,” DeBry says. “There’s constant feature improvement. You’re unable to move forward, and testing can cause other things to happen.”</p>
<p>When in “cowboy mode,” engineers try to eliminate <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/introduction-to-the-technical-debt-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technical debt</a>, or what results when software teams expedite the delivery of a piece of functionality or a project which later needs to be refactored. In other words, they balk at prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code. Cowboys want “to “pay back the tech debt now,” according to DeBry.</p>
<p>Yet teams should instead focus on the people who will use the software, DeBry maintains. “Users are humans, and engineers maybe not so much. You don’t just write code. Efforts need to be organized around what to test and where. What’s important to do? What are the users’ priorities? There’s the argument that you don’t spend time testing for something if the user doesn’t care about it.”</p>
<h3>Tip #4: Don’t neglect the negative</h3>
<p>“Only testers who do nothing make no mistakes,” echoes Bartek Nowakowski, test lead at career website <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-positive-testing-and-negative-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zety,</a> “When testing big apps there are a lot of connections between functionalities, so it is easy to miss some of them.”</p>
<p>Zety has run into complications by not performing negative testing, a form of testing that checks to find out how software will behave under unexpected circumstances, such as if a user types letters instead of numbers into a phone number field.</p>
<p>“So even if functionality works as intended there can be circumstances in which incorrect or unpredicted user behavior creates an edge case situation,” says Nowakowski. “These can occur for months before someone realizes there’s an issue.”</p>
<h3>Tip #5: Doing live testing? Warn your users!</h3>
<p>A variety of industry best practices can and do get overlooked in the heat of the moment during a software crisis.</p>
<p>“After some changes to our database, we wanted to test the new elements. Unfortunately, there was an error that severed the connection between the backend and frontend,” says Reuben Yonatan, CEO of <a href="https://www.getvoip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GetVoIP</a>. “We couldn’t connect to the database. It took a while, but our IT team found the bug and fixed it. However, we suffered disruption to our services.”</p>
<p>To GetVoIP, the incident underscored the need to always be prepared with a backup when running a software test. “That way, if something …</p></div></div>

October 27, 2020 | https://ish-ar.io/tutorial-go-git/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ish-ar.io/tutorial-go-git/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Tutorial introduction and requirements</h2>
<p>Today’s article is a tutorial on how set up and use the go-git library to clone and update a repository with an in-memory filesystem.<br>
This procedure is quite useful if you want to push against or clone a repository without touching the OS filesystem and deal with permissions or temporary files.<br>
Albeit, there’s documentation about git-go, I find it not really clear and sometimes misleading due to the different versions and names of the library.<br>
For this reason, I’ve decided to share this tutorial, and hopefully will be helpful to someone.<br>
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will do everything inside a main.go file, however you might want something more sofisticated for your use case :)</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An https Git repository (Github, Bitbucket doesn’t really matter as long as it’s accessible via https.)</li>
<li>Go installed and configured.</li>
<li>Basic Knowledge of Go.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up the In-Memory Filesystem</h2>
<p>To set up the in-memory filesystem, we will use two packages storage and memfs.
The storer will contain the objects, references and other metadata (normally what the directory <code>.git</code> would do).<br>
The memfs filesystem will be our filesystem to read, create, remove any kind of file in our repository.<br>
First step, we need to create the two objects (the storer and the filesystem).</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>package main

import (
        "fmt"

        billy "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5"
        memfs "github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/memfs"
        git "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5"
        http "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing/transport/http"
        memory "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/storage/memory"
)

var storer *memory.Storage
var fs billy.Filesystem

func main() {
        storer = memory.NewStorage()
        fs = memfs.New()

...</code></pre></div>
<h2>Setting up Git objects and Clone the repo</h2>
<p>Second step, in order to have our repository in the in-memory filesystem, we need to <strong>clone</strong> it and create the <strong>worktree</strong> object.<br>
The function <code>Clone()</code> will also return the Repository interface that we will then use to <code>Push()</code> to the remote.<br>
The method <code>Worktree()</code> will return the Worktree object that we will need to <code>Add()</code> &amp; <code>Commit()</code> our changes.<br>
Finally, if our repository is private, we would need to set up the basic authentication to clone it (We need the basic authentication to push anyway so better to set up it here!).</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        // Authentication
        auth := &amp;http.BasicAuth{
                Username: "your-git-user",
                Password: "your-git-pass",
        }

        repository := "https://github.com/your-org/your-repo"
        r, err := git.Clone(storer, fs, &amp;git.CloneOptions{
                URL:  repository,
                Auth: auth,
        })
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("%v", err)
                return
        }
        fmt.Println("Repository cloned")

        w, err := r.Worktree()
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("%v", err)
                return
        }</code></pre></div>
<h2>Create and commit your files</h2>
<p>Now, will we use the <code>fs</code> object to create an actual file, add &amp; commit it to the Worktree().</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, the repository is always cloned into <code>"/"</code>. </li>
<li>For some reason (unknown to me), if the filename starts with ”/” it will create a folder and not a file.<br>E.g.: /hello/world.txt (world.txt would be a directory) hello/world.txt (world.txt would be a file inside the folder hello)</li>
</ul>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        // Create new file
        filePath := "my-new-ififif.txt"
        newFile, err := fs.Create(filePath)
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        newFile.Write([]byte("My new file"))
        newFile.Close()

        // Run git status before adding the file to the worktree
        fmt.Println(w.Status())

        // git add $filePath
        w.Add(filePath)

        // Run git status after the file has been added adding to the worktree
        fmt.Println(w.Status())

        // git commit -m $message
        w.Commit("Added my new file", &amp;git.CommitOptions{})</code></pre></div>
<h2>Push and check errors</h2>
<p>The Push() will be performed using the method of the Repository interface as shown below.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>...

        //Push the code to the remote
        err = r.Push(&amp;git.PushOptions{
                RemoteName: "origin",
                Auth:       auth,
        })
        if err != nil {
                return
        }
        fmt.Println("Remote updated.", filePath)
        return
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Our final main.go would look like this: <a href="https://github.com/ish-xyz/ish-ar.io-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial-go-git/main.go">https://github.com/ish-xyz/ish-ar.io-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial-go-git/main.go</a></p>
<h2>Install and run our module</h2>
<p>Let’s try our new go module. Run the following commands:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>go mod init
go build
go run main.go

    Repository cloned
    ?? my-new-file.txt
    &lt;nil&gt;
    A  my-new-file.txt
    &lt;nil&gt;
    Remote updated. my-new-file.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>I know this is quite a specific topic, but I hope this tutorial will help someone!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infrastructure as code has been an important practice of DevOps for years.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone running an Apache Kafka data infrastructure and running on Kubernetes, the chances are you’ve probably nailed defining your infrastructure this way.</p><p>If you’re running on Kubernetes, you’re likely using operators as part of your CI/CD toolchain to automate your deployments.&nbsp;</p><p>Adopting GitOps is natural evolution, whereby the state of your landscape is managed in Git (or any code repo) with automation systems ensuring the state of a deployment remains consistent with the repo.</p><p>Where we’ve seen a particular lack of maturity and best practices is in managing the application landscape of flows and microservices on technologies such as Kafka and Kubernetes.</p><p>GitOps is increasingly playing a big part of DataOps. DataOps promotes the accelerated delivery of data products through decentralized data governance, automation, self-service and lowering the skills required to operate data. GitOps brings standardization, governance and automation.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a subject we’ve spoken about at a few events recently including at Kafka Summit this year and on DevOps.com:</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJygfiN-RR8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>What Kafka with GitOps should look like</h2><p>
When looking to automate real-time applications following DataOps, we need to be thinking about more than automating the app deployment. We need to define the correct data governance controls as part of the software delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>This means avoiding blind releasing apps where governance is an afterthought.&nbsp;</p><p>Lack of good governance will reduce the accessibility and trust in data and reduce the confidence to use the data downstream. Governance should cover the accessibility, availability, quality, integrity and confidentiality of the data.&nbsp;</p><p>We want the creator of the App, who best understands the data to be able to define the governance controls as a single package and then have it reviewed by a standard workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Example: A data analyst builds their own data-processing application, but they also define the governance and compliance controls required to release it.

Lenses provide a full experience for data practitioners (developers, analysts, even business users) to build real-time applications deploying on a Kafka &amp; Kubernetes data platform by ensuring all data is catalogued, made accessible and explorable.&nbsp;</p><p>The<a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.0/tools/cli/"> Lenses CLI client</a> allows your “data landscape” to be exported as declarative

and best maintain a consistent state</h2><p>
Here’s where there are a few different methods that are commonly adopted.&nbsp;</p><h3>Push Methods</h3><p>This is the method we see most organizations adopt. Teams will push to Git which will trigger a deploy pipeline in any CI/CD (such as Jenkins) using various APIs in Kafka, Kafka Connect, Kubernetes or wherever you’re running your applications. It also makes it difficult for Jenkins to monitor the desired state and ensure consistency with Git.</p><p>Of course you also need to open up the firewall to allow Jenkins into your data platform.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/74tcs9DG4E3jGe7mk34fku/3a4d4d3bd393f1de19d92d0f659ad9ff/GetYourGitOps_Pushing.png" alt="Traditional CI/CD push for Kafka automation"></p><h4>K8 Operator for Kafka</h4><p>You can use a Kubernetes operator to push the desired state. Jenkins or your CI/CD tool still needs to penetrate the data platform environment, however, which may increase security risk. Then you can use a Kubernetes operator (such as Strimzi’s) to monitor the desired state and apply the state to Kafka via APIs. This method is often used to operate the Kafka infrastructure, scale up Brokers etc. rather than to operate at the data layer (Topics, ACLs etc.)</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/47dnPqN0cGXI46XbqGx9gg/25f72efd0b1a927661c5dd0359e9916c/GetYourGitOps_K8s.png" alt="Traditional Kubernetes operator for GitOps"></p><h3>Pull Methods</h3><p>Pull methods are still based on an operator pattern, but through watching Git rather than watching Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p><p>This allows the pattern to work independently of using Kubernetes. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/RrcOkBDI9jgcm4KXBL9ca/73f4b286f539b47886b4854803fd7917/gitops_graffic_lenses_operator.png" alt="Lenses Operator for GitOps"></p><p>The operator is a Lenses operator which can run either inside or outside your data platform.&nbsp; The operator speaks with Lenses which applies the desired state to the data platform including any real-time applications. So for example for anyone using <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/Why-new-Streaming-SQL-opens-up-data-platform/">Lenses Streaming SQL</a>, this would deploy the application over Kubernetes.&nbsp;</p><p>The desired state of course would have been created within a separate Lenses environment and exported as config with the CLI before being pushed into Git.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefit of this pull deployment approach is it provides a more secure environment by not needing your CI/CD to access your infrastructure, it also ensures your applications are secured, governed and audited in Git with the state actively monitored and the ability to rollback at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>You can practice GitOps in the free </b><a href="https://lenses.io/box/">Kafka+Lenses docker developer Box </a><b>now.&nbsp; If you’re interested in an early access to the Lenses Operator: get in touch with us now</b><a href="https://lenses.io/contact-us/"> by form</a><b> or via </b><a target="_blank" href="https://launchpass.com/lensesio">Slack.</a><b> </b></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Organizations that operate microservices/service-oriented architecture face a variety of technical and people related problems. Over the past few years, companies have been migrating massive monolithic applications into smaller microservices (think services that do one thing, like <em>archive a pdf</em>) or even service oriented architectures (e.g. service-per-domain, <em>payments, billing, auth</em>).</p><p>There are undoubtedly many issues that come from monolithic architectures: easy to tightly couple domains and data, slower deployment process, and long test runs to name a few. Breaking the monolith can seem like a panacea for these issues. An SOA can provide team level ownership of domains and their systems, data is decoupled, and features/fixes can be deployed separately. Unfortunately, a SOA comes with its own set of issues.</p><p>Monoliths have been around for a while. There's a lot that's been written about "taming the monolith". As we get to work building Cortex, we've been talking to engineers about their experiences dealing with microservice architectures. Here's some things we've learned about taming your microservices.</p><p>A monolith, for all its warts, is simple to reason about. There are no network calls. There's no overhead to calling a function elsewhere in the codebase. If you're using a typed language, you can catch API changes at compile time. All the code is in one place – if you're so inclined, you can easily peek under the hood.</p><p>An SOA brings with it a suite of technical challenges, including operational complexity and performance hits. You now have to think about:</p><ul role="list"><li>Network latency</li><li>API versioning - what if the payments team makes a breaking change to its API without notifying me?</li><li>Network issues - what happens if I don't receive confirmation that the payment went through?</li><li>Change management/releases - when an issue occurs</li></ul><p>Yet, these technical challenges are the least of your worries.</p><h2>PEBCAK - Problem exists between chair and keyboard</h2><p>While it may sound strange to think that cultural and people problems are a significant challenge stemming from architectural choices, keep in mind that most organizations move to an SOA to scale their team, not their software.</p><p><strong>Distributing ownership of domains, data, and release cadence across services and teams can increase the velocity of your engineering org.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, distributing ownership does just that - teams start diverging in their operational procedures, documentation practices, and more. As an organization scales, this can wreak havoc on productivity, and ultimately bring your velocity back to square one.</p><p>People, process, and cultural issues around service oriented architectures have far reaching consequences:</p><ul role="list"><li>Ramping up engineers becomes costly - each team maintains their own processes. An engineer moving between teams may have to learn as much as a brand new hire.</li><li>Operational triage takes longer - tribal knowledge dissipates as an organization grows, making it harder to answer questions such as: what services exist, what they do, and who owns them</li><li>Communication overhead between teams - oversharing information is noisy, undersharing (e.g. when making API changes) can, in the worst case, cause outages or functionality issues and directly impact the bottom line</li></ul><p>Looking to scale your team? It's time to start thinking these challenges and how you can counter them.</p><p>There's no silver bullet to solve these problems. No combination of tools or processes can protect you. However, prevention really is better than the cure.</p><p>Think of it like a flu shot - you know its flu season, getting the flu sucks, and even though you may still get the flu, you'll never regret setting yourself up for success.</p><h2>Spec first design</h2><p>An excellent habit to promote is thinking about APIs and data models before jumping into the implementation.</p><h3>API Design</h3><p>It's important to ensure your SOA doesn't turn into a <em>distributed monolith</em>.</p><p>Signs of a distributed monolith:</p><ul role="list"><li>No separation of concerns</li><li>Shared databases and data models</li><li>Releasing one service requires coordination of deploys across multiple other services</li><li>Consuming a service's APIs requires knowledge about its data models, side effects, etc</li></ul><p>One way to prevent this is following the Amazon model - APIs are the only way teams communicate. This means that a service owner should:</p><ul role="list"><li>Think about their API request/responses <strong>before implementation</strong></li><li><strong>Share the API for review</strong> so that use cases for dependents are well covered</li><li><strong>Communicate API changes</strong> ahead of time</li><li><strong>Version their APIs</strong> to maintain backwards compatibility</li></ul><p>This workflow provides additional benefits when used in conjunction with tooling, such as OpenAPI or gRPC. If schemas and APIs are designed ahead of time, you can use:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Code gen</strong> for clients across different languages</li><li>Catch breaking changes to your API at <strong>build time</strong></li><li>Use your code review process to loop in the right stakeholders <em>before a change is released</em></li><li><strong>Contract testing</strong> to ensure you don't go out of compliance with your predetermined schema</li></ul><figure id="w-node-9def8f3c3ff0-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f3387ce026d1c67c8e6_JqjXbRYzUWfOUOAN.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Atlassian is an example of successfully using spec-first API design to improve their development lifecycle. I found <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/technology/spec-first-api-development"><strong>https://www.atlassian.com/blog/technology/spec-first-api-development</strong></a> to be an excellent overview of using OpenAPI as the tooling to enable spec-first development.</p><h3>Data models</h3><p>The breaking point for a monolith is when multiple teams start depending on the same data models across domains. This slows down the development cadence across the org and the resulting spaghetti data models make it exponentially more difficult to reason about the code base.</p><p>It's easy to go down the same route in an SOA as well. There are some habits that help prevent this nightmare:</p><ul role="list"><li>Separate data stores for each service</li><li>Thinking carefully about data models and links before implementing APIs</li><li>Reducing dependencies at the data level between services - for example, store reference IDs to resources in a different service, and fetch data through their API</li><li>Ensuring stakeholders (business, developers, service consumers) don't build tooling directly on your data. This locks in your data model and prevents you from iterating as a service owner. Instead, expose data (with its own contract) through APIs or analytical data streams.</li></ul><h2>Standardization of platform/process</h2><p>There's one obvious solution to "each team doing things their own way" - make it easy for teams to do things in a standardized way.</p><p>Atlassian, for example, has built out an internal PaaS that is essentially a thin wrapper around AWS. By doing so, developers are provisioned their desired resources but the platform automatically augments it with standard monitoring, logging, and more.</p><p>Well designed tooling that provides a standard way of doing things speeds up developer velocity and makes sure teams are working in consistent ways.</p><p>This even extends to documentation. Spotify and Atlassian have built internal tooling that standardizes information discovery around their microservices. System-Z at Spotify and <a href="https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/why-atlassian-uses-an-internal-paas-to-regulate-aws-access/"><strong>Microscope at Atlassian</strong></a> provide a source of truth for details about each service, such as system ownership, links to documentation/runbooks, and recent deploys. What makes them even more powerful is that they are the entrypoint into further information about services – on-call rotations, links to monitoring dashboards, logging, etc.</p><figure id="w-node-a1aa57605d7f-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f37ddc5afe80353230b_vpQZUjpsspzaKCVQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This kind of standardization of information improves engineering ramp up time and operational efficiency - all services are operated in the same way and developers have a single source to look for critical information about their services.</p><p>Many organizations end up building an internal service registry for humans after the problem has gotten out of hand – too many services, growing teams and turnover, remote developers, etc.</p><p>Cortex provides a standard, opinionated way to organize information about all of your services and enables functionality such as:</p><ul role="list"><li>A dashboard to answer questions such as "what services exist?", "who owns this service?", "where are the runbooks for this service?"</li><li>An audit report that shows you the health of your services: does every service have an owner, an oncall rotation, etc.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-66b03bd1403c-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5ecd2f3276ebd32f1e32f034_YyoCvebvNYItDndV.png" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>Integrations with third party tools - for example, when Pagerduty triggers an alert, Cortex can send a slack message with information about the service such as ownership, latest commits from github, latest deploys, and more.</li></ul><p>Reach out to us on our home page to request a demo, we'd love to show you what we've built and help prevent some of the headaches that come with a service oriented architecture.

<p><code>dry-python/returns@0.15</code> is <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/releases/tag/0.15.0">released</a>! And it means that now anyone can use our Higher Kinded Types emulation in their projects.</p>

<p>In this post I will explain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What Higher Kinded Types (HKTs) are and why they are useful</li>
  <li>How they are implemented and what limitations there are</li>
  <li>How can you use them in your own projects</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, let’s talk about typing!</p>


      <h2 id="simple-types">
        
        <a href="#simple-types">Simple types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Typing is layered. Like a good cake. There are at least three layers that we are going to cover.</p>

<p>Simple (or flat) typing, like <code>x: int = 1</code>. This allows us to express simple types and their transformations. Like <code>int -&gt; str</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A lot of languages like <code>go</code> and <code>php</code> do not go beyond this line. And they still work pretty well! These types are also sometimes called <code>*</code>-kinded. It can be understood as “a place for just a single type argument”.</p>


    
      <h2 id="generic">
        
        <a href="#generic">Generic</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Generic level is required to express “nested” types. For example, you have a list of integers. In Python we annotate it as <code>List[int]</code> or <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/"><code>list[int]</code></a> in Python <code>3.9</code>. This allows us to have types with other types as arguments. <code>List</code> can receive <code>int</code> or <code>str</code> or even another <code>List</code> as the type argument. This way we can nest type and types start to have their own structure.</p>

<p>Generics are much more interesting than simple types. And they can have multiple type arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>List has one: for values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>List -&gt; T = List[T]</code></li>
  <li>Dict has two: for keys and values, so it has a kind of <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. It can be understood as a type transformation <code>Dict -&gt; K -&gt; V = Dict[K, V]</code></li>
  <li>And so on!</li>
</ul>

<p>This would be very helpful for us in the future, I promise.</p>

<p>We can also write transformations for generic types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_list_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, that is where things begin to be quite complicated.</p>

<p>How can this function work with other iterables like <code>set</code>, <code>frozenset</code>, <code>tuple</code>?
We can express this in Python as easy as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the typing part would be quite challenging. Let’s try several things.</p>


    
      <h3 id="common-interface">
        
        <a href="#common-interface">Common interface</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>The first obvious thing to try is <code>Iterable</code> protocol. It is builtin into Python and does what we need.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Iterable</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try it out:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>}))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span>#  Revealed type is 'typing.Iterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that a part of our typing information is lost. We pass <code>List</code> or <code>Set</code> or <code>Tuple</code> and always get the <code>Iterable</code> back.</p>

<p>Sometimes - this is ok. But, in some cases, this is not enough. Let’s try some other technique!</p>


    
      <h3 id="methods">
        
        <a href="#methods">Methods</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>One can say: we are all using Object-Oriented Programming! Why cannot we just create a new method for each type we need? And specify the exact return type there!</p>

<p>Well, it is a possible solution. But, there are some reasonable problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot add methods to existing types and extend them with this approach. Only create new ones, probably via subtyping, and add new methods there. In our example you would have to create your own versions of <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, and <code>Tuple</code>. Which is not desirable in most situations</li>
  <li>It really starts to be messy if you have a lot of methods to add. A type with more than <code>X</code> (choose the number yourself) methods starts to be really complex to read, understand, and use. Instead, using separate functions is much easier, because we don’t have to put everything into a single namespace</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try something else.</p>


    
      <h3 id="overloads">
        
        <a href="#overloads">overloads</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Another solution that might solve our problem is using the <code>@overload</code> decorator with proper types for each required case.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Set</span><span>,</span> <span>overload</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>@</span><span>overload</span>
<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>...</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Awesome! Looks like we’ve achieved our goal, haven’t we? But, there’s a new problem. We have to manually list all possible cases in a function’s signature. This works for cases when all possible arguments and outcomes are known in advance. But, not in this case. In Python <code>Iterable</code> is a protocol. We can use this function with any type with <code>__iter__</code> method defined: with both builtin and custom types. So, the number of possible arguments and outcomes is endless.</p>

<p>To illusrate the problem, let’s see what happens for <code>Tuple</code> which is not listed in the function’s overloads:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)))</span>
<span># error: No overload variant of "stringify_iterable_items" matches argument type "Tuple[int, int, int]"
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We, in <code>dry-python</code> <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/0.14.0/returns/_generated/converters/flatten.pyi">used this technique</a> with <code>@overload</code> decorator for our previous versions. This allowed us to write correct definitions of functions working with generic types. But, they were limited to the pre-defined set of our own types. And we wanted to allow our users to create their custom types based on our interfaces. With the full existing code reuse.</p>


    
      <h2 id="higher-kinded-types">
        
        <a href="#higher-kinded-types">Higher Kinded Types</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>That’s where the idea of Higher Kinded Types becomes useful. We need HKTs when we want to change the inner structure of generics with full type information preserving and openness to the extension. In theory, you can write something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Iterable</span>

<span>T</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'T'</span><span>,</span> <span>bound</span><span>=</span><span>Iterable</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>type</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>arg</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this would solve our problem! What happens here is that we abstract away the <code>Iterable</code> type itself. And then ask <code>mypy</code> to figure this out for us.</p>

<p>This way we can potentially have <code>stringify_iterable_items</code> working for any <code>Iterable</code> type, but with the exact same type returned back without any information lost. And it would work for all types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.list[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>({</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'builtins.set[builtins.str]'
</span>
<span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>stringify_iterable_items</span><span>(</span><span>MyCustomIterable</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
<span># Revealed type is 'my_module.MyCustomIterable[builtins.str]'
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/python/typing/issues/548">it is not supported</a> at the moment.</p>


    
      <h3 id="emulation">
        
        <a href="#emulation">Emulation</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Turns out we are not alone in this situation. There are multiple languages where Higher Kinded Types are not natively supported yet. But, they can be emulated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/docs/guides/HKT.md">TypeScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bow-swift.io/docs/fp-concepts/higher-kinded-types/">Swift</a></li>

</ul>

<p>And now with <a href="https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/hkt.html">Python</a> too!</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf">an original whitepaper</a> for ones who are interested.</p>

<p>The core idea of HKT emulation is that we can write types the other way around: not like <code>T[int]</code>, but rather like <code>Kind[T, int]</code> (which is absolutely the same thing).</p>

<p>This way we can transform the inner structure of generics, but maintain the simple context without reinventing <code>TypeVar</code> with type arguments. And our function’s type signature will look like: <code>Kind[T, int] -&gt; Kind[T, str]</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see the implementation.</p>


    
      <h2 id="implementation">
        
        <a href="#implementation">Implementation</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/sobolevn/7f8ffd885aec70e55dd47928a1fb3e61">the final working code</a> with all the logic, all the hacks, and everything. In this article, we going to write and explain it step by step.</p>

<p>We would need a better example to test our implementation. Let’s build two types: a <code>Box</code> and a <code>Bag</code>. <code>Box</code> is defined by its size, while a <code>Bag</code> is an item of fashion: it has a brand name and a model name (I have a wife, I know this stuff!).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>dataclasses</span> <span>import</span> <span>dataclass</span>
<span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>,</span> <span>TypeVar</span>

<span>_ValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_ValueType'</span><span>)</span>
<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span>

<span>@</span><span>dataclass</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>_ValueType</span>
    <span>brand</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we can create <code>Box</code>es and <code>Bag</code>s of different types, because we can put different things inside them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>box</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>  <span># Box[int]
</span><span>bag</span> <span>=</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>  <span># Bag[int]
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we need a function with a type transformation. Let’s say we want to apply a function to the value inside boxes and bags. Let’s use fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type for now to illustrate our intent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Callable</span>

<span>_NewValueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_NewValueType'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[[</span><span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span> <span>_NewValueType</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BoxOrBag</span><span>[</span><span>_NewValueType</span><span>]:</span>  <span># fake type for now
</span>    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is going to work like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>box</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Box</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>'10'</span><span>,</span> <span>length</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>=</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span><span>bag</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Bag</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>brand</span><span>=</span><span>'Fancy'</span><span>,</span> <span>model</span><span>=</span><span>'Baggy'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We only need to change current fake <code>BoxOrBag</code> type to a real HKT. We would need to define a new <code>Kind</code> type to make the emulation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
<span>_FirstTypeArgType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_FirstTypeArgType'</span><span>,</span> <span>covariant</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Kind</span><span>(</span><span>Generic</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceType</span><span>,</span> <span>_FirstTypeArgType</span><span>]):</span>
    <span>"""Used for HKT emulation."""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One pro-tip about <code>Kind</code>: it won’t not exist during runtime. Only during type-checking.</p>

<p>Now, let’s change <code>apply_function</code> to use <code>Kind</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_InstanceKind</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_InstanceKind'</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>apply_function</span><span>(</span>
    <span>instance</span><span>:</span> <span>Kind</span><span>[</span><span>_InstanceKind</span><span>,</span> <span>_ValueType</span><span>],</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

October 27, 2020 | https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently finished the MVP for an idea I had last month: <a href="https://essays.findka.com/" target="_blank">Findka Essays</a>, a newsletter that adapts to your preferences with machine learning. I pivoted to this from a much more complicated recommender system app, so I was already familiar with (almost) all the parts needed to build it. I'm extremely happy with the result: the new app is simple, the codebase is clean, and I launched it in under two weeks. In the grand tradition of our people, it is now time for an architecture + toolkit walkthrough. Feel free to skip to whichever sections interest you most. If you read only one section, I suggest <a href="https://findka.com/blog/essays-implementation/#recommendations">Recommendations</a>.</p><p>Note: I've abstracted a lot of the code into <a href="https://findka.com/biff">Biff</a>, a web framework I released several months ago. I'll reference Biff frequently.</p><ul>

</ul><hr><h3 id="language">Language</h3><p>The vast majority of the app is written in Clojure (the only exception is the actual recommendation algorithm, which is written in Python). Clojure is a fabulous language that has a strong emphasis on simplicity and stability, which makes codebases easy to maintain and extend in the long run. As a Lisp, it also has an extremely tight feedback loop which is great for rapid development.</p><p>There is a trade-off: since Clojure focuses on long-term concerns over short-term concerns, it can take a while to get up to speed (though it's a lot easier if you have a mentor). For example, to do web dev in Clojure, you'll need to learn how to piece together a bunch of individual libraries—there isn't a go-to framework like Rails or Django. (<a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> is probably the best starting point, after you're familiar with the language itself).</p><p>In most cases, I'd say the trade-off is well worth it. But for small or experimental apps (like you might build in a startup), speed at the beginning is extra valuable. If you want to move fast right away but you're not already comfortable in the Clojure ecosystem, you might have a bad time. One of my goals for Biff is to help mitigate that.</p><h3 id="front-end">Front end</h3><p>OK, now for some actual code. Findka Essays, unlike its predecessor, is a humble multi-page application. No React here. So the front end is pretty simple.</p><p>(For brevity, I'll call it "Findka" from here on out).</p><p>I use <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/rum" target="_blank">Rum</a> for HTML generation. Here's a quick example:</p><pre><code>(ns hello.world
 (:require
   [rum.core :as rum]))

(defn -main []
  (spit "hello.html"
    (rum/render-static-markup
      [:html
       [:body
        [:p {:style {:color "red"}}
         "Hello world!"]]])))
</code></pre><p>After <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started" target="_blank">installing Clojure</a>, you could put that in <code>src/hello/world.clj</code> and then run the program with <code>clj -Sdeps '{:deps {rum/rum {:mvn/version "0.11.5"}}}' -M -m hello.world</code>. That's a great way to get started with Clojure, actually—you can make a whole static site with just functions, data structures, and Rum. That's how I made Findka's landing page. Here's a snippet:</p><pre><code>(defn home []
  (base-page {:scripts [[:script {:src "/js/ensure-logged-out.js"}]]}
    [:.bg-dark.text-white
     [:.container.px-3.mx-auto.max-w-screen-md
      [:.nunito-sans-bold.text-2xl.mt-4.mb-8.sm:text-center
       "Great essays delivered to your inbox. " [:br.hidden.md:inline]
       "Chosen specifically for you with machine learning."]
      [:a.btn.btn-green.btn-block.sm:max-w-sm.mx-auto
       {:href "/signup"}
       "Sign up"]
      ...
</code></pre><p>This project is the first time I've used <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> (I used Bootstrap previously). I give it two thumbs up. Tailwind gives you smaller, better building blocks than Bootstrap, and it has responsive variants for every class (hallelujah). Setup was straightforward. After an <code>npm init; npm install tailwindcss --save-dev</code>, you just need a few files:</p><p><code>tailwind.config.js</code>:</p><pre><code>module.exports = {
  purge: [
    './src/**/*.clj', // for tree-shaking
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'dark': '#343a40',
        'hn-orange': '#ff6600',
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p><code>tailwind.css</code>:</p><pre><code>@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;
@responsive {
  .btn-thin {
    @apply text-center py-2 px-4 rounded;
  }
  .btn {
    @apply btn-thin font-bold;
  }
  ...
}

@tailwind utilities;
@responsive {
  .nunito-sans-bold {
    font-family: 'Nunito Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight : 900;
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>Build with <code>npx tailwindcss build tailwind.css -o output.css</code>.</p><p>The last piece is fonts. I am not a designer, at all. Despite this, I have recently made a startling discovery: using different fonts, instead of just the default, can actually make your site look a lot better. It turns out you can just doom scroll through <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> until you find some you like. I did that for Findka's logo (I tried AI logo generators in the past, but they weren't good).</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>Findka supports signin via email link or Google. Biff mostly handles email link auth for you.
Just make a form with an <code>email</code> field that POSTs to <code>/api/signup</code>. Biff sends the user an email with a link, they click on it, boom. You have to provide an email template and a function that actually sends the email. I use Mailgun, so Findka's email function looks like this:</p><pre><code>(def templates
  {:biff.auth/signup
   (fn [{:keys [biff.auth/link]}]
     {:from "Findka Essays &lt;...&gt;"
      :subject "Create your Findka Essays account"
      :html (rum/render-static-markup
              [:div
               [:p "We received a request to create a Findka Essays account using this email address."]
               [:p [:a {:href link :target "_blank"} "Click here to create your account."]]
               [:p "If you did not request this link, you can ignore this email."]])})
   ...})

(defn send** [api-key opts]
  (http/post (str "https://api.mailgun.net/v3/mail.findka.com/messages")
    {:basic-auth ["api" api-key]
     :form-params opts}))

(defn send* [{:keys [mailgun/api-key template data] :as opts}]
  (if (some? template)
    (let [template-fn (get templates template)
          mailgun-opts (template-fn data)]
      (send** api-key mailgun-opts))
    (send** api-key (select-keys opts [:to :subject :text :html]))))

(defn send [{:keys [params template recaptcha/secret-key] :as sys}]
  (if (= template :biff.auth/signup)
    (let [{:keys [success score]}
          (:body
            (http/post "https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify"
              {:form-params {:secret secret-key
                             :response (:g-recaptcha-response params)}
               :as :json}))]
      (when (and success (&lt;= 0.5 score))
        (send* sys)))
    (send* sys)))
</code></pre><p>As shown at the end, I use Recaptcha for bot control. It's nice because you
don't have to make the user do anything; Google's script will simply give you a
score that represents how likely the user is to be a human.</p><p>Biff doesn't have Google sign-in support built in (yet), but it's pretty simple to add.
After the front-end bit is taken care of, you just have to add an HTTP endpoint that receives
a token, verifies it using Google's library, and sets a session cookie.</p><p>That's sort of a funny way to use Google sign-in, I'll admit. You're "supposed" to send the token
with every request and verify it each time, letting Google's code handle sessions on the client.
However, Biff is already set up for authenticating requests via session cookie, and that's more convenient for multi-page applications anyway.</p><h3 id="crud">CRUD</h3><p>I use <a href="https://opencrux.com/" target="_blank">Crux</a> for the database. Crux is an immutable document database with datalog queries. Another way to explain it is that Crux works well as a general-purpose database (e.g. a replacement for postgres), but it fits better with functional programming. You also get flexible data modeling without giving up query power.</p><p>(That ignores Crux's raison d'être, bitemporal queries—a cool feature, and no doubt extremely useful if you need those. For my simple applications, I haven't.)</p><p>Crux doesn't enforce any schema, but Biff does. You can specify schema using <a href="https://clojure.org/about/spec" target="_blank">Clojure spec</a>:</p><pre><code>(require '[trident.util :as u])

(u/sdefs
  ::event-type #{:submit :email :click :like :dislike}
  ::timestamp  inst?
  ::url        string?
  ::parent     uuid?
  ::user       uuid?
  ::event      (u/only-keys
                 :req-un [::event-type
                          ::timestamp
                          ::user
                          ::url]
                 :opt-un [::parent]))

(def schema
  {:events {:spec [uuid? ::event]}})
</code></pre><p>This schema defines a "table" for events. The <code>[uuid? ::event]</code> part means that
the primary key for an event document should be a UUID, and the rest of the
document should conform to the spec given for <code>::event</code> above. In this case,
that means the document must have an event type, timestamp, user ID and URL,
and it can optionally have a "parent" key (which is set to the primary key of
another event).</p><p>Like a standard multi-page app, Findka has POST endpoints for writing to
the database and GET endpoints for reading (though I have no idea if the
endpoints adhere to REST or not). Here's one for submitting an essay:</p><pre><code>(defn submit-essay [{:keys [biff/node session/uid params] :as sys}]
  (if (nil? uid)
    {:status 302
     :headers/Location "/login/"}
    (do
      (crux/await-tx node
        (biff.crux/submit-tx sys
          {[:events] {:user uid
                      :timestamp :db/current-time
                      :event-type :submit
                      :url (:url params)}}))
      {:status 302
       :headers/Location "/settings"})))

(def routes
  [["/api/submit-essay"
   {:post submit-essay
    :name ::submit-essay
    :middleware [anti-forgery/wrap-anti-forgery]}]
   ...])
</code></pre><p>And here's a snippet from the <code>/settings</code> page. The call to <code>crux/q</code> performs
a datalog query which returns the current user's 10 most recent events, which
are displayed in the UI:</p><pre><code>(defn settings* [{:keys [biff/db session/uid]}]
  (let [events (map first
                 (crux/q db
                   {:find '[event timestamp]
                    :full-results? true
                    :args [{'user uid}]
                    :order-by '[[timestamp :desc]]
                    :limit 10
                    :where '[[event :event-type]
                             …</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>Yesterday I <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mugshot-bot">launched Mugshot Bot on Product Hunt</a> as a solo founder. It was a wild ride and I’ve never been glued to my computer like this.</p>

<p>The launch finished with with over 250 upvotes, 39 comments, and #5 Product of the Day. It generated close to 1000 visits, over 70 sign ups, and 6 paying customers.</p>

<p>I even got a cute little badge from Product Hunt!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mugshot-bot?utm_source=badge-top-post-badge&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_souce=badge-mugshot-bot" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/top-post-badge.svg?post_id=271792&amp;theme=light&amp;period=daily" alt="Mugshot Bot - Automated link preview images for your website. | Product Hunt" width="250" height="54"></a></p>

<p>Here’s my journey on what worked, what didn’t work, and things I wish I spent more time on. I’m not guaranteeing following these will make your launch a success. But hopefully you can pick up a tip or two.</p>

<p>Oh, and for newcomers, <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/">Mugshot Bot</a> is a tool that automates link preview images for your website without design tools.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked">What worked</h2>

<p>The single biggest contributor to the success of this Product Hunt launch was the work done, well, before the launch.</p>

<h3 id="build-in-public">Build in public</h3>

<p>First, I’ve been building Mugshot Bot in public, sharing progress as it happens. Almost every day for the past two months I’ve tweeted about a new feature, an idea, design progress, or a question.</p>

<p>Anything worth elaborating on (but not quite long enough for a blog post) I’ve been posting to <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/joemasilotti">Indie Hackers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="get-early-upvotes">Get early upvotes</h3>

<p>You only get one day on Product Hunt, and those <a href="https://blog.producthunt.com/how-to-launch-on-product-hunt-7c1843e06399">24 hours are based on the Pacific time zone</a>. Ideally, you are launching early in the morning so you can maximize your time for upvotes.</p>

<p>I’m in Eastern time and didn’t want to get up at 3am to start promoting my post. Instead, I had someone in London help me out.</p>

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/jmckinven">James</a> for getting the ball rolling. He shared the post with other indie hackers and makers in his circle which bumped the post right from the get-go.</p>

<h3 id="live-tweet">Live tweet</h3>

<p>About five seconds after I woke up I <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">tweeted a link</a> to the Product Hunt post. I followed up on every milestone, every mishap, and every little victory.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">
  <img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshotbot-tweet-thread.png" alt="Beginning of Twitter thread about Product Hunt launch">
  </a>
</p>

<p>I also pinned the tweet to my profile and set my URL to the Product Hunt page for the day.</p>

<p>In total, the tweet received 7500 impressions and a whopping 500 engagements. I replied to <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">the thread</a> 20 times.</p>

<p>This was where people showed their excitement. If you click through the thread there’s a ton of people interacting with me, letting me know they upvoted, and just being generally awesome.</p>

<p>It was a highlight of the day for me to connect directly with people about Mugshot Bot on Twitter.</p>

<p>Shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/panphora">David</a> for this idea and for providing a <em>ton</em> of feedback while building Mugshot Bot.</p>

<h3 id="be-genuine">Be genuine</h3>

<p>Product Hunt has a strict policy against asking for upvotes. Instead, they recommend asking folks to “check out the page.”</p>

<p>What worked well for me was being genuine. I wanted support from my audience so that’s what I asked for. “I would love if you could show me some support” seemed to resonate.</p>

<p>I also called out in my <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1320674419077910530">initial tweet</a> that I was nervous. This was met with a lot of positive reinforcement from folks that went a long way towards ending the day feeling great.</p>

<h2 id="what-didnt-work">What didn’t work</h2>

<p>Not every second of my launch day was productive. Here are some things that I tried but didn’t seem to help very much.</p>

<h3 id="engaging-out-of-target-audiences">Engaging out-of-target audiences</h3>

<p>A big portion of my Twitter followers are indie makers, developers, and/or bloggers. Mugshot Bot helps content creators and hackers the most, so there’s a ton of overlap.</p>

<p>That isn’t the case for my Facebook audience. Most of these folks are friends from high school and college. I’ll also be the first to admit I don’t post on Facebook much anymore.</p>

<p>The takeaway is to pick the audience that matters and focus on that instead of spreading yourself too thin.</p>

<h3 id="email-campaign-asking-for-support">Email campaign asking for support</h3>

<p>This one surprised me the most. Before the launch I had about 100 registered accounts. I sent an email letting them know about the importance of the Product Hunt launch and asking for support.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, only 9 people clicked through the Product Hunt post. Here’s the email, if you’re interested.</p>

<p><img src="https://masilotti.com/images/product-hunt-launch-email.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of email campaign announcing Product Hunt launch"></p>

<p>Looking back, I can’t tell if these folks didn’t care enough or my messaging was off. Probably a combination of the two!</p>

<h3 id="twitter-ads">Twitter ads</h3>

<p>As soon as I got my first new customer I set up a Twitter campaign for the same amount. I focused on getting clicks to the Product Hunt post and promoted the first post in the Twitter thread.</p>

<p>I cancelled the campaign after two hours.</p>

<p>In 2 hours I received 2 clicks. For $15. This might make sense for a direct acquisition channel, but $7.50 per click was nowhere near worth it for potential upvotes.</p>

<h3 id="obsessively-refresh-metrics">Obsessively refresh metrics</h3>

<p>In the spirit of building in public all of <a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats/">Mugshot Bot’s metrics are publicly available</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mugshotbot.com/stats">
  <img src="https://masilotti.com/images/mugshotbot-stats.png" alt="Mugshot Bot public metrics">
  </a>
</p>

<p>I probably refreshed this page over 100 times throughout the day. Sure, there were a few dopamine hits when a number spiked. But overall, it was a waste of time.</p>

<p>Metrics are important but being glued to them is a dangerous habit.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wish-id-also-done">What I wish I’d also done</h2>

<p>There’s only so many hours the day. But here are a few things that I wish I carved out some extra time for.</p>

<h3 id="post-to-indie-hackers">Post to Indie Hackers</h3>

<p>Early last week I posted to Indie Hackers documenting <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/my-prep-for-a-product-hunt-launch-on-monday-66f2757c1f">everything I did for seven days leading up to the launch</a>. It was really fun to update this throughout the week.</p>

<p>But for some reason I completely forgot to post on launch day! I think this could have strummed up a bit more excitement but nothing getting too upset over.</p>

<p>You could post in the <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/product-launch">Product Launch</a>  or <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/group/product-hunt">Product Hunt</a> groups, they both have about 150 members.</p>

<h3 id="fine-tune-a-welcome-e-mail">Fine-tune a welcome e-mail</h3>

<p>Late in the day I added a click-to-tweet link to the welcome email to people who have signed up for Mugshot Bot. A few people used it, too!</p>

<p>The link uses Twitter intents to automatically prompt a drafted tweet with populated content. I used <a href="https://tech.cymi.org/tweet-intents">Twitter Intent Creator</a> to generate the link.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I wish I added this earlier in the day to capitalize on some more reach.</p>

<h2 id="your-product-hunt-launch">Your Product Hunt launch</h2>

<p>That’s everything that I learned during my first big Product Hunt launch. I hope you picked up a tip or two for your launch!</p>

<p>My tl;dr is to build an audience before your launch. Without this you’ll be fighting an uphill battle.</p>

<p>If you used this post to help your launch I’d love to hear about it. <a href="https://twitter.com/joemasilotti/status/1321129876938649600">Reply to this tweet</a> or <a href="mailto:joe@masilotti.com">send me an email</a> and we can talk shop.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started learning Python in 2009, and I had a pretty challenging task and somewhat unusual use of Python. I was working on a desktop application that used PyQT for GUI and Python as the main language.</p><p>To hide the code, I embedded Python interpreter into a standalone Windows executable. There are a lot of solutions to do so (e.g. <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">pyinstaller</a>, <a href="https://www.py2exe.org/">pyexe</a>), and they all work similarly. They compile your Python scripts to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode">bytecode</a> files and bundle them with an interpreter into an executable. Compiling scripts down to bytecode makes it harder for people with bad intentions to get the source code and crack or hack your software. Bytecode has to be extracted from the executable and decompiled. It can also produce obfuscated code that is much harder to understand.</p><p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/code_isolation.svg"></p><p>At one point, I wanted to add a plugin system so that users could benefit from extra features. Executing arbitrary third-party code on your server is dangerous. But can it harm your commercial product when you execute it on user's machines, and users have trust in that they are executing? At that time, the answer was not obvious, and I decided to implement the system.</p><p>A few years later, it became apparent that you should <strong>never</strong> execute third-party code using the same Python process (interpreter) if you don't want to leak the source code. There are a lot of commercial products that use Python for desktop software or as a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/AppsWithPythonScripting">scripting language</a>. Some of them can be at risk.</p><p>There are many ways to extract Python bytecode even if you don't run any third-party code. It's a never-ending arms race between developers and reverse engineers, but it's much easier to extract the bytecode and crack your program when you can run your own code. My software was later cracked without using the plugins subsystem.</p><p>So what can you do to the "host" code when it executes your scripts?</p><p>Python is a very dynamic language, and you can do a lot of things. This article demonstrates a few approaches on how to modify or extract the source code.</p><blockquote><p>When you work with a regular Python process, you don't even need a plugins system. You can always <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/DebuggingWithGdb">attach to a running</a> process using GDB and inject your own code.</p></blockquote><h2>Monkey patching</h2><p>If a plugin can be initialized before a function that you want to modify, we can simply mock it.</p><p>Let's suppose we have a function that validates license:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>validate_license</span><span>():</span>

For example, the path to callback can be defined in the settings file.</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>get_amount</span><span>():</span>

</code></pre></div><h4>Fast locals</h4><p>In Python, local and global variables are stored in dictionaries. Every time you use a variable, Python needs to lookup it in a dictionary. Since dictionary lookups are not free and take time, Python uses various optimization techniques.</p><p>By analyzing the code of a function, it's possible to detect variable names that a function will be using when running. Our function has three local variables: <code>amount</code>, <code>user</code>, <code>logger</code>. Function arguments are local variables too.</p><p>When compiling source code to bytecode, Python maps known variable names to indexes in a special array and stores them there. Accessing a variable by an index is fast, and most of the functions use predefined names. Optimized variables are called <code>fast locals</code>. To keep variable names that are generated on the go, Python uses a dictionary as a fallback.</p><p>When dereferencing variables, Python prioritizes fast locals and ignores changes in the dictionary. That's why we use <code>ctypes</code> and call internal <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/cb9879b948a19c9434316f8ab6aba9c4601a8173/Objects/frameobject.c#L1148"><code>PyFrame_LocalsToFast</code></a> function.</p><h2>Patching bytecode</h2><p>I have an article on <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/python-bytecode-patch/">bytecode patching</a> that describes how to patch function definition. We can go even further and patch a running function.</p><p>Instead of source code, Python interpreter executes bytecode that was generated using a special compiler. When executing the code, a special virtual machine executes each instruction one by one. That allows us to replace unexecuted instructions on the go.</p><p>Let's use this function as an example:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>is_valid</span><span>():</span>

Every <code>bytes</code> object contains meta-information, such as <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/python-garbage-collector/">number of references</a> and information about the type. To locate the exact address of the raw C string, we use the <code>id</code> function that returns object address in memory, and we skip all meta information (size of the empty byte string). The output from <code>dis.dis</code> shows that the <code>POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE</code> instruction is the 10th element in the byte string that we need to replace.</p><h2>Extracting the source code</h2><p>Every script that Python runs or imports creates a <code>module</code> object that stores constants, functions, class definitions, and so on. If you don't have source code, you can get it back by decompiling the bytecode.</p><p>Here is how you can iterate over all modules and find all available functions:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>for</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>module</span> <span>in</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>modules</span><span>.</span><span>items</span><span>()):</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>isfunction</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>):</span>
            <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>obj_name</span><span>,</span> <span>obj</span><span>.</span><span>__code__</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Fortunately (or unfortunately for some people), there is no easy way to extract the bytecode of a whole module if you don't have a <code>pyc</code> (bytecode cache) file. If you want to get the source code from a running Python process, you will need to extract the bytecode of each function, class, and module definitions as well as from some frame objects. After that, you will need to run it through one of the <a href="https://github.com/rocky/python-decompile3">decompilers</a>.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>This article is a part of <a href="https://rushter.com/blog/tags/cpython/">CPython internals</a> series. It's hard to find a practical application to these techniques, but such language details are useful for people who perform security research or participate in CTF competitions. My previous articles on bytecode have helped people to get extra points in security competitions.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>OberonScript</h2>
<p>Oberon Script is a scripting language and runtime system for building interactive Web Client applications. It consists of a compiler that translates the full Oberon language into JavaScript code, and a small runtime system that detects and compiles at load-time script sections written in Oberon Script.</p>
<p>It is a complete re-implementation from scratch of an earlier compiler that I built
while being with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a>
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. For legal reasons I was unable to take the code with me
but I cleared the code by MSR's legal department for publication via <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/downloads/default.aspx">Microsoft Research's code posting tool</a>.
However, I left MSR before completing the process, hence the complete rewrite.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>The code of the compiler is available in its current, far from final version in source code (obviously...) for personal,
non-commercial and non-governmental use. The usual disclaimers apply.</p>
<p>A very minimal documentation is also available. I may merge it some time with the prettyprinted HTML version below.</p>

			<p>Administrators can use teams policies for controlling what users can do in Microsoft Teams.</p>

<p>In this blog, I’ll show that these policies are applied only in client and thus can be easily bypassed.</p>





<p>Policies are used in Microsoft Office 365 and Azure AD for securing access to services and data. Besides the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">common identity and device access policies</a>,
Microsoft has provided a set of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/teams-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Teams specific policies</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teams and channel policies</li>
<li>Messaging policies</li>
<li>Meeting policies</li>
<li>App permission policies</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, administrators can configure Teams so that external users are not able to edit or delete any messages they’ve sent. Or, an owner of a Teams site can disable message editing for members of a certain channel.</p>



<h2 id="initial-discovery">Initial discovery</h2>

<p>While I was working with the previous version (v0.4.4) of <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals" target="_blank">AADInternals</a> Teams functions I noticed an interesting thing: I was able to edit and delete chat messages using AADInternals as a guest
even when it was not allowed.</p>

<p>This led to a question that <strong>what if the policies are applied only at the client end?</strong> In practice this would mean that the Teams service tells to your Teams client that “Though shall not edit messages!” but the client
could still do so.</p>

<h2 id="observing-teams-client-behaviour">Observing Teams client behaviour</h2>

<p>I started by watching what was going on between the client and cloud when the Teams client started. The first observation was that the client made about 120 http requests to the cloud.
While browsing through those requests, I spotted one that caught my interest (headers stripped):</p>

<pre><code>POST https://teams.microsoft.com/api/mt/part/emea-02/beta/users/useraggregatesettings HTTP/1.1

{
    "tenantSettingsV2": true,
    "userResourcesSettings": true,
    "messagingPolicy": true,
    "clientSettings": true,
    "targetingPolicy": true,
    "tenantSiteUrl": true,
    "userPropertiesSettings": true,
    "callingPolicy": true,
    "meetingPolicy": true,
    "educationAssignmentsAppPolicy": true
}
</code></pre>

<p>The response contained all the settings and policies the Teams client is allowed to do as the logged in user. Below can be seen the <strong>messagingPolicy</strong> section:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span></span><span>"messagingPolicy"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>"value"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>"allowUserEditMessage"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUserDeleteMessage"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUserChat"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowGiphy"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"giphyRatingType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Moderate"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowGiphyDisplay"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowPasteInternetImage"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowMemes"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowStickers"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUserTranslation"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowUrlPreviews"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"readReceiptsEnabledType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"UserPreference"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowImmersiveReader"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowPriorityMessages"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"audioMessageEnabledType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"ChatsAndChannels"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"channelsInChatListEnabledType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"DisabledUserOverride"</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowRemoveUser"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowSmartReply"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>What we can learn here is that the Teams client asks from the cloud what the current user is allowed to do, which was the expected behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="testing-in-action">Testing in action</h2>

<p>Next I decided to try whether I could lie to Teams client:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saved the response from above to be used as a baseline.</p></li>

<li><div><p>I created a new Messaging policy to disable editing and deleting of sent messages.</p><p>
I applied the policy to a single demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies1.png" alt="Custom policy"></p><p>Now I had two policies, the default organisation wide and the restricted one for demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies2.png" alt="Policies"></p></div></li>

<li><p>I restarted the Teams client and noticed that the editing and deleting were correctly disabled (didn’t exists).</p></li>

<li><div><p>I compared the returned policies from the <strong>useraggregatesettings</strong> requests<br>
and as we can see, the request was missing two lines:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies3.png" alt="Policy comparison"></p></div></li>

<li><div><p>I closed the client and configured Fiddler to do an autoresponse using the saved http response from above:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies4.png" alt="Fiddler autoresponse"></p><p>
Now, when the client is requesting the settings file, it will be served the one that allows editing and deleting.</p></div></li>

<li><p>I started the Teams client and <strong>the editing and deleting were again allowed</strong> and I was able to edit and delete (my own) messages!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What we can lean here is that <strong>we can lie to Teams client</strong> and change its behaviour 😂 <br>
Moreover, we learnt that <strong>Teams policies are applied only on the client</strong> 🤦‍♂</p>

<p>Here is the video demonstrating this with <strong>AADInternals</strong> and <strong>Fiddler</strong> (sorry for the bad audio after 03:20):</p>

<div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zcqig-OyUMY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>Below is a video that shows in action that this works also with <strong>cloud file storage restrictions</strong>:<br></p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a32TkLIBwS4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<br><strong>Note:</strong> Although not seen on the video, I was able to add my Google Drive account to Teams so this is not just a UI thing.</p>



<p>As far as I know, the “uncompliant” Teams client behaviour can not be detected.</p>

<p>Same verdict with protecting. Well, one could try to use Conditional Access (CA) with device ownership and compliance restrictions, but that doesn’t cover all scenarios.</p>



<p>Our little test here proves that <strong>Teams policies are applied ONLY on the client!</strong>.</p>

<p>If the user (or guest) is utilising Teams APIs directly, using for instance AADInternals <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals/#teams-functions" target="_blank">Teams functionality</a>, he or she can bypass the restrictions set by the policies.
However, this is not a bug or vulnerability as such, but a (very very bad) design choice by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Users can do at least the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bypass messaging policies</li>
<li>Bypass cloud file storage restrictions</li>
<li>Bypass meetings policies</li>
</ul>

<p>⚠️ <strong>Teams policies are NOT a security measure and organisations should not rely on them!</strong> ⚠️</p>

Virtual bands, virtual YouTubers, and virtual streamers are all the same concept; the people creating and performing are not the focus. CGI characters are replacing humans, even outside of animation.&nbsp;</p><p>Virtual performers are not new. Alvin and the Chipmunks are the earliest example. Other notable Western examples include Dethklok and Crazy Frog.</p><p>Japan and the East, unsurprisingly, love virtual performers. Hatsune Miku is one of the most popular. She has widely attended live concerts. K/DA is a virtual K-pop group composed of characters from Riot’s League of Legends that has also seen enormous global success.</p><p id="youtube2-YSyWtESoeOc" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;YSyWtESoeOc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YSyWtESoeOc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p>Virtual streaming was really kicked off in 2016 by Kizuna AI. Kizuna plays video games just like other streamers, but she is entirely virtual. Body movements are likely motion captured or pre animated. Her voice is a paid actress. She embodies many cutesy anime girl tropes.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, streaming was dominated by young men on Twitch in the West, which didn’t appeal to Eastern audiences. Japan was already primed because of their penchant for virtual idols. Kizuna likely uses the same freeware, MikuMikuDance, as Hatsune Miku.</p><p id="youtube2-3AK24prZk-k" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;3AK24prZk-k&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3AK24prZk-k?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><div><p>The Japanese popularity of virtual streamers has influenced a new generation of Twitch streamers. Streamers like projektmelody (NSFW) and BuffPup do well in their niches. The vast majority of virtual streamers follow the trail blazed by virtual idols and Kizuna AI. Typically they are young female anime avatars that speak Japanese.</p><p>BuffPup stands out. BuffPup is one of the earliest virtual streamers to branch out from its anime roots into furry fandom. I’ll let you look that one up if you’re unfamiliar. Virtual streaming is clearly still in its infancy. Expressiveness of many virtual streamers is lacking, which leaves a huge opportunity for the right tech to push the medium forward. Many fall into uncanny valley territory.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488692c5-d040-43fb-b228-79189c0dfe9e_1080x888.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F488692c5-d040-43fb-b228-79189c0dfe9e_1080x888.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/488692c5-d040-43fb-b228-79189c0dfe9e_1080x888.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:888,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:112162,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><div><p>Since Riot is already getting their feet wet with virtual performers, I expect this trend to continue in the industry. Every major publisher will have a virtual version of their characters playing their games, streamed live. Publishers will pay actors to do motion / facial capture as well as live voice. Fans will finally be able to interact directly with their favorite video game characters. This market alone will be enormously profitable, since it can leverage existing live streaming monetization techniques.</p><p>Gaming companies will double down into motion capture and face filter-like technologies. They’ll branch into AI generated voice tech, or acquire it. Once the tech gets there, virtual streaming will be an extremely high margin business, because even the talent will be fully automated. At least in the short and medium term, this will mean more jobs for actors, so that’s a plus.</p></div><p>Stats:</p><ul><li><p>K/DA has over 384 million views on this video</p></li></ul><p id="youtube2-UOxkGD8qRB4" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;UOxkGD8qRB4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UOxkGD8qRB4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><ul><li><p>Kizuna AI has over 2.8 million subscribers on Youtube and videos with over 14 million views</p></li><li><p>projektmelody (NSFW) has 289,000 followers on Twitch, and routinely has 3,500+ concurrent viewers</p></li><li><p>64+ virtual streamers on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/team/antilewdarmy)</p></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">538</a> and the <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">Economist</a> have both released detailed data from their election forecasts, listing how each state votes in 40,000 simulations of the presidential election. To understand some unusual scenarios from the 538 model, like every state <a href="https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1300480869082292225">voting for Biden but New Jersey</a>, Andrew Gelman <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/24/reverse-engineering-the-problematic-tail-behavior-of-the-fivethirtyeight-presidential-election-forecast/">examined the correlation</a> in the Trump vote share between pairs of several states. </p>
<p>I was curious what the whole universe of pairwise correlations looked like; you can click on a grid cell below to see voting patterns in two states in more detail along with the electoral maps from individual simulation scenarios. In the 538 model, 242 pairs of states are <span>negatively correlated</span>!</p>


<p>Mousing around the edges of the scatter plot pulls out more unusual scenarios, like Trump losing everywhere but <code>CA-HI-VT</code>. </p>
<p>On the correlation matrices, it appears that both models have identified similar groups of states. A scatter plot shows this directly: </p>


<p>Outside of the <code>CA-DC-VT-WA</code> and <code>LA-MS-ND-KY</code> clusters, where the 538 correlation dips below 0, the models are mostly aligned. Glancing over the outliers, it looks like the Economist might not have an equivalent to 538’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/">regional regression</a> that groups states in the same geographic region together; the Economist has <code>HI</code> at 0.2 correlation with <code>WA</code> &amp; <code>OR</code>  while 538 has it around 0.7.</p>
<p>Stepping back from the funky correlation charts, comparing the Trump vote share state by state clearly shows a bigger difference between the models: the <span>Economist model</span> considers really surprising outcomes, like Trump decisively winning <code>CA</code>, less likely than the <span>538 model</span>.</p>


<p>I haven’t followed the extensive discussion around election modeling closely enough to have a strong opinion on what all of this means, but it does look like the 538 model is allowing for the <a href="https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1320043524771991560">possibility</a> of a broad <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1300825856072454145">realignment in politics</a>–something you’d want to incorporate when modeling 2024 today, but not plausible for an election next week with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/absentee-ballot-early-voting.html">sixty million ballots</a> already cast.</p>
<div id="notes">
<p>Only 5,000 scenarios are shown on the scatter plots; the scenarios are a snapshot from 2020-10-25 and not updated (looking at the correlations over time might be interesting though!). The rendered electoral college scenarios ignore the possibility of <code>NE</code> or <code>ME</code> spliting their votes. 

</p><p>The correlations matrix orders states by clustering on 538’s correlations. Sorting using the Economist correlations <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JH9FC8I.png">splits up</a> the negative 538 correlations.

                <div>
                    <p>People often say that software is eating the world. But have you ever wondered what that really means?</p><p>Ten years ago, software eating the world might have been hard to believe. In 2008, only one of the top ten companies in the S&amp;P 500 was a tech company: Microsoft. </p><p>Today, all five of the top five companies in the S&amp;P 500 are tech companies. Their combined market cap is <a href="https://www.startribune.com/the-s-p-500-has-never-been-more-top-heavy/572106152/">22% of the entire index</a>. Or as much as the bottom 363 companies combined. They are so dominant, lawmakers want to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-panel-calls-for-congress-to-break-up-tech-giants-11602016985">break them up</a>.</p><p>How did this happen? And what happens next?</p><p>What role did software play in this outcome? And what does it mean for the future of financial services?</p><p>To understand what's really happening, you need to unpack the <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software eats the world hypothesis</a> and understand why digital is different and the implication this has on value chains everywhere.</p><p>In a <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/08/16/software-eaten-world-healthcare/">2019 interview</a>, Marc Andreessen describes in three layers how the software eats the world hypothesis unfolds across industries. Layer one is:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>Any product or service in any field that can become a software product, will become a software product.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If there's something you're used to doing on the phone, that will go to software. If there's something you're used to doing with paper, that will go to software. If there's something that you're used to doing in person and there is any way it can go to software, it will go to software.</p><p>Countless physical products are <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/apps-replacing-modern-devices/">now just apps on the phone</a> for most people: cameras, maps, keys, paper tickets, books, newspapers, magazines, calendars, radios, televisions, measuring tapes, remote controls, mirrors, and flash lights. Just to name a few. And more are being added all the time.</p><p>In other words, if it can become bits, it becomes bits.</p><p>What are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bits</a>? Zeroes and ones―a basic unit of information in computing. Data expressed as a series of zeroes and ones is what we call <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital">digital</a>.</p><p>And digital is different. On a deep and fundamental level.</p><p>An obvious reason is that digital products are easier to change, so it's faster to innovate and add new capabilities or features. Digital products are also easier to replicate at scale and are much more cost effective.</p><p>A less obvious reason is that digital products enable a shift from a world based on scarcity into a world based on abundance, unlocking large opportunities for value creation and re-arranging existing value chains in the process.</p><p><a href="https://www.usv.com/people/albert-wenger/">Albert Wenger</a>, a partner at Union Square Ventures, <a href="https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/digital">describes the two most important ways digital is different</a>:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Zero marginal costs</strong></strong> Making one additional unit and delivering it across the network costs nothing. The price for a product with zero marginal cost trends towards free. Zero marginal cost is like an economic singularity similar to dividing by zero in math―as you approach it strange things begin to happen, ranging from digital near-monopolies to granting all of humanity access to the world's knowledge.</li><li><strong><strong>Universality of computation</strong></strong> Anything that can be computed in the universe, can be computed by the type of machines we already have today, given enough memory and time. Computation means taking information inputs, executing a series of processing steps, and producing information outputs. Which is essentially what a human brain does. In principle, a digital machine can do everything a human brain does.</li></ul><p>So if products and services in your field are becoming software products and can take advantage of zero marginal costs and universality of computation, how do you figure out what might happen to your market?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Ask yourself some of the <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/investment-analysis/">questions an early stage investor asks</a>  before investing in a startup:</p>
<ul>
<li>What used to be scarce but is now abundant?</li>
<li>What used to be full of friction but is now no friction? And how will consumer behavior change?</li>
<li>What is the new scarcity that the startup is going to claim?</li>
<li>How is the value chain arranged today and how can it be re-arranged to eliminate existing players or reduce their margins so that the total friction to a customer is lower but that the new point of friction is the startup—and that is why the startup can collect money?</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For example, before the Web, information was scarce. Getting answers to questions was full of friction. It required knowing who to ask, or which physical books, magazines or articles to pore over. And then, how did you actually know if you had really found the best answer? Or just a local maxima?</p><p>With the emergence of &nbsp;the Web, information was digitized and only a click away. Information was now abundant. But there was a new problem. How did you find it?</p><p>Finding the best answers to questions was the new scarcity, and Google built clever software that did a much better job of ranking answers to questions than anyone else. Because of zero marginal costs, they allowed people to use it for free. The experience was 10x better than any alternative, and made users feel awesome. Like they had a superpower. </p><p>This was the beginning of a virtuous cycle. As people clicked on answers, Google recorded clicks as votes and then recalibrated their rankings. The more people used Google, the better it got. And the better it got, the more people used Google.</p><p>Software and digitalization enabled Google to aggregate the world's demand for answers on a scale never before seen. Google was the new point of friction in the value chain, and anyone who wanted to show up as the top answer had to pay. Many selling information (the old scarcity) had to find a new business.</p><p>OK, so what does all this mean for financial services?</p><p>Most money today is just information in a database. Deposits (checking and savings) should already be zero marginal cost, but banks have added friction and bureaucracy to keep money safe because of fraud and the absence of trust. Customers have been okay with this because trust is fundamentally what they've been buying.</p><p>As an individual, how can I trust that my money will be there when I need it? How can I trust that when I send a payment it's received by who I intended? How can I trust that I can borrow money when I need to? And that my loans will not be called in early? How can I trust that I own what I believe I have invested in? And when I have an accident, how can I trust my policy will pay as expected?</p><p>In today's world, trust is scarce.</p><p>But what if the world changed, and this was no longer true? What would happen to today's leading financial companies and their business models if trust became abundant?</p><p>Let's take a look at the evolution of the financial services platform stack¹ and see how things are changing.</p><h3 id="pre-internet-era">Pre-Internet Era</h3><p>For hundreds of years prior to the Internet, financial services were a vertically integrated oligopoly controlled by large banks. Names varied by country, but the story was always the same. Big banks managed every aspect of the stack, from the end user experience (bankers and ATMs) all the way down to the lowest level of infrastructure (settlements). </p><p>Regulation, infrastructure and customer acquisition cost made entry difficult, and so existing firms were very profitable. New products were rare, and old products hardly changed (aside from rates, fees or terms of service). Software was important at the platform and infrastructure layers, but would not be considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design">good software</a> by today's standards. Software was used mainly to do old things better. There was no incentive to innovate, so things stayed the same.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--1-.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--1-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Evolution of Finance: Pre-Internet Era</figcaption></figure><h3 id="internet-era">Internet Era</h3><p>Mobile phones and broadband access to the Web meant that customers wanted always-on self-service access to financial services. Banks launched web sites and mobile apps, but there was no change to the underlying products and services being offered. Just a new way to interact with them that saved banks money. Once again, new technology was used to do old things better.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new class of innovators called fintechs emerged that were good at software, user experience and interfaces. They started targeting underserved customer segments and making improvements in the experience and interface layer, while partnering with existing financial services players for the middle office, back office and settlements.</p><p>These fintechs and neobanks are software companies in a way that banks are not. And some have become very big, like PayPal, Stripe, Square and Robinhood. Despite this, they are mainly innovating around the edge. Money and value still settles through fintechs essentially the same way paper bills settled hundreds of years ago.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--5-.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--5-.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--5-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Evolution of Finance: Internet Era</figcaption></figure><h3 id="future-era">Future Era</h3><p>Large financial institutions from the Pre-Internet era are still in control of the financial system today. The top four US banks each hold over a <a href="https://www.usbanklocations.com/bank-rank/total-deposits.html">trillion dollars in deposits</a> and maintain their positions through bundling, regulation and scarcity of access to the financial system's platform and infrastructure layers―coupled with a good measure of inertia, fear, uncertainty, and doubt. </p><p>Their value proposition is trust. </p><p>But <strong>public blockchains make trust abundant</strong>. And when trust is no longer scarce, big changes will happen in financial services.</p><p>It's hard to overstate how important this is. Today's entire financial system is based on trust being scarce. And unlike fintechs innovating around the edge, trust becoming abundant will enable fundamental and deep re-ordering of the financial services value chain.</p><p>Like many new technologies, today public blockchains and crypto-assets seem <a href="https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy">like toys</a>. <a href="https://cdixon.org/2019/01/08/strong-and-weak-technologies">Strange, unserious, and expensive</a>. Maybe even dangerous. But over time, new technologies like these get better and are adopted gradually, and then suddenly. And often massively expand a market, making it <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/why-the-market-for-bitcoin-may-be-bigger-than-you-think/">orders of magnitude bigger.</a></p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--6-.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--6-.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/10/Evolution-of-Finance--6-.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Evolution of Finance: Future Era</figcaption></figure><p>This is how software eats money. <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/why-the-market-for-bitcoin-may-be-bigger-than-you-think/">Multi-sided networks like Bitcoin</a> will emerge and provide parallel platform and infrastructure layers that make trust abundant and can be freely innovated on.

<div><h2 id="The-Virtues-of-Prototyping">The Virtues of Prototyping<a href="#The-Virtues-of-Prototyping">¶</a></h2><p>One neat thing about prototyping (with Python or whatever) is that it allows you to fully focus on your <em>approach</em>, rather than on the infrastructure. Very obviously, this is useful for <em>teaching</em> – you can use examples as the ones above in a lecture to very quickly communicate essential techniques of program analysis and test generation.</p>
<p>But prototyping has more advantages. A Jupyter Notebook (like this one) documents how you developed your approach, together with examples, experiments, and rationales – and still focusing on the essentials. If you write a tool the "classical" way, you will eventually deliver thousands of lines of code that do everything under the sun, but only once you have implemented everything will you know whether things actually work. This is a huge risk, and if you still have to change things, you will have to refactor things again and again. Furthermore, for anyone who will work on that code later, it will take days, if not weeks, to re-extract the basic idea of the approach, as it will be buried under loads and loads of infrastructure and refactorings.</p>
<p>Our consequence at this point is that we now implement new ideas <em>twice</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, we implement things as a notebook (as this one), experimenting with various approaches and parameters until we get them right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only once we have the approach right, and if we have confidence that it works, we reimplement it in a tool that works on large scale programs. This can still take weeks to months, but at least we know we are on a good path.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Incidentally, it may well be that the original notebooks will have a longer life, as they are simpler, better documented, and capture the gist of our novel idea. And this is how several of the notebooks in this book came to be.</p>

            <p>Prior research has shown that physical activity can prevent unhealth as well as improve the prognosis of several diseases including various forms of cancer. Exactly how exercise exerts its protective effects against cancer is, however, still unknown, especially when it comes to the biological mechanisms. One plausible explanation is that physical activity activates the immune system and thereby bolsters the body’s ability to prevent and inhibit cancer growth.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet expanded on this hypothesis by examining how the immune system’s cytotoxic T cells, that is white blood cells specialized in killing cancer cells, respond to exercise.</p>

<h2>Cancer growth slowed in trained animals</h2>

<p>They divided mice with cancer into two groups and let one group exercise regularly in a spinning wheel while the other remained inactive. The result showed that cancer growth slowed and mortality decreased in the trained animals compared with the untrained.</p>

<p>Next, the researchers examined the importance of cytotoxic T cells by injecting antibodies that remove these T cells in both trained and untrained mice. The antibodies knocked out the positive effect of exercise on both cancer growth and survival, which according to the researchers demonstrates the significance of these T cells for exercise-induced suppression of cancer.</p>

<p>The researchers also transferred cytotoxic T cells from trained to untrained mice with tumors, which improved their prospects compared with those who got cells from untrained animals.</p>

<h2>Exercise altered T cell metabolism</h2>

<p>To examine how exercise influenced cancer growth, the researchers isolated T cells, blood and tissue samples after a training sessions and measured levels of common metabolites that are produced in muscle and excreted into plasma at high levels during exertion. Some of these metabolites, such as lactate, altered the metabolism of the T cells and increased their activity. The researchers also found that T cells isolated from an exercised animal showed an altered metabolism compared to T cells from resting animals.</p>

<p>In addition, the researchers examined how these metabolites change in response to exercise in humans. They took blood samples from eight healthy men after 30 minutes of intense cycling and noticed that the same training-induced metabolites were released in humans.</p>

<p>“Our research shows that exercise affects the production of several molecules and metabolites that activate cancer-fighting immune cells and thereby inhibit cancer growth,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/helame">Helene Rundqvist</a>, senior researcher at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/labmed/department-of-laboratory-medicine">Department of Laboratory Medicine</a>, Karolinska Institutet, and the study’s first author. “We hope these results may contribute to a deeper understanding of how our lifestyle impacts our immune system and inform the development of new immunotherapies against cancer.”</p>

<p>The researchers have received financing from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust.</p>

        <h2>Make better decisions.</h2>
      </p>
      <p>A decision journal is a simple, yet effective tool. It helps us to avoid hindsight bias, recognize patterns of mistakes in our decision making, and provide accurate and honest feedback on the decisions we make.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with what a decision journal is, it is the simple idea of keeping track of your decisions by writing them down for the purpose of reviewing it in the future. The Nobel Prize winner and famous psychologist <a href="https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/" target="_blank">Daniel Kahneman introduced the basic concept of a decision journal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Go down to a local drugstore and buy a very cheap notebook and start keeping track of your decisions. And the specific idea is whenever you’re making a consequential decision, something going in or out of the portfolio, just take a moment to think, write down what you expect to happen, why you expect it to happen and then actually, and this is optional, but probably a great idea, is write down how you feel about the situation, both physically and even emotionally. Just, how do you feel? I feel tired. I feel good, or this stock is really draining me. Whatever you think.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, Kahneman said, helps us avoid hindisight bias. The bias where everyone tends to look back on their own past in a favorable light. It’s the tendency people have of attributing their success to their own skills and talent but their failures to bad luck.</p>

<p>By keeping a decision journal, we avoid this bias by writing down exactly how we feel in the moment of making the decision. That way our future self can’t create a false narrative. We’re forced to be honest with ourselves.</p>

<p>Many decision makers in all walks of life use decision journals to help them improve their decision making capabilities. The problem is they can be challenging to maintain and keep track of. They require you to always remember to write down the decisions you want to keep track of and to go back and review them periodically. This causes many people to stop using them or to use them sub-optimally.</p>

<p>What if there was a more convenient way to use a decision journal?</p>

<p>Now there is, introducing Decision Journal, now available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/decision-journal/id1534768141" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterthinkingsoftware.decisionjournal" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p>

<p>With Decision Journal, we tried to take all of the awesome benefits decision journals offer and augment them with modern technology and software. Let’s go over some of the app’s key features.</p>

<h4 id="always-with-you">Always with you</h4>

<p>One of the challenges in keeping a good decision journal is making sure that you remember to write down the important decisions you want to keep track of. Not only that but the whole point of a decision journal is so that you can later recall exactly what you were thinking and feeling at the time of the decision. The challenge is that we don’t remember everything and the longer you go without writing down your thoughts, the more likely what you write down will be inaccurate.</p>

<p>That’s one of the great benefits of using the Decision Journal app as your decision journal. It’s always with you. Whenever you make a decision or begin thinking about making a particular decision, you can pull your phone out of your pocket and jot it down. Plus, given that it is on your phone, we’ll sync it to the cloud every time you save it so that you can keep track of your decisions on your own time, whenever is most convenient for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://decisionjournalapp.com/assets/img/screens/welcome-image.light.ios.png" height="350">
</p>

<h4 id="scheduled-reviews">Scheduled reviews</h4>

<p>Another important part of keeping a decision journal is so that you can accurately and honestly evaluate your decisions. However, one of the challenges is in remembering to do so in a timely manner.</p>

<p>We’re probably all too familiar with setting out our New Year’s resolutions at the beginning of each year, only to never follow up and review them. Why? Because life happens and we lose track of things. We’re human.</p>

<p>But that’s where technology can come in and assist us. With the Decision Journal app, we’ve made it super simple to mark a particular decision for a review at some point in the future. And you don’t have to remember to follow up, the app will do all of that for you. When it’s time to review a particular decision, the app will send you a notification letting you know that a particular decision is up for review.</p>

<p>And we didn’t just stop there. Sometimes you make decisions where the outcome of that decision can take place over long periods of time. That’s why we made it easy for you to schedule multiple reviews for any decision.</p>

<p><img src="https://decisionjournalapp.com/assets/img/screens/schedule-review.light.ios.png" height="350">
</p>

<h4 id="analyze-the-results">Analyze the results</h4>

<p>The whole point in keeping a decision journal in the first place is to try and improve on our decision making ability. That means picking up on patterns of errors and mistakes that we may be making.</p>

<p>With a paper and pen journal, this can be quite challenging. We may be able to remember the most frequent patterns of errors that we make but we might also miss a lot due to information overload.</p>

<p>This is another area where modern technology and software can help us. With the Decision Journal app, you can tag every decision you make to easily find trends and patterns in any particular category of decisions. In addition to tags, we’ve also added a powerful search capability that allows you to find decisions in a flash, so that you can be sure you’re not missing anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://decisionjournalapp.com/assets/img/screens/analyze-results.light.ios.png" height="350">
</p>

<h4 id="make-better-decisions-today">Make better decisions today</h4>

<p>Decision journals are such a powerful and effective tool for helping you make better decisions. Everyone should be using them. The problem is, they can also be a challenge and a burden to keep. That’s why we created the Decision Journal app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/decision-journal/id1534768141" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.betterthinkingsoftware.decisionjournal" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p>

<p>It takes the powerful concept of a decision journal and expands on it with new capabilities made possible through modern technology and software. We think it is an essential tool for any decision maker out there, but don’t just take our word for it, give it a try today:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During the last 10 years, Node.js has become a big player in the backend framework market, powering several large scale applications across the globe. Meanwhile, JavaScript has also evolved greatly, not only because of the efforts of its development team, but also based on community feedback. However, integrating some of these new language features into a 10-year-old framework is not really straightforward, and has a high level of complexity.</p>
<p>Therefore we could say that Node.js’ architecture hasn’t evolved as fast as the language. As a basic example, Node.js is still based on callbacks, while there are far better ways to deal with asynchronicity in modern JavaScript. This is something that its creator, Ryan Dahl, has acknowledged in the past few years, and it has moved him to work on a new framework that addresses some of these issues. It is called Deno, and in the following article, we would like to explore some of its concepts to determine if it will render Node.js obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-deno">What is Deno?</h2>
<p>First of all, you should know that Deno is not a fork of Node.js. It’s a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, implemented from scratch by Ryan Dahl in 2018. It was built on <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a> just like Node.js, but Deno was written with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a>. The runtime was designed with TypeScript in mind, and for that reason Deno supports TypeScript without extra configurations or tooling.</p>
<p>Deno was built to improve security and help increase productivity in developers using the latest JavaScript features. At the time this article was written, Deno’s version is 1.4.0. It’s a stable release, so it’s a good time to go over its main features and learn how you can use them for your application.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="typescript-out-of-the-box">TypeScript out of the box:</h3>
<p>TypeScript is powerful. This superset of JavaScript allows us to use types, interfaces, classes, inheritance, modules, generics, and other awesome things. However, it can be a bit tricky when using it with Node.js, because we need to install a module for TypeScript support and some tools to transpile the code. It also requires some additional configurations through tsconfig.json. However, after all of this setup, the JavaScript files that get compiled from TypeScript work pretty well with Node.js.</p>
<p>Deno offers native support for TypeScript at its 3.9 version. For it to run nothing else needs to be installed, and no compilation step is needed since Deno transpiles the code behind the scenes. It is also possible to run the code with a custom <code>tsconfig.json</code> file to customize how Deno compiles your code.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span># Using a custom tsconfig.json file</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span>deno</span> run -c tsconfig.json my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="url-imports">URL imports:</h3>
<p>Node.js projects have a <code>package.json</code> file that contains relevant information for your project. It also holds the dependency list that you’ll be using. Deno handles this part in a completely different way. The <code>package.json</code> file is not used anymore in favor of <code>ES Modules</code>. In order to use modules in a Deno project, you will need to reference each module with its URL or file path.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a># Import <span>module</span> <span>server</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>import</span> <span>{</span>serve<span>}</span> <span>from</span> “https<span>:</span><span>//deno.land/std/http/server.ts”</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When the application is executed for the first time, Deno downloads and caches all modules in a global cache. It is possible to store them in a custom directory using the <code>$DENO_DIR</code> environment variable. With this approach, Deno decentralizes the modules and your project will not have a large <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p>
<p>To keep module versions locked, it is possible to create a lock file with the <code>--lock</code> and <code>--lock-write</code> flags.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span># Create/update the lock file "lock.json"</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span>deno</span> cache --lock=lock.json --lock-write src/my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="secure-by-default">Secure by Default:</h3>
<p>Deno has some security measures in place to disallow potentially dangerous operations. By default, the code is executed in a secure sandbox, so it is not possible to access the network, file system, or environment unless you explicitly allow it. You can do this by adding flags when running the application. These are enabled by default in Node.js, which makes it insecure in some cases.</p>
<p>As a quick overview of what can be enabled we have the following flags:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span># Enable environment access with Deno.env.get</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-env my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>#Enable high resolution time measurement (used for profiling)</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-hrtime my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>#Enable network access</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span># This is used in cases where we want to fetch from external servers</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span># or when we want to expose a port from our server</span></span>
<span id="cb4-10"><a href="#cb4-10"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-net=https://example.com my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-11"><a href="#cb4-11"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-12"><a href="#cb4-12"></a><span># Enable plugin usage</span></span>
<span id="cb4-13"><a href="#cb4-13"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-plugin my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-14"><a href="#cb4-14"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-15"><a href="#cb4-15"></a><span># Enable filesystem access</span></span>
<span id="cb4-16"><a href="#cb4-16"></a><span># To read a file or directory with Deno.open, or write to a file</span></span>
<span id="cb4-17"><a href="#cb4-17"></a><span># or  directory with Deno.writeFile</span></span>
<span id="cb4-18"><a href="#cb4-18"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-read=awesome.txt my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-19"><a href="#cb4-19"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-write=awesome.txt my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-20"><a href="#cb4-20"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-21"><a href="#cb4-21"></a><span># Enable subprocess execution with Deno.run</span></span>
<span id="cb4-22"><a href="#cb4-22"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-run my-application.ts</span>
<span id="cb4-23"><a href="#cb4-23"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-24"><a href="#cb4-24"></a><span># Disable all security checks</span></span>
<span id="cb4-25"><a href="#cb4-25"></a><span>deno</span> run --allow-all my-application.ts</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="built-in-utilities">Built-in utilities:</h3>
<p>In Deno, we have some nice tools available out of the box. This means that we don’t need to install any additional libraries for some common development tasks. At a glance, these utilities are:</p>
<p><strong>Debugger:</strong> Like Node, Deno supports the V8 Inspector Protocol, which means that it’s possible to debug the program in any client that supports it. This consists mainly of two commands:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span># Debugging flags</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>#   --inspect      : Allows debugger attachment at any point</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a><span>#   --inspect-brk  : Pause execution on first line</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span># Usage:</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a><span>deno</span> run --inspect-brk</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From this point, all you have to do is open your client and the program will stop on the first line, allowing you to set up breakpoints where you need to. For VSCode you can add the entry point and arguments to your <code>launch.json</code> to enable it.</p>
<p><strong>Formatter:</strong> In Node.js applications, it’s common to add a linter tool (typically ESLint) with a formatter like Prettier so the code is standardized. Deno has this feature built into it. You can access it by simply running <code>deno fmt</code></p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>deno</span> fmt          <span>#Formats everything in the current tree</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>deno</span> fmt file1.ts <span>#Formats a single file</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a><span>deno</span> fmt --check  <span># Checks if files are formatted correctly</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bundler:</strong> Bundling is a task that is currently done with webpack, gulp or Grunt in Node.js applications. We can use Deno’s bundler when we want to pack a module together with its dependencies and this will generate a single module we can reference from other files. These bundles can also be loaded in the web browser.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>deno</span> bundle https://foo.bar/test.ts test.bundle.js</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that, we can import it from another JavaScript file or using a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in our HTML with the <code>type=”module”</code> property.</p>
<p><strong>Dependency inspector:</strong> We can display a tree structure of our dependencies using the <code>deno info</code> command, followed by the URL we want to inspect. This is similar to <code>npm ls</code> in Node</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>deno</span> info https://deno.land/std/uuid/test.ts</span>

<h3 id="asynchronous-handling">Asynchronous handling:</h3>
<p>JavaScript asynchronous operations have evolved over time. The standard way of making an asynchronous call was through the use of callbacks. Recently we’ve gotten better ways to handle these operations, by using Promises, async/await syntax or generators. For that reason, Deno has taken advantage of these modern features.</p>
<p>All async actions in Deno return a promise. This is interesting because the <code>await</code> keyword is supported on the top level and there is no need to define the function with the <code>async</code> keyword. This approach allows us to write more readable code when working with asynchronism.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>// Await some asynchronous operation</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>let</span> file <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>open</span>(<span>'./my-file.txt'</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a><span>// Awaiting when starting the server</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a><span>import</span> <span>{</span> serve <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a><span>const</span> server <span>=</span> <span>serve</span>(<span>{</span> port<span>:</span> <span>3000</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><a href="#cb9-9"></a><span>for</span> <span>await</span> (<span>const</span> req <span>of</span> server)<span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10"><a href="#cb9-10"></a>  <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>respond</span>(<span>{</span> body<span>:</span> <span>'Running server!!'</span> <span>}</span>)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-11"><a href="#cb9-11"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Deno supports promises out of the box. In the first example, the <code>await</code> keyword waits until <code>Deno.open</code> is resolved and its result is stored in the <code>file</code> variable. In the second example, <code>server</code> is an async iterator and the <code>for await</code> keywords are used to iterate them, each item will be a new incoming request.</p>

<p>Deno has incredible features, but there are two points that I think can be improved: - The permission flags could be handled in a different way like using a file that allows us to set the flags. If your code needs almost all the permissions you will have to use a long command. However, this is not a big issue on itself. - About the dependencies, NodeJS has a better project organization and the <code>lock</code> file is generated automatically. With Deno your dependencies will be placed in one directory, and to lock the dependencies you need to run an additional command. This might not be a good developer experience, but the community is working on some alternatives to change this.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to mention is regarding the examples and tutorials. On the NodeJS side, you can find a lot of examples/tutorials of any library or functionality you may need, while with Deno there are few examples/tutorials. But it will increase in the future for sure.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://github.com/stackbuilders/deno-example">link</a> you will find a small example using Deno and Typescript that shows how to create routes with the <code>oak</code> module, submit data from a form and generate a CSV file with the provided data.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Deno is a good alternative for increasing security that allows us to use TypeScript without extra configurations or …</p></div></div>

<p>DENVER, CO — Oct 27, 2020 — Application security startup StackHawk announced today that it has raised a $10 million in Series A funding. The pre-emptive, oversubscribed round was led by <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire Ventures</a> and included return seed backers Foundry Group, Costanoa Ventures, Flybridge Capital, and Matchstick Ventures. Launched just over a year ago, StackHawk has seen significant demand as a platform that helps developers implement security testing before applications are pushed into production — a trend in the industry known as “shifting security left.”</p>



<p>With widespread adoption of DevOps over the past decade, companies are shipping software to production more frequently than before, with many companies pushing to production multiple times per day. The traditional models of application security testing such as quarterly penetration tests or scheduled scans of the production application have struggled to keep up with this shift, resulting in inefficiencies and increased risk exposure. Modern companies, however, are integrating application security into their DevOps practices, checking for vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle. This approach vastly shortens the time to find and fix vulnerabilities, leading to efficient development and secure applications.</p>



<p>StackHawk is an application security testing platform that allows DevOps teams to instrument automated dynamic application security testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline. With this approach, engineering teams can instrument automated testing with every pull request, ensuring that vulnerabilities are caught long before they hit production. And with a strong focus on features for software developers, application security can scale across the engineering organization, creating significant efficiencies in fixing security bugs.</p>



<p>Adrián Moreno Peña, Tech Lead at VanMoof, describes the company’s use of StackHawk, “At VanMoof we work fast and lean, in a DevOps-way of working with empowered teams using smart tools to handle their work. It was about time to find InfoSec tools that fit with our vision — high productivity tools, flexible, adaptable and created with developers in mind. Using StackHawk we can make our security improvement process transparent, actionable and easy to understand for each developer in the team, applying best practices and preventing security issues from going to production.”</p>



<p>The modern approach to application security also resonates with Katie Teitler, industry analyst at TAG Cyber. “Coming early into the development lifecycle is an attractive proposition, both for development lifecycles and for security teams,” said Teitler. “Since the platform is lightweight and quick to deploy through Docker, devs should feel instantly comfortable with it.”</p>



<p>The StackHawk founding team has leveraged their backgrounds in DevOps and security to build the product that puts application security in developer’s hands. Joni Klippert, StackHawk founder &amp; CEO, has spent the past decade building DevOps products, most recently as the VP, Product at VictorOps (acquired by Splunk).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital Transformation has allowed for automation of many tasks associated with building, delivering and operating software in production. DevOps automation enables companies to deliver business value to their customers faster than ever before,” said Klippert. “However, security practices are not keeping up with the speed of modern software delivery. StackHawk empowers software engineers to deliver secure software to their customers at the speed of DevOps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The focus on integrating into the modern engineering workflow and building features for developers was a leading factor for Sapphire to lead the round. “With the rise of DevOps, companies have shifted to the frequent release of software and reliance on automation. How companies approach application security should be no different,” says David Hartwig, Managing Director at Sapphire Ventures. “We believe that StackHawk has the product and the team in place, led by Founder and CEO Joni Klippert, to deliver on developer-first automated application security testing in the DevOps pipeline, and we are excited to partner with them along their journey.”</p>



<p>With the additional capital, StackHawk will continue product development, invest in go-to-market teams, and continue to support ZAP, the open source project that the company’s platform is built upon.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>About StackHawk</strong><br>StackHawk, an application security SaaS startup in Denver, CO, empowers engineers to easily find and fix application security bugs at any stage of software development.

      <section id="main_content">
        
<p>This is a brief blog post describing my experience with automating Photoshop using Python.
I am an experienced software developer, but had never really used Photoshop before. As you can tell from my wonderful programmer art in this post ;)</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop-cc-vbs-ref.pdf">Adobe documentation</a> my work was based on.</p>

<p>Here’s a link to <a href="https://github.com/loonghao/photoshop-python-api">another project</a> that could also be of interest. <strong>I have not used their code,</strong> but it looks very promising.</p>

<p>The sample code and repo source code have been <strong>tested on Python 2.7</strong>, but should work fine on Python 3.
<a href="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation">Source code</a></p>

<h2 id="generating-images">Generating images</h2>
<p>Some time ago we needed a solution to be able to quickly generate some product images using Photoshop.</p>

<p>The graphic designer wanted to combine 2 images into a final product image to be used for display their products online.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An environment image (PSD file).</li>
  <li>An object image (jpg).</li>
  <li>Combine the above images into a product image (jpg).</li>
</ul>

<p>This was done manually in Photoshop and as expected was very time consuming and error prone.</p>

<p>The scenario described for generating an image might seem very simple, <strong>why use Photoshop at all, right?</strong> PIL, Skimage, OpenCV would work fine! Well in this case, there were some very fine transformations and image processing being done in Photoshop and the graphic designer needed all these features required in order to generate high-quality images using filter, shears and other exotic (for me at least) visual effects.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation/blob/gh-pages/Combine_2_images.png?raw=true" alt="Combination of 2 images"></p>

<h2 id="smart-objects">Smart objects?</h2>
<p>Prior to my involvement, the graphic designer had been looking for a way to simplify and automate this image generation process.
An important feature that would be key to this work is the concept of <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/photoshop/using/create-smart-objects.html">Smart Objects</a></p>

<p><strong>Smart objects</strong> in Photoshop allow you to ‘link’ 2 or more PSD files. Any changes made to the linked PSD are automatically made to any PSD linking to it!
Basically you create a PSD file, and have one of the layers be a Smart Object. Then you link that Smart Object layer to another PSD.
Afterwards when you open the background image and the product image in Photoshop, <strong>any changes you make to the product image, also are made in the background image</strong>.</p>

<p>Another cool thing about Smart Objects: <strong>all the transformations within the Smart Object layer are preserved</strong>, regardless of the changes you make to the source PSD.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/kelvin0/ImageAutomation/blob/gh-pages/smart_objects_update.png?raw=true" alt="Smart Objects workflow"></p>

<p><strong>This requires:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each background image (PSD) must contain a layer with a Smart Object.</li>
  <li>The Smart Object layer has  to be linked to a default image (PSD).</li>
  <li>Works best if both PSD files reside in same directory.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The manual steps for generating a final product image becomes:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the background image in Photoshop (mountains).</li>
  <li>Open the default product image in Photoshop (ball).</li>
  <li>Open the desired product image in Photoshop (star).</li>
  <li>Copy the desired product image into the default product image. This updates the Smart Object.</li>
  <li>Save the background image as JPEG. This is our final image we want to generate with mountains and the star.</li>
  <li>Repeat this for every background/product combination image we want to generate.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="python-and-com">Python and COM</h2>
<p>As mentionned at the beginning, we will be using the Photoshop COM programming interface.
The <a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/photoshop/pdfs/photoshop-cc-vbs-ref.pdf">Photoshop reference PDF</a> will be our guide in writing our automation scripts. Of course we could be doing this directly in VB script, but it is much more fun (and productive!) to use Python.</p>

<p>Here’s a basic sample that opens an image in Photoshop.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>win32com.client</span>

<span># This actually fires up Photoshop if not already running.
</span><span>ps</span> <span>=</span> <span>win32com</span><span>.</span><span>client</span><span>.</span><span>Dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>"Photoshop.Application"</span><span>)</span>

<span># Open an image file (PSD in our case)
</span><span>doc</span> <span>=</span> <span>ps</span><span>.</span><span>Open</span><span>(</span><span>r"X:\Path\To\My.psd"</span><span>)</span>
<span># ... do something ...
</span><span>doc</span><span>.</span><span>Close</span><span>()</span>

<span>ps</span><span>.</span><span>Quit</span><span>()</span> <span># Stops the Photoshop application
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>This works on Windows, but some other scripting language might be more appropriate for Mac OS.
We will not be covering other platforms.</p>

<p><strong>There is no headless mode when running Python/COM automation scripts.</strong></p>

<p>Each script command actually translates to an action you see happen on the screen.
I will get into this and other annoyances later.</p>

<h2 id="basic-recipe">Basic Recipe</h2>

<p>Here is some basic sample code that illustrates the automated steps to generate our final product image, which is a star on a background of mountains.</p>

<p>Notice also that we duplicate the PSD documents once we open them. We do this in order not to accidentally change and save the original PSD files.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> working with Photoshop’s object containers is different than native Python lists and tuples. The indices are <strong>1-based</strong>, so the first element of container has index=1 (as opposed to index=0 as per usual).</p>

<h2 id="watch-out">Watch out!</h2>
<p>As mentionned earlier, even though there are quite a few advantages to automating with Photoshop, there are also quite a few points to consider.</p>

<p>Photoshop scripts require running an actual instance of Photoshop and it’s <strong>main window will be visible on the desktop</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Photoshop window should not be minimized while running a script.</strong> This might actually block Photoshop, and prevent your automated task from running properly.</p>

<p>If you make use of <strong>Copy/Paste commands in your script, this will hijack your clipboard</strong>, and prevent any other user/application from using it properly.</p>

<p><strong>Photoshop tends to hang/freeze/crash periodically.</strong> The crashes are frequent on big batches of images and don’t seem to be related to RAM/CPU usage. Just restart your script and it will eventually run to completion just fine. Regardless of crashes, <strong>you can still make huge productivity gains from automating some tasks.</strong></p>

<p>For all these reasons, we <strong>highly recommend that any automated tasks you create should run on a dedicated Windows PC.</strong> You don’t need a high end PC for most tasks and this will definitely make everyone more productive.</p>

<h2 id="hope-this-was-useful">Hope this was useful</h2>
<p>Of course, most of the code and samples discussed here are related to the specific use case described.
Almost all Photoshop commands can be scripted this way. The sample code should help you get started, and more details can be found in Photoshop scripting reference.
<strong>If you need any help with your project, we will gladly share our expertise if required!</strong></p>

    <p>
      Proposition 24 is a 52-page law that overhauls privacy laws in California. It's so complex that it has split the privacy community, and experts disagree about what it would mean for Californians. Most voices agree Prop 24 has some changes to love, and some to reject. The typical voter is probably very uncertain about whether to vote "Yes" or "No".
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <strong>San Diego Privacy</strong>, a small group of privacy advocates in San Diego, and we'd like to help by offering a neutral analysis. Below you'll find 10 of the biggest issues with Prop 24, along with the main points supporters (the "Yes" side) and opponents (the "No" side) make about that issue.
    </p>
    <p>We suggest you first pick the issues in purple that jump out to you the most. Then, keep count of whether you find the Yes side or the No side more compelling, for the issues you've picked. Last, total up your counts.</p>
    <p>Then, as always, go vote your values.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Update</i></strong>: When you pick the issues below that matter to you, consider <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FSWtcqBEbe-SOUUWZ9d7j_M3Ft1ap5CR?usp=sharing" target="_blank">downloading a shareable image</a> of that issue as well, and posting it on social media to generate discussion.</p>

            <p>I feel strongly about <strong>Pay For Privacy</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Pay for Privacy</strong> means that if you demand privacy, companies can charge you more for goods and services.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Companies that rely on targeted advertising, like newspapers or free streaming music services, currently rely on targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Some privacy options allow you to block the ability to show you targeted ads.</li>
                <li>Pay-for-privacy is already allowed in existing California law.</li>

                </p>
                <p>
                   When interviewed, Prop 24 author Alastair Mactaggart warns the newspaper industry would be hit hard if pay-for-privacy options were blocked. (<a href="https://youtu.be/eWOFZOPJm78?t=2186" target="_blank">Union-Tribune video interview</a> with Yes on 24)

                  <li>Argues privacy is a constitutional right of Californians; it is not for sale.</li>
                  <li>Warns Prop 24 further emboldens businesses to charge consumers for privacy.</li>

        Authors' Note: It's important to emphasize here that pay-for-privacy is already allowed in current law. Opponents see Prop 24's choice to further expand pay-for-privacy, rather than ban it, as one reason to oppose it.

            <p>I feel strongly about <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Global Opt-Out</strong> allows you to set up your privacy options in one place, and have them apply universally. Prop 24 allows companies to ignore those global settings, in some cases.

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>In the future, you'll be able to set your privacy preferences in one place, rather than at each site or service.</li>
                <li>Prop 24 includes provisions for allowing companies to ignore your global privacy preferences for certain reasons, like if they want you to pay.</li>
                <li>There could be other reasons companies won't have to respect your global privacy preferences.</li>

            <p>I'm concerned about privacy law <strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
            <div>
              <p>
                Current privacy laws in California are rarely <strong>enforced.</strong> Only the California Attorney General can enforce California's privacy laws.

              <ul>
                <li>California previous privacy agency was previously closed during budget cuts.</li>
                <li>The California attorney general has signaled that they don't have enough resources for enforcement.</li>
                <li>The California attorney general has asked the legislature to allow individuals the right to sue to enforce their privacy.</li>

                <li>Argues individuals should be able to sue companies to enforce their privacy choices, but Prop 24 left that out.</li>
                  <li>Believes the new enforcement agency established by Prop 24 would be underfunded and ineffective.</li>

        Authors' Note: Privacy advocates feel very strongly that Californians should have the "private right of action," or the right to sue companies to enforce privacy law. It seems to us unlikely that privacy organizations will support overhauls to California's privacy laws without that private right of action being included.

                Prop 24 is a 52-page law with so much complexity that even experts disagree on its meaning. It was written privately and then submitted directly to voters.

		<p>For the past 15 years I’ve been a very opinionated PC gamer, along with the rest of my family. However it’s always been a pain in some shape or form to <em>be</em> a PC gamer, be it with the constant software updates, the lack of first-party support, or just the general cost. I’m one of these people that has stuck to good old Windows 7 because a mobile UI on my gaming PC is what I imagine hell to be. I’ve had no problems thus far, but there are more and more 10-only games coming out by the day, and some of them are enticing an upgrade.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there has been a LOT of activity around Wine and Vulkan to get Windows games running on Linux, to the point where I scheduled some time this Christmas break to give it a shot. My goal was to run the few games I actually wanted to play (Elite Dangerous, Minecraft, Subnautica, Garry’s Mod) on Linux on a spare computer before the 25th, whilst also proving to my family of gamers that it was time to “break the glass” and get away from the proprietary OS.</p>
<h2 id="by-the-way-i-tried-to-use-arch">By the way I tried to use Arch</h2>

<p><a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/2018-12-24-003401_1440x900_scrot.jpg"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/2018-12-24-003401_1440x900_scrot_hue660b04f3b99512430f28cfa69e907e7_222930_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian.jpg" title="Desktop"></a></p><p>I don’t think it’s possible to ever finish installing Arch, you just get more things configured (and broken) over time. I started this week trying to set up a system with Steam installed and Linux compatible games running. It took a full day’s work to get through the numerous issues I encountered, but I eventually had Garry’s Mod launching, albeit with some weird error about <code>en_US.UTF8</code> not being available.</p>
<p>At that point, I wasn’t at all happy with the setup. I had a very minimal i3, a very broken version of Steam with all sorts of rendering issues, and one native Linux game limping along. I installed LXDE so that I had a window manager that cooperated with the concept of full screen graphics applications, but even with my high tolerance for outdated looking UIs I still couldn’t help but dislike the default theme. I spent a good few hours fixing that but it was still uncomfortable to use.</p>
<p>I tried setting up <a href="https://lutris.net/">Lutris</a> too. They recommend installing wine-staging which is no problem on Arch because you just grab the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wine-staging-git/">wine-staging AUR package</a> and job done. However I still couldn’t get it to launch any games due to all sorts of missing dependencies in Wine (and maybe due to my Donegal internet too).</p>
<p>When I realized I needed to install most 32 bit versions for everything I accepted defeat. It was going to be too much hassle to configure + maintain an Arch gaming install, and I’d never want to reload that machine. I took a night to think about it, then I broke up with Arch in the morning.</p>
<h2 id="solus-is-new-bae">Solus is new bae</h2>
<p>Whilst I was browsing around on Lutris, Reddit, and some other sites I kept seeing mentions of this new Debian based distro with some real fancy window manager. With my lack of motivation to do configuration myself my requirements were now very different as to when I picked Arch. However, with the need for a very new version of Steam + Wine in order to play games I needed something that had either frequent updates or a way to easily update manually.</p>
<p>The Solus website looked very appealing. “Designed for Home Computing”. Last time I read that I set up Mint on my granny’s laptop, and I don’t think she used it since. However something about the material design of its site and UI made me think it was at least worth a shot.</p>
<p>I downloaded the ISO, booted up a computer, and in about 10 minutes I had a running machine. This PC does have an SSD in it, but even so it took just 4 seconds to boot to the login screen! My mentality of it needing to be Arch to boot fast went right out the window.</p>
<p>I logged in and a lot of things were just working, which was great, but then again my expectations were very low coming from Arch. There was a remarkable lack of shit installed by default. LibreOffice is there but not GIMP, and there’s only 1 video player instead of 4. As a result I didn’t spend any time undoing defaults, which I had fully expected from a “home computing” distribution.</p>
<h2 id="who-needs-terminals">Who Needs Terminals?</h2>
<p>I got Steam and Proton installed again, this time with no hassle because I used the Solus Software Centre and it just worked. Whilst that was downloading I copied Garry’s Mod over from another Windows computer on the network through the file manager because apparently it just supports CIFS out of the box. I launched that game no problem, so then I started looking at Lutris again.</p>
<p>I was under the impression that I was going to need Lutris to play basically anything that wasn’t a Steam native Linux game. It turns out that is not entirely true. My next game goal was Elite Dangerous, so I copied it over the network too and Steam picked it up fine. Testing my luck I just hit “play” with the Steam Proton version set to the latest beta, but it did absolutely nothing. Then I tried launching it through Lutris. I got a bit suspicious when I saw the Steam install downloader pop up, and then I realized it was creating its own “prefix” for Steam Windows under Wine, ignoring the system version I had installed entirely.</p>
<p>So I wasn’t going to use Lutris for Elite then, and I got a bit worried. If it didn’t launch through Steam would it work at all? I searched around and saw lots of people trying to get it to work, and then I found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/150">this Github issue</a> which lead to <a href="https://github.com/redmcg/wine/releases/tag/ED_Proton_3.16-6_Beta">this forked repo release</a>. With that, I had the game running flawlessly in like 20 minutes, and I even <a href="https://twitter.com/m1cr0m4n/status/1076614809414782976">tweeted about it</a>.</p>
<p>Other than installing the ED Proton fork, I had no need for a terminal during this process. I call that a testament to this OS. Generally, I only need a terminal when something breaks or something is more easily/quickly done at the prompt. My point being that if you were a Windows gamer trying to justify the conversion, you can rest assured that there is no need for any prior knowledge of Linux, or maybe even computers, to pull this off.</p>
<h2 id="real-work-on-solus">Real Work on Solus</h2>

<p><a href="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/Screenshot%20from%202018-12-24%2001-20-04.jpg"><img src="https://m1cr0man.com/posts/gaming-on-linux/images/Screenshot%20from%202018-12-24%2001-20-04_huc4494bcc592d409b6b1867b12478b696_518421_0x384_resize_q85_gaussian.jpg" title="Solus"></a></p><p>It’s been so long since I used a “real” distro I can’t really separate what is unique to Solus from the common features you get nowadays. Setting up my networking and audio was painless. It’s Network Manager based networking with that regular GNOME GUI you see everywhere. You can control your audio volumes per-application from the pop out side bar in the UI. I noticed whilst I was installing all sorts of random stuff that the Solus not-a-start-menu was populating shortcuts and categories for everything. Also once I got the Nvidia driver installed everything like moving windows around was silky smooth. Honestly, I don’t think I want to use i3 any more.</p>
<p>With this level of confidence, I even went and setup my browser, IRC client, and a bunch of other stuff I would only do if I was committed to an install. What I wanted to try next was remote desktop gaming using TurboVNC, and I immediately encountered a problem. TurboVNC wasn’t in Solus' repositories so I was going to have to build it myself. I’m so glad I did.</p>
<p>Solus has a really nice YAML based system for developing packages. It does 90% of the work for you which is awesome. It will setup a build environment in a chroot, install dependencies, run commands, and generate a package all based on this one package.yaml. Their documentation on this setup is quite easy to follow, but I did pop into their IRC for a few questions.</p>
<p>I ended up building 3 packages for TVNC + its dependencies, and it didn’t take too long. From talking to a few developers and package maintainers, I’m quite tempted to submit + maintain these packages for Solus too. This blog post isn’t going to be about remote desktop gaming though so I’ll leave that for another day.</p>
<h2 id="convincing-the-family">Convincing the Family</h2>
<p>Over this weekend I played around 8 hours of Elite, whilst on Discord, on this really weirdly spec’d computer with an i3 2100 and a GTX 970. I had zero issues, both in setup and performance, and I spent way more time actually playing the games than I expected to.</p>
<p>When I mention the idea of using Linux to my brother, I always get an immediate no. “It’s for geeks”, “I can’t code”, “X won’t run on it”. I was able to prove him wrong on at least 2 of his points, but really it would be so much better if we all ran Linux. One of the biggest problems we have at the moment is that every time we make a significant hardware change to one of our computers, we have to reload the OS. We wouldn’t have to do that if we were running Solus on all the PCs. Also, Windows 7 isn’t exactly secure anymore. It hasn’t got real updates in like 2 years now, and we have turned them off before that to avoid breaking some games relying on old DRM (read: Securom) technology.</p>
<p>I don’t think it is going to take me much longer to convert every one given how much faster, simpler and prettier running a modern Linux distribution is. So long as I can prove that new and old games will work fine and continue to work when I’m not around I might be in for a chance of having a standardized boot image on all of our computers. This is appealing because living in Donegal you can’t be doing any sort of updates whilst playing games online otherwise your ping will go through the roof. You still have to do updates at some point, the question is how many times do you have to do them.</p>
<p>I’ll continue to test more games and work out a way I can easily deploy an entire Linux gaming setup to more computers. It is already exceptionally simple, but I need a turnkey solution to running Windows games on Steam that I can hand to people that have no idea what <code>ls</code> does.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This tutorial will help you to get up and running with Speechly by guiding you through the process of building a simple voice filtering web app with Speechly and React.</p>
<p>You can find the source code for this tutorial <a href="https://github.com/speechly/react-example-repo-filtering">on GitHub</a> and you can also try out the final result <a href="http://speechly.github.io/react-example-repo-filtering/">hosted on GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Since we’ll be using <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started">create-react-app</a> for this tutorial, we’ll need the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js 8.10+</li>
<li>npm 5.2+</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this tutorial also uses TypeScript, so feel free to check out <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs">TypeScript documentation</a> if you’re not familiar with it.</p>
<h3 id="1-creating-an-app">1. Creating an app</h3>
<p>Let’s get started by creating an app and installing its dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">npx create-react-app speechly-voice-filter --typescript
<span>cd</span> speechly-voice-filter
npm i
</code></pre></div><p>Now that you’ve created the app, you can check it out by running <code>npm start</code> - it should open a browser tab with your app running in it.</p>
<h3 id="2-adding-data-and-layout">2. Adding data and layout</h3>
<p>Since we are building a filtering app, let’s add some data to filter and layout to display it.</p>
<p>To make it simple, our data source will be just a static array with some popular repositories on GitHub. Let’s add the following code and save it as <code>src/data.ts</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ts"><span>export</span> type Repository <span>=</span> {

<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;

<p>Before we proceed with the app, let’s take a quick detour and train a very simple and not very useful Speechly app, so that we can use it to test our integration later on.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://speechly.com/dashboard">https://speechly.com/dashboard</a> and login (or sign up if you haven’t yet) and create a new app (you can <a href="https://www.speechly.com/docs/quick-start/">check our Speechly Dashboard quickstart guide</a> if you feel lost). Feel free to use any configuration you want, even an almost empty configuration with just “Hello world” will suffice, but make sure your app is deployed!</p>

<p>Once you have your Speechly app deployed, let’s integrate it. Start by installing Speechly React client:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">npm i --save @speechly/react-client
</code></pre></div><p>The client exposes a context provider and a hook that allows you to consume that context. Let’s add the context provider to <code>src/App.tsx</code>. Make sure you provide the <code>App ID</code> of your Speechly app as a property for <code>SpeechProvider</code>!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { SpeechProvider } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<span>import</span> <span>"./App.css"</span>;

<span>function</span> App()<span>:</span> JSX.Element {

    <span>&lt;</span><span>/div&gt;</span>
  );
}

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> App;
</code></pre></div><p>Next, let’s add some code to act as the microphone button. Also, it would be nice to see what we are saying, so let’s also render the transcript next to the button for some feedback. Let’s make that a separate component and save it as <code>src/Microphone.tsx</code>:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, this component renders a button that calls the <code>onRecord</code> callback passed in the properties and uses the state of Speechly client to determine when to enable the button and which text to use as its label. In addition to that, the component also renders the transcript of the phrase by assembling individual transcripted words from a segment (check out <a href="https://www.speechly.com/docs/speechly-api/#understanding-server-responses">this article in our documentation</a> for more information about how SLU API works). Since a word can be either tentative (i.e., its value can change as the API receives more audio data) or final, we use bold text to highlight final words.</p>
<p>One more step - we’d need to render our component and hook it up to the API. Let’s add it to our <code>SpeechApp</code> component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="tsx"><span>import</span> React from <span>"react"</span>;
<span>import</span> { useSpeechContext } from <span>"@speechly/react-client"</span>;

<span>import</span> { repositories } from <span>"./data"</span>;

<span>import</span> { RepoList } from <span>"./RepoList"</span>;
<span>import</span> { Microphone } from <span>"./Microphone"</span>;

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> SpeechApp: <span>React.FC</span> <span>=</span> ()<span>:</span> JSX.Element <span>=&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> { toggleRecording, speechState, segment } <span>=</span> useSpeechContext();

  <span>return</span> (
    <span>&lt;</span>div<span>&gt;</span>

Peterson</a></strong>&nbsp;is a Canadian clinical psychologist and psychology professor at the University of Toronto who became a controversial figure in late-2016 for his critiques of political correctness. Peterson’s most recent book, 12 Rules for Life, has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. Most recently, Peterson has suffered from health issues that necessitated a year-long reprieve from the public eye.</p><h4><strong>Success compounds, meaning those that win tend to continue to win</strong></h4><p>Lobsters are interesting animals, but most people don’t think about them too often. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/">While they may not be immortal as many like to think</a>, they never stop growing and can regenerate lost limbs. Unfortunately for them, they taste good with butter - but let’s circle back to lobsters here in a minute.</p><p>In the early 1900s, an Italian engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher (but he was probably no fun at parties, so you got him there) named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto#Economic_concepts">Vilfredo Pareto</a> became fascinated by the ideas of wealth and power - namely, how is wealth distributed across society? (Interestingly, he did not start this work until his forties, <a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/takeaway-friday-a-stoic-philosopher">so it is never too late to make a difference</a>.)</p><p>Ever diligent, he pulled data from the 1400s through his modern times and found the same pattern everywhere. Whereas people had previously assumed that wealth would be distributed in a flat, upward-sloping line from poor to rich, what Pareto found was in fact a hockey stick - a small percentage of the population holds a majority of the wealth.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fcb31aa6-3ff3-4fba-b50a-82da1fb89f75_700x400.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:700,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:110387,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>This kind of distribution - the most successful / most productive / largest “winners” continuously having a greater chunk of the pie - can be seen across many different fields.</p><blockquote><p>That same brutal principle of unequal distribution applies outside the financial domain—indeed, anywhere that creative production is required. The majority of scientific papers are published by a very small group of scientists. A tiny proportion of musicians produces almost all the recorded commercial music. Just a handful of authors sell all the books. A million and a half separately titled books (!) sell each year in the US. However, only five hundred of these sell more than a hundred thousand copies. Similarly, just four classical composers (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky) wrote almost all the music played by modern orchestras. Bach, for his part, composed so prolifically that it would take decades of work merely to hand-copy his scores, yet only a small fraction of this prodigious output is commonly performed...</p><p>It also applies to the population of cities (a very small number have almost all the people), the mass of heavenly bodies (a very small number hoard all the matter), and the frequency of words in a language (90 percent of communication occurs using just 500 words), among many other things. Sometimes it is known as the Matthew Principle (Matthew 25:29), derived from what might be the harshest statement ever attributed to Christ: “to those who have everything, more will be given; from those who have nothing, everything will be taken.”</p></blockquote><p>This idea was further expanded in the mid-1900s when British physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price">Derek Price</a> noticed that certain of his colleague were prolific publishers and others - well, not so much. In fact, Price could fit most domains of publication to a “law” stating that half of all papers are written by the square root of the number of all writers - if you had 100 papers written by 25 people, 50 papers would have been written by only 5 individuals. If it was 1,000 papers and 250 people, 500 papers were written by only 16 people. Thus, there was always an active minority generating the majority of the work.</p><p>These results can be understood as it relates to the compounding effects of resources - those that have previously “won” generally have access to the greatest resources and can more easily utilize those resources to achieve additional success. Those without resources cannot. </p><p>Thus, resources beget additional resources while losing resources restricts your ability to gain resources in the future - <em>winners are more likely to win again, and losers more likely to lose</em>.</p><p>However, there is also something going on in the brain that makes those that win more likely to pursue meaningful, productive activities again in the future.</p><h4>Your brain is aware of where you are within the winner-loser continuum and makes plans based on where it thinks you sit</h4><p>Back to the lobsters. Lobsters live in a cold, brutal world where things such as ideal lobster nests (think “safe hiding places”) and access to food are both paramount and scarce. This scarcity can result in conflict. So how do you determine which lobsters lay claim to the best nests?</p><p>As you might have guessed, they fight for them - and Peterson goes into detail on lobster confrontation rituals in his book. Important to this conversation is what happens in the brains of lobsters that win and lobsters that lose.</p><blockquote><p>A lobster loser’s brain chemistry differs importantly from that of a lobster winner. This is reflected in their relative postures. Whether a lobster is confident or cringing depends on the ratio of two chemicals that modulate communication between lobster neurons: serotonin and octopamine. Winning increases the ratio of the former to the latter.</p><p>A lobster with high levels of serotonin and low levels of octopamine is a cocky, strutting sort of shellfish, much less likely to back down when challenged. This is because serotonin helps regulate postural flexion. A flexed lobster extends its appendages so that it can look tall and dangerous, like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti Western…</p><p>High serotonin/low octopamine characterizes the victor. The opposite neurochemical configuration, a high ratio of octopamine to serotonin, produces a defeated-looking, scrunched-up, inhibited, drooping, skulking sort of lobster, very likely to hang around street corners, and to vanish at the first hint of trouble.</p></blockquote><p>The lobster’s brain knows whether it just lost or won a fight. The victor confidently holds himself up high and the loser shirks from potential conflict. And this makes sense - it is advantageous to your survival to avoid conflict if you tend to lose because 1) you tend to lose and 2) having lost, you now have access to less advantageous resources (food and shelter). The winner is confident in his access to resources and knows, based on experience, that he can win future fights.</p><p>These changes in how the lobster orients itself to the world start deep within its brain, with levels of serotonin driving physical changes in the external lobster. This brain infrastructure is very similar to what sits inside humans, who also take into account where they are in the “tend to win and have resources / tend to lose and don’t have resources” continuum.</p><blockquote><p>The part of our brain that keeps track of our position in the dominance hierarchy is therefore <a href="https://newsletter.butwhatfor.com/p/takeaway-tuesday-knowing-history">exceptionally ancient and fundamental</a>.&nbsp;It is a master control system, modulating our perceptions, values,&nbsp;emotions, thoughts and actions…</p><p>The ancient part of your brain specialized for assessing dominance watches how you are treated by other people. On that evidence, it renders a determination of your value and assigns you a status. If you are judged by your peers as of little worth, the counter restricts serotonin availability. That makes you much more physically and psychologically reactive to any circumstance or event that might produce emotion, particularly if it is negative. You need that reactivity. Emergencies are common at the bottom, and you must be ready to survive.</p></blockquote><p>If you are lower on the totem pole, being constantly prepared for emergencies eventually takes its toll on you given your orientation towards short-term survival at the expense of long-term success. It impacts everything, from the way your body allocates resources to its immune system (long-term investment) to your fight-or-flight response sensitivity (expensive short-term preparedness). </p><p>But this all makes sense for the competitive world our ancestors grew up in. </p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, that physical hyper-response, that constant alertness, burns up a lot of precious energy and physical resources. This response is really what everyone calls stress, and it is by no means only or even primarily psychological. It’s a reflection of the genuine constraints of unfortunate circumstances. When operating at the bottom, the ancient brain counter assumes that even the smallest unexpected&nbsp;impediment might produce an uncontrollable chain of negative events, which will have to be handled alone, as useful friends are rare indeed, on society’s fringes. You will therefore continually sacrifice what you could otherwise physically store for the future, using it up on heightened readiness and the possibility of immediate panicked action in the present… The physical demands of emergency preparedness will wear you down in every way.</p><p>If you have a high status, on the other hand, the counter’s cold, pre-reptilian mechanics assume that your niche is secure, productive and safe, and that you are well buttressed with social support. It thinks the chance that something will damage you is low and can be safely discounted. Change might be opportunity, instead of disaster. The serotonin flows plentifully. This renders you confident and calm, standing tall and straight, and much less on constant alert. Because your position is secure, the future is likely to be good for you. It’s worthwhile to think in the long term and plan for a better tomorrow.</p></blockquote><h4>Feedback loops can both hurt you and help you</h4><p>This whole process is an example of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis#:~:text=A%20single%20chemical%20reaction%20is,is%20called%20an%20autocatalytic%20reaction.">autocatalytic reaction</a> - a chemical reaction where one of the reaction products (in this case “losing”) …</p></div></div>

In fact, Tem published the first Notion website back in March 2020 (oh, how the world has changed). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Thanks in large to awesome projects like Super and Fruition, building websites on Notion became easier and faster. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Given the surge in popularity, I deciced to pen this comprehensive guide and create some duplicable blocks, so you can create your own Notion website in no time — enjoy 🙌</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="cc149452e88b42e8b29622443a589d9c"></span><span><span>🔑 An overview of the guide</span></span></h2><div id="c496b9ce8126498e85222feb210e850b"><div id="4e7f6e020650473a8d103736b9068090"><p><span><span>Making a landing page with Notion is easy to the point of enjoyable — you don't need any coding skills at all. It's also flexible — you can mix, match, and style various blocks to get the look and feel needed to present your idea (or product) just the right way.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This guide will walk you through every step of setting up your landing with Notion, publishing it to the web, adding analytics and custom styling. As a cherry on top, we've also curated 10 ready-made components that you can use to get your Notion landing page out in no time.</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="4b158c7e538e49518051b4d9b3d1f780"></span><span><span>🎯 Setting your landing page goals</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Landing pages are the best way to "sell" something, to tell people about a specific product, service or a resource, and make them do a specific action. </span></span></p><p><span><span>When user does an action, this is called "conversion", and usually landing pages are fine-tuned to get as much conversions as possible. Conversions could be anything: from subscribing to a newsletter or joining a community, to buying a product or a service. Landing pages can be purely informational, too. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Think what's the purpose of your page, and what the user needs to do to contribute.</span></span></p><h2><span id="cbfc301b7d274e27a06afc720d7eb511"></span><span><span>🤔 Deciding on what to show on the landing page</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Defining your goal was the hard part — after you know what action you want the user to make, it's easy to define what to show on your landing. </span></span></p><p><span><span>If they're subscribing to a newsletter, tell what it's about. If the goal is to grow a community, tell about the people already there and show what's the purpose of this community. If you're selling a product, focus on the value it offers and on core functionality. Don't forget call-to-actions to let the user actually realize their interest when they're convinced.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Take a look at </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demandcurve.com/#1opac8uusrjldfqjb39wpp">Demand Curve</a></span><span>'s landing page, for example. </span></span></p><div id="54fa9f431f9a45fc970d6e7fc90bf338"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>They're advertising their start-up program, focusing on what the program is about, how it's structured and why people learn valuable things during that program. It's all there — right on the first screen you can see the bullet points describing what the program is about (Growth Strategy, Ads, etc.).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Demand Curve's team also put a special emphasis on social proof — there's a ton of different testimonials and stories from people on the page.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes short landing pages that span 1-2 screens have higher conversion that longer ones, that span 3 and more screens. When you need your user to perform a simple action, like sharing their email, a short page works better. Short landings also make more sense for "warm" clients who already know what you are offering.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Longer landings with lots of information work better for "cold" clients, because they need more context. After you have an idea on what size is appropriate in your case, you can start experimenting with content.</span></span></p><h2><span id="3812d49b74904f9d961961ff3c8b07b9"></span><span><span>🖋️ Adding some content</span></span></h2><p><span><span>On a typical landing page, the information is arranged into standard "blocks" with valuable information:  there's an eye-catching Hero image, simple text blocks describing your value proposition, a call-to-action that lets you collect interest, and a footer with terms. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Like on </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.refactoringgrowth.com/">Refactoring Growth</a></span><span>'s landing page, you have an elaborate introduction, several sections with a value proposition (simple text) block and a picture or a graphic, a pricing block and a Call-to-Action.</span></span></p><div id="c32142c387d44b52b7995b22ae6c17c9"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>Optionally, you can add more useful stuff.

</span><span><span>Here's a step-by-step to get you going on Super:</span></span></span></p><ol><li id="30fa5f0ef68b4ad79354c951f1b9aba1"><span><span>Sign up, select a plan (essentially boils down to how many sites you need, keep in mind that one site can have many subpages, like any website on the Web)
</span></span></li><li id="787193987a0b4c7c95437a027e1bd716"><span><span>Select whether you want to make a static website out of your page, or go with a default Notion-based method. 

First option offers great performance, but doesn't allow for filtered views and calendars on your page. 

Default Notion page is relatively poor in terms of performance and SEO, but all Notion functionality will work and it's still enough for simple personal websites or pages where you don't need fast loading.
</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="e44a993f1fce466193429d780f87fd90"><span><span>Select your site name used in Super, a custom domain from a domain provider, and the URL to your original Notion page with the page set to public via the "Share" menu at the top ("Share" → "Share to the Web")
</span></span></li><li id="2aa6fd185ae9449084ed3674d150ac83"><span><span>Add one or more pretty URLs if you need them. By default, all the sub-pages you add inside your home page will have ugly Notion URLs. You can change that by providing links to sub-pages you want to add slugs to and specifying the slug (e.g. </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/preconceived">optemization.com/preconceived</a></span><span>)

This means you can use most of analytics solutions available.</span></span></p><p><span><span>For example, you can get your Fathom Analytics script to inject by going to Settings → Site → Site ID. Here's their own Fathom's </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usefathom.com/support/tracking">instruction</a></span><span>.

                                                  <div>
                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“We treated them for a month and the effect was quite amazing,” says Chen, explaining the drug was successful in reversing major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “We couldn’t tell the drug-treated disease models and the healthy models apart.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen, a Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher, is optimistic about the future of this research, noting the next step will be clinical trials in people.</span></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>“Legacy Code is code without tests”</p></blockquote><p>If you’ve come across that definition, it’s from Michael Feathers’ book: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=working+effectively+with+legacy+code">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a>.</p><p>While I have <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/what-is-legacy-code-is-it-code-without-tests/">a slightly extended definition</a>, this is a very valid and useful one!</p><p>Feathers’ book is from 2004. Yet, its content doesn’t get outdated. There is a reason for that and <a href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2019/03/13/like-a-good-wine">this CommitStrip</a> puts it best:</p><p><img src="https://understandlegacycode.com/assets/legacy-code-commitstrip.png" alt="Working Effectively with Legacy Code is like a good wine: it gets better with age"></p><p>This book is a reference. Probably THE reference.</p><p>When there’s a thread about Legacy Code, it doesn’t take long for someone to drop a comment suggesting you read it.</p><blockquote><p>I didn’t read it. I’ve seen it’s recommended. But what are the key points of that book?</p></blockquote><p>If that’s you, I got your back!</p><p>Here’s my summary of the salient points of the book and how they can help you deal with your existing codebase.</p><h2 id="first-add-tests-then-do-your-changes"><a href="#first-add-tests-then-do-your-changes" aria-label="first add tests then do your changes permalink"></a>First, add tests, then do your changes</h2><p>The challenge with changing existing code is to preserve the existing behavior.</p><p>When code is not tested, how do you know you didn’t break anything?</p><p>You need <strong>feedback</strong>. Automated feedback is the best. Thus, this is the first thing you need to do: write the tests.</p><p>Only then you’ll be safe to change the code and refactor.</p><p>Your goal is to get there. The point of the book is to show you <em>how</em> you can get there when you have to deal with an impossibly convoluted codebase. Which leads us to the next point…</p><h2 id="adding-tests-the-legacy-code-dilemma"><a href="#adding-tests-the-legacy-code-dilemma" aria-label="adding tests the legacy code dilemma permalink"></a>Adding tests: the Legacy Code dilemma</h2><p>Before you change code, you should have tests in place. But to put tests in place, you have to change code.</p><p>This is the paradox of Legacy Code!</p><p>So, how do you go about it? Are you doomed?</p><p>You’re not. But you should be extra careful until you got tests in place. You should perform minimal, safe refactorings.</p><p><strong>Change as little code as possible to get tests in place.</strong></p><p>The recipe is:</p><ol><li>Identify change points (Seams)</li><li>Break dependencies</li><li>Write the tests</li><li>Make your changes</li><li>Refactor</li></ol><p>Once you get to the tests, you know how to proceed. The first two points are the difficult ones.</p><h2 id="identify-seams-to-break-your-code-dependencies"><a href="#identify-seams-to-break-your-code-dependencies" aria-label="identify seams to break your code dependencies permalink"></a>Identify Seams to break your code dependencies</h2><p>Adding tests on the existing code can be challenging.</p><p>Hell, it’s usually a nightmare!</p><p>That’s because the code was not written to be <em>testable</em> in the first place. 99% of the time, this is a dependency problem: the code you want to test can’t run because it needs <em>something</em> hard to put in the test.</p><p>Sometimes it’s a database connection. Sometimes it’s a call to a third-party server. Sometimes it’s a parameter that’s complex to instantiate. Usually, it’s a complex mix of all that.</p><p>To test your code, you need to <strong>break these dependencies</strong> in the tests.</p><p>Therefore, you need to identify <strong>Seams</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>“A Seam is a place to alter program behavior, without changing the code.”</p></blockquote><p>There are different types of Seams. The gist of it is to identify how you can change the code behavior without touching the source code.</p><p>If your language is Object-Oriented, the most common and convenient Seam is an object.</p><p>Consider this piece of JavaScript code:</p><pre data-language="js" data-index="0"><p><code><span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>DatabaseConnector</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>// A lot of code…</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>connect</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>// Perform some calls to connect to the DB.</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></p></pre><p>Say the <code>connect()</code> method is causing you problems when you try to put code into tests. Well, the whole class is a Seam you can alter.</p><p>You can extend this class in tests to prevent it from connecting to an actual DB:</p><pre data-language="js" data-index="1"><p><code><span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>FakeDatabaseConnector</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>DatabaseConnector</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>connect</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>// Override the problematic calls to the DB</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Connect to the DB"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></p></pre><p>There are other kinds of Seams.</p><p>If your language allows you to change code behavior without altering the source code, you have an entry point to writing the tests.</p><p>Speaking about tests…</p><h2 id="unit-tests-are-fast-and-reliable"><a href="#unit-tests-are-fast-and-reliable" aria-label="unit tests are fast and reliable permalink"></a>Unit tests are fast and reliable</h2><p>Discussions about testing best practices usually turn into heated debates. Should you apply the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html">Pyramid of Tests</a> principle and write a maximum of unit tests? Or should you embrace <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests/">the Testing Trophy</a> instead and write mostly integration tests?</p><blockquote><p>Why are people giving contradictory advice?</p></blockquote><p>Because <strong>they don’t have the same definition of what a “unit” is</strong>. Thus, some people talk about “integration tests” when others talk about “unit tests”.</p><p>To avoid any confusion, Michael Feathers gives a clear definition of <strong>what is NOT</strong> a unit test.</p><p>In short, your test is not unit if:</p><ol><li>it doesn’t run fast (&lt; 100ms / test)</li><li>it talks to the Infrastructure (e.g. a database, the network, the file system, environment variables…)</li></ol><p>Write a maximum of tests that have these 2 qualities. How you call them doesn’t matter.</p><p>Now, sometimes it’s really hard to write such tests because you don’t even <em>understand</em> what the code is supposed to do. There’s a technique for that…</p><h2 id="characterization-tests"><a href="#characterization-tests" aria-label="characterization tests permalink"></a>Characterization tests</h2><p>Before you can refactor the code, you need tests. But writing these tests can be challenging. Especially when code is hard to understand.</p><blockquote><p>“A characterization test is a test that characterizes the actual behavior of a piece of code.”</p></blockquote><p>Instead of writing comprehensive unit tests, you capture the current behavior of the code. You take a snapshot of what it does.</p><p>The test ensures that this behavior doesn’t change!</p><p>This is very powerful because:</p><ol><li>With most systems, what the code <em>actually</em> does is more important than what it <em>should</em> do.</li><li>You can quickly cover Legacy Code with these tests, giving you a safety net to refactor.</li></ol><p>This technique is also called ”<em>Approval Testing</em>”, ”<em>Snapshot Testing</em>” or ”<em>Golden Master</em>” in the wild. Same stuff.</p><p>And I also blogged about it: <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/3-steps-to-add-tests-on-existing-code-when-you-have-short-deadlines">the 3 steps to add tests on Legacy Code when you have short deadlines</a>.</p><p>Having short deadlines is a very common situation. When you are in a hurry, it’s hard to take the time not to make things worse. Hopefully, there’s something you can do…</p><h2 id="use-sprout--wrap-techniques-to-add-code-when-you-dont-have-time-to-refactor"><a href="#use-sprout--wrap-techniques-to-add-code-when-you-dont-have-time-to-refactor" aria-label="use sprout  wrap techniques to add code when you dont have time to refactor permalink"></a>Use Sprout &amp; Wrap techniques to add code when you don’t have time to refactor</h2><p>Big lumps of code have a gravitational force. They <em>attract</em> more code.</p><p>It’s the Broken Window theory: a little disorder calls for more serious crimes. If the class is already 2,000 lines-long, who cares that you add 3 more <code>if</code> statements?</p><p>Well, you should. Now you have to maintain a 2,0<strong>10</strong> lines-long class!</p><p>But what if you really, <em>really</em> don’t have time to write tests for that class? That’s just 3 <code>if</code> statements and you might not feel like you can justify taking 2 days for that — although you should.</p><p><img src="https://understandlegacycode.com/assets/time-for-dat.jpg"></p><p>In such a tricky position, you can still make the right call with these 2 techniques.</p><h3 id="1-the-sprout-technique"><a href="#1-the-sprout-technique" aria-label="1 the sprout technique permalink"></a>1.

<p>For starters, this post is not a theoretical demonstration regarding whether you should use or not use ORMs (Object Relational Mapping) in your projects. It’s a description of why, in my own context, I decided to stop using ORMs. The ambition is to give a particular point of view that may be of use for people working in tech, to make up their mind.</p>

<p>First, the context. I’ve been working for 6 years as a tech startup CTO, at times as a cofounder, at times as a freelance. I’ve worked in or with a dozen of tech teams, using various kinds of technologies. Some teams were venture-backed, some were not.<br>If I had to sum up the context for the subject at hand, I would say that my point of view on ORMs is relevant for startup tech teams with &lt; 30 persons.</p>



<p>When I started coding, like most people, I started with a specific language, and that was not SQL. So, as soon as I started to need using a database, I naturally used ORMs to handle the database stuff. If we’re being honest here, most people don’t do a thorough research regarding the ORM topic, and just end up using one because they feel like they can get things done quicker, in a language they’re familiar with. I myself began coding in Python, and I quickly ended up using Django.</p>



<p>As time passed, I began appreciating several things about it, especially the migrations management part. Having all data schema modifications done in code (= versioned in Git) felt safer, especially when working with other people on that data schema. As the complexity of my projects grew, the backend code became more and more complex, but I didn’t give it second thoughts, since I had always used ORMs.<br>One thing that bothered me is that each time a requirement a little bit complex came up on a project, I had to dig very deep in the ORM documentation, like if I was cursed and that when a customer asked me something it would invariably be a specific corner case where the ORM fell short.</p>



<p>One day, I started taking data science projects, and I started learning SQL, since I had to perform a lot of queries on structured data.<br>I did my research and for various reasons I ended up selecting Postgres for my database of choice, due to its open source nature, its awesome views features (named reusable SQL queries), and its GIS extension Postgis.<br>One thing leading to the other, I worked on multiple data science projects in a row, and began to be quite good with SQL. It started to dawn on me how quick I was to make complex queries, with very few lines of SQL code.<br>I then worked again on web projects, and with my experience in SQL, decided that this time I would still write the backend in Python, but without ORM, and use a database driver instead (Psycopg2) to interact with the DB (database).</p>



<p>It has been a few years now that I work without ORMs, and I think my productivity more than doubled. I’m currently a freelance CTO, and I’m responsible (among other things) for the production infrastructure, including database schemas, of 4 startups.<br>I tried to analyze retrospectively what happened and here are a few thoughts.</p>



<p><strong><span>There is no Free Lunch</span></strong></p>



<p>ORM make one promise: that they will abstract the DB away. Solving problems in a generic way that works for everybody can mean 2 things: either it’s a technological breakthrough, either someone made some kind of middle-ground trade-off with existing tech. ORMs clearly fall in the latter.<br>ORMs make so many abstractions that starting off may be easier, but very quickly as you encounter more evolved real-world use cases, you end up spending your time reading documentation to understand the ORM abstractions, and how to configure it the way you need.</p>



<p>When a piece of software abstracts away a problem for you, if the scope of the problem is well defined, you can end up always using sensible defaults config parameters and a few of their variants. In this case, abstraction is a winning proposition.<br>The problem with ORMs is that the scope of what they usually try to achieve is too big, and in a real-world situation, when complexity arises, you often end up reading dark corners of your ORM documentation to find out whether your situation can fit in their abstractions. A great <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/" target="_blank">blog post</a> sums this up:  </p>



<p>“Although it may seem trite to say it, Object/Relational Mapping is the Vietnam of Computer Science. It represents a quagmire which starts well, gets more complicated as time passes, and before long entraps its users in a commitment that has no clear demarcation point, no clear win conditions, and no clear exit strategy.”</p>



<p>ORMs often seemed at first to be a winning proposition, but as time passes, I spent more time reading complex documentation for seemingly simple real-world situations, and I realized that the scope of what ORMs try to accomplish is just too large. When life keeps throwing at you different use cases with many little variants (and rest assured, this never stops), any endeavour to abstract it all quickly turns into a quagmire.</p>



<p><strong><span>Requirements You don’t have</span></strong></p>



<p>A huge problem of ORMs is that they abstract away the database, which means that if you have a favorite database, you can’t use its specific features.<br>If we’re being honest, in the context I’m talking about (startup with tech team &lt; 30 persons), who really needs DB portability?<br>The DB field is competitive and different DBs do differentiate themselves with great features (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo…). Abstracting the DB away means you have to settle for a common denominator, which is usually frankly quite mediocre.</p>



<p>For example, if in Django you need to perform a classic array aggregation, you end up using django.contrib.postgres.aggregates module, and lose DB portability right away. Array aggregations are very useful in many use cases, but not all DB propose it, so you end up using DB-specific modules anyway.</p>



<p><strong><span>The Performance Problem</span></strong></p>



<p>ORMs usually come with a SQL generator, that you’re never supposed to see. Problem is, in real-life, your DB schema will eventually get complex enough, and you will start having performance issues.<br>Business requirements change over time, retrocompatibility requirements pile up, and there is no way you can keep your DB schema theoretically optimal for your company’s needs at time t.<br>This fact translates into increased complexity for your DB queries, and a need to be smart about your queries.<br>When this complexity increases a bit, there is simply no way the ORM SQL generator can output optimized queries. Things will get slow, and I’ve yet to see an efficient way of querying a complex DB other than by writing the SQL yourself.</p>



<p><strong><span>DB Schema Consistency</span></strong></p>



<p>Initially I loved ORM for the fact that data structures were defined in code, which means versioned in Git, which means people could collaborate on them. Over the years I’ve changed my mind completely about this. Having multiple people make changes on DB schema invariably leads to huge inconsistencies, suboptimal choices and huge legacy.<br>This is why I enjoy working in small teams. I know it’s not possible for big corporations to have only 1 or 2 guys be the data masterminds, and I think that’s the reason why software quality drops so rapidly with the size of an organization. We just don’t know how to work efficiently in tech when the problem becomes too big for one brain (and by the way I think this is one of the biggest challenges to the advancement of humankind but that’s a story for another time).<br>I think that in the context of a startup with a tech team &lt; 30 persons, you should not have multiple persons making decisions about the DB schema. There should be 1 owner for this (which does not mean there can’t be collaborative discussions of course).<br>Currently I usually am the owner of DB schemas, and I manage SQL migrations by hand, via SQL scripts that are versioned in git, separately from backend code repos. I’m still regularly surprised by how many bad product/code decisions become obvious when considering DB schema issues, with context and history in mind.</p>



<p><strong><span>Be pragmati</span><span>c</span></strong></p>



<p>I had the opportunity to discuss the ORM topic with friends, and many had experienced more or less the same things, however some of them had an interesting take on the matter: they kept using ORMs, but only for particular things such as migrations management, handling connection pools with DB (for concurrent querying), input validations… To come back to the Vietnam analogy, I think it’s perfectly OK to use ORMs, if you know exactly what for, with a clear goal in mind and a well defined perimeter.</p>



<p><strong><span>The stack I use now</span></strong></p>



<p>Now when I start a web project, on the backend side I set up a REST API with a lightweight HTTP framework (Flask in Python, ExpressJS in Javascript), I interact with the DB with a driver (Psycopg2 in Python, pg-native in NodeJs), and I use Postgres, with a heavy use of Postgres Views to put as many data-related code in SQL, and as few as possible in backend Python/Js code.</p>



<p>The resulting backends, if you know SQL, are insanely quick to write, easy to read, and thus to maintain.</p>

</figure>

<p>We like to apply labels to users: they’re irrational, lazy, unpredictable, rushed, and so on.</p>

<p>To some extent that may be true<span>—</span>we aren’t machines.</p>

<p>But research shows that users actually make decisions based on a set of predictable subconscious patterns.</p>

<p>To create satisfying digital experiences, UX designers should be aware of<span>—</span>and support<span>—</span>these cognitive habits.</p>

<h2 id="heuristics">Heuristics</h2>

<p>Human beings use psychological tactics and biases to get to decisions quickly. These mental shortcuts are called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555" target="_blank">heuristics</a>. We use heuristics in everyday life, but we especially like using them with software.</p>

<p>We don’t follow these patterns out of laziness or because we’re scatter-brained. It’s quite rational to take advantage of heuristics as a user because…</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the digital world, there’s <strong>very little penalty for being wrong</strong>. The cost of most errors is close to zero. Guessing wrong on a link and hitting the back button is still more efficient than reading the whole page to find an exact match.</li>
  <li>Carelessly clicking around is <strong>more fun</strong> because we get a small dopamine rush from each click.</li>
  <li>Web pages can be complicated. We’d rather <strong>make a decision and get on with our lives</strong>. It’s a matter of trade-offs<span>—</span>a balancing act.</li>
  <li>The web enables us to <strong>move quickly from one decision to the next</strong>, at a much faster pace than the physical world. So that’s what we do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most common heuristics that users employ.</p>

<h3 id="satisficing">Satisficing</h3>

<p>A combination of the words “satisfy” and “suffice.” It means to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/satisficing/" target="_blank">settle for the first reasonable option you find</a>, without considering the whole set of possibilities. We don’t look for the right answer<span>—</span>we look for whatever is good enough.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/satisficing.png" alt="Users make quick and dirty scans. When they come across something that refers even a little to what they've come for, they instinctively click it.">
</figure>

<h3 id="loss-aversion">Loss Aversion</h3>

<p><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.320.8769" target="_blank">Losses loom larger than gains</a> in our minds. It is thought that the pain of losing is about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. We put in more work and take more risks to avoid losses than we do to make gains. Part of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prospect-theory/">Prospect Theory</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/loss-aversion.png" alt="Users will go to great lengths to avoid something that’s potentially negative, or that could cause them to lose what they already have.">
</figure>

<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/availability-heuristic/" target="_blank">People draw conclusions based on what comes to mind immediately</a>. We give a lot of importance to things that we recall quickly and things we can already see right in front of us.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/availability.png" alt="If a user needs to make a decision on a page, what's right in front of them? What can they recall quickly from other pages? What do they notice first?">
</figure>

<h3 id="decision-fatigue">Decision Fatigue</h3>

<p>Making a lot of decisions <a href="https://archive.org/details/psychologyofecon0000unse/mode/2up" target="_blank">lowers a person’s ability to make rational ones</a>. It’s also exhausting.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/decision-fatigue.png" alt="If a user is forced to make decision after decision after decision, they'll eventually start making sub-optimal choices... or give up entirely.">
</figure>

<h3 id="reference-dependence">Reference Dependence</h3>

<p>Human beings do not have an innate way to determine absolute value. So <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/01/the-power-of-comparison-how-it-affects-decision-making.php" target="_blank">we assign value by comparing one thing to another</a>. We make judgments in relative rather than absolute terms.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/reference-dependence.png" alt="In a set of choices in an interface, how the options relate to each other will determine what the user will do.">
</figure>

<h3 id="status-quo-bias">Status Quo Bias</h3>

<p>Unless there’s a compelling incentive, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-power-of-defaults/" target="_blank">people are more likely to stick to the default</a>. In other words, we tend not to change the established situation.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/status-quo-bias.png" alt="This explains, for example, why users rarely utilize fancy customization features or change default settings.">
</figure>

<h3 id="hicks-law">Hick’s Law</h3>

<p>The number of stimuli present <a href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law" target="_blank">influences the time and effort required to make a decision</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/hicks-law.png" alt="When users come across a situation with too many options, sometimes they'll try to bypass the unpleasantness of Hick's Law by hastily making any decision, which they later regret.">
</figure>

<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>

<p>As designers, what do we do about all this?</p>

<p>Here are a few ways we can tailor our digital experiences to these heuristics.</p>

<h3 id="decrease-your-dpp">Decrease your DPP</h3>

<p>One helpful exercise is to look at what we can call our DPP: <em>Decisions Per Page</em>.</p>

<p>Take an important page from your interface and count the number of possible decisions a user could make on that page. This includes actions (which always require a decision) or information that leads to a decision.</p>

<p>I’m willing to bet the number is higher than you would have guessed.</p>

<p><strong>If the DPP is too high, what do you do?</strong></p>

    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/decisions-per-page.png" alt="Decisions per page">
</figure>

<h3 id="reduce-visual-signals">Reduce visual signals</h3>

<p>Start by reducing the number of colors and fonts. Using more than four meaningful colors causes the “<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-impressions-human-automaticity/" target="_blank">rainbow effect</a>” which disorients the brain and creates an impression of ugliness.</p>

<p>Movement is distracting. Use animation sparingly and only for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>Build a design system. It ensures consistency between elements, and prevents users from having to re-learn the interface on every new page.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="optimize-the-default-experience">Optimize the default experience</h3>

<p>Be aware that many people will never use fancy customization options. Make sure the general default experience provides for all the important <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/the-how-and-why-of-user-flows" target="_blank">task flows</a>.</p>

<p>Forms provide lots of opportunities to be helpful. For example, we could pre-populate fields with the most common value or a realistic example. This representative value helps the user understand how to complete the field and what the expected response is. Not to mention it will save most users time and decision-making energy.</p>

    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/sensible-defaults.png" alt="Sensible defaults">
</figure>

<h3 id="prioritize-for-the-user">Prioritize for the user</h3>

<p>Since many users aren’t going to accurately prioritize things on their own, we should do some of that work for them. The ultimate goal is that they can glance at any page and know instinctively which items are most important.</p>

<p>Knowing what to prioritize requires that you learn about your users, their goals, and their main <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/the-how-and-why-of-user-flows" target="_blank">workflows</a>. Think about what is <em>essential</em> (vs. what is optional) and what moves the user <em>forward</em>.</p>

<p>We can give the user visual clues to create a clear hierarchy. Our brain assigns importance to things based on size, color, imagery, contrast, white space, and alignment.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/visual-priority.png" alt="Visual priority">
</figure>

<h3 id="evaluate-your-content">Evaluate your content</h3>

<p>Remember almost all users scan<span>—</span>they don’t read. Classic principles of good writing, including descriptive headings and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/" target="_blank">inverted-pyramid</a> structures, help users get meaning from content.</p>

<p>Some common red flags include a lack of headings and big, long blocks of text. Call attention to important information using bulleted lists and bold or italic fonts. Take the time to craft your <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/7-practical-tips-for-better-microcopy" target="_blank">microcopy</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-decisions/content.png" alt="Evaluate content">
</figure>

<h3 id="consider-the-post-click-experience">Consider the post-click experience</h3>

<p>What happens when a user clicks on something? What’s the next thing they see and how does it connect to where they just were? How does it fit into their whole journey through your interface?</p>

<p>It could be easy to think of each page in isolation. <strong>But remember pages aren’t individual silos<span>—</span>they’re pieces of flows.</strong> It’s all a series of connected actions.</p>

<p>Give good <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/7-practical-tips-for-better-microcopy" target="_blank">information scent</a> with link labels so users know where they’re going. Allow them to gracefully recover from clicking on the wrong thing to eliminate the “cost” of clicking. Make sure they’re always moving forward.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="tying-it-off">Tying it off</h2>

<p>Remember: we never truly know what an individual user is thinking until we research. When in doubt, <a href="https://learnuxd.io/posts/usability-testing-in-4-simplified-steps" target="_blank">test it out</a>.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the field of computer science, the Paxos algorithm is notorious for how difficult it is to understand. I had to learn the Paxos algorithm in my distributed systems class. I even have "implemented" it by translating Leslie Lamport's TLA+ to Python. But I didn't understand it until much much later.</p>

<p>Now I have a better understanding of Paxos than I used to, I want to explain it to other people. Not because I'd like to help people, rather, I find that explaining things is a very good way to find blind spots in my own understanding.</p>

<p>So, where do we start? Personally, I dislike explanations that start with a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm, followed by a proof of why those steps do what they claim to do. Instead, I much prefer to start with the problem the algorithm tries to solve, then iteratively come up with a solution together with the reader. So that's what I am going to do. And now you understand the title.</p>

<p><em>Small disclaimer:</em> The glossaries used in this article is different from what is commonly used for Paxos. I just picked the ones that made the most sense for my narrative.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The distributed consensus problem is widely useful, so the reader probably doesn't need to be motivated. Here I will just simply state the problem.</p>

<p>There is a group of agents (let's call them $\sc{CLIENT}s$), who want to choose a number among their selections. Any number is fine, as long as everyone agrees on the same number.</p>

<p>Here, there are a few assumptions we will make to make this problem meaningful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the agents - including but not limited to the $\sc{CLIENT}s$, as we will add more types of agents later - are well-behaved. Meaning they all execute the prescribed algorithms faithfully, and don't maliciously try to trick other agents. (If you like jargons: Byzantine failures don't occur.)</li>
  <li>Agents can talk to each other by sending each other messages, but the messages they send to each other could take arbitrarily long before reaching their destination, and might get lost (but never altered).</li>
</ul>

<p>The agents could also "fail". However, failing is equivalent to all messages sent to/from that agent being lost forever. So whether we have this assumption or not won't change the algorithm we come up with.</p>

<p>Also, to not complicate things, we are only solving the "single-round" consensus problem in this article, meaning as the output of this algorithm, all of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ will get a single number which they agree on.</p>

<h2 id="solution-searching-adventure">Solution searching adventure</h2>

<h3 id="iteration-0">Iteration 0</h3>

<p>When trying to solve a complex problem such as this one, it's usually a good idea to start by simplifying the problem.
As a start, let's just ignore the need to be reliable entirely.</p>

<p>If we throw reliability out the window, it should be easy to come up with a very simple solution: we add an agent (let's call it $\sc{COORDINATOR}$).
The $\sc{CLIENTS}$ send whatever number they pick to the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ in a $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ message, where $x$ is the number
proposed by the $i$-th $\sc{CLIENT}$. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ picks an arbitrary proposal (say, $x'$),
and informs the other $\sc{CLIENT}s$ about this decision.
Specifically, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ will just reply with a $\sc{CHOSEN}(x')$ message to all the $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\ldots)$ messages it has
received and will receive.</p>

<p>If we assume no messages ever get lost, it is quite easy to see that every $\sc{CLIENT}$ will get a number. And because only one number is ever chosen, they will all get the same number.</p>

<p>It is also easy to see why this solution is impractical: it has a single point of failure. Once the singular $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ fails, no further progress can be made.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h3>

<p>To improve this almost looks easy at first glance: just add more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$!</p>

<p>Sure, more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would remove the single point of failure. However, if there are more than one $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, they might individually make different decisions, which results in the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ having disagreement.</p>

<p>What if we let the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ reach an agreement among themselves before responding? But wait, doesn't that sound familiar? Having a group of agents reaching an agreement, that's exactly what we added the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to solve. We just made the problem cyclic.</p>

<p>Let's take a step back. Is there a way for the clients to reach an agreement without having the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ communicate with each other?</p>

<p>In other words, among the decisions of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, is there an deterministic algorithm to pick out a specific one that is robust against message losses?</p>

<p>This might sound hard, but it's actually quite simple: pick the decision that is backed by more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>There can't be two decisions both with more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing them; and if a decision doesn't have that many $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing it, it won't appear to have more backing $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ through message losses.</p>

<p>Since this approach resembles a majority vote, let's call $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ decisions $\sc{VOTE}(coord_i, x)$ from now on, where $x$ is the number picked by the $i$-th $\sc{COORDINATOR}$. Each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has a single vote, because each of them only makes a single decision.</p>

<p>Obviously, our solution cannot be infinitely reliable. If more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ went down, there will never be a majority reached. But this is already vastly better than our first solution, and the reliability scales with the number of $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$. So we will call it good enough.</p>

<p>Sadly, this solution doesn't actually work: there might not be a majority at all! For example, it's possible that three of the proposals each get a third of the votes. We would have a stalemate in that case.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h3>

<p>Again, a solution seems straightforward: just try again in case of a stalemate.</p>

<p>But then again, things aren't that simple.</p>

<p>First of all, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ need to be made aware of a retry. Otherwise, because each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ only has one vote, they won't be able to vote again even if the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ retry.</p>

<p>To do that, we attach an attempt id to all the messages sent. i.e. $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ becomes $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\#attempt, client_i, x)$, and so forth. Each time a $\sc{CLIENT}$ retries, it bumps $\#attempt$ to the maximum $\#attempt$ it knows of plus 1. And the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ should only responds to messages with the most recent $\#attempt$.</p>

<p>Hopefully the intent of the $\#attempt$ number is clear. (<a href="https://github.com/yshui/explain-algorithms/issues/new">Let me know</a> if not.)</p>

<p>Are we good now? Unfortunately, no. Consider this scenario:</p>

<p>There were 2 clients. They proposed their numbers, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ voted on them and all agreed on a single number, $x_1$, all is good. But, all of the $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots)$ messages got lost on the way to $client_2$, while $client_1$ received all of the messages just fine. At this point, $client_1$ thought $x_1$ is the number, but $client_2$ went on to retry. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ voted again, and got $x_2$. This time, all the messages sent to $client_1$ got lost.</p>

<p>And behold, we got the two clients to disagree.</p>

<p>There is an important insight to be had here. Whenever a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$, say $coord_i$, sends out a $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots, coord_i, x)$, there is a chance that some $\sc{CLIENT}$ would adopt $x$. If $coord_i$ ever sends out two votes with different $x$, there is a chance that some of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ would disagree.</p>

<p>In other words, once a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has revealed its vote, it has to stick to it.</p>

<p>This seems to run contrary to our attempt: if the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ cannot change their votes, what's the point of retrying? A stalemate will be a stalemate forever.</p>

<p>Looks like we reached a dead end with this type of voting. It appears the problem stems from the fact that the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to commit to their votes.</p>

<p>So, what if we introduce a form of non-commitment voting?</p>

<h3 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h3>

<p>Let's explore this idea. Say, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ could now send a $\sc{TENTATIVE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, coord_i, x)$ message, to tentatively vote for $x$.</p>

<p>Obviously, the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ couldn't adopt $x$ right away. So what's this vote good for?</p>

<p>Ah, right, it could get us to a majority.</p>

<p>It is correct that tentative votes don't lead directly to an agreement among $\sc{CLIENT}s$, but it can show us when a majority has formed among the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>Once a $\sc{CLIENT}$ sees a majority tentative vote, it can then message the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to ask for an actual vote. (Let's call this message $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, client_i)$). Intuitively, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to make the same vote in the actual vote as their tentative votes.</p>

<p>If all goes well, we would get a majority and an agreement. If there is no majority, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ won't even start a vote, so they are free to change their mind. So the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ could start another attempt which might have a different outcome.</p>

<p>What if things don't go well? What if the $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}$ messages weren't received by some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$?
In that case, some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would have voted, and their decisions cannot be changed. That is to say, in all subsequent attempts, these $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ will always vote for what they have voted for, whether it's a tentative vote, or the actual vote. But that doesn't create a problem for us. There was a majority in the tentative votes, and now we solidified part of the tentative votes. There is at least one way we can still reach a majority in the next round: everyone votes the same as they did in this round. And we can prove this inductively for all future rounds.</p>

<p>From this, we can have a rough image of how the algorithm functions: as attempts are being made, more and more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ start to make up their mind which number they will commit to, while making sure a majority could still be reached. Eventually, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

  <section><p>Throughout my career, I’ve always gravitated toward incidents. Maybe it’s the
drama, or I like to see how things go wrong. Perhaps… maybe I even cause them?</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, this experience has helped me develop a sense of how I like
handling incidents, something I’ve tried passing onto my team. So when a
colleague asked what our methods were, I was more than happy to respond with
some unstructured ramblings.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/incident-response-email.png" alt="email asking for incident response advice">
</figure>

<p>Since then, Matthieu has regularly nudged me to share these thoughts more
widely. This article is what happened when I took those words, dressed them up
all fancy, and sent them into the world.</p>

<p>I hope you find it useful!</p>

<hr>

<p>If you’ve ever Googled incident response, you’ll have found a load of results
about <strong>incident roles</strong>. Atlassian has some <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management">incredible docs</a> that
explain the concepts well.</p>

<p>In brief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incident roles help scale incidents as your response team grows. Roles help
separate responsibilities, ensuring someone is properly focused on each aspect
of an incident. Defining these roles can help make everyone clear about what
they’re expected to do, and what to expect of one another.</li>
  <li>Two <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/incident-response/roles-responsibilities">roles</a> you must be aware of:
    <ul>
      <li>Incident commander, the single point of contact for actions taken related
to this incident. They don’t need to be the person taking the action, but
before you reboot that server, you check with them. This avoids the
classic ‘shit, I didn’t realise you were restoring the database onto
<em>that</em> node’ when you clash with a well-intentioned colleague</li>
      <li>Communications. Essential, and typically the first thing forgotten when
lacking a structured incident response process. Don’t be that team-
nominate someone to manage comms as early as possible, and make sure all
responders actively offload communication to them. Don’t ever split
people’s focus by requiring them to debug and communicate, or you’ll
half-ass both!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are many other roles defined in the literature, but roles only help when
your team has a strong understanding of what each role entails. Commander and
communications are, in my opinion, essential- adding more granularity without
sufficient training can confuse incidents and impair your response</li>
</ul>

<p>If you become comfortable with the roles you want to use, and your team are well
practiced in all of them, you’ll have taken the first step towards an effective
response. But now you have the roles, how does your team go about fixing the
issue?</p>

<p>Firstly, identify <strong>what is bleeding</strong>. If you can establish the scope of an
incident early, it means your next steps will be much more likely to address the
problem.</p>

<p>Try to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify which systems are failing, then work through the dependencies to
understand whether the issue is due to an upstream or downstream component</li>
  <li>Be extremely wary of assumptions. For everything you receive from a
third-party, trust but verify. Record whatever you did to verify, such as the
commands you ran and the time you ran them. An incorrect assumption can derail
your response, so do your best to avoid them!</li>
  <li>Once you’ve found the technical source, consider running some impact analysis.
Don’t delay your response with this work, but if someone is spare, get them to
estimate the scope of the impact- who and how many are affected. An inaccurate
understanding of impact can lead to poor decisions, and clarity on who is
affected can help other parts of your organisation (Customer Success, Support,
etc) respond appropriately</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the team understands the nature of the incident, you can begin to <strong>stop
the bleeding</strong>. Put differently, your goal should be to stop the immediate pain
and defer clean-up to a less pressured time.</p>

<p>For this, we need to prioritise actions to achieve the best chance of a positive
outcome. Note the phrase <strong>“best chance”</strong>: routine remediations that are quick
to apply should be taken first, even if you suspect it may only partially fix
the problem.</p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rollback to a known good revision, even if you think you can write a fix
really quickly- you can always do that after you’ve rolled back, when there is
less urgency</li>
  <li>Take action to preserve critical systems, even at the expense of other less
critical flows. If a single endpoint is causing the whole system to fail,
don’t hesitate to no-op that endpoint if it restores service to the parts that
matter</li>
  <li>Make full use of your team and proactively apply whatever fixes you think are
low-risk, even if you suspect it might not fix the whole problem: scale down
non-essential queues, put a freeze on deploys, restart that server. Effective
delegation means it costs little to try, provided other responders continue to
work on root cause analysis assuming the easy fixes will fail</li>
</ul>

<p>This should give you an idea of what your team should work on. The question is
now how should they work together to execute them?</p>

<p>Given incident response is so much about communication, you’ll be wanting an
effective tool for <strong>instant messaging</strong>, and to record a log of your actions.</p>

<p>Turn to Slack (or whatever your equivalent is):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first action in any incident should be creating a message channel. Several
tools (<a href="https://github.com/monzo/response">monzo/response</a>, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072">Netflix’s
Dispatch</a>) can automatically create that (and more) for you,
but even if you have to painstakingly click those buttons yourself, do it.
It’s way worth the additional minute of downtime to get that space
ready-to-go.</li>
  <li>I strongly advocate against private incident response channels. Company
culture providing, a public channel can level-up your response by increasing
ease of access to information. This can prevent coordination issues that you’d
head-desk to encounter (I’ve seen two separate incident teams tackling the
same incident, with no knowledge of each others existence…)</li>
  <li>Whenever you’re about to do something destructive, such as run a command or
restart some resource, message the channel. Not only can this improve
awareness across the team, but it provides an invaluable resource when
building an incident log for your post-mortem</li>
</ul>

<p>Instant messaging is great for information that is timestamped and should not be
changed. For content you expect to modify as the incident progresses, create an
<strong>incident document</strong> in your favourite collaborative editor (Google Docs,
Dropbox Paper, Notion, etc):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your organisation can draft incident doc templates that contain the structure
you need: perhaps you have reporting responsibilities, or have a specific
communications flow? Put it all in here, and make it easy to create documents
from these templates with a single click</li>
  <li>Especially for large-scale incidents where people rotate through the incident
team, this doc can act as the entry-point for onboarding people into the
incident. Have whoever runs comms manage this document, maintaining a timeline
of important events, and even draft an executive summary if the incident is
particularly complex</li>
  <li>Have your technical team post code snippets or relevant logs lines into the
document appendix, so everyone can lean on a central view of the incident</li>
</ul>

<p>Paired together, chat log and incident doc can be powerful tools to help
coordinate the response team, while providing transparency to any invested
onlookers. Even better, this content can be easily reshaped into a post-mortem
once the dust has settled.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, the <strong>human element</strong>. People make bad decisions
when stressed, and the excitement of an incident can make you forget entirely
about caring for yourself. Lead by example and be forceful when encouraging your
responders to care for themselves.</p>

<p>Some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One highly effective method to reduce stress is to take breaks, going away
from your screen, and breathing. Actively encourage your team to take these
pauses with you, reducing the chance you’ll screw things up by rushing</li>
  <li>As a general rule, take pauses whenever:
    <ul>
      <li>You get paged. It doesn’t have to be long; just 10s of breathing can
remind your body that you’re in control, and lower your adrenaline.</li>
      <li>Whenever the production impact has ceased. As soon as the alarms go quiet
and things seem stable, call a break for the entire team. It’s rare that
incidents don’t have extended follow-up work: rest yourself for at least
15m before you start that process</li>
      <li>During follow-up, before commencing any sort of procedure, such as
‘recovery of X cluster’. Get everyone to grab some air before running the
checklist, allowing each individual to recharge in case the process goes
wrong, or takes much longer than expected</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure your incident commanders are trained to detach responders before they
burn themselves. One important job is to order (and expense!) food before
people get hungry. You’ll be surprised at how an incident response team will
eat, after noisily protesting that they don’t need any food!</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all folks! A whistle-stop tour through my essential shopping list of
incident response practices. This list is far from complete, but can be used as
a great starter pack, or a prompt for the more experienced to consider what they
care about in their incident response process.</p>

<p>Just remember: take a deep breath, look out for your colleagues, blame systems
not people, and don’t rush. Good luck!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I love text layout, and have been working with it in one form or other for over 35 years. Yet, knowledge about it is quite arcane. I don’t believe there is a single place where it’s all properly written down. I have some explanation for that: while basic text layout is very important for UI, games, and other contexts, a lot of the “professional” needs around text layout are embedded in <em>much</em> more complicated systems such as Microsoft Word or a modern Web browser.</p>

<p>A complete account of text layout would be at least a small book. Since there’s no way I can write that now, this blog post is a small step towards that – in particular, an attempt to describe the “big picture,” using the conceptual framework of a “loose hierarchy.” Essentially, a text layout engine breaks the input into finer and finer grains, then reassembles the results into a text layout object suitable for drawing, measurement, and hit testing.</p>

<p>The main hierarchy is concerned with laying out the entire paragraph as a single line of text. Line breaking is also important, but has a separate, parallel hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-text-layout-hierarchy">The main text layout hierarchy</h2>

<p>The hierarchy is: paragraph segmentation as the coarsest granularity, followed by rich text style and BiDi analysis, then itemization (coverage by font), then Unicode script, and shaping clusters as the finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/layout_pyramid.svg" alt="diagram of layout hierarchy"></p>

<h3 id="paragraph-segmentation">Paragraph segmentation</h3>

<p>The coarsest, and also simplest, segmentation task is paragraph segmentation. Most of the time, paragraphs are simply separated by newline (U+000A) characters, though Unicode in its infinite wisdom specifies a number of code point sequences that function as paragraph separators in plain text:</p>

<ul>
  <li>U+000A LINE FEED</li>
  <li>U+000B VERTICAL TAB</li>
  <li>U+000C FORM FEED</li>
  <li>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN</li>
  <li>U+000D U+000A (CR + LF)</li>
  <li>U+0085 NEXT LINE</li>
  <li>U+2008 LINE SEPARATOR</li>
  <li>U+2009 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</li>
</ul>

<p>In rich text, paragraphs are usually indicated through markup rather than special characters, for example <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> in HTML. But in this post, as in most text layout APIs, we’ll treat rich text as plain text + attribute spans.</p>

<h3 id="rich-text-style">Rich text style</h3>

<p>A paragraph of rich text may contain <em>spans</em> that can affect formatting. In particular, choice of font, font weight, italic or no, and a number of other attributes can affect text layout. Thus, each paragraph is typically broken into a some number of <em>style runs,</em> so that within a run the style is consistent.</p>

<p>Note that some style changes don’t <em>necessarily</em> affect text layout. A classic example is color. Firefox, rather famously, does <em>not</em> define segmentation boundaries here for color changes. If a color boundary cuts a ligature, it uses fancy graphics techiques to render parts of the ligature in different color. But this is a subtle refinement and I think not required for basic text rendering. For more details, see <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/">Text Rendering Hates You</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bidirectional-analysis">Bidirectional analysis</h3>

<p>Completely separate from the style spans, a paragraph may in general contain both left-to-right and right-to-left text. The need for bidirectional (BiDi) text is certainly one of the things that makes text layout more complicated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this part of the stack is defined by a standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UAX #9</a>), and there are a number of good implementations. The interested reader is referred to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. The key takeaway here is that BiDi analysis is done on the plain text of the entire paragraph, and the result is a sequence of <em>level runs,</em> where the level of each run defines whether it is LTR or RTL.</p>

<p>The level runs and the style runs are then merged, so that in subsequent stages each run is of a consistent style and directionality. As such, for the purpose of defining the hierarchy, the result of BiDi analysis could alternatively be considered an implicit or derived rich text span.</p>

<p>In addition to BiDi, which I consider a basic requirement, a more sophisticated text layout engine will also be able to handle vertical <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode">writing modes</a>, including mixed cases where short strings are horizontal within the vertical primary direction. Extremely sophisticated layout engines will also be able to handle ruby text and other ways of annotating the main text flow with intercalated strings. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a> for many examples of sophisticated layout requirements; the scope of this blog post really is basic text layout of the kind needed in user interfaces.</p>

<h3 id="itemization-font-coverage">Itemization (font coverage)</h3>

<p>Itemization is the trickiest and least well specified part of the hierarchy. There is no standard for it, and no common implementation. Rather, each text layout engine deals with it in its own special way.</p>

<p>Essentially, the result of itemization is to choose a single concrete font for a run, from a <em>font collection.</em> Generally a font collection consists of a main font (selected by font name from system fonts, or loaded as a custom asset), backed by a <em>fallback stack,</em> which are usually system fonts, but thanks to <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto</a> it is possible to bundle a fallback font stack with an application, if you don’t mind spending a few hundred megabytes for the assets.</p>

<p>Why is it so tricky? A few reasons, which I’ll touch on.</p>

<p>First, it’s not so easy to determine whether a font can render a particular string of text. One reason is <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalization</a>. For example, the string “é” can be encoded as U+00E9 (in NFC encoding) or as U+0065 U+0301 (in NFD encoding). Due to the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">Unicode equivalence</a>, these should be rendered identically, but a font may have coverage for only one or the other in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cmap">Character to Glyph Index Mapping</a> (cmap) table. The shaping engine has all the Unicode logic to handle these cases.</p>

<p>Of course, realistic fonts with Latin coverage will have both of these particular sequences covered in the cmap table, but edge cases certainly do happen, both in extended Latin ranges, and other scripts such as Hangul, which has complex normalization rules (thanks in part to a Korean standard for normalization which is somewhat at odds with Unicode). It’s worth noting that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201009-00/?p=104351">DirectWrite gets Hangul normalization quite wrong</a>.</p>

<p>I believe a similar situation exists with the Arabic presentation forms; see <a href="https://www.arabeyes.org/Developing_Arabic_fonts">Developing Arabic fonts</a> for more detail on that.</p>

<p>Because of these tricky normalization and presentation issues, the most robust way to determine whether a font can render a string is to try it. This is how LibreOffice has worked for a while, and in 2015 <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2015-October/005168.html">Chromium followed</a>. See also <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/layout-team/eliminating-simple-text">Eliminating Simple Text</a> for more background on the Chromium text layout changes.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> whole class of complexity is emoji. A lot of emoji can be rendered with either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Emoji_versus_text_presentation">text or emoji presentation</a>, and there are no hard and fast rules to pick one or the other. Generally the text presentation is in a symbol font, and the emoji presentation is in a separate color font. A particularly tough example is the smiling emoji, which began its encoding life as 0x01 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Code page 437</a>, the standard 8-bit character encoding of the original IBM PC, and is now U+263A in Unicode. However, the suggested default presentation is text, which won’t do in a world which expects color. Apple on iOS unilaterally chose an emoji presentation, so many text stacks follow Apple’s lead. (Incidentally, the most robust way to encode such emoji is to append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)">variation selector</a> to pin down the presentation.)</p>

<p>Another source of complexity when trying to write a cross-platform text layout engine is querying the system fonts. See <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/skribo/text/2019/04/04/font-fallback.html">Font fallback deep dive</a> for more information about that.</p>

<p>I should note one thing, which might help people doing archaeology of legacy text stacks: it used to be pretty common for text layout to resolve “compatibility” forms such as NFKC and NFKD, and this can lead to various problems. But today it is more common to solve that particular problem by providing a font stack with <em>massive</em> Unicode coverage, including all the code points in the relevant compatibility ranges.</p>

<h3 id="script">Script</h3>

<p>The <em>shaping</em> of text, or the transformation of a sequence of code points into a sequence of positioned glyphs, depends on the script. Some scripts, such as Arabic and Devanagari, have extremely elaborate shaping rules, while others, such as Chinese, are a fairly straightforward mapping from code point into glyph. Latin is somewhere in the middle, starting with a straightforward mapping, but ligatures and kerning are also required for high quality text layout.</p>

<p>Determining script runs is reasonably straightforward - many characters have a Unicode script property which uniquely identifies which script they belong to. However, some characters, such as space, are “common,” so the assigned script just continues the previous run.</p>

<p>A simple example is “hello мир”. This string is broken into two script runs: “hello “ is <code>Latn</code>, and “мир” is <code>Cyrl</code>.</p>

<h3 id="shaping-cluster">Shaping (cluster)</h3>

<p>At this point, we have a run of constant style, font, direction, and script. It is ready for <em>shaping.</em> Shaping is a complicated process that converts a string (sequence of Unicode code points) into positioned glyphs. For the purpose of this blog post, we can generally treat it as a black box. Fortunately, a very high quality open source implementation exists, in the form of HarfBuzz.</p>

<p>We’re not <em>quite</em> done with segmentation, though, as shaping assigns substrings in the input to <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/clusters.html">clusters</a> of glyphs. The correspondence depends a lot on the font. In Latin, the string “fi” is often shaped to a single glyph (a ligature). For complex scripts such as Devanagari, a cluster is most often a syllable in the source text, and complex reordering can happen within the cluster.</p>

<p>Clusters are important for <em>hit testing,</em> or determining the correspondence between a physical cursor position in the text layout and the offset within the text. Generally, they can be ignored if the text will only be rendered, not edited (or selected).</p>

<p>Note that these shaping clusters are distinct from grapheme clusters. The “fi” example has two grapheme clusters but a single shaping cluster, so a grapheme cluster boundary can cut a shaping cluster. Since …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<hr>

    <p>For a while now I’ve had a series of blog posts floating around in my head on how to build an HTTP stack in Swift. The idea started last spring with Rob Napier’s <a href="https://robnapier.net/start-with-a-protocol">blog posts on protocols</a>, and matured last summer and fall while I was working at WeWork on an internal Swift framework.</p>

<p>So, with my <a href="https://davedelong.com/blog/2020/06/14/anything-worth-doing/">newfound blogging powers</a>, I think it’s time to tackle this problem. Over the course of several posts, I’ll walk through a number of topics related to HTTP and how we can fit them together into a great Swift framework. We’ll end up with a framework that supports things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automatically retrying requests</li>
  <li>throttling to a customizable maximum number of concurrent requests</li>
  <li>specifying custom server environments for an entire connection stack, or for a single request</li>
  <li>automatically cancelling in-flight requests when the stack is reset</li>
  <li>basic mesh networking</li>
  <li>implementing OAuth (or any sort of authenticated request)</li>
  <li>multi-part form uploads</li>
  <li>easy mocking of responses</li>
  <li>… and a whole lot more I’m glossing over</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll be building all of this on top of <code>URLSession</code>. And along the way, we’ll be addressing a lot of the feedback I <a href="https://davedelong.com/blog/2018/03/02/apple-networking-feedback/">provided to Apple Engineers</a> about the state of the built-in networking stack. (Awesomely, in the past 2 years a couple of those items have already been addressed)</p>

<p>I will preempt any questions by saying: I will <em>not</em> be publishing the actual code for this framework online. The purpose of these posts is to describe the problems and solutions, but implementing them will be left up to you. I will have small embedded snippets to illustrate concepts, but largely the entire thing will be left as an “exercise for the reader”. There’s just no substitute for sitting down and writing the code yourself.</p>

<p>But… before we get started in Swift, we need to answer a really fundamental question.</p>

<h2 id="what-on-earth-is-http">What on earth is HTTP?</h2>

<p>HTTP, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">“Hypertext Transfer Protocol”</a>, is a specification for describing how two different systems can communicate with each other. As its name implies, it’s a <em>text</em>-based specification. This is great for humans, because text is nicely readable, and it’s good for machines, because text is pretty nicely compressible (which is a major part of the 2.0 specification).</p>

<p>HTTP defines a very specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response">“request/response”</a> model. You send out a request for information, and you get a response back. One request, one response.</p>

<p>A request has the following format:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A request line</li>
  <li>Zero-or-more header value lines</li>
  <li>A blank line</li>
  <li>An optional body</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="request-lines">Request Lines</h3>

<p>A request line looks something like:</p>



<p>The first part of the line is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">request method</a>. We’re most familiar with <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>, but other common HTTP methods include things like <code>HEAD</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and so on. In reality, the HTTP spec itself does not place a limit on the value of the request method, which allows for specs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> (which powers CalDAV and CardDAV) to add their own methods like <code>COPY</code>, <code>LOCK</code>, <code>PROPFIND</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>This leads us to the simplest of problems with a lot of Swift networking frameworks. It’s really common to see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>enum</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>"GET"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>"POST"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>put</span> <span>=</span> <span>"PUT"</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>delete</span> <span>=</span> <span>"DELETE"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the HTTP spec allows for <em>any</em> single-word method, defining this value in Swift as an <em>enum</em> is incorrect, because an enum only allows for a finite number of values, but there are an infinite number of possible “single word” values. A <em>better</em> implementation of this is to use a <code>struct</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>struct</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>:</span> <span>Hashable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>get</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"POST"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>put</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"PUT"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>let</span> <span>delete</span> <span>=</span> <span>HTTPMethod</span><span>(</span><span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>"DELETE"</span><span>)</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>let</span> <span>rawValue</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After the method comes the path, which should be readily recognizable as the <code>.path</code> of a <code>URL</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s a bit about which HTTP spec version you’re using. HTTP 2.0 is commonly used these days, but since it mainly deals with <em>compressed</em> HTTP requests, I’ll use the 1.1 version, which describes <em>uncompressed</em> requests.</p>



<p>Headers are a series of key-value pairs, in a familiar key-value-looking format:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Host: swapi.dev
Connection: close
User-Agent: Paw/3.1.10 (Macintosh; OS X/10.15.5) GCDHTTPRequest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields">header fields commonly used with HTTP</a>, some of them defined by the specs, and some agreed upon by convention. Like with request methods, there’s no limit to the possible names of a header, nor much of a limit on the possible values.</p>

<h3 id="the-body">The Body</h3>

<p>Any HTTP request may include a body. Yes, even a <code>GET</code> request is allowed to include a body. However, most servers will only interpret the body of a request based on which request method is used, so it’s likely that even if you did include a body with a <code>GET</code> requests, the server would ignore it.</p>

<p>The body itself is just raw binary data. How it’s interpreted by the server depends entirely on conventions agreed upon between the server engineers and the client engineers.</p>

<h2 id="putting-a-request-together">Putting a request together</h2>

<p>If we want to execute a basic HTTP request to the <a href="https://swapi.dev/">Star Wars API</a>, we would construct an HTTP request that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GET /api/ HTTP/1.1
Host: swapi.dev
Connection: close
User-Agent: Paw/3.1.10 (Macintosh; OS X/10.15.5) GCDHTTPRequest

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see the request line, 3 header lines, and an empty line at the end. It’s important to note that every line in an HTTP request is separated by <em>two</em> characters: <code>\r\n</code> (carriage return + line feed). This becomes more apparent when we look at the hex representation of this request (newlines inserted for readability):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>474554202F6170692F20485454502F312E310D0A 
486F73743A2073776170692E6465760D0A
436F6E6E656374696F6E3A20636C6F73650D0A 
557365722D4167656E743A205061772F332E312E313020284D6163696E746F73683B204F5320582F31302E31352E35292047434448545450526571756573740D0A
0D0A
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>0D</code> and <code>0A</code> are the hexadecimal representation of <code>\r</code> and <code>\n</code>, respectively. The empty line is how an HTTP server knows where the headers stop and the body begins.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an aside, if you find yourself working with network APIs a lot, I <em>highly</em> recommend using Lucky Marmot’s fantastic app <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a>. It is an indispensable tool for analyzing and tweaking network calls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another thing worth pointing out here is that <code>Host:</code> header. While it’s required by the spec, it doesn’t necessarily specify where the request is going. That’s because the host part of the URL is used before the request is ever sent by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS resolution process</a> as part of the whole “what server am I actually connecting to” flow. The <code>Host</code> header is included for clarity while debugging, and it may be used by the server for further internal routing. For example, you could imagine a server for all of Github Pages using the <code>Host</code> header to know which set of pages you actually want.</p>

<p>So, that’s the request.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-response">What about the response?</h2>

<p>The response we get back is almost identical in structure to the request. It has:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The response line</li>
  <li>Zero or more header value lines</li>
  <li>An empty line</li>
  <li>An optional body</li>
</ol>

<p>So, that request to the Star Wars API will have a response that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.16.1
Date: Sat, 27 Jun 2020 19:13:53 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: close
Vary: Accept, Cookie
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
ETag: "57e8c3fe1ac5cb74e15b96dc98767ce6"
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000

{"people":"http://swapi.dev/api/people/","planets":"http://swapi.dev/api/planets/","films":"http://swapi.dev/api/films/","species":"http://swapi.dev/api/species/","vehicles":"http://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/","starships":"http://swapi.dev/api/starships/"}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like with the request, all lines are separated by <code>\r\n</code>, and the empty line is how we know where the headers stop and the body begins. The only other difference is that the first line now has an integer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">status code</a> and a textual description of the code’s meaning.</p>

<p>Like with request methods, there’s no real limit on the status code values and message. The HTTP spec defines many that we’re familiar with, such as <code>200</code> (OK) and <code>404</code> (Not Found), as well as the allowed range of numbers (100 … 599). But… you <em>could</em> return a <code>666 Diabolical</code> code, or <code>42 Mostly Harmless</code> code. You could even return a <code>200 👍</code> response. But please don’t. 😅</p>

<p>The body, again, is raw binary data and it’s up to the recipient to correctly interpret it. The Star Wars API body is JSON-encoded text, but a body can just as easily be the raw bytes of a <code>.jpg</code> file, or the XML bytes of an RSS feed, or the text that describes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U">HTTP live streaming playlist</a>.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h2>

<p>That’s an overview of HTTP requests and responses. This simple model describes the fundamental communications used by most of the internet. It doesn’t cover things like web sockets or push notifications, but this is used by every website and most network APIs. Knowing the details of how this works continues to be one of the most valuable and consistently useful things I know and use as a software engineer.</p>

<p>In the next post, we’ll take a look at how we move from this specification to the basic structures we’ll need for our framework.</p>

                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last year we had a three part blog series about Qt's new approach to working with 3D graphics APIs and shading languages: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-2">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-3">part 3</a>. For <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-index.html">Qt Quick</a>, an early, opt-in preview of the new rendering architecture was shipped in Qt 5.14, with some improvements in Qt 5.15. With the release of Qt 6.0 upcoming, let's see what has happened since Qt 5.15. It will not be possible to cover every detail of the graphics stack improvements for Qt Quick here, let alone dive into the vast amount of Qt Quick 3D features, many of which are new or improved in Qt 6.0. Rather, the aim is just to give an overview of what can be expected from the graphics stack perspective when Qt 6.0 ships later this year.</p>
<p>Note that the documentation links refer to the Qt 6 snapshot documentation. This allows seeing the latest C++ and QML API pages, including all changed and new functions, but the content is also not final. These links may also break later on.</p>

<h2>QRhi improvements</h2>
<p>QRhi, the Qt Rendering Hardware Interface, is Qt's internal graphics abstraction when 3D APIs, such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D, are involved. Compared to 5.15, the main improvements in 6.0 are a lot of polishing fixes here and there, and, most importantly, a large set of performance optimizations. While benefitting Qt Quick as well, these become especially important with Qt Quick 3D when complex scenes with many renderable objects are involved.</p>
<p>With some simplifications, the main layers of the Qt 6.0 graphics stack can be visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png" alt="rhiarch-3" width="800" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 400w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 800w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1200&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1600&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2000&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2000w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Shader management</h2>
<p>The Qt Shader Tools module is now a selectable module in the installer. For applications this can be relevant because this is the module that provides the <em>qsb</em> command-line tool (not to be confused with <em>qbs</em>) and its associated CMake build system integration. In addition, the module is a mandatory dependency for Qt Quick 3D at the moment.</p>
<p>Qt 6 no longer uses OpenGL-compatible GLSL source snippets directly. Rather, shaders are all written in Vulkan-style GLSL, then reflected and translated to other shading languages, and finally packaged up into a serializable QShader object that can be consumed by QRhi. The shader preparation pipeline in Qt 6 is the following:</p>

<p>In QML applications using Qt Quick, whenever working with ShaderEffect, or subclassing QSGMaterialShader, the application will need to provide a baked shader pack in form of a .qsb file. These are generated by the <em>qsb</em> tool. This does not however mean that developers have to start dealing with a new tool directly: with the CMake integration one can easily list the vertex, fragment, and compute shaders in CMakeLists.txt via the qt6_add_shaders() CMake function. Invoking qsb and packing the resulting .qsb files into the Qt resource system is then taken care of by the build system.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtshadertools-index.html">the shadertools documentation</a> for an overview of how graphics and compute shaders are handled in Qt 6 and the details of the qsb tool and its CMake integration.</p>
<h2>Direct OpenGL is no more for Qt Quick</h2>
<p>In Qt 5.14 and 5.15, Qt Quick shipped with an optional QRhi-based rendering path that could be enabled by setting the environment variable <em>QSG_RHI</em>. This allowed painless experimenting with the new stack, while keeping the traditional, battle tested direct OpenGL code path the default.</p>
<p>In Qt 6.0 all such switches are gone. There is no way get rendering go directly to OpenGL with Qt Quick scenes. Rather, the new default is the QRhi-based rendering path of the Qt Quick scene graph. Other than the defaults changing, the ways to configure what QRhi backend, and so which graphics API to use are mostly unchanged compared to Qt 5.15. See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#rendering-via-the-qt-rendering-hardware-interface">the documentation</a> for details. One difference is better API naming: in C++ code to request, and so effectively tie the application to, a given QRhi backend (and by extension graphics API) is now done through the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#setGraphicsApi">QQuickWindow::setGraphicsApi()</a> function, whereas in 5.15 this task used to be pushed onto an overload of setSceneGraphBackend(), leading to fairly inaccurate naming.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications, although many applications will not notice any of these. If an application uses neither shader code (ShaderEffect, QSGMaterial) nor does it perform its own rendering with OpenGL directly, there is a very high chance that it will need no migration steps at all. (at least not because of graphics)</p>
<h4>Applications using OpenGL directly</h4>
<p>What about applications that use OpenGL directly in one way or another, and are not interested in functioning with other graphics APIs? For example, applications that use <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickframebufferobject.html">QQuickFramebufferObject</a>, or connect to signals like <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRendering">QQuickWindow::beforeRendering()</a> to inject their own OpenGL rendering under or above the Qt Quick scene. This is when the setGraphicsApi() function mentioned above comes into play for real: if an application wishes, it can always state that it wants OpenGL (or Vulkan, or Metal, or D3D) only, and nothing else. That way it is guaranteed that Qt Quick is going to use the corresponding QRhi backend (or else it will fail to initialize), so the application can safely assume that going directly to OpenGL is safe, because Qt Quick will also end up rendering through OpenGL. Note that this does not exempt the application from having to do other type of porting steps: for example, if it in addition uses ShaderEffect or creates its own custom materials, it will still need to migrate to the new ways of handling shaders and materials.</p>
<h4>QSG* and QQuick* API changes</h4>
<p>The API changes mainly fall into 3 categories. This is not going to be an exhaustive list, but rather just a peek at some of the important changes. Detailed change lists and porting guides are expected to be available with the final Qt 6.0 release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Different approach to shaders and materials: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgmaterialshader.html">QSGMaterialShader</a> received a full revamp (matching more or less what the now-removed QSGMaterialRhiShader used to be in 5.14 and 5.15). <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html">ShaderEffect</a> no longer allows inline shader strings. Rather, the vertexShader and fragmentShader properties are URLs, similarly to <span>Image.source</span> and others. They can refer to a local .qsb file, or a .qsb file embedded via the Qt resource system (qrc).</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing OpenGL-specifics from QQuickWindow, QSGTexture, and elsewhere. It should come as no surprise that functions like <em>GLuint textureId()</em>, <em>createTextureFromId(GLuint textureId, ...)</em>, or <em>setRenderTarget(GLuint fboId)</em> are now gone. Adopting (wrapping) an existing OpenGL texture, Vulkan image, Metal texture, or D3D11 texture, or accessing the underlying native texture for a QSGTexture is still perfectly possible, but now is done via a different set of APIs, such as <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-qsgvulkantexture.html">QSGVulkanTexture</a> and the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-sub-qtquick.html">other similar classes</a>, instances of which are <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgtexture.html?__hstc=233546881.8510e053e4fb66e1a58543a6e9886427.1603454017210.1603454017210.1603454017210.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1603454017210&amp;__hsfp=1285229618#nativeInterface" rel="noopener">queryable from QSGTexure</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Integrating the application's own custom rendering with the graphics API that Qt Quick renders with is fully supported, not just for OpenGL, but also Vulkan, Metal, and D3D11. Due to their nature however, some of these APIs will need more than connecting to one single signal like beforeRendering() or afterRendering(). For example, we now also have <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRenderPassRecording">beforeRenderPassRecording()</a>. See the relevant section in the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#mixing-scene-graph-and-the-native-graphics-api">scenegraph overview docs</a> for more details and links to examples. Finally, the number of native graphics resources queryable via <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgrendererinterface.html">QSGRendererInterface</a> has been extended, now covering Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D too.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending support for redirecting the Qt Quick scene into an offscreen render target. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/%3Ehttps://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendercontrol.html">QQuickRenderControl</a> and the related infrastructure has been heavily enhanced. This was done not just to enable working with graphics APIs other than OpenGL the same way as in Qt 5 (for example, to render a Qt Quick scene into a Vulkan VkImage without an on-screen window), but also to enable integration with AR/VR frameworks and APIs such as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">OpenXR</a> (in combination with any of Vulkan, D3D11, or OpenGL). Besides the slightly changed QQuickRenderControl interface, we now have a number of helper classes that improve the configurability of a QQuickWindow: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendertarget.html">QQuickRenderTarget</a>, <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsdevice.html">QQuickGraphicsDevice</a>, and <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsconfiguration.html">QQuickGraphicsConfiguration</a>. These are essential in scenarios where a more fine grained control is needed: integrating with APIs like OpenXR is not always straightforward when an existing rendering engine is involved, with a number of potential chicken-egg problems when it comes to the creation, initialization, and ownership of instance, device, and other graphics objects: Which Vulkan instance should Qt Quick use, or should it create a new one upon initializing the scenegraph for the first time? Which Vulkan physical device or DXGI adapter should Qt Quick pick, or just stay with the default? Which VkDevice extensions should be enabled in addition to what Qt itself needs? What 2D image/texture should rendering target, who creates that and when? The expectation is that Qt 6.0 will be well-prepared and providing the foundations for further exploring the world of AR/VR during the rest of the Qt 6.x series.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>New approach to handling shader code in ShaderEffect</h4>
<p>A comprehensive example of the new approach to shader code in ShaderEffect is the Qt 6 port of the classic Qt 5 Cinematic Experience demo. <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience" rel="noopener">(GitHub repo)</a> This version is ported to CMake and is fully functional with all graphics APIs, including all shader and particle effects.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png" alt="cinematic" width="702" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=351&amp;name=cinematic.png 351w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=702&amp;name=cinematic.png 702w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1053&amp;name=cinematic.png 1053w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1404&amp;name=cinematic.png 1404w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=1755&amp;name=cinematic.png 1755w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cinematic.png?width=2106&amp;name=cinematic.png 2106w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p>Looking at the QML source code, for example the code for the <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/blob/master/content/CurtainEffect.qml" rel="noopener">curtain effect </a>shows that indeed it has all inline GLSL strings removed.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=354&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png" width="354" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=177&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 177w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=354&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 354w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=531&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 531w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=708&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 708w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=885&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 885w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png?width=1062&amp;name=image-png-Oct-19-2020-12-22-47-14-PM.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px"></p>
<p>Instead, the vertex and fragment shaders now live as <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/tree/master/shaders" rel="noopener">ordinary files in the source tree</a>, not bundled with the application executable anymore.</p>

<p>It is now up to the build system and Qt Shader Tools to compile, reflect, and translate at build time - with the added benefit of shader compilation errors becoming proper build errors instead of …</p></span></p></div></div>

	<section>
		<p>I am a notorious note-taker. Over the years, I've learned not to rely solely on my (or anyone else's) memory but to create well structured, concise, and adequately labeled notes for future use. It's not only required to preserve the knowledge, but it helps you develop some valuable abilities &amp; skills, e.g.:</p><ul><li>synthesis of information</li><li>clarity of thought</li><li>proper application of mental models</li><li>crafting a visual structure that carries the supplementary information</li><li>sketching :)</li></ul><p>I've tried various techniques of note-taking. Friction-less apps like Bear, personal knowledge management tools like Notion, audio recorders like Otter, outlining tools like Workflowy, Zettelkasten-inspired research tools like Roam or Obsidian. All of them have their pros, I still use some of them daily for specific purposes (Notion, Roam), but none of them has beaten the <strong>fundamental advantages</strong> of a thin sheet of paper:</p><ul><li>minimum latency (&amp; inertia)</li><li>maximum flexibility (when it comes to notation &amp; form - nothing is enforced)</li></ul><p>Obviously, <strong>paper has its flaws</strong> as well:</p><ul><li>it's immutable</li><li>digitizing it is a manual, cumbersome process</li><li>full freedom of what you draw/write/scribble is fantastic, but sometimes it would save a lot of time to have a library of stencils/templates</li><li>inventorizing the notes properly (so they're searchable/navigable in scale) is not easy</li><li>making cross-content references is also a pain</li></ul><p>Is it possible to have a solution <strong>with the advantages of paper but devoid of its flaws</strong>? In my quest to answer this question, I've decided to reach for an e-ink tablet named <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">reMarkable 2</a>.</p><hr><p>It's the 2nd iteration of that concept. I was considering a purchase of the previous generation one, but in the end, I've passed because of the high price and moderately enthusiastic reviews on the Internet. According to its creators' declaration, the new edition is supposed to fix its predecessor's flaws. And the price tag is much more wallet-friendly.</p><p>So in the end I've decided to give it a go. The production and delivery cycle has been delayed due to COVID-19 (by two months), but I've finally received my device, used it for few weeks, and can now provide you my initial review.</p><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_2.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Before I dive into the actual details - what precisely did I order? Apart from the tablet itself (there's just one model, no options/variants), I've picked the marker (more expensive version - with the eraser) and a folio case (opens like a book, covers full tablet).</p><p>I'll spare you all the specification details - screen density, dimensions, weight, etc. - you can find all of those at the manufacturer's site. I'd like to focus on impressions &amp; conclusions only.</p><p>IMHO the hardware quality is on par with <strong>Amazon Kindle Oasis 2</strong> - the e-book reader I use daily for a long time. Solid, sturdy, durable, thin &amp; aesthetic. No cheap plastic elements. The only visible differences between Oasis and reMarkable 2 (except for the size) are the lack of screen backlight and turn-page buttons. </p><p>Additional observations:</p><ol><li>the screen is not automatically turned on/off when closing the folio case - TBH I don't find it a significant flaw</li><li>the marker is attached magnetically to the side of the tablet - it snaps precisely, exactly when expected, and it doesn't drop off randomly - zero complaints here</li></ol><hr><p>Marker is not required to use reMarkable 2, but TBH using the tablet w/o it kind of misses the whole point. It's supposed to be <strong>a note-taking device, not an e-book reader</strong>. You've been probably waiting for that, so I'm not stalling anymore: the marker works surprisingly well - both accuracy and latency are more than acceptable:</p><ul><li>I don't remember getting frustrated that the effect of my scribbling doesn't match my intent (<u>precision</u>)</li><li>the <u>feedback</u> is nearly instantaneous - I didn't have a feeling I'm intentionally slowing down (writing or scribbling) to compensate for any device's speed deficiencies</li><li>the speed (of a move, while marker touches the surface) doesn't affect the <u>accuracy</u> (fluidity) - lines remain continuous, without gaps or other inaccuracies</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_5.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Btw. the marker has a removable rod at its tip - that's the only surface that touches the screen when scribbling. I can't tell how quickly it wears out, but you get a few spare ones as replacements. So far, I didn't notice any scratches on the e-ink screen - let's hope it stays that way.</p><p>My marker (the more expensive version) theoretically works like a pencil with an eraser at the opposite end. That's the theory - in practice, it turns out that you can't rub (to erase), but you need to poke. It's not only unintuitive but also quite slow. However - it works.</p><p>Overall, reMarkable 2 hardware doesn't disappoint - it provides <u><strong>a solid base to meet expectations</strong></u>, but TBH there was no <em>"wow effect"</em> - I didn't have a feeling of handling a breakthrough <em>"next-gen"</em> device.</p><p>There are three pieces of software to evaluate pretty much independently:</p><ol><li>Tablet firmware</li><li>PC companion app</li><li>Chrome extension</li></ol><h3 id="tablet-firmware">Tablet firmware</h3><p>Needless to say, good hardware is crap w/o decent software (on the device). Surprisingly reMarkable 2 <strong>doesn't shine here</strong>. Tablet's software is very minimalistic (which is not an issue <em>per se</em>) - you can read e-books and make notes, but the software doesn't do much to improve/expand the experience:</p><ul><li>no dictionaries/Wiki support</li><li>no bookmarking/indexing</li><li>three colors (black, one shade of grey, white) for note-taking :(</li><li>the surface for scribbling is fixed (forget about infinite whiteboard ...) and in fact rather small (but you can easily add more sheets, of course)</li><li>OCR functionality is limited - whole page or nothing</li><li>there's zero integration with popular note-taking tools/platforms (like Evernote or OneNote) - all you can do is to export to image formats like PNG</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_4.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_4.jpg 600w"></figure><p>Unfortunately, I've encountered <strong>few bugs/inconsistencies</strong> as well:</p><ol><li>there were misleading synchronization messages (<em>"failed but succeeded"</em> style of communication ;P)</li><li>once I've tried to change font settings for an article sent via Chrome extension (it was a part of Apache Arrow specification), the device started rebooting repeatedly (about five times) - I was able to replicate the issue</li></ol><hr><p>But to be honest, there are <strong>some pros worth mentioning</strong> as well:</p><ol><li>You can scribble over your e-books (!) - underline, highlight, add comments on margins. It works like a charm, is very convenient, but TBH I didn't check how foolproof it is (e.g., what happens with the notes if I adjust margin settings, so page numeration changes ...).</li><li>There's a nice variety of "pens" available - ones that imitate pencils, brushes, highlighters, or markers - I find the selection wide enough for my needs.</li><li>It's possible to add transparent layers, so you can scribble on one without affecting others.</li><li>One can also use one of many available templates (stencils) for the full pages (only): tables, grids, checklists, organizers, even perspective "helpers" or guitar chord sheets.</li><li>Selecting content is super-convenient - you just draw a shape around an item ("magic lasso" style), and then you can scale, rotate or cut the selection.</li><li>You need to get used to erasing stuff - it's impossible to "select" elements by "clicking"; you need either to use the selection tool or the opposite tip of your marker (if you have the expensive version).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/remarkable_3.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="pc-companion-app">PC companion app</h3><p>What about the PC companion app? I've tried the Windows version, and it ... just works. Its primary purpose is to upload e-books, and it does it in quite a convenient way - you don't need to plug the device to your PC (with USB cable), because it sends the e-book over the Internet.</p><p>When it comes to e-books, two formats are supported: PDF and epub. I have literally zero complaints regarding PDFs - due to the larger screen, the user experience (of reading PDF) was much more pleasant than with <strong>Amazon Kindle Oasis 2</strong>. But my epubs were rendered poorly, like if someone has stripped all the formatting and converted the rich text to raw text. Frankly, I can't tell whether it's the issue with epub format or reMarkable 2, because I've never used epub before (only mobi), but the effect was disappointing anyway.</p><h3 id="the-browser-extension">The browser extension</h3><p>The browser extension is available only for Chrome (sadly). All it does is send whatever page you're reading to your reMarkable 2 as either raw text or PDF (it uses PDF print functionality built into Chrome). I've already mentioned issues with changing font settings for raw text articles. Hopefully, this gets fixed soon.</p><p>I guess it's time to round things up.</p><p><strong>reMarkable 2</strong> is a great piece of hardware that needs some improvement of the software powering it. I dreamed of using it as a minimum-friction note-taking <em>"front-end"</em> for powerful knowledge management platforms I use, but it's very cumbersome at this point. It's a standalone device, <strong>reMarkable 2</strong> isn't even trying to either attach to any existing app ecosystem or creating its own (challenger) one.</p><p>That's a big disappointment. But I believe that CAN be fixed; the potential is still there. The device's essential features - <u>high responsiveness</u>, <u>remarkable accuracy</u>, and <u>low latency times</u> - are there: confirmed and unquestionable.</p><p>What kind of improvements would I gladly see? Here are some ideas:</p><ol><li>OCR for selection - replaces scribbling (in-place) with recognized text</li><li>Import/export from popular knowledge management tools</li><li>Remove the fixed boundaries of quick notes scribbling space (make it "virtually infinite")</li><li>Casting/transmitting the content of the device e.g. to computer screen in real-time (e.g. to present for the larger audience or just collaborate remotely)</li><li>Stencil library for shapes (e.g. sticky notes, basic icons, elements of the most popular visual notations)</li><li>Better UX for syncing stuff (on the tablet) - e.g. force sync button</li></ol><p>What I think is beyond the capabilities of reMarkable 2 (even with regular software updates)?</p><ol><li>More colors (I don't believe they've reduced it to 3 for kicks and giggles ...)</li><li>"Objectualizing" parts of the note and adding dynamic connectors between them (e.g. flows, arrows, lines) that adjust when objects are moved</li></ol><hr><p><strong>So, was it worth it (the price tag)?</strong></p><p>I honestly can't tell at this point.

<p>… or failures are your friends :&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;INTRO&gt;</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>&lt;/INTRO&gt;</p>
<p>The story behind this whole post is a bit lengthy but I’ll try to be brief 🙂</p>
<p>In August of 2019, I’ve received an email from MrTrinsic. Back then, I didn’t yet know what is coming lol.</p>
<p>It turned out that MrTrinsic is a great Amiga enthusiast and he’d asked me to work on his Amiga 1000 … but no on a standard A1000 but with an Amiga 1000 Phoenix motherboard!</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix Enhanced mobo is an extremely rare motherboard replacement for Amiga 1000. Some people think there were no more than 200 units manufactured, others say it was no more than 2000. I’ve no idea either but still, it is very rare so a magic smoke is not an option lol.</p>
<p>This motherboard is an awesome hack in itself and that is why MrTrinsic refers to it as DIVA 😀</p>
<p>Let me quote an excerpt from one of emails.</p>
<p><em>You should mention or point out more clearly that the Phoenix Board is a … DIVA!<br>It is a hack. Just look at the manual what kind of things you can modify and what kind of headers there are to change stuff.<br>The price is that it has an extremely bad signal quality. Plus, it lacks the Buster-Chip that the Amiga 2000 has.<br>The Phoenix is a bad version of the original A2000 from Braunschweig, which in itself was a hacked and beefed-up version of the A1000.<br>Plus, the Phoenix only has two layers. It’s a nightmare as we have seen.</em></p>
<p>It simply always has some problems like stability and compatibility issues which I’ve tried to sort out.</p>
<p>Phoenix mobo was developed in 1989/1990 by our fellow friends from Australia and was one of the very first crowd-funding campaigns! You can read/watch more on one of my fav websites -&gt; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=476" target="_blank">www.amigalove.com</a></p>
<p>Hardware specs are available here -&gt;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amiga.resource.cx/exp/phoenix" target="_blank"> amiga.resource.cx</a></p>
<h4>The plan</h4>
<p>Initially, MrTrinsic asked me to work on some external floppy replacements by Dell which I will cover in another post. Once I’ve figured out that floppy drive issue he’d decided we should start working on The Phoenix project.</p>
<p>At first, he’d send me a large box with gear that he wanted to have in this Amiga. I was like OMG! Not only Phoenix but the whole large project was about to begin!</p>
<p>The plan was to run lots of modern hardware add-ons with Amiga 1000 Phoenix and later try to squeeze it into a nice looking case, plus make it alive and stable.</p>
<p>The first package arrived and I was really excited by what I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix in an A1000 case with lots of mods and hacks already installed, plus, tons of other hardware mods still in boxes … and that was only for starters …</p>

<p>Obviously, the original plan was to MAKE Amiga 1000 Phoenix GREAT AGAIN!</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the main goal was to run a graphics card along with <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA500plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA500plus</a> + <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by iComp</p>
<p>On top of tons of other minor hardware mods, He’d also sent me two graphic cards – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shop.mntmn.com/products/zz9000-for-amiga-preorder" target="_blank">ZZ9000 by MNT</a> and GBAPII++ by KryoFlux.</p>

<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/dg6QzfV.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/dg6QzfV.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h4>Running it</h4>
<p>First things first. Phoenix motherboard is so rare that I first had to learn how it works and how it is all connected etc.</p>
<p>As it gave me a black screen at the very first run, I had to start learning about jumper settings and the board in general</p>
<p>Below, you can see a block diagram of particular parts location to give you an idea of what is where.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of course, I would not move on quickly without MrTrinsics support. He’d pointed me to several sites and sent over some more info about the board itself. One of the most important documents I’ve received was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/phoenix_jumpers_english.pdf" target="_blank">the jumper settings file</a> along with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Phoenix.pdf" target="_blank">original manual</a>.</p>
<p>The above documents gave me the general idea of how things should work. The very first thing that I did was the removal of all added mods. I’ve then tried to run the A1K but still no luck – black screen. MrTrinsic then pointed me to jumper L35 which could cause such behavior if set incorrectly and bingo! It worked! </p>
<p>Since Phoenix has slots for more than one ROM chip, it is possible to install three KickStarts – 1.3. and 3.1 and third as a custom option. That was already done, along with a switch hack.</p>

<p>The problem was that Amiga wasn’t starting every single time. Instead, it booted every couple of times. My next move was to take it out and try running it outside of the case. This is where I’ve started noticing all the awesome texts on the PCB itself. I took PCB out started shooting pics of those texts and greetz for various hackers of that era.</p>

<p>Next, I’ve checked for any obvious problems and when I was happy with this inspection, I’ve put it back to a case to simply avoid any accidental short circuits caused by beer-drinking ;P</p>
<p>I’ve decided that I will try to run it with only Indivision ECS2, and KryoFlux GBAPII++ inserted.</p>
<p>I’ve then located the switch setting for the first ROM and put an awesome<a href="http://www.diagrom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DiagROM by John “<em>Chucky</em>” Hertell</a> in a socket. Yeah, I know, it is a quite a large resistor ;P</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/imgur.com/1Xs3Ren.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/imgur.com/1Xs3Ren.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>To my surprise, it worked flawlessly and I was greeted by a known diag info and a menu a bit later.</p>

<p>Once it worked, I’ve figured that it might be as simple as a flaky ROM socket problem. I’ve put a 2.0 ROM in the place of DiagROM and Viola! It works!</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/CVzvAYd.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/CVzvAYd.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>When I’ve figured that part out, I could move on and start working on the alternative power supply which was …</p>
<h4>HDPLEX + Uber nice Amiga adapter</h4>
<p>MrTrinsic sent me this HQ HDPLEX Pico PSU but he’d also sent me a very cool DIY KIT – ATX2.0d-Amiga adapter which has super cool features like over-voltage/current protection outputs all needed voltages, and has additional floppy power outputs. Moreover, it generates a TICK signal which is good to have for testing.</p>
<p>However, it was a DIY KIT so I had to solder it all up first.</p>

<p>All I needed to do next was to prepare all the wiring. That was a trivial job after taking some measurements. I’ve used wires from my Nissan Patrol spare wiring kit as these are thick (copper) and nice, hence the color mismatch ;P</p>

<p>It worked like a charm so now I had two working power supplies – original and superior to it HDPLEX with a kickass adapter.</p>
<h4>030 cards</h4>
<p>The next step was about adding 68030 CPU to the system. I had two options as MrTrinsic sent me two different solutions.</p>
<p>The First solution was an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://icomp.de/shop-icomp/en/produkt-details/product/ACA500plus.html" target="_blank">ACA500plus</a> card along with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank">an ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by Individual Computers. ACA500plus also had an Ethernet add-on – X-Surf 500</p>
<p>These two make a great solution but for AMIGA 500. There are not many folks out there who played it with it in an A1000 and especially with a Phoenix mobo!</p>

<p>Then I’ve added ACA1233n on an EXTREMELY WANTED DURING PANDEMIC stand 😀 😀 😀</p>

<p>Below, a demo running on this setup</p>
<figure><p><span><iframe width="900" height="507" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJYyBRBnhu8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>

<p>The second setup was a bit different. It is made of four devices.</p>
<ul><li>Open 68000 relocator card</li><li>68030 accelerator card </li><li>SDRam + IDE interface</li><li>IDE2CF interface</li></ul>
<p>This setup also appeared to be working nicely after some tests, however as MrTrinsic pointed out, it has some stability issues and will not allow running some software so it was a backup card in case ACA failed. I don’t have a video of it running though.</p>

<h4>Other mods and add-ons</h4>
<p>Once accel-cards were tested, I’ve started installing OS and testing other mods. To name the few:</p>
<ul><li>X-surf 500 Ethernet card</li><li>RapidRoad USB</li><li>Indivision ECS v2</li><li>SCSI2SD </li><li>KryoFlux GBAPII++</li></ul>

<p>Indivision ECS v2 and SCSI2SD worked flawlessly so I started playing with other gear.</p>

<p>After installing all the needed software I’ve finally managed to get an IP addr from my local DHCP server</p>

<p>Obviously, I wouldn’t be myself if I didn’t destroy something. I’ve accidentally connected the RapidRoad USB module to a clock port the other way around. The magic smoke appeared and…</p>

<p>Of course, I had to fix it. After a while, it turned out that only 3R3 resistor was fried.</p>

<h4>GFX cards</h4>
<p>Once all other major mods were working more or less correctly, I could start testing GFX cards high-res modes.</p>
<p>This is where it all started to go wrong …</p>

<p>I had two cards to test with this setup – GBAPII++ by Kryoflux and ZZ9000 by MNT. </p>
<p>GBAPII++ worked nicely only with green 030 cards, but in such config, there would be no Ethernet card.</p>

<p>Then I’ve tried running ZZ9000 along with green 030 and ACA cards but I’ve encountered autoconfig problems.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve focused on ACA500plus with ACA1233n and I just couldn’t make it work. </p>
<p>When ACA was inserted then GBAPII++ was completely invisible to the system.</p>
<p>After updating tons of libraries, firmware and reinstalling OS a few times without any luck, we’ve figured out that it might be a power issue. MrTrinsic ordered an adapter for A500 which would allow pumping in more power.</p>
<p>I’ve first tested it with a stock A500.</p>

<p>Same story, GBAPII++ was invisible but I’ve checked it with A1K and power injector adapter just to be sure … unfortunately no luck again.</p>

<h4>Unfinished 🙁</h4>
<p>I’ve invested weeks of time into this GFX problem research but finally, I had to give up on this project for now. It is still in an unfinished state until we will find a solution to all problems. The project is partially done but it requires more work and I hope to cover it someday in one of the future posts making Amiga 1000 Phoenix great again!</p>
<p>But worry not, this gave birth to a new project which is even more awesome.</p>
<p>Currently, it is a work-in-progress but that is a story for another blog post 🙂</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2Ftelemelt-FINAL.png?v=1601250432872" alt="Telemelt Logo"></p>
<p><a href="https://telemelt.com/">Telemelt</a> is a web-based multi-emulator (<a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>/<a href="https://www.libretro.com/">libretro</a>) designed to recreate the experience of playing console games with a single controller in a room full of friends.</p>
<p>Gathering around a TV and collectively attempting to beat a game has been a consistent joy throughout my life, and is one of the rituals I miss the most with the ones we're separated from right now. I wanted to create a way to play single player/hotseat games with friends remotely that was free and required minimal setup. Netplay has always been unsatisfying for this, since only the host had low enough latency for games that require tight timing. I started this project in March, and have been pouring my heart into it every day possible since then.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2F6dfcbe63-2f80-4bb3-a780-a48a51dc0a19.image.png?v=1602011998888" alt="collage"></p>
<p>The system skips traditional netplay to allow a single player to assume host responsibility and experience <strong>zero network latency</strong> for games with demanding response times, with the viewers processing frames as broadcasted by the player. The virtual controller/host can be instantly passed to any user in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Designed to be lowest hassle way to play emulated games with a friend or loved one, even if they are not tech savvy!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No port forwarding, no IP addresses thanks to auto-generated URL</li>
<li>No installation or downloads, everything works in browser</li>
<li>Mappings for common/inexpensive controllers (PS3/4, XB360/1, Switch JC/Pro etc..) on both USB/BT thanks to RetroArch bindings</li>
<li>Always free! No tracking, no logins, no paid advertisements - personal budget allocated for Azure costs to serve thousands of users for months</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2Fgiphy.gif?v=1602018705346" alt="Become Player"></p>
<p><strong>Focus on the experience of passing <em>a single controller</em> between people</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This allows for a unique and efficient architecture that provides a consistent experience with minimal bandwidth</li>
<li>No AV is transmitted! Only controller and serialized state data, made even smaller by <a href="https://github.com/phretaddin/schemapack">schemapack</a></li>
<li>User state error checked per frame and reconciled via <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> server if needed</li>
<li>Takes advantage of deterministic nature of certain libretro cores - like a broadcasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun">TAS</a></li>
<li>Rethink the kinds of content you would play (painting, music collaboration, RPGs, game shows)</li>
<li>Everyone working towards the same goal keeps people engaged</li>
</ul>

<strong>Quick start - Open up a Discord/Zoom/Meet etc.. with friends and try some of these!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minigame collections (player transfer system is fast enough to keep up with switching on every stage)</li>
<li>Practice for a week then hold live olympic games (world/winter/summer/california games etc)</li>
<li>Live sound test or NSF/VGM listening party</li>
<li>Homebrews, hacks, and live demoparties (with live reactions)</li>
<li>Golf / bowling / fishing games to chill</li>
<li>Create music collaboratively in LSDJ/NTRQ</li>
<li>TV Gameshows</li>
<li>Painting games (mouse support!)<br>

<li>Grind through an rpg over a few weeks (savestates work great for this!)</li>
<li>Alternate copiloting an game no one has played before on gamefaqs</li>
<li>Hotseat tactical / turn based games</li>
<li>Teach a friend to speedrun with the ability to demonstrate and practice together</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/productivity-cover.png" alt="Productivity cover"></p><h2 id="what-is-productivity">What Is Productivity?</h2><p>Let’s define productivity first:</p><blockquote><p>Productivity represents the efficiency of a person to perform a specific task.</p></blockquote><p>We often think it is a state of constant efficiency that allows us to do everything faster and better, but this is wrong. <em>Productivity is a measurement per individual task.</em> With some assignments, you are very productive, while with others, your efficiency is terrible.</p><p>It’s because, for some tasks, you unconsciously are doing the right things, while for the others, you need to rethink your approach. And this also means that you can focus on those more important tasks and become more efficient at them.</p><p>At the end of this guide, you will have all the necessary knowledge to analyze your approach toward different assignments and make the corresponding adjustments to be more productive. It helped me <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/faang-preparation/">land an offer at facebook</a> and become a part of <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/iulian-gulea">Toptal</a> — one of the best freelance communities on the planet, and I hope that it will help you, too.</p><h2 id="the-four-levels-of-mastery">The Four Levels Of Mastery</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-of-mastery-1.png" alt="The Pyramid Of Mastery"></p><p>Before diving into different productivity techniques, let’s first dive into more details about the <em>essence</em> of productivity. And to do that, I will use the <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">Pyramid of Mastery</a> — a model that allows you to understand better a domain of interest, its constituent parts, and how to become an expert in it.</p><p>It does so by defining a domain through four types of entities:</p><ul><li><strong>Elements.</strong> These are the building blocks of the field of interest, that include concepts, ideas, and entities;</li><li><strong>Rules.</strong> These are the laws that govern a domain. This layer comprises both rules that define the interaction between various Elements as well as organizational and governing rules at the domain level;</li><li><strong>Tools.</strong> These are the instruments you use to perform the activities within a field;</li><li><strong>Frameworks.</strong> These are combinations of the above levels that allow for faster achievement of preset goals for which the Framework was created;</li></ul><p>For an in-depth explanation of the Pyramid of Mastery, you can read the original <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/pyramid-of-mastery/">article</a> on it.</p><p>Now, once you have an understanding of the model, let’s see how we can define productivity through the prism of it.</p><h2 id="productivity-elements">Productivity Elements</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-elements.png" alt="Pyramid of Mastery - Elements"></p><p>What are the Elements of productivity, the building blocks that you need to know about in order to excel at it?</p><p>I find this to be the most underestimated and overlooked layer. Very few people are thinking about what makes a productive person or about what productivity consists of. Instead, they try to squeeze in more time using tools, calendars, and other tools.</p><p>But knowing the fundamentals is vital if you want to become an expert in something. Therefore, here are some of the Elements that can help you be more productive if you understand them.</p><h3 id="human-senses">Human Senses</h3><p>Our senses are the only mechanisms that allow us to get information about the world around us. Humans have five main senses through which they receive information:</p><ul><li>Vision</li><li>Hearing</li><li>Touch</li><li>Smell</li><li>Taste</li></ul><p>Each sense has its own throughput:</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/conscious_attention_bit_sec.png#c" alt="Image with conscious attention throughput"></p><p>Therefore, we receive the most information visually, then through hearing, touch, smell, and taste.</p><p>If you are interested in the topic of human senses, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/human-senses/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="attention">Attention</h3><p>We receive a flood of information through our senses at every moment, but only a tiny bit of it reaches our awareness. This filter that orients our focus toward different stimuli is <strong>attention.</strong></p><p>Attention is the process that selects which sensory information is preferentially processed and ultimately reaches our awareness.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>There are two types of attention: <em>Goal-Directed</em> attention (GDA) and <em>Stimulus-Driven</em> attention (SDA). The GDA is the voluntary effort to focus on something, be it reading this article, cutting vegetables, watching a movie, or writing code.</p><p>On the other hand, SDA is the involuntary reaction toward stimuli that are salient enough to grab our attention:</p><ul><li>contrasting things (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.);</li><li>intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.);</li><li>certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.);</li></ul><p>If you are interested in the topic of attention, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/attention/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="working-memory">Working Memory</h3><p>For tasks that require cognitive effort, once we focused our attention on a specific subset of stimuli we got from our senses, it is only here that we can finally perform some mental work.</p><p>Working Memory is the place in our memory where we can consciously process and manipulate data. It has a fundamental limitation, though: its processing capacity is limited to ~4 chunks of information.</p><p>A <em>chunk</em> is a relative unit of measurement that depends on different factors, such as:</p><ul><li>familiarity with the topic;</li><li>complexity of the concept;</li><li>one’s mental agility;</li></ul><p>For instance, in the simple task of solving this simple math equation <code>21 * 2</code>, you have to store number <code>21</code> as a chunk, store number <code>2</code> as another chunk, then, having these 2 in your working memory, do the multiplication, and store the result <code>42</code> as a third chunk.</p><p>However, in a debate on “homeschooling vs. formal education,” both concepts each represent a chunk. As it is a complex concept, you can then zoom in or out on either of those as information is stored in a complex network of associations in our brain.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about working memory, I wrote a separate, in-depth <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/working-memory/">article</a> about it.</p><h3 id="long-term-memory">Long-Term Memory</h3><p>Our Long-Term Memory (LTM) holds all the information, knowledge, skills, plans, and memories. What you commit to the LTM can stay there for your whole life. Although there is a tendency to forget things, you can strengthen your memories using repetition.</p><h3 id="task-process">Task Process</h3><p>A task usually represents a specific result you want to achieve (e.g., write an article, build a website, create a marketing campaign, etc.). But behind any such assignment, there is a sequence of steps necessary to complete before you can say that you have done the task. It is called a <strong>process.</strong></p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/task-process.png" alt="Image of a task process"></p><p>Each step in the process is a smaller task that will advance you closer to your desired result.</p><p>Learn and understand the necessary steps needed to achieve the end goal — it will show you what you are doing well and where you are wasting your time. Besides this, it is always easier to follow a list of specific action steps rather than figure out what to do on the fly.</p><h3 id="domain-specific-elements">Domain Specific Elements</h3><p>Finally, since productivity is measured per task, it means that besides the Elements mentioned above, there are some domain-specific ones that you must also understand to be more effective.</p><p>And this is valid for all layers of the pyramid — you must know your domain of activity. Otherwise, you cannot be productive in it since you will have to learn a lot, and learning is a slow and effortful process in itself.</p><p>Now, once we have enumerated the primary elements, let’s discuss the Rules that govern the domain of productivity.</p><h2 id="productivity-rules">Productivity Rules</h2><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/the-pyramid-of-mastery/the-pyramid-rules.png" alt="Pyramid of Mastery - Rules"></p><p>How the Elements we have enumerated interact? Here are some essential Rules that govern how we function and perform cognitive work.</p><h3 id="stimulus-driven-attention-overrides-goal-directed-attention">Stimulus-Driven Attention Overrides Goal-Directed Attention</h3><p>Imagine that while you are reading this article, you hear the sound of a breaking plate in the kitchen, which distracts you from reading. Or you are working on a report, and suddenly, the light starts to flash, thus distracting you from the job.</p><p>Stimulus-Driven attention can override your voluntary, Goal-Directed attention. This is bad news for productivity since, most of the time, working on a task means we have to engage this Goal-Directed attention to focus on some things consciously. And because those things might be boring, monotonous, or uninteresting, we can get distracted much easier by any unrelated stimulus.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/bright-shiny-objects.jpg#c" alt="Cartoon where dogs in a meeting are being distracted by a squirrel"></p><p>The following stimuli are all capable of distracting your Goal-Directed Attention:</p><ul><li>high-contrast changes in our environment (stillness to movement, loud to soft, silence to sound, dark to bright, etc.);</li><li>intensity stimulation (extreme sounds, sights, etc.);</li><li>some certain impulses we find vital or appealing (dangerous things, beautiful things, shiny things, etc.);</li><li>“important” (e.g., one’s own name).</li></ul><h3 id="working-memory-is-physiologically-incapable-to-multitask">Working Memory Is Physiologically Incapable To Multitask</h3><p>Imagine you are in a warehouse with an immense storage capacity (that’s your Long-Term Memory), a single small table with four zones where any kind of work can be performed (that’s your Working Memory), and a storekeeper who does all the work and knows where everything is stored. One constraint is that the storekeeper can work <em>only</em> at the table, so you must first put it there before doing anything.</p><p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/working-memory-analogy.png#c" alt="Image of a table with four zones and a storekeeper"></p><p>Each chunk takes one slot on the table. And you can get it either from your senses (imagine a conveyor system that brings things directly to your table) or search in the warehouse (which takes time).</p><p>Suppose you are working on a report. The storekeeper searches for relevant information in your Long-Term memory, puts it on the table, takes some from the conveyor, and puts it on the table as well, where they can manipulate, combine, dissect, and mix those concepts.</p><p>But suddenly, you are being called by your spouse regarding the plans for the weekend. Ideally, the storekeeper should take the time to carefully take the chunks off the table and put them in a dedicated place where they can find them later. In reality, however, the storekeeper sweeps off in a hurry everything from the table and rushes to put on it chunks related to plans for the weekend: movies, cuisine, activities, etc.</p><p>Then, when you are done talking with your spouse, you stare blankly at the computer screen, trying to recall what you were doing before the call. The storekeeper runs hysterically around the table in these moments, trying to find out something, but they don’t know what exactly to look for. Finally, you see the opened MS Excel window and remember you were working on the report.</p><p>But then another problem arises. You cannot recall the latest thoughts you had just before the call. The storekeeper cannot find the chunks they swept off the table. They looked everywhere, but the chunks just vanished. And …</p></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Weak maps allow creating a map from objects to arbitrary values (similar to SplObjectStorage) without preventing the objects that are used as keys from being garbage collected. If an object key is garbage collected, it will simply be removed from the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very useful new feature, as it allows users to worry even less about leaving memory leaks in their code. While this might not be an issue for most PHP developers, it is certainly something to watch out for when writing long-running processes, for example using ReactPHP. With WeakMaps, references to an object automatically get garbage collected, once the object is no longer available.</p>
<p>If you would do the same thing with an array, you would still have a reference to the object, thus leaking memory.</p>

<h2 id="new-codevalueerrorcode-exception">New <code>ValueError</code> Exception <a href="#new-codevalueerrorcode-exception">#</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8 introduces a new built-in exception class called <code>ValueError</code>. It extends <code>\Exception</code> and PHP throws this exception, every time you pass a value to a function, which has a valid type - but can not be used for the operation. Prior to PHP 8, this would result in a warning.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
 
/**
 * We pass an array to array_rand,
 * which is of the correct type. But
 * array_rand expects non-empty arrays.
 *
 * This throws a ValueError exception.
 */
array_rand([], 0);

/**
 * The depth argument for json_decode is a
 * valid integer, but it must be greater than 0

<h2 id="added-support-for-attributes">Added support for Attributes <a href="#added-support-for-attributes">#</a></h2>
<p>PHP 8's attributes actually consist of a number of RFCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes_v2</a>
</li>
<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attribute_amendments</a>

<li>RFC: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/shorter_attribute_syntax_change</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Attributes are definitely one of the biggest changes in PHP 8, and they can be a bit tricky to understand at first. In short, attributes allow you to add meta-data to PHP functions, parameters, classes, etc.
This meta-data can then be retrieved programatically - whereas in PHP 7 and lower, you would need to parse doclocks, attributes allow you to access this information deeply integrated into PHP itself.</p>
<p>To make this a bit clearer, lets say that you want to allow users to add a middleware to a controller class/method by using an attribute.</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);
// First, we need to define the attribute. An Attribute itself is just a plain PHP class, that is annotated as an Attribute itself.

#[Attribute]
class ApplyMiddleware
{
    public array $middlware = [];

    public function __construct(...$middleware) {
        $this-&gt;middleware = $middleware;
    }
}

// This adds the attribute to the MyController class, with the "auth" middleware as an argument.

#[ApplyMiddleware('auth')]
class MyController
{
    public function index() {}
}

// We can then retrieve all ApplyMiddleware attributes on our class using reflection
// And read the given middleware arguments.

$reflectionClass = new ReflectionClass(MyController::class);

$attributes = $reflectionClass-&gt;getAttributes(ApplyMiddleware::class);

foreach ($attributes as $attribute) {
    $middlewareAttribute = $attribute-&gt;newInstance();
    dump($middlewareAttribute-&gt;middleware);
}

exit;
</pre>
</pre>

<p>This RFC proposes to introduce a short hand syntax, which allows combining the definition of properties and the constructor:</p>
<pre data-theme="light" data-filename="index.php" data-php="8"><pre data-filename="index.php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);

class User {
    public function __construct(
        public int $id,
        public string $name,
    ) {}

<p>This RFC proposes adding a new match expression that is similar to switch but with safer semantics and the ability to return values.</p>

<h2>Wennington Green, Bow, London</h2>



<p>At the intersection of Roman Road and Grove Road lies Wennington Green – a patch of land in <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/mile-end-park-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mile End Park </a>principally sculpted by flying bombs. In fact, an English Heritage plaque on the railway bridge a little further down Grove Road commemorates the first one to strike London.</p>



<p>The blitz largely levelled the hundred or so turn-of-the-century terraces, common stock of the working class East End, on what is now the Green but up until the early ‘90s a row of dilapidated dwellings persisted. These residences were mostly derelict, abandoned and occasionally squatted, but for one, ex-docker Mr Sidney Gale of No. 193, a condemned house remained a home.</p>



<p>Indeed, in 1993, the final row was fated to be demolished as part of Tower Hamlet’s council’s plan to create a Green Corridor, unifying the broken line of parkland between the Isle of Dogs and the established lung of <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/victoria-park-east-london-bow/">Victoria Park</a>. It was a means to cleanse the area of the legacy of prefabs that had homed the dislocated population post-war and a redemptive space for those in the high-rise accommodation which had replaced the traditional terraces. ‘What people who live in tower blocks want is parkland,’ declared Councillor Eric Flounders.</p>



<p>Yet psychogeographer Iain Sinclair was sceptical of the council’s motives, calling it ‘an Arcadia for the underclass… the whole scheme was a disinterested attempt at municipal aesthetics’. Pointedly, the area was in direct sight of Mrs Thatcher’s commerce baby, Canary Wharf, and the call for a Green was not a far cry from the original motivations to create Victoria Park, opened in 1845. Vicky Park is the oldest purpose built recreation ground in London, conceived to curb disease contracted in damp and cramped conditions and as a means harness working-class wildness. Indeed, Bow is an area rich with connotations of a strong working-class community, but also radicalism and revolt.</p>



<p>Mr Gale forcefully resisted eviction from No. 193 by the council for a number of years, even festooning the property with banners to affirm his unrelenting presence, but, realising his campaign was ultimately futile, he eventually yielded and was re-homed nearby. Gale’s loss was artist Rachel Whiteread’s gain. The practitioner had been seeking a condemned property in London for over two years to realise a project which was essentially a development upon her Turner Prize nominated sculpture, Ghost (1990); a room-sized cast of a bedsit contained in a Victorian property in Archway.</p>



<p>Whiteread, supported by art commissioners Artangel, approached the London Borough of Tower Hamlets&nbsp;council about utilising the property and the authorities duly consented. In the beginning, the council were of the opinion that, ‘It won’t cost the neighbourhood a penny and will provide an unusual landmark for the area,’ however, by the time the bricks were removed and the sculpture was exposed, Councillor Flounders, Chair of Bow Parks Board, denounced it as ‘excrescent.’</p>



<h2>Building Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="692" src="https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-1024x692.jpg" alt="Rachel Whiteread's House on Grove Road in Bow, photo by David Hoffman" srcset="https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-300x203.jpg 300w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman-768x519.jpg 768w, https://romanroadlondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Rachel-Whiteread-house-credit-David-Hoffman.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Rachel Whiteread’s house view of Grove Road © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>To make House, Whiteread used the physical house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mould, making a cast from the interior by spraying a skin of liquid concrete around a metal armature constructed to support the weight of the work. Coating the whole house took over a month and an additional ten days were needed for the concrete to cure and set. Once solid, scaffolding was erected and Whiteread and her assistants began to remove the exterior brick structure.</p>



<p>What was revealed was an uncanny sight – the concrete impressed with the idiosyncrasies of over a century of domestic habitation. Depressions translated into protrusions; the industrial material betraying past human intimacies: soot marking the fire; yellow paint from a top-floor bedroom. The floors in-between stories could not be cast so, as local Markham Hall recalls, it resembled a ‘wedding cake.’ But the marriage at hand, between the art world and the East End, was to be short-lived and volatile.</p>



<h2>Reactions to Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>It was essentially a neutral process, with no specific moral agenda, but Whiteread conceded ‘I knew of course, while I was making House, it had a political dimension. You can’t make a cast of a house in a poor area of London and not be political.’ Yet it became ‘far more political than I could have predicted.’ Seemingly, the council had also underestimated its resonance, as it quickly became front-page news, attracting scores of art-pilgrims and causing traffic chaos. Its status was even brought to debate in the House of Commons. The council couldn’t wait to get rid of the work fast enough, coming to regard it as a politically embarrassing monument to an impoverished history and standing in the way of the construction of a less threatening green space.</p>

Why Not? © David Hoffman</figcaption></figure>



<p>People reacted to House so strongly as it transcended the individual and became an archetype; an emblem for the area’s time-honoured mode of living. Indeed, it raised pressing questions regarding degrading housing stock and what should be done with it, the creeping gentrification of a historically tight working class community and scepticism towards the authority of those instigating change for the supposed ‘greater good’. In whose name was this change really for? And poignantly, it confronted these questions on its own material terms – concrete being the material used to fix the original Victorian House’s bricks; the embossed surface betraying the umbilical cords of pipes and power-lines which linked the individual house with the local, national and global public.</p>



<p>At base, Whiteread made an empty space, the negative void of the vacated property, into a positive object but insists ‘the work is to do with absence not presence.’ Implicitly, House was defined by the object it was not. When one refers to a ‘house’ we generally mean the façade as publicly viewed from the street, the interior is intimate – that is the home. Whiteread’s sculpture was resolutely an interior; an unsettling mass of inside, out.</p>



<p>The form elicited unease as when we have an intimate relationship with a space, we start to ignore its intricacies, instead handling navigating through the general form unconsciously. Thus, the sculpture was uncanny as it solidified the overlooked, demanding a long-looking, deep contemplation, as one attempted to decipher the inverted forms. Whiteread neglected to furnish her House with meaning but it was predominantly envisioned as what the populace of Bow would soon lose sight of. The interior, a family home, was left out in the cold and significantly, Whiteread chose not to cast the attic space, as if riffing on the idiom ‘left with no roof over their heads.’</p>



<p>It’s understandable then, that there was some resentment from locals towards House as they perceived it to be adding insult to injury over the demolition of such homes in the area, and a crassness in exposing working-class abode for the ‘arty’ leisure classes. Yet, this wasn’t just a case of Art World vs. East Enders, the opinions were split within both camps: in the Art World, Andrew Graham-Dixon proclaimed it ‘a strange and fantastical object which also amounts to one of the most extraordinary and imaginative public sculptures created by an English artist this century.’ To Brian&nbsp;Sewell, it was a ‘meritless gigantism.’ Sewell’s scorn found resonance in one local’s assertion that ‘an engineer could have done it; I don’t see it as creative.’ Whereas, another neighbour to the site regarded it as ‘brilliant,’ reckoning it to be ‘a new way of looking at traditional things.’</p>



<p>House’s evicted resident, Mr Gale, protested, ‘They’re taking the wee-wee.’ He questioned, ‘How can they get grants for arts projects when we can’t get grants for homes? I could have bought a new home for my family with this money.’ His sentiment was echoed in graffiti scrawled on the sculpture: ‘WOT FOR?’ Another renegade scribe rebuffing ‘Why not!’</p>



<p>House’s economics became even more contentious when Whiteread won the £20,000 Turner Prize for the work (the first woman to receive the honour), and then £40,000 from the rebel K Foundation (composed of members of the defunct pop group KLF) for the ‘worst artist of the year.’ Whiteread split the latter money between Shelter, a charity for the London’s homeless, and a fund to supplement young artists. On the same day, the&nbsp;Council made the decision to refuse House a stay of execution. By this time, many people (philanthropists, dealers, galleries) had offered to purchase House, but money offered to the Council to retain its presence was blasted by the authorities as ‘bribes.’ In any case, Whiteread was adamant that the sculpture was ‘absolutely specific to the site’ thus preferred its destruction to relocation.</p>



<p>The bulldozers came on January 11th 1994. The <em>East London Advertiser</em> reports that ‘art lovers’ chained themselves to the railings in attempt to save the work, quoting one as protesting, ‘We’re doing this because House represents the destruction of not only homes but whole communities in East London.’ Another suggested its removal was a sacrilegious act, perceiving House as ‘a headstone to the houses that were here.’ But the sculpture’s fate was sealed. As Whiteread succinctly mused ‘it took three and a half years to develop, four months to make, and thirty minutes to demolish.’</p>



<h2>The legacy of Rachel Whiteread’s House</h2>



<p>The Houseless Park has now had over 20 years to bed in to the community’s psyche and flourish naturally. In all of the articles and art history books I have trawled to substantiate …</p></div></div>

    <p>Ever since teaching <a href="https://github.com/chiphuyen/stanford-tensorflow-tutorials">TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research</a>, I’ve known that I love teaching and want to do it again.</p>

<p>In early 2019, I started talking with Stanford’s CS department about the possibility of coming back to teach. After almost two years in development, the course has finally taken shape. I’m excited to let you know that I’ll be teaching <strong>CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford</strong> in January 2021.</p>

<p>The course wouldn’t have been possible with the help of many people including <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/">Christopher Ré</a>, Jerry Cain, Mehran Sahami, <a href="https://pirroh.fyi/">Michele Catasta</a>, Mykel J. Kochenderfer.</p>

<p>Here’s a short description of the course. You can find the (tentative) syllabus below.</p>

<p><em>This project-based course covers the iterative process for designing, developing, and deploying machine learning systems. It focuses on systems that require massive datasets and compute resources, such as large neural networks. Students will learn about the different layers of the data pipeline, approaches to model selection, training, scaling, as well as how to deploy, monitor, and maintain ML systems. In the process, students will learn about important issues including privacy, fairness, and security.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong>: <em>At least one of the following; CS229, CS230, CS231N, CS224N, or equivalent. Students should have a good understanding of machine learning algorithms and should be familiar with at least one framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX.</em></p>

<p>For Stanford students interested in taking the course, <a href="https://bit.ly/appy-mlsys-2021">you can fill in the application here</a>. The course will be evaluated based on one final project (at least 50%), three short assignments, and class participation.</p>

<p>For those outside Stanford, I’ll try to make as much of the course materials available as possible. I’ll post updates about the course on <a href="https://twitter.com/chipro">Twitter</a> or you can check back here from time to time.</p>

<p>Since these are all new materials, I’m hoping to get early feedback. If you’re interested in becoming a reviewer for the course materials, please shoot me an email. Thank you!</p>

<p>2020-10-23</p>
<p>For my current job I knew I wanted a Linux laptop again, after enough exposure to Apples ecosystem. Naturally a Thinkpad came to mind as an option, but I wanted to give used hardware a chance, given that Thinkpads are known to be reliable and well built.</p>
<p>I went with used/refurbished hardware from a vendor I know and trust for a while now, <a href="https://www.lapstore.de/">lapstore.de</a>, and I could not be happier with my choice. I went with a Lenovo Thinkpad T460s, as a compromise between decent performance, weight, screen size and good Linux support out of the box. This model is 5 years old, but CPUs are not evolving that fast anymore, so it still feels very snappy with everything I'm doing. The internal screen could have used a slightly higher resolution for my taste, but I am rarely using it these days.</p>
<p>One big advantage of the older models is access to the old version of the docking stations, which are totally worth it. At home the laptop sits there, gets charged and drives my 4K display easily, while being hooked up to my mouse, keyboard and network cable. Speaking of ports: the T460s still has proper Rj-45, USB 2.0/3.0 and HDMI ports. No adapters needed!</p>
<p>Summing up, here is why I think used hardware is worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is cheaper. Sure, your employer might be paying for it, but maybe you have a fixed budget and get more out of it this way.</li>
<li>it is good for the environment.</li>
<li>it will likely last for the next few years. Most of us don't need the latest hardware to do our job. I would argue that quite a bit of software could run better if developers weren't handed the latest and greatest hardware as a given</li>
<li>you are not giving up support. Sure, it might break. But so does a new one. There are quite a few respectable dealers out there who offer 3 years of warranty for little extra cost. Actually the first (used) docking station I got was not working ok, so I got an immediate, brand new replacement 2 days later.</li>
<li>Linux runs great on older hardware. With Kubuntu 20.04 everything works out of the box, including webcam, multimedia keys, docking/undocking or switching between different screen configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not give used hardware a try?</p>
<p>EDIT [2020-10-27] fixed typo "wantec"</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 <div>
  
  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 October 2020</strong></label></p><p>An <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=three+weeks&amp;oq=three+weeks">eternity</a> ago, I published a <a href="https://www.peterstefek.me/focused-render.html">blog post</a> about a shader I wrote. In that post, I casually repeated a piece of gpu folklore I picked up as a wee opengl enthusiast almost a decade ago,   </p>
<p>
"Using if statements inside a shader will cause performance degradation."  
</p>

<p>People on the internet seemed a little skeptical about this statement, and I realized my advice might be outdated. So this post is a quick follow up about the cost of branching on more modern gpus.  </p>
<p>Before we talk about branching, what is a gpu? A GPU or graphics processing unit, is a special piece of hardware initially developed to crunch numbers for graphics calculations. It accomplishes this goal quickly through a large amount of parallelization.   </p>
<p>GPUs can run many threads at the same time in parallel. These threads are generally executed in groups called warps (CUDA), invocations (Vulkan) and waves (I will use the term warp, but they are all interchangeable). On recent Nvidia hardware (Ampere/ Volta / Pascal) these warps contain 32 threads. Pascal for example can theoretically run up to four independent instructions per warp over 56 warps of 32 threads which comes out to a mind blowing 7168 instructions per cycle. </p>
<p>Each warp can only execute one instruction at a time. However that instruction can be executed for each of the threads in the warp. This means the GPU can execute 32 copies of the same instruction in parallel for each thread in the warp at once.   </p>
<p>However, taking both sides of a branch will cause the threads inside a warp to "diverge". This means some threads will need to execute one side of the branch and some will need to execute the other. Unfortunately, both instructions can not be executed simultaneously for threads in the same warp. So these divergent instructions must be executed sequentially.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.  </p>
<p>Consider the <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdyyWV">following fragment shader</a>:<br>
<code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{  <br>
  </code></p><p><code>
  // TUNE THIS AMOUNT TO YOUR GPU STRENGTH<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (mod(fragCoord.x, 2.) &lt; 1. &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>In fragment shaders like the one above, each warp is composed of a set of spatially close pixels. Each warp in this shader should diverge because each horizontally adjacent pixel takes a different side of the branch. Let's say the cost of each inner loop is n cycles. Since each side of the branch is executed in series, each warp must take at least 2n cycles, even though each thread uses only one side of the branch. These effects scale with the number of threads in the distinct divergent paths taken (up to 32x in Nvidia hardware). Here's another shader which should have roughly four branches per warp. <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wsVyzG">This shader</a> will take at least 4n cycles.  </p>
<p>However, let's look a <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsVyzG">second shader</a>:   </p>
<p><code>
void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
  </code></p><p><code>
  // USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  int workAmount = 2000;<br>
  float incr = 1. / float(workAmount);<br>
  float outColor = 0.0;  
<p>// USE THIS VARIABLE TO TOGGLE BRANCHING<br>
  bool branch = true;  </p>
<p>if (fragCoord.x &lt; iResolution.x / 2.0 &amp;&amp; branch) {
    </p><div><p>
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
        </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(0.0,outColor,0.0,1.0);
    </p></div>
  } else {
    <div><p>
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; workAmount; i++) {
          </p><p>
          outColor += incr;
          </p><p>
      }<br>
      fragColor = vec4(outColor,0.0,0.0,1.0);
      </p></div>
  }
  </code></p><p><code>
}
</code></p>
<p>This shader should run roughly twice as fast as the other shader even though roughly the same number of pixels take each branch. This is because most of the warps do not diverge (with the exception of a few around half way across the screen).   </p>
<p><strong>Nvidia Specifics</strong><br>
As far as I can tell, there are roughly two different ways of nvidia graphics cards handle divergence with in a warp.</p>
<p><strong>Thread Masking (Pre Volta)</strong><br>
On pre volta Nvidia card, divergence was handled by something called thread masking.   </p>
<p>Basically when a conditional is hit, a thread mask is generated.  We can think of this mask as a 32 entry array. Each entry specifies whether the corresponding thread takes the first side of the branch or not. The first side is then executed for each of those threads. After the first side of the branch is then executed, the mask is reversed and the other side of the branch is executed.   </p>
<p>This thread mask strategy exists in part because there is only one program counter per warp on pre volta gpus. So essential every thread in the warp must be at the same place in the program. The only way we know which threads to execute, is by using the mask.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/pascal-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that only the threads which need to execute the branch actually are assigned to computational cores. So if no threads execute one side of the branch, no work is done.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Thread Scheduling (Volta and Beyond)</strong><br>
One big change in the Volta architecture and beyond is the introduction of "Independent Thread Scheduling".   </p>
<p>In Independent thread scheduling, each thread has its own program counter. This allows each warp to track the execution of every thread at a fine grain level. However, we can still only execute only one instruction at a time. So the actual runtime of a branch does not change.  </p>
<p>So if Independent Thread Scheduling does not speed up branching, what does it do? Independent Thread Scheduling enables both sides of a branch to execute concurrently but not in parallel.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/shader-branch/volta-divergence.png" width="65%"> 
</p>

<p>The above image is taken from the Volta whitepaper.</p>
<p>The reason for this shift is because before Volta, branches were places where deceptive deadlocks could occur. <br>
<code>
leader_id = 0<br>
If (threadIdx.x == leader_id) {<br>
  </code></p><p><code>
    // Do some inital work
  </code></p><p><code>
} else {
  <p>
    // Wait for leader to finish it's work<br>
    // then do my work
  </p>
}<br>
</code></p>
<p>In the above compute shader pseudo code, we have 31 "follower" threads waiting for the "leader thread" to finish (using in-warp shared local memory) before executing their own instructions. </p>
<p>On a Pascal GPU or below, if the else side of the branch is executed first, a deadlock will occur. The leader will never get a chance to start it's work because its followers will be waiting for it. </p>
<p>Independent Thread Scheduling gets around these locking problems by interlacing the two diverging paths. </p>
<p><strong>Article TLDR</strong><br>
Branch divergence in warp makes all parts of the branch execute in sequence which slows down the shader. Branching divergence between warps does not affect runtime.  </p>
<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br>
Branch execution on gpus is surprisingly deep, and there are many edge cases I didn't address and I also didn't touch gpu vendors other than Nvidia. Here are some good sources if you want to learn more:  </p>

              <p>Warp is a puzzle–based stealth action game where you play as Zero, a little orange alien with a big score to settle!</p>
<p>I copied that off the game's website.</p>
<p>The important part is in the first five words. Warp is puzzle-based. That's how the game is billed, that's what I expected.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8-1-5.jpg" alt="" title="WARNING, WARNING, A CUTE ORANGE THING IS LOOSE. RUN AROUND POINTLESSLY AND DO NOT LOOK UP. WARNING." width="650" height="382" srcset="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8-1-5-300x176.jpg 300w, http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8-1-5.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></p>
<p>And let's get this out of the way: Warp is a good game. The puzzles are fun, the game is pretty, the plot is predictable but in the good we're-all-familiar-with-this-myth-so-let's-get-the-cliches-out-of-the-way-and-have-some-puzzle-fun manner. I like myths. Myths are good. Myths attached to a puzzle game are even better.</p>
<p>Zero, the playable character, has a host of special abilities. He can warp through solid walls and obstructions, he can warp inside objects and explode them from the inside, he can swap places with objects and he can launch objects at high speed. Note that "objects" includes "people". In most puzzle games, "people" are major puzzle pieces. In Warp, the only real difference between a turret and a person is that the person is easier to lure into important locations and doesn't shoot you as quickly.</p>
<p>It's all a recipe for a great puzzle game, and it's honestly somewhat tragic that it falls short.</p>
<p>The thing about good puzzle games is that, by their very nature, you'll have trouble with them. Some puzzle games are designed so that it's impossible to get stuck. Some are designed so that restarting is easy and fast. Warp is a bit of a curious beast in that it's also a stealth action game. Your opponents have guns, they are quick with their triggers, and you will die in a single shot. So: You die. You hit the "restart" button.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/W_Screenshot2.jpg" alt="" title="DANGER! LOADING SCREEN APPROACHES" width="650" height="365" srcset="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/W_Screenshot2-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/W_Screenshot2.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></p>
<p>You sit there staring at a loading screen for ten seconds.</p>
<p>Which doesn't sound like a lot, but Warp is a <i>very</i> deadly game. The wrong approach can, and will, lead to death in seconds. Even when you're not being actively shot at, the world is littered with lasers and explosives and similar instant death traps. The second level starts with a puzzle that will kill you so quickly that failure results in spending more time loading than playing. And even when your plan is perfect and the area is harmless, Warp's sensitive controls will lead to you waltzing into lasers and warping yourself straight into death far more often than you'd expect.</p>
<p>Each time, accompanied by a ten second loading screen.</p>
<p>It is hard to describe how annoying that is, and it's just a herald of what lies in store.</p>
<p>Warp is filled with minor issues. Nothing that, in itself, would cripple the game. Things that I'd normally be remarking about in passing, as a minor blemish on an otherwise good game. But they just came so quickly and so relentlessly that it seemed every time I forgot about one, I'd run into another.</p>
<p>Example: The levels are filled, not just with armed guards, but with unarmed scientists. The scientists are terrified of you. Perpetually. Doesn't matter if you've carefully avoid killing scientists. Every time you warp into a room: screaming scientists. You can stand in the room for a minute and they just keep running around panicking, you leave the room, they recover and go back to work, teleport back in and it's Screamtown USA all over again.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/warp2-620x.jpg" alt="" title="AUGH. AUUUUUGH. AUUGH. AUUUGH. AUUUUUUUUUGH. DON'T LOOK AT MY PANTS. AUUUUUUUUUUUUGH." width="620" height="349"></p>
<p>This could have been improved in several ways. Iji does it brilliantly – avoiding slaughter in Iji eventually leads to the "enemies" allying with you, followed by an entire different branch of the game with a different ending. Extra endings and game branches take time and money, of course. Here's an easier idea: <i>make the damn scientists quieter</i>. As it is, every time you jump into a room you're greeted with an atmosphere-obliterating chorus of screeches. Or make them stop paying attention to you after a while! Maybe that's a reward for not killing them: they stop setting off alarms!</p>
<p>Another example: I mentioned Warp's controls. Most of my frustration revolved around Zero's Illusion ability, which allow him to project a duplicate of himself to trick enemies. The problem is that any damage done to the illusion, or any missteps into areas where the illusion is not allowed to go, will dissipate the illusion . . . causing Zero to instantly start moving in whatever direction the illusion was moving. If you use the illusion in a place where it's not allowed – even if a valid spawn point is literal inches away – the illusion will spawn directly in front of Zero, instantly disperse, and return control to Zero when you're least expecting it.</p>
<p>So if, for example, you decide to create an illusion and move it forward, and at that very instant a laser beam fires directly ahead of you, your illusion will walk into it, disperse, and before you have time to react, Zero will troop happily into it and die.</p>
<p>Cue ten-second load screen.</p>
<p>Not that this happened to me dozens of times over during the end boss fight or anything.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mandible.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Warp-Screenshot-3.jpg" alt="" title="SIR, WE HAVE HIM IN OUR SIGHTS, AND IT DEFINITELY ISN'T AN ILLUSION THIS TIME, UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS TWENTY SEVEN TIMES" width="620" height="349"></p>
<p>I can live with issues like this if the game is a low-budget affair, and doubly so if they're easy to recover from. Hotline Miami, an even faster-paced game released lately, is buggy as hell and had many fascinating problems and glitches as I fought my way through the levels. But in Hotline Miami, restarting the level is instant. And Hotline Miami's art is relatively simple, and its budget, I suspect, was quite minimal. For an indie game, Warp is a high-budget game, built on the Unreal engine, with detailed 3d models, good texturing, copious voice acting and cutscenes, and a boss that randomly and mysteriously fails to take damage from being attacked. Given the money spent on the rest of the game, the controls, loading times, and gameplay bugs are just unacceptable.</p>
<p>In the end, I kept feeling like the actual <i>game</i> had taken second tier to the rest of Warp. Compared to the amount of polish the art and atmosphere received, the gameplay was rough and spiky.</p>
<p>Warp is a good game. But with a little more work on the interface and a little more work on the game behavior, it could have been a lot better . . . even if that meant sacrificing a bunch of polygons.</p>

<p>[Edit April 25 2019: Please note <strong>this is not an iPhone or Android app</strong>, and I have no plans to release it as such. You can use your phone or any other camera to take pictures of your ground coffee, but then you need to install the application on either OS X or through Python (on any operating system) to analyze the data. <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/archive/master.zip">Download the application package here</a>.]</p>



<p>Today I would like to present an OS X application I have been developing for a few months. It turns out writing Python software for coffee is a great way to relax after a day of writing Python software for astrophysics.</p>



<p>When I started being interested in brewing specialty coffee a few years ago, one of the first things that irritated me was our inability to recommend grind sizes for different coffee brewing methods, or to compare the quality of different grinders in an objective way. Sure, some laboratories have laser diffraction equipment that can measure the size of all particles coming out of a grinder, but rare are the coffee geeks that have access to these multi-hundred thousands of dollars kinds of equipment.</p>



<p>At first, I decided to take pictures of my coffee grounds spread on a white sheet, and to use an old piece of software called <a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</a>, developed by the National Institutes of Health mainly to analyze microscope images, to obtain a distribution of the sizes of my coffee grounds. This worked decently well, and allowed me to start comparing different grinders. Then <a href="https://www.scottrao.com/">Scott Rao</a> made me realize that a stand-alone application that doesn’t need a complicated installation and that is dedicated to coffee would be of interest to many people in the coffee industry. Probably just the 10% geekiest of them, but that’s cool.</p>



<p>I’m hoping that this application will help us understand the effects of particle size distributions on the taste of coffee. I don’t think the industry really kept us in the loop with all the laser diffraction experiments, so hopefully we can help ourselves as a community.</p>



<p>If you are interested in measuring the particle size distribution of your grinder, then this app is for you ‒ and it’s free. I placed it as “open source” on <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a>, so if you are a developer, you are welcome to send me suggestions in the form of <em>push requests</em> (the developers will know what that means).</p>



<p>If you would like to get started, I suggest you read this quick <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_installation.pdf">installation guide</a>, which will explain how to download the app and run it even though I am not a registered Apple Developer. Then, you can choose to either read this <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_summarized_manual.pdf">quick summary</a> that will get you running with the basics, or this <strong><em>very</em></strong> detailed and wordy <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize/blob/master/Help/coffee_grind_size_manual.pdf">user manual</a> that will guide you through all the detailed options the application offers you.</p>



<p>I would like to show you an example of what can be done with the software. Below, I am comparing the particle size distribution of the Baratza Forté grinder, which uses 54 mm flat steel burrs, with that of the Lido 3 hand grinder, which uses 48 mm conical steel burrs. I set both grinders in a way that produces a similar peak of average-sized particles with diameters around 1 mm, but as you can see, the particle size distributions are very different ! The Forté generates way less fines (with diameters below 0.5 mm) and slightly less boulders (with diameters of approximately 2 mm), which is indicative of a better quality grinder.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="976" data-permalink="https://coffeeadastra.com/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam/" data-orig-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" data-orig-size="1000,780" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png?w=750" src="https://coffeeadastra.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/lido3_size9_file10_hist_mass_diam.png" alt=""><figcaption>An example of figure that can be generated with the coffee grind size software. Each red bar corresponds to one kind of particle diameter generated by the Lido 3 grinder (smallest particles correspond to the leftmost bar, largest ones correspond to the rightmost bar), and their heights correspond to the total contribution of these kinds of particles, by mass. As you can see, the particles that contribute to the largest amount of mass have sizes just above 1 mm. The red circle shows the average particle diameter for the Lido 3, and the horizontal bars show the “characteristic width” of the distribution – this corresponds to the width that covers approximately 68% of all the distribution. Similarly, the blue line and the blue circle describe the distribution of the Forté grinder.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For now, the app is only intended to be used on OS X computers. But if you are running any other kind of system and know your way around Python, you can always download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize">GitHub</a> and run it with your own installation of Python 3.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/66ug5i9bkhrghef/screencap_coffeegrindsize.mov?raw=1"></video><figcaption>This is an example of how to use the coffee grind size application.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would like to thank Scott Rao for his excitement when I shared this project idea with him, and for beta testing the software. I would also like to thank Alex Levitt, Mitch Hale, Caleb Fischer, Francisco Quijano and Victor Malherbe for beta testing the software.</p>

<p>Online discourse has recently been borrowing vocabulary from Lewis Carroll. From articles about the dangers 
of 
rabbit holes on social media, Youtube and Reddit, to QAnon's "follow the white rabbit" mantra, concepts from 
Alice's Wonderland seem to fit naturally with the internet.</p>
<p>In Lewis Carroll's book, Alice and the white rabbit are the only two characters that transition from reality 
to 
Wonderland. The white rabbit is driven by anxiety. Alice by curiosity. We are motivated to access 
the internet for these same reasons. Our curiosity is never satiated with endless content and powerful 
recommender systems. Our anxiety is consistently triggered by the fear of missing out and the need to escape 
reality.</p>
<p>Like Wonderland, the internet has become an alternate reality thanks to the breath of the content available 
and its multimedia nature. Wonderland resembled reality enough that Alice accepted it as real. The internet's 
information is realistic enough that people struggle to know what is real and what is fake.</p>
<p>As distorted realities, both the internet and Wonderland are strange and entertaining. But they are a 
dangerous type of fantasy that discourages us from returning to reality, and attemps to transform us into one of its 
cartoon characters.</p>
<p>Alice navigated Wonderland safely, staying true to herself. Her principles can help us remain active 
internet users, instead of being used by the internet. Keep an open mind, but remain logical. Think 
critically, through questions. Stay curious, with purpose.</p>
