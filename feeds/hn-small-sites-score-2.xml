Be sure to check the <a href="https://esphome.io/devices/nodemcu_esp8266.html">documentation</a> for the specific board you’re using, and connect the pins correctly.

Unfortunately, this doesn’t work for the initial flash. For this, we have to download the firmware and flash it ourselves.</p><p>Before the firmware can be flashed, it must be compiled. This takes the configuration yaml and turns it into a firmware file. To do this, click the 3 dots on the relevant device card and select “Compile”.

<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>
<!-- more-->



<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>seasonToString</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>S…</span></pre></div></div></article></div></section></div>

<h2 id="using-an-old-blackberry-as-a-portable-ssh-or-telnet-terminal">Using an old BlackBerry as a portable SSH (or Telnet) terminal</h2>
<p>You used to see BlackBerries everywhere. Sites such as CrackBerry detailed sightings of celebrities using them constantly. Nowadays, not so much. However, I believe they still have some usecases today. One of these is as a portable terminal. Here's why one might want to use one of these devices as a terminal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice built-in physical keyboard</li>
<li>Long standby battery life
<ul>
<li>Easily swappable batteries (see my Altoids tin filled with batteries below!)</li>
<li>The 7290 I'm using reportedly has a 216 hour standby battery life, and unlike modern phones this number seems to hold up relatively well even with network enabled</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affordable
<ul>
<li>You can easily find these devices for ~$20 on eBay</li>
<li>You can get a 100 MB data plan from US Mobile for $2/mo. not including fees (closer to $5/mo. with fees)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extremely portable
<ul>
<li>Much smaller than other devices one might use for this kind of thing
<ul>
<li>OpenPandora</li>
<li>GPD Pocket</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Much shorter than most modern phones</li>
<li>Cellular connection means you don't need a wireless router around</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decently rugged
<ul>
<li>Not nearly as prone to failure after drops as modern smartphones (in my experience)
<ul>
<li>The screen is recessed, so it doesn't take the brunt of falls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Easy to setup
<ul>
<li>You can simply browse to <a href="http://xk72.com/wap">http://xk72.com/wap</a> on the phone itself to install an SSH client (MidpSSH) over the air</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I've been using a BlackBerry 7290 on the US Mobile network, which still supports GSM for now. It's notable that the SSH negotiation is decently slow (~30-45 seconds), but is decently usable after connected (things are still a little sluggish however). Furthermore, I had to reenable the weak DSA public key algorithm as well. This doesn't bother me so much as I basically have a middleman server that allows this weak standard that I talk to everything else through rather than enabling it on every server.</p>
<p>To make things easier on myself, I wrote an <a href="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/postlogin.txt">interactive script</a> that is sourced by <code>.bashrc</code> upon logging in that asks what I actually want to connect to and then does so for me.</p>
<p>In the future, I might move to a BlackBerry 8700(c/g) as they support EDGE (much faster network speed), have much faster CPUs, and a higher standby time. I am not sure what I am going to do in the long run, as 2G networks in the US will probably all be shut down by the end of the year with 3G soon to follow. I guess I can just enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Here are the lines I added to my <code>sshd</code> config for the BlackBerry to be able to connect:</p>
<pre><code>HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Ciphers +3des-cbc
</code></pre>
<p>And here are some pictures!</p>

<p><em>Connected and at the interactive prompt</em></p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s …</p></section></div>

<p>The final code is about 250 lines of C (<a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3.c">unix</a>, <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3-win.c">windows</a>).
All you need to know is how to read basic C or C++ and how to do <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/BinaryMath/BinaryMath.html">binary arithmetic</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> This VM is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate program</a>. This means you are reading the source code right now! Each piece of code from the project will be shown and explained thoroughly, so you can be sure nothing is left out. The final code was created by <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate">"weaving"</a> the blocks of code together.

<h3> What is a virtual machine?</h3>
<p>A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it.
</p>
<p>The amount of computer hardware the VM attempts to simulate depends on its purpose. Some VMs are designed to reproduce the behavior of some particular computer, such as video game emulators. Most people don't have an NES lying around anymore, but we can still play NES games by simulating the NES hardware in a program. These emulators must <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tricky-to-emulate_games">faithfully recreate</a> every <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests">detail</a> and major hardware component of the original device.
</p>
<p>Other VMs don't act like any real computer and are entirely made up! This is primarily done to make software development easier. Imagine you wanted to create a program that ran on multiple computer architectures. A VM could offer a standard platform which provided portability for all of them. Instead of rewriting a program in different dialects of assembly for each CPU architecture, you would only need to write the small VM program in each assembly language. Each program would then be written only once in the VM's assembly language.

</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> A compiler solves a similar problem by compiling a standard <em>high-level language</em> to several CPU architectures. A VM creates one standard <em>CPU architecture</em> which is simulated on various hardware devices. One advantage of a compiler is that it has no runtime overhead while a VM does. Even though compilers do a pretty good job, writing a new one that targets multiple platforms is very difficult, so VMs are still helpful here. In practice, VMs and compilers are mixed at various levels.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</a> is a very successful example. The JVM itself is a moderately sized program that is small enough for one programmer to understand. This has made it possible to be written for thousands of devices including phones. Once the JVM is implemented on a new device, any Java, Kotlin, or Clojure program ever written can run on it without modification. The only cost is the overhead of the VM itself and the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">further abstraction</a> from the machine. Most of the time, this is a pretty good tradeoff.
</p>
<p>A VM doesn't have to be large or pervasive to provide a similar benefit. Old <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/anotherWorld_code_review/">video games</a> often used small VMs to provide simple <a href="https://sf2platinum.wordpress.com/page/1/">scripting systems</a>.
</p>
<p>VMs are also useful for executing code in a secure or isolated way. One application of this is garbage collection. There <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/24.2.html">is no trivial way</a> to implement automatic garbage collection on top of C or C++ since a program cannot see its own stack or variables. However, a VM is “outside” the program it is running and can observe all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection">memory references</a> on the stack.
</p>
<p>Another example of this behavior is demonstrated by <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html">Ethereum smart contracts</a>. Smart contracts are small programs which are executed by each validating node in the blockchain network. This requires the node operators to run programs on their machines that have been written by complete strangers, without any opportunity to scrutinize them beforehand. To prevent a contract from doing malicious things, they are run inside a <a href="http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html#ethereum-virtual-machine">VM</a> that has no access to the file system, network, disc, etc. Ethereum is also a good application of the portability features that result when using a VM. Since Ethereum nodes can be run on many kinds of computers and operating systems, the use of a VM allows smart contracts to be written without any consideration of the many platforms they run on.

<a name="1:3"></a><div><a name="1:3"><h4>3. LC-3 Architecture</h4></a>
<p>Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3">LC-3</a>. The LC-3 is popular for teaching university students how to program in assembly language. It has a simplified instruction set <a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html">compared to x86</a>, but contains all the main ideas used in modern CPUs.
</p>
<p>First, we need to simulate the essential hardware components of the machine. Try to understand what each component is, but don't worry right now if you are unsure of how it fits into the larger picture. Start by creating a C file. Each of the code snippets in this section should be placed in the global scope of this file.
</p>
<h3> Memory</h3>
<p>The LC-3 has 65,536 memory locations (the maximum that is addressable by a 16-bit unsigned integer <code>2^16</code>), each of which stores a 16-bit value. This means it can store a total of only 128kb, which is a lot smaller than you may be used to! In our program, this memory will be stored in a simple array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Memory Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>/* 65536 locations */
uint16_t memory[UINT16_MAX];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Registers</h3>
<p>A register is a slot for storing a single value on the CPU. Registers are like the "workbench" of the CPU. For the CPU to work with a piece of data, it has to be in one of the registers. However, since there are just a few registers, only a minimal amount of data can be loaded at any given time. Programs work around this by loading values from memory into registers, calculating values into other registers, and then storing the final results back in memory.
</p>
<p>The LC-3 has 10 total registers, each of which is 16 bits. Most of them are general purpose, but a few have designated roles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>8 general purpose registers  (<code>R0</code>-<code>R7</code>)
</li>
<li>1 program counter (<code>PC</code>) register
</li>
<li>1 condition flags (<code>COND</code>) register
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general purpose registers can be used to perform any program calculations. The program counter is an unsigned integer which is the address of the next instruction in memory to execute. The condition flags tell us information about the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Registers <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    R_R0 = 0,
    R_R1,
    R_R2,
    R_R3,
    R_R4,
    R_R5,
    R_R6,
    R_R7,
    R_PC, /* program counter */
    R_COND,
    R_COUNT
};
</pre>



</div>
<p>Just like the memory, we will store the registers in an array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Register Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>uint16_t reg[R_COUNT];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Instruction Set</h3>
<p>An instruction is a command which tells the CPU to do some fundamental task, such as add two numbers. Instructions have both an <strong>opcode</strong> which indicates the kind of task to perform and a set of <strong>parameters</strong> which provide inputs to the task being performed.
</p>
<p>Each <strong>opcode</strong> represents one task that the CPU "knows" how to do. There are just 16 opcodes in LC-3. Everything the computer can calculate is some sequence of these simple instructions. Each instruction is 16 bits long, with the left 4 bits storing the opcode. The rest of the bits are used to store the parameters.
</p>
<p>We will discuss, in detail, what each instruction does later. For now, define the following opcodes. Make sure they stay in this order so that they are assigned the proper enum value:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Opcodes <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    OP_BR = 0, /* branch */
    OP_ADD,    /* add  */
    OP_LD,     /* load */
    OP_ST,     /* store */
    OP_JSR,    /* jump register */
    OP_AND,    /* bitwise and */
    OP_LDR,    /* load register */
    OP_STR,    /* store register */
    OP_RTI,    /* unused */
    OP_NOT,    /* bitwise not */
    OP_LDI,    /* load indirect */
    OP_STI,    /* store indirect */
    OP_JMP,    /* jump */
    OP_RES,    /* reserved (unused) */
    OP_LEA,    /* load effective address */
    OP_TRAP    /* execute trap */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> The Intel x86 architecture has hundreds of instructions, while others such as ARM and LC-3 have very few. Small instruction sets are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISCs</a> while larger ones are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISCs</a>. Larger instruction sets typically do not provide any fundamentally new possibilities, but they <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/">often make it more convenient</a> to write assembly for. A single instruction in CISC might take the place of several in RISC. However, they tend to be more complex and expensive for engineers to design and manufacture. This and other tradeoffs cause the designs to come <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/269/why-would-anyone-want-cisc">in and out of style</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Condition Flags</h3>
<p>The <code>R_COND</code> register stores condition flags which provide information about the most recently executed calculation. This allows programs to check logical conditions such as <code>if (x &gt; 0) { ... }</code>.
</p>
<p>Each CPU has a variety of condition flags to signal various situations. The LC-3 uses only 3 condition flags which indicate the sign of the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Condition Flags <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    FL_POS = 1 &lt;&lt; 0, /* P */
    FL_ZRO = 1 &lt;&lt; 1, /* Z */
    FL_NEG = 1 &lt;&lt; 2, /* N */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> (The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> symbol is called the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/336xbhcz.aspx">left bitshift operator</a>. <code>(n &lt;&lt; k)</code> shifts the bits of <code>n</code> to the left <code>k</code> places. Thus <code>1 &lt;&lt; 2</code> will equal <code>4</code>. Read that link if you are not familiar. It will be important.)

<p>We are finished setting up the hardware components of our VM! After adding standard includes (see reference), your file should look something like this:
</p>

<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/covid-19-u-s-fatalities-june-2020-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In June</a>, I made the prediction that it’s likely we’ll see hundreds of thousands dead by July from COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to official data, my prediction <span><em>was not entirely accurate</em></span>, being closer to the lower bound of my simulation(s) (a hundred thousand).</p>
<p>Today, we have more information about the virus and importantly improved data on death rates (via the CDC) – <strong>it appears the official death toll from COVID19 may be under reported</strong>. Perhaps more terrifying, it also appears <strong>if you are 25-85+ years old you have a 20-50% increased risk of dying in 2020 than you did in 2015-2019</strong> (given COVID19’s current penetration rate).</p>
<p>Some key takeaways from this analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official death COVID19 related deaths are likely higher than official count(s)</li>
<li>Testing capacity appears to be shrinking or not being reported</li>
<li>Age groups over 25 are seeing a 20-50% increased number of deaths in 2020 (over 2015-2019)</li>
<li>It is likely the increased fatality rate over prior years will continue as COVID19 prevalence increases</li>
<li>By year end 2020, it’s likely we will see over one million deaths in the U.S.</li>
<li>By April 2021, it’s likely we will see over two million deaths in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p>For transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code (&amp; Graphics): <a href="https://github.com/lettergram/covid19-analysis">Github</a></li>
<li>Data

<li>CDC data is only [mostly] accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, we aren’t testing enough to capture all cases. People are not being tested for various reasons: desire to work, no/minor symptoms, can’t receive a test, etc. Unfortunately, this will leave us vulnerable.</p>
<p>On a whole, the nation wide positive rate is still hovering well above lows, with around 7% tests coming back positive.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the reduction in tests are from collection errors, reduced testing capacity, issues with the data provider or some other unknown factor.</p>

<p>It’s important to note, that it is not an entirely fair to compare 2019 to 2020, as each year has variance in deaths. With this in mind, I also created a simple regression model, then compared the predicted death count to the actual 2020 deaths and came to figure of <strong>178,598.40 deaths over the predicted number</strong> (remember, this is for the week of July 20, 2020):</p>

<p>Currently, in August — nearly three weeks passed the CDC numbers cut off and deaths are still increasing. At this point, it is likely we are well over 200,000+ deaths beyond the prediction. Further, it is quite possible we are now 250,000+ deaths above the 2019 figures. If true, we are likely under counting COVID related deaths by 40-60%.</p>
<p>This analysis doesn’t take into account mitigating factors (such as less car accidents) as it also doesn’t take into account confounding factors (such as more suicides).</p>
<h2><span>States Under Reporting COVID-19 Related Fatalities</span></h2>
<p>To highlight the clear under reporting of pandemic related fatalities, we can review states, where the issue becomes more pronounced.</p>
<p>Take <strong>Texas</strong>, for instance:</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-TX-203x150.png 203w"></a>The deaths one standard deviation above the norm (norm being deaths in 2015-2019) are highly correlate with the number of <em>new cases </em>of COVID19, rather than that of COVID19 related <em>deaths</em>.</p>
<p>This implies one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>COVID19 deaths are being attributed to another illness</li>
<li>Hospitals are focusing on the COVID19 patients and other critically ill patients are dying (at an alarming rate)</li>
<li>Some other catastrophe is happening</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless, as more people test positive, more people are dying and there is a high correlation between the two. If I had to guess, this really means people aren’t being tested until after they are dead or critically ill &amp; in the hospital.</p>
<h2><span>Decreased Testing</span></h2>
<p>It’s also important to bring attention to the <span>decreasing number of tests from July 9, 2020 and August 13, 2020</span>. Time will tell if the rate of fatalities will drop (or if just the COVID19 related deaths will), the decreased testing volume correlates exactly with the declining positive cases (as one would suspect).</p>
<p>This holds true for many states, including <strong>Florida</strong>:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png" alt="" width="650" height="488" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-300x225.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-768x577.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-2048x1538.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-300x225.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-768x577.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-2048x1538.png 2048w"></a>Testing capacity in Florida has dropped 40% in the past six weeks. At the same time, the death toll is rising. Frankly, I wouldn’t be surprised if reduced testing was a ploy related to opening schools.</p>
<p>There are some examples where the figures do appear to be <em>generally</em> accurate, such as <strong>New York</strong>:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-203x150.png 203w"></a>Another example is <strong>Illinois </strong>(although initially there was likely under-reporting due to lack of testing):</p>

Under-reporting appears to be a signal that there is not enough testing – aka the system is overwhelmed. This makes logical sense, as the system becomes overwhelmed, resources are diverted on saving lives over identifying community spread. There’s also a question if the test results are being reported federally and outside my dataset for some reason.</p>

<p>It is difficult mid-pandemic with a lack of testing to determine the case <a href="https://newslit.org/updates/case-fatality-rate-vs-mortality-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fatality rate (CFR) or mortality rate</a>, which is typically what is being reported. Unfortunately, we don’t know the infection rate. With that in mind, it’s probably more accurate to track the “increased risk of dying in 2020”.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<blockquote><p>How much greater are my risks of dying in 2020 over 2019?</p></blockquote>
<p>Infection rate is included as part of metric, we don’t know the extent. COVID19 penetration is <em>maybe</em> 10% across the U.S. population (studies vary wildly). Regardless, as the year progresses, we are sure this number will increase.</p>
<p>With that in mind, on average all age groups over 25, are seeing roughly 10-15% increased risk of dying in 2020 over 2019 (again, this will likely increase):<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>Focusing on <strong>New York</strong>, which appears to have kept decent records &amp; has a decent infection rate – the data looks stark:</p>

It’s probably Texas hasn’t had as much of a proliferation of COVID19 yet and most of the spread has been related to young gathers. Leading to our next section…</p>
<h2><span>COVID19 Spread due to Gatherings</span></h2>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge, that as people gather Coronavirus spreads more easily. Particularly, in <strong>Texas</strong>, <strong>Florida</strong>, <strong>Illinois</strong> and others started to see a rise in fatalities (and infections) following rises in heat (pushing gatherings in doors), protests, and generally opening bars.</p>
<p>Particularly, the rise of deaths in <strong>Texas</strong> coincide directly with the protests (Starting week 22 and rising to the present):</p>

<p><strong>Florida</strong> has seen the same effect, in the exact same time range:</p>

Personally, I suspect heat is the largest factor. People gathered outside to protest or celebrate (July 4th) and ended up congregating inside, without masks. This lead to an increase in spread and fatalities, as moving indoors confines people together, in air conditioning, with minimal mask protection or UV to kill the virus.</p>

<p>Finally, in prior discussions I’ve made predictions. Largely, these predictions came from running simulations (both on my own and available to me). As it stands, I continue to stand by my prior prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 million COVID-19 deaths in the United States is likely (April 1, 2021)</li>
<li>25% [true] unemployment in the United States is likely</li>
<li>15% reduction in GDP is within reason</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s an estimated 180k to 1.85m dead by October 14th. Personally, for the officially count, I’d err on the side of the lower values, perhaps 250k. However, I suspect deaths will be under counted due to lack of testing, I suspect the real figures will be closer to 500k-800k after analysis, this would more closely matching the findings above (which indicate we are already over 200k).</p>

	<p>Write code that’s compatible with how your brain works.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Video</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8Pb8TvYsCE">Philip reading this essay</a>.</p>
<p>The 1956 paper <em><a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/">The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
Two</a></em> is the most widely cited paper
in the 126 year history of the journal <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Review">Psychological
Review</a></em>. The author
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller">George A. Miller</a> is
considered one of the founders in the field of cognitive science. His
historic claim is that you can only juggle <strong>between 5 and 9 things</strong> in
your brain at any one time.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, despite some
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486516/">controversy</a> over
the years, this 7 ± 2 figure has withstood the ongoing
<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">reproducibility
crisis</a>
and it appears to capture a deep truth about how our brains actually
function.</p>
<p>Many people are skeptical of the claim because seven sounds like an
absurdly small number, surely if you are doing something complex like
writing software, or planning a wedding for that matter, you are juggling
dozens to hundreds of things? As it turns out you are not. At least not at
once.</p>

The first 225 digits of <a href="https://dancohen.org/2010/03/08/the-last-digit-of-pi/">Pi</a>.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>In 2005 <strong>Lu Chao</strong> recited <a href="https://www.livescience.com/50134-pi-day-memory-experts.html">67,890
digits</a> of
Pi, a mind-boggling demonstration of a gifted and well-trained mind. Yet
given a series of random single-digit numbers he can on average recall less
the than nine of them, to be exact he’s been measured to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span#Digit-span">digit
span</a> of 8.83 which
fits perfectly within Miller’s finding. Amazing!</p>
<p>Chao memorizes Pi the same way story tellers once memorized long tales
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, yet he can only
juggle a handful of things at one time. I find this actually to be very
comforting, he is not a freak of nature, at least not as freaky as you
first thought.</p>
<p>The illusion we can hold many things in mind is almost identical to the
illusion that our field of view is high resolution everywhere. It’s
incredibly compelling because the instant we wonder <em>what’s over there</em> we
do a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccade</a> and are
immediately rewarded with a high resolution view of exactly <em>what’s over
there</em>. We ask the question and we get an instant answer, so it feels like
the answer was there the whole time.</p>

<p>Thinking in general works very much like vision. This is not surprising
since it’s implemented using the same brain hardware. As we rapidly flit
from idea to idea, from concept to concept, we page in the necessary
details, but at no time do we have more than about nine individual things
in the front of our minds.</p>
<p>How do we navigate a complex world with this seemingly crippling limit on
the size of our working memory? Two of the primary tools that we use are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>When we think of a car we naturally divide the car into a handful of high
level chunks like the <em>engine</em>, the <em>dashboard</em>, the <em>seats</em>, the <em>wheels</em>.
When we mentally zoom into the engine, however, it effortlessly resolves
into more parts: the <em>engine block</em>, the <em>pistons</em>, the <em>spark plugs</em>. And
we can keep zooming in, although how far we can zoom in highly depends on
how much we know about cars and the world in general.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented
Programming</a> one
of the simplest ways to tame complexity is to limit your objects to around
seven <em>attributes</em>. In some languages attributes are called <em>member
variables</em> or <em>fields</em>. Many programmers immediately balk at this
suggestion. Sure, that works for toy examples, but I’m writing serious
software and my objects sometimes need 10, 20 or 50 attributes. You must be
working on easy stuff, they will say. My problems are special, so my code
has to be different.</p>
<p>The biggest trap of software development is that it’s easy, trivial in
fact, to write software that you yourself cannot understand, and in turn no
one else can understand. Even a novice, <em>especially</em> a novice, can in a few
weeks write software that literally no one on the planet can easily think
or reason about. That’s depressing, but also kind of impressive in a way.
With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>Objects which have too many attributes are a major cause of software that’s
too complicated to understand. Some people conclude the problem is Object
Oriented Programming itself. This is not a crazy idea, there are <a href="https://tobeva.com/resources/technical/programming/functional/">other
ways</a> to program, and they do
have advantages, but in my experience most of the flaws attributed to
Object Oriented Programming stem from having done it poorly, and boy is it
easy to do poorly.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/complex_hua73d922edef0eeb6c3d75f190e4c0729_39455_350x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="350" height="197"></p><p>
Complexity grows without bound.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>The key thing to realize is a single object with a lot of attributes is
itself <em>not</em> Object Oriented. Instead, it’s a 1970s style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Structured
Program</a> in disguise.
The attributes of the object are the <strong>global variables</strong> of the program,
and the object’s methods are the program’s <strong>functions</strong>. Every function
can freely access every global variable which is what causes many of the
problems.</p>
<p>A structured program with more than seven global variables is trouble, and
if many objects in your program are effectively messy structured programs
themselves, you are in serious trouble indeed. At a high level you are
doing Object Oriented Programming, but at a low level you are right back in
the 1970s struggling to deal with one confusing program after the next.</p>
<p>How do we save this sinking ship? We save it by actively and aggressively
keeping the number of attributes per object <strong>at or below seven</strong>. If you
fail to do this you are punting the problem <em>to your future self</em>, a
problem that by definition your future self is going to have a hard time
solving.</p>
<p>Just today I had a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> class called
<code>PerfEvent</code> with these attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>start_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>start_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>end_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>end_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>process_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>process_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>thread_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s eight attributes, since eight is only one over the limit, should we
wait until the object grows bigger? No, let’s deal with it <em>now</em>. To reduce
the number of attributes we introduce two new classes or structs: <code>Span</code>
and <code>Origin</code>. Each only has two attributes, but now the original object has
been slimmed down to six attributes, all is well again:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>span</span> <span>=</span> <span>Span</span><span>(</span><span>start_ns</span><span>,</span> <span>end_ns</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span> <span>=</span> <span>Origin</span><span>(</span><span>process_id</span><span>,</span> <span>thread_id</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although it’s a minor change, compare the two versions, the improved one
simply <em>looks</em> better, even if you stand far back and squint.</p>
<p>It seems minor, but if you don’t make these types of changes as you go it
will eventually lead to <em>intractable</em> complexity, the type of complexity
that causes projects and companies to fail, the type of complexity that
seduces humans into wasting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails">billions of
dollars</a>
every year writing software that does not work.</p>
<p>The benefits of introducing sub-objects goes far beyond just reducing the
number of attributes. While accessing the attributes is slightly more
verbose, I like the sound of <code>self.span.start_ns</code> compared to just
<code>self.start_ns</code>, but more importantly we can now pass <code>Span</code>'s and
<code>Owner</code>'s to functions, slimming down and chunking <em>their</em> argument lists.</p>
<p>We’ve introduced two natural and useful concepts that will pay ongoing
dividends, but even better don’t just think of how your code is today,
think about how it’s going to grow over time. Your single monolithic object
has sprouted two buds. You can now push functionality down into these buds,
and they can grow into branches, which later can sprout buds of their own.</p>
<p>For example we can now give <code>Span</code> a <code>get_duration_ns()</code> method. Again it seems
minor, but writing <code>span.get_duration_ns()</code> is better than writing
<code>span.end_ns - span.start_ns</code> especially if you are going to do that in
many different places.</p>
<p>The real magic though is that the benefits of being disciplined will accrue
like <a href="https://youtu.be/GtaoP0skPWc">compound interest</a> as you convert your
monolithic object into an intricately structured tree which buds and
sprouts and branches organically. You will benefit from this better design
every minute you are working on the software, and the software will benefit
greatly from your improved mood and ability to sustain focus.</p>

A carefully tended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai">Bonsai</a> tree.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>Code, like most human created artifacts, can be beautiful, so there is an
aesthetic pay off here, but the real jackpot is that if you assiduously
tend and groom this tree you will create a software design that slides into
your head with minimal fuss and friction, and slides similarly into the
heads of other people.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that we find natural environments to be more soothing than
the made world, than the concrete jungle. The design of the natural world
tends to be more in harmony with how our brains think about that world.
Game recognizes game.</p>
<p>Over time, you will grow a system that you and others can <strong>understand</strong>,
<strong>maintain</strong>, <strong>debug</strong> and <strong>extend</strong>. When people look at your code years
from now, maybe even in the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">far
future</a>, they will benefit from your
diligence and hard work. And the punchline is doing all this is not hard.
In fact, it’s <em>much easier</em> to do this work than not to not do it.</p>
<p>It’s easier and more pleasant to work with something that’s well crafted
and simpatico with your thinking. It’s hard and unpleasant to constantly
wrestle with something you don’t understand. Trim, prune and shape your
objects early and often. Your brain will thank you.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://thinking.farm/research/three-gorges-dam/">To Dam or Not to Dam: Exploring the Failure Risk of the Three Gorges Dam </a></h2>
            
            <section id="single-content">
                <p><em>This research explores the risk that the Three Gorges dam will experience failure.
I believe the risk that the dam becomes structurally compromised, and requires the government to drain the reservoir to undertake repairs, is  <strong>20-25%</strong>. In the case that there is a seismic event, that likelihood would be closer to <strong>80%</strong>. I put the chance of a dam failure during this summer’s ongoing floods at <strong>5-10%</strong>, rising to <strong>30%</strong> in the case of a seismic event.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Did Wuhan commit a great crime in 2019? How else to explain the cityâ€™s bad luck in 2020, beginning with the COVID-19 world pandemic and continuing with recent worries that the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the worldâ€™s largest, might burst and flood the city? News reports about the dam have primarily been journalists repeating the opinions of various experts, with some quotes dating back to the 1990s. Predictably, this has encouraged the formation of two camps: those primed towards conspiratorial speculation that the Chinese Communist Party is lying about a looming catastrophe, and those that repeat state media lines that rumors about the dam are the work of Chinaâ€™s foreign enemies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think that clear thinking about risk can help us assess the likelihood of disaster at the TGD. The dam is subject to three types of risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>structural integrity risk, which originates in the damâ€™s construction and maintenance</li>
<li>foundation risk, which reflects the geologic stability of the damâ€™s foundation</li>
<li>shock risk, which the likelihood that an external shock occurs, like an earthquake or landslide.</li>
</ol>
<p>Structural integrity risk is hard to assess, but we can obtain relatively clear information to assess foundation and shock risk, if we make use of valuable geologic data gathered by the Three Gorges Development Corporation in the 1990s. Moreover, the changing rhetoric of press releases from the Chinese government can reveal how the authorities themselves, who have live access to the state of the dam, are mitigating these risks. The governmentâ€™s behavior can then further calibrate our sense of how large and realized these risks actually are.</p>
<p>I have been unable to come by reliable information to assess the structural integrity of the dam. The major risk to the dam comes from foundation risk. As can be ascertained from geologic data, Sections 1-5 of the left powerhouse lie on top of a low-dipping joints with high connectivity, meaning that there is elevated sliding risk. The damâ€™s recent deformation on July 21 means previously calculated safety ratios are likely inflated. Moreover, changes in government rhetoric support this suspicion. In contrast to years past, the government claims that the dam was never mean to control floods and that each region should figure out their own solution.</p>
<p>In terms of shock risk, the dam is susceptible to seismic activity, instability arising from the sheer weight of the TGD reservoir, and flood waves large enough to overwhelm the damâ€™s sluice gates. As of writing (July 26), the 3rd flood wave has officially formed in the Yangtze, and a 4th might appear in short succession. Overall, I think there is a 20-25% chance that the dam is further structurally impaired, prompting the government to continue draining the reservoir as fast as possible. There is something like a 5-10% chance that multiple flood waves overwhelm the dam and raise the reservoir level. These would weaken the dam or its foundation and cause a sliding failure. Were an earthquake to happen this month, these risks would be something more like 80% and 30%.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-dam">Anatomy of a dam</h2>
<p>There are several types of dam design: arch dams, buttress dams, embankment dams, and gravity dams.</p>
<p>Arch dams hold back the water partially through the strength of their structural shape. The Hoover Dam is an example of an arch dam. The arch is convex facing upstream, which distributes water pressure along the structure to the abutments at each end.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/hoover-dam.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>The Hoover Dam, Arizona-Nevada border</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Buttress dams consist of a face slab which angles away from the upstream, and is supported on the downstream side by buttress structures. These structures are attached to a base slab foundation. Buttress dams are built in areas with looser soil foundations.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/daniel-johnson.jpg" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>The Daniel-Johnson Buttress Dam, Canada</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Embankment dams are built up by the piling up of soil, rocks, or synthetic materials. These are usually porous on their outside but have an impervious core. Their main advantage is their low cost and flexibility, which allows them to adjust to shifts in the embankment or settlement of the foundation over time.</p>
<p>Gravity dams resist water flow through their sheer weight, which pulls them vertically down and allows them to resist the horizontal force of water pressure along their surface. This is similar to what a child does when he blocks a stream or rivulet by piling rocksâ€”they divert the water flow not through any structural design but through their weight. This is the origin of the name â€œgravity dam.â€�</p>
<p>A U.S. Department of the Interior report in 1998 explored various dam â€œeventsâ€�. These include four gravity dams in the United States and one in France<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. All five suffered damage due to sliding, and two of them failed entirely. The remaining three required additional drainage, reinforcements, and the release of reservoir waters to keep water depths low. For example, the Morris Shepherd Dam suffered sliding because the initial loading of the reservoir changed the stability of the bedrock foundation such that the safety ratio fell below 1.0. In other words, the load that the dam could support before failing had fallen below the regular load the dam was supposed to hold.</p>
<h2 id="foundation-risk-is-sliding-risk">Foundation risk is sliding risk</h2>
<p>The most important factor in sliding events is the nature of the bedrock on which a gravity dam is built. In failures of this type, the part of the foundation on which the dam rests slides downstream. We have reliable data to study this phenomenon, though media and news commentators have not put in the work.</p>
<p>In 2003 scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Yangtze River Scientific Research Institute received data and support from the Three Gorges Development Corporation, the Changjiang Water Resources Commission, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to conduct a stability assessment of the damâ€™s foundation using physical and numerical modeling.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The study incorporated a variety of techniques for the stability assessment, including conventional methods of geological mapping such as borehole drilling and shaft exploration, geophysical prospecting such as acoustic emission, remote sensing, seismic reflection and refraction, electromagnetic techniques, and physical-chemical analysis and micro-structural analysis. Most of these data are recorded in expensive studies commissioned in 1998 and 1999, when the dam was being built.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>They conclude that the â€œmajor factor influencing the foundation stability would come from the pre-existing discontinuities. However, among these discontinuities the faults mostly have steep dip angles, thin thickness, and well-cemented tectonite, so they would not play important roles in the foundation stability.â€�</p>
<h2 id="foundation-faults-and-joints">Foundation, faults, and joints</h2>
<p>The foundation is plagioclase granite which is homogenous and of high strength, and with various degrees of weathering, though the dam itself is on the moderately and lightly weathered parts.</p>
<p>The are 886 faults in the granite, most of which have steep angles (i.e. they go down more than sideways). 90% of these are shorter than 300 meters and narrower than 1 meter. Most of the faults are filled in with tectonite, a metamorphic type of rock.</p>
<p>The granite also has a very large number of joints. Joints are fractures where the two sides, unlike in a fault, lack visible or detectable movement relative to each other. 13% of joints have dip angles less than 30 degrees, 10% are between 30-60, and 77% are greater than 60 degrees.</p>
<p>The low-dipping joints have been studied more than the others because they dip downstream at an angle low enough to create sliding surfaces in the damâ€™s foundation. This was determined to be the greatest risk to foundation stability.</p>
<p>As we can see in the illustration below, the area of greatest risk is labeled â€œrelative developed regions of gently dipping joints,â€� which is where these low dipping joints are present in both long and short form, and in high densities. This area crosses the dam around the left powerhouse, which also overlaps with one of the large faults.</p>
<figure>

            <h4>Rock joint distribution along the foundation of Three Gorges Dam (Liu et al)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another risk factor is connectivity: the percentage of joints that could form a potential sliding path. The higher the connectivity, the higher the probability that a disturbance will link the joints into a fracture that produces a sliding event.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="http://thinking.farm/layout-of-tgd.png" width="100%"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Layout of the TGD and the numbered left powerhouse-dam sections (Liu et al)</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sections 1-5 of the left powerhouse dam are the weakest links. As can be seen below, the density of low-dipping joints is highest under Section No. 3 of the left powerhouse dam. Even more unfortunately, Section No. 3 also has the highest joint connectivityâ€”80% of the joints are in a potential sliding path!</p>

<p>We can appreciate the high connectivity of the joints under Section No. 3 through the geological sketches from Liu et al.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p>
        I am now providing two different data sets: one that is calculated witha 25 degree minimum user terminal angle
        and one with a 35 degree minimum user terminal angle. The more recent SpaceX filings show that they are capable
        of using the 25 degree minimum but that they eventually want to increase that. The previous datasets were
        calculated with a 35 degree minimum as that was what I had found on file at the time. With the lower minimum
        angle and about 100 more satellites at operational altitudes the 25 degree dataset now shows bands with
        continuous coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, I plan to calculate what I call the <em>satellite multiplicity</em>, the number of satellites
        overhead at any given time on average, since the number of overlapping satellites is relevant to some
        calculations for routing and bandwith.
    </p>
    <p>
        New Features: You can now double-click a cell to toggle showing more granular data.
        Cells with 100% uptime now display a gold star. Faster parsing, reduced battery drain,
        hopefully.
    </p>
    <p><label for="minAngleSelect">Choose a minimum angle to load the dataset:</label>
        
    </p>
    
    
    <div>
        <p>This renders the percentage of the day that a portion of the earth is covered by a Starlink satellite. (Red
            is no
            coverage, blue is all day coverage).</p>
        <p>Click on a cell to see how many minutes in a day a cell is covered by at least one satellite. Note that
            currently
            for performance reasons the cells are much larger than the resolution the data was simulated at. As such the
            error within a cell can be quite large, especially near the poles where the coverage drops off rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>In my opinion anything less than 1440 minutes (aka continuous coverage) means that SpaceX <em>should not</em>
            provide service in that area.</p><p>
        For more info about how it's calculated:
        <a href="https://github.com/sebsebmc/starlink-coverage">https://github.com/sebsebmc/starlink-coverage</a></p><h2> Changelog:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6-20-20 - Removed satellites that had low altitudes because they are not believed to be in operational
                orbits.</li>
            <li>6-21-20 - Fixed remaining issues with calculations at the antimerdian.</li>

<p>
  <span>
H</span>
  ello and welcome to my website! Given all of this extra time I have had at home recently, I figured it was finally time to stand up a website to publish some blog posts I have been meaning to write. As any self respecting software engineer would do in this case, my plan was to build it all myself.


</p>

<p>Having not considered the ecosystem of static content generation sites for quite some time, I hit the books to figure what my options are.</p>
<h2 id="wait-its-all-javascript">Wait, it’s all JavaScript?!</h2>
<p>The very first first thing I noticed was that almost every solution required JavaScript, either at build time or on the client. JavaScript has no business being involved in static text based context, HTML and CSS already do an amazing job.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there was only a single viable solution that passed the test of being relevant and not using JavaScript, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="styling">Styling</h2>
<p>Hugo at its core is really nothing more than a very feature rich HTML template renderer, which is exactly the right tool for the job of generating markup, but what about styling?</p>
<p>I chose to just use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>. Using nothing but SASS is amazing for a project this small. I wrote all of the styling myself, which for text based content, really isn’t that bad.</p>
<p>Hugo offers a library of themes, but I personally find the usage of themes to be a bit tacky. I wanted something that is uniquely mine, and more importantly, doesn’t add a bunch of shit I will never use.</p>
<h2 id="hosting--deployment">Hosting &amp; deployment</h2>
<p>Hosting static content in 2020 is so easy it should be <em>illegal</em>. I use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> as the host, which really is as simple as turning it on in the repository settings.</p>
<p>Similarly, deployment is disgustingly easy with <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. My configuration file is triggered by every push to master, which then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloads the <code>hugo</code> binary</li>
<li>Builds the site from source with <code>hugo</code></li>
<li>Pushes the build to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s it, every push of my website source code immediately triggers a build and deployment, all for free.</p>
<p>Here is my configuration for reference:</p>


<h2 id="thats-it-we-have-a-website">That’s it, we have a website</h2>
<p>It really is this simple to build your own custom corner of the internet and serve it for free. I left out some details, specifically my configuration in Cloudflare, but if there is demand I can dive deeper into it.</p>
<h2 id="less-javascript">Less JavaScript</h2>
<p>I hope you’ll join me in adding less unnecessary JavaScript to the internet. It will make you a stronger web developer, and your websites are nearly guaranteed to be faster. There are still of course valid use cases for JavaScript, and perhaps I will explore this topic more in the future as well.</p>

<p>How do you end up being one of those people that manages managers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the beginning of a <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/">series of articles</a> looking at how you can start working on progressing up the management track beyond an <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/">Engineering Manager</a>, and into the world of important-sounding job titles. And meetings. Don’t forget meetings. There’s lots of those.</p>



<p>But those job titles, huh?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have looked at roles such as <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1weNoeSUfHYOHy9sHKad_ax6qrVXNFlP4ieTwaRll70M/edit#gid=1999769114">Director of Engineering or VP Engineering</a> from afar and imagined just how prestigious it must be to see it shining at the bottom of your email signature as you send a terse and impactful decision to your large organization.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Yes. Let’s commit to this.</em></p><p><em>——</em></p><p><em>A. Genius, PhD</em></p><p><em>Senior Vice President of Data Science and Engineering</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Maybe you’ve even edited your Twitter profile to see what it would look like in your bio. Don’t worry, we’ve all done it. Hopefully you didn’t accidentally hit save.</p>



<p>Anyway, to that question. How do <em>you</em> get one of these roles?</p>



<p>No doubt you’ve seen <em>Director of…</em>, <em>Head of…</em>, and <em>VP</em> roles advertised externally, especially at large software companies. However, often there’s a Catch-22 situation that you’ll face: they’re typically looking for people who have had experience in doing it before. Or even if they say that they aren’t, what chance are you going to have in the recruitment process if you’re up against others who’ve been there and done that? Now, of course, you might get lucky. But maybe there are ways of preparing to make yourself even more lucky.</p>



<p>Let’s think about getting yourself prepared for making the leap to managing managers. I believe that you stand the most chance of being able to make the next progression step if you find yourself at the union of a majority of the following characteristics and situations:</p>



<ul><li><strong>You’ve been an Engineering Manager for a decent amount of time</strong> (say, 2-5 years) and have a provable track record of shipping and people management, with references that can back you up. After all, if you’re going to be running multiple teams, you’re going to need to know how to run one team inside out. (If you’re still working on that, there’s plenty of material on the rest of this site to help you skill up.)</li><li><strong>You’re already working for a company with a strong management culture</strong> that has clear career progression tracks for managers as well as individual contributors. This means that if the role opens up where you already work, it’s clear how to put yourself forward for it. It’ll also mean you’re learning and practicing the right skills.</li><li><strong>You’re at a company that is changing fast</strong> and has a tendency to not quite be able to keep up with the chaos. This often occurs during periods of rapid growth, or even via shake-up – through downsizing, mergers and acquisitions – any event that begins to question the current shape of the org chart being correct for the foreseeable future.</li><li><strong>You have a good presence online</strong> via the usual social channels: LinkedIn, Twitter, Github, and so on. This way if people are trying to find people like you elsewhere, then they can.</li></ul>



<p>Now, of course, it is entirely plausible that you may apply cold for a Director of Engineering role as an external applicant whilst currently being an Engineering Manager. That’s what I meant by getting lucky above. Quite often more senior engineering management positions are either specifically headhunted or promoted from within.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But why is this?</p>



<ul><li><strong>The more senior the managerial position, the more risky a bad hire is</strong>. That’s why excellent internal candidates always have the upper hand: they are a known entity that likely already has domain knowledge. They’re also far more likely to have the company take a chance on the new gig working out. Even better: smart companies will do a 30-60-90 plan that allows the promoted member of staff to revert back to their old role amicably if it’s not working out.</li><li><strong>Good companies will look out for their own staff first</strong> and seize opportunities to offer career progression in order to retain existing talent. I don’t have any statistics on how many manager of manager roles that get filled and are never advertised externally, but I’d reckon it’s maybe in the 70%+ region. If you hire good people consistently, you’ll always have someone great progressing up through the ranks. Why look elsewhere, unless you specifically need to bring in someone specific, such as a candidate with key domain knowledge that is lacking at the company?</li><li><strong>The need to find a manager of managers (in my experience) is rarely something that undergoes extensive planning</strong>. During periods of rapid growth, the number of staff in the department may start stacking up to the point that existing teams need to be split into smaller ones, thus greating opportunities for a node in the org chart above those teams. Sometimes an existing manager of managers will quit and filling that void internally, on a tight timeline, is much easier than reaching outside of the company. Or perhaps two organizations merging together create a bunch of empty nodes in the org chart needing urgently to be filled. Often you look within.</li></ul>



<p>These are all opportunities that you can more likely seize if you make sure you’re already working for an ambitious, high growth company and are doing a stellar job of running a team. This is no small feat in itself, mind you.</p>



<p>Start-ups, or smaller high growth companies in general, are great for giving yourself this opportunity, especially ones that have just received a new venture capital investment. An injection of money means an injection of people, and that then creates more opportunities for leading them as the org chart adapts. <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book/">I advocated strongly for the managerial opportunities that high growth start-ups can offer you in the penultimate chapter of my book</a>. After all, how do you reckon many CTOs became CTOs for the first time?</p>



<p>So where am I going with this? To use the cheesiest quote, you’ve gotta skate where the puck is going. (Thanks Wayne.) Yes, you can keep an eye on external adverts and apply to anything and everything and hope that you land the job. However, depending on where you currently work, it may be more fruitful to change role sooner at your <em>current</em> level – which is often easier – in order to stand more of a chance of upward growth over time.</p>



<p>There are parallels here with the early stages of an individual contributor’s career. It’s often really hard to land that first job because the applicant has yet to be able to prove themselves. However, once they’ve stuck around for a few years and have gained experience by shipping lots of code, they find themselves having to bat the recruiters away.</p>



<p>The exact same thing is true about progressing further up the management track. Getting your first management role is tough, but you only have to do it once to prove you can do it again. The same is true about the next step of managing managers. People often grow from within by being excellent performers and then working their way upwards.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to grow from managing individual contributors to managing managers, have a think about the following points.</p>



<ul><li><strong>How likely is it that this will be possible at your current company within a reasonable timeframe?</strong> If it’s not, you might need to look elsewhere sooner rather than later.</li><li><strong>Is your current Engineering Manager role defined similarly to how other notable companies in the industry define it?</strong> If not, why not? The more your current EM role fits that of the best employers in the industry, the better chance you have of moving sideways and upwards.</li><li><strong>How many years of experience in this role do you have?</strong> I would expect a manager of managers to be a high growth EM with at least a few years of tenure.</li><li><strong>What notable infrastructure, features or products have you shipped whilst being an EM?&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Are you seen as an influential person in your current department?</strong> Do people outside your team seek your advice? If not, why not?</li><li><strong>Have you coached anyone outside of your team?</strong> If not, then I’d advise you to start giving it a go.</li><li><strong>Have you found anyone else doing this role, either in your existing company, your network or online?</strong> Get in touch with them to see if they’ll have a chat with you about what it’s like to do that job, and ask them how they got into it. What changed for them when compared to just running one team? What happened to their time to contribute technically? </li></ul>



<p>What’s your current story? Does it feel like you’re ready for the next step? Have you already been working at the level of your next promotion?</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with the management career progression path in general then you can check out the career tracks of other companies, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1weNoeSUfHYOHy9sHKad_ax6qrVXNFlP4ieTwaRll70M/edit#gid=1999769114">including our own</a> from Brandwatch, on <a href="https://www.progression.fyi/">progression.fyi</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re seeking out others to talk to about it, then you could use LinkedIn, Twitter, or Slack communities such as <a href="https://lead-dev-slack.herokuapp.com/">The Lead Developer</a>, <a href="https://ctocraft.com/community/">CTO Craft,</a> or the <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/">Rands’ Leadership group</a> to do so. </p>



<p>While you ruminate on these, I’ll be expanding out my own thoughts and experiences of doing the job for a number of years in the forthcoming series of articles that I’ll be hosting under the <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/">Managing Managers</a> section of the website.</p>



<p>Until the next one, good luck!&nbsp;</p>

I did this first for Verbling (as a side component to my work as a full-time dev), and then later for Codementor, as a remote growth consultant.</p> <p>The second, was my own sites or apps where 100% of the content was produced by me. I've also helped several other independent solo-founders do essentially the same for their own projects. Today's advice is for 2nd type of site—the ones with just one writer.</p> <p>For a quick point of reference, I'll what I'm currently working on so you can get an idea of how applicable my experience is or isn't to you:  <a href="https://alchemist.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alchemist Camp</a>. It targets an extremely small programming niche and is hovering around Alexa 700k (10-15k uniques/month with decent visit time). I add new content about once a week. Previously, I built a considerably larger personal blog that peaked at about Alexa 300k, but it's no longer up.</p> <h2 id="work-with-the-search-engine"><a href="#work-with-the-search-engine">#</a> Work <em>with</em> the search engine</h2> <p>There's a lot of competition for attention from search engines and an entire industry of people trying to game them. It's possible to do that successfully in the short term, but people who do that generally get crushed when new search ranking updates. The more egregious marketers sometimes get penalized or banned entirely.</p> <p>There are certain technical SEO basics to pay attention to, such as having a reasonable site structure, a sitemap and appropriate meta-tags. I'm going to assume you've got that covered. WordPress or any other modern CMS will do an adequate job out of the box.</p> <p>So with the above assumptions, what's a good way to cut through the competition?</p> <h2 id="pay-attention-when-a-search-is-frustrating"><a href="#pay-attention-when-a-search-is-frustrating">#</a> Pay attention when a search is frustrating</h2> <p>The single most successful strategy I've found for getting search engine traffic for a more niche site has been to pay very close attention when something is difficult to find online. This isn't very difficult to do, since it's easy to notice when something is frustrating. The key is to be aware and take notes.</p> <p>Look at your browser history and write down <em>the exact queries</em> you typed into Google, Duckduckgo or your search engine of choice. Ask yourself <em>what</em> you were hoping to find online and why you tried each query after the first.</p> <h2 id="create-what-you-hoped-your-search-would-find"><a href="#create-what-you-hoped-your-search-would-find">#</a> Create what you hoped your search would find</h2> <p>Then, after you've learned what you were trying to learn during your frustrating search, create the very thing you were trying to find.</p> <p>Usually a search is difficult because the ideal answer doesn't exist in a single document online or video. Instead, finding the answer involves piecing the information together from numerous sources. If that was the case with your frustrating search, then the next step is to create the answer to the search and publish it.</p> <p>Occasionally after a long and frustrating search, you <em>will</em> find a single resource that answers exactly what you wanted. In this case the question is, "Why didn't my first several searches return this document?" Maybe it used different terminology than you did. Maybe it was comment on an ancient forum post. Maybe it was on an extremely slow site. Make your own version of the resource you finally found, but fix whatever issue made it difficult to find.</p> <h3 id="an-example"><a href="#an-example">#</a> An example</h3> <p>One direct example of using this strategy was when it took me about 20 minutes of searching to find out how to do a certain kind of query with Elixir's main DB-related library, Ecto. Elixir maps are stored in Postgres as JSONB fields, and I wanted to query fields within the JSONB.</p> <p>I saw I'd made 8 searches, starting with <em>"query nested fields of a map ecto"</em>. Ultimately the whole answer to what I was looking for was split between a Thoughtbot post, a Stack Overflow answer and a Postgres documentation page.</p> <p>Then I wrote a short article called, <a href="https://alchemist.camp/articles/querying-nested-map-ecto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Querying nested fields of a map with Ecto</a> that contained exactly the information I'd been looking for, and it's since brought in a thousand visitors from search in under a year.</p> <h2 id="why-does-this-work"><a href="#why-does-this-work">#</a> Why does this work?</h2> <p>This strategy tends to be stable because it works with the search engine and doesn't tend to get crushed by updates the way more aggressive techniques do. It leads to creating genuinely helpful resources for people to find online and Google has every incentive to return them in its results.</p> <p>Content created this way tends to rank well because the entire strategy revolves around escaping competition. If there is a lot of competition around a query, it's generally well-answered and you'll find an adequate (though possibly spammy, advertising-stuffed) result within a search or two. The searches that are <em>really</em> frustrating are usually not going to have much competition.</p> <p>Unless your interests are <strong>truly</strong> rare, others will search for what you did and find your page.</p>  <br></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Welcome back to <em>Exploring FPGA Graphics</em>. In the previous part we got an <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/">introduction to FPGA graphics</a>; now we’re ready to put our graphical skills to work recreating the arcade classic: Pong.</p>
<p>In this series we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We start by learning how displays work, before racing the beam with Pong, drawing starfields and sprites, simulating life with bitmaps, drawing lines and triangles, and finally creating simple 3D models. I’ll be writing and revising this series throughout 2020. New to the series? Start with <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/">Exploring FPGA Graphics</a>.</p>
<p><em>Revised 2020-08-17. Get in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/WillFlux">@WillFlux</a> or open an <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/issues">issue on GitHub</a>.</em></p>
<h3 id="series-outline">Series Outline</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics">Exploring FPGA Graphics</a> - how displays work and simple animated colour graphics</li>
<li>FPGA Pong (this post) - race the beam to create the arcade classic</li>
<li><a href="https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-ad-astra/">FPGA Ad Astra</a> - animated starfields, hardware sprites, and bitmap fonts</li>
<li>Life on Screen - bitmaps and Conway’s Game of Life (being written)</li>
<li>Hard Lines - drawing lines and screen coordinates (planned Sep 2020)</li>
<li>More 2D &amp; 3D to follow (details TBC)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>For this series, you need an FPGA board with video output. We’ll be working at 640x480, so pretty much any video output will do. You should be comfortable with programming your FPGA board and reasonably familiar with Verilog.</p>
<p>We’ll be demoing with these boards (FPGA type):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker">iCEBreaker</a></strong> (Lattice iCE40) with <strong><a href="https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker">12-Bit DVI Pmod</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual">Digilent Arty A7-35T</a></strong> (Xilinx XC7) with <strong><a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodvga/reference-manual">Pmod VGA</a></strong>
<ul>
<li>The Arty version of Pong is still being tested and will be released soon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the source <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/fpga-pong">README</a> to quickly build a project for either of these boards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>iCEBreaker with VGA Pmod</strong><br>
The first part of this series included VGA designs for iCEBreaker. Maintaining three sets of designs was a significant overhead, so the iCEBreaker VGA version has been dropped from the examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="source">Source</h3>
<p>All the Verilog designs featured in this series are available in the <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/">Exploring FPGAs repo</a>, and source links are included throughout the blog. The designs are open source under the permissive MIT licence, but this blog is subject to normal copyright restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Pong</strong> may not have been the first computer game, but it has an excellent claim to being the first to break into public consciousness when it was released in 1972. Originally an arcade cabinet, it was quickly adapted to be played at home attached to a television. If you’d like to learn more about the early history of Atari, including Pong, I recommend <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/racing-beam">Racing the Beam</a></em> by Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost.</p>
<p><em>ProTip: If you’re unfamiliar with Pong gameplay, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it0sf4CMDeM">Pong video</a> on YouTube.</em></p>
<h2 id="ball--paddles">Ball &amp; Paddles</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-graphics/">previous part</a> of this series, we learnt how to draw animated squares and perform collision detection. This gives us all we need to implement a square Pong ball:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to add some paddles. The paddles are simple rectangles that move vertically on the left and right sides of the screen.

</code></pre></div><p>We compare paddle positions with the top or bottom of the ball to prevent them being too twitchy.</p>
<h3 id="pong-v1">Pong v1</h3>
<p>We can use the ball and paddle logic to create a first version of the top module for Pong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xilinx XC7: <em>coming soon</em></li>
<li>Lattice iCE40: <strong><a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/blob/master/fpga-pong/ice40/top_pong_v1.sv">ice40/top_pong_v1.sv</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To build this example, you’ll also need the display timings, clock generation, and constraints, that we created in the first part of the series. All these files are available in the <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/fpga-pong">FPGA Pong repo</a> together with a makefile for iCEBreaker, and Vivado project for Arty.</p>
<h2 id="collision">Collision</h2>
<p>It’s briefly fun to watch the ball crawl around the screen with the paddles, but this isn’t exactly a game, even a demo of one: the ball shows a blatant disregard for the paddles.</p>
<p>To test for paddle collision, we take advantage of the drawing signals: if we’re drawing the ball and a paddle at the same time, then there’s a collision. The collision occurs during the drawing process, so we need to store it and use it when we next animate.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog"><span>logic</span> p1_col, p2_col;
<span>always_ff</span> @(<span>posedge</span> clk_pix) <span>begin</span>
    <span>if</span> (animate) <span>begin</span>
        p1_col <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span>;
        p2_col <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span>;
    <span>end</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (b_draw) <span>begin</span>
        <span>if</span> (p1_draw) p1_col <span>&lt;=</span> <span>1</span>;
        <span>if</span> (p2_draw) p2_col <span>&lt;=</span> <span>1</span>;
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We reset the collision detection when we receive the <code>animate</code> signal. However, the value of <code>col_p1</code> and <code>col_p2</code> is available until the next clock tick, so the ball animation can always use it.</p>
<p>Update the horizontal ball animation to check for paddle collisions:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog">    <span>always_ff</span> @(<span>posedge</span> clk_pix) <span>begin</span>
        <span>if</span> (animate) <span>begin</span>

<p>So far the FPGA has been playing against itself. If you want to get in on the action, we need to add some controls. We’re going to use three buttons: up, control, and down.</p>
<p>Add the buttons to the top module ports:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog">    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> btn_up,       <span>// up button
</span><span></span>    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> btn_ctrl,     <span>// control button
</span><span></span>    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> btn_dn,       <span>// down button
</span></code></pre></div><p>We need to map these buttons to FPGA pins in the constraints file. You’ll be happy to hear I’ve already done this for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xilinx XC7: <em>coming soon</em></li>
<li>Lattice iCE40: <strong><a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/blob/master/fpga-pong/ice40/icebreaker.pcf">ice40/icebreaker.pcf</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To safely use buttons in our design, we need to debounce them. Debouncing ensures we get a single, clean, transition from button presses. The debounce module looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog"><span>module</span> debounce (
    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> clk,  <span>// clock
</span><span></span>    <span>input</span>  <span>wire</span> <span>logic</span> in,   <span>// signal input
</span><span></span>    <span>output</span>      <span>logic</span> out,  <span>// signal output (debounced)
</span><span></span>    <span>output</span>      <span>logic</span> ondn, <span>// on down (one tick)
</span><span></span>    <span>output</span>      <span>logic</span> onup  <span>// on up (one tick)
</span><span></span>    );

    <span>// sync with clock and combat metastability
</span><span></span>    <span>logic</span> sync_0, sync_1;
    <span>always_ff</span> @(<span>posedge</span> clk) sync_0 <span>&lt;=</span> in;
    <span>always_ff</span> @(<span>posedge</span> clk) sync_1 <span>&lt;=</span> sync_0;

    <span>logic</span> [<span>16</span><span>:</span><span>0</span>] cnt;  <span>// 2^17 = 1.3 ms counter at 100 MHz
</span><span></span>    <span>logic</span> idle, max;

        idle <span>=</span> (out <span>==</span> sync_1);
        max  <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>cnt;
        ondn <span>=</span> <span>~</span>idle <span>&amp;</span> max <span>&amp;</span> <span>~</span>out;
        onup <span>=</span> <span>~</span>idle <span>&amp;</span> max <span>&amp;</span> out;
    <span>end</span>

    <span>always_ff</span> @(<span>posedge</span> clk) <span>begin</span>
        <span>if</span> (idle) <span>begin</span>
            cnt <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span>;
        <span>end</span> <span>else</span> <span>begin</span>
            cnt <span>&lt;=</span> cnt <span>+</span> <span>1</span>;
            <span>if</span> (max) out <span>&lt;=</span> <span>~</span>out;
        <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
<span>endmodule</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We want continuous signals for up and down, but a one-off event for the control button:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="verilog">    <span>logic</span> sig_ctrl, move_up, move_dn;
    debounce deb_btn_ctrl (.clk(clk_pix), .in(btn_ctrl), .out(), .ondn(), .onup(sig_ctrl));
    debounce …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<div><p>
Sean Ellis (early Dropbox, Eventbrite) found leading indicator for product/market fit.
<b>Just ask users "How would you feel if you could no longer use our product?" and measure the percent who answer "Very disappointed"</b></p><p>

If the percentage is above the 40%, you did it — you got to product/market fit.

</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>
This article is by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulvohra/">Rahul Vohra</a>, the founder and CEO of <a target="_blank" href="https://superhuman.com/">Superhuman</a> — a startup building the fastest email experience in the world.
</p>
<p>
We’ve all heard that product/market fit drives startup success — and that the lack thereof is what’s lurking behind
almost every failure.
</p>
<p>
For founders, achieving product/market fit is an obsession from day one. It’s both the hefty hurdle we’re racing
to clear and the festering fear keeping us up at night, worried that we’ll never make it.
But when it comes to understanding what product/market fit really is and how to get there, most of us quickly realize that
there isn’t a battle-tested approach.
</p>
<p>
In the summer of 2017, I was waist-deep in my search for a way to find product/market fit for my startup, Superhuman.
Turning to the classic blog posts and seminal thought pieces, a few observations stuck out to me.
Y Combinator founder Paul Graham described product/market fit as when you’ve <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/13sentences.html">made something that people want</a>,
while Sam Altman <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/before-growth">characterized</a> it as when users spontaneously tell other people to use your product.
But of course, the most cited description comes from this passage in Marc Andreessen’s 2007 blog post:
</p>
<p>
“You can always feel when product/market fit is <b>not</b> happening.
The customers aren't quite getting value out of the product, word of mouth isn't spreading, usage isn't growing that
fast, press reviews are kind of ‘blah,’ the sales cycle takes too long, and lots of deals never close.
</p>
<p>
And you can always feel product/market fit when it is happening. The customers are buying the product just as
fast as you can make it — or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers
is piling up in your company checking account. You're hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can.
Reporters are calling because they've heard about your hot new thing and they want to talk to you about it.
You start getting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Business School.
Investment bankers are staking out your house.”
</p>
<p>
For me, this was the most vivid definition — and one that I stared at through tears.
</p>
<p>
We had set up shop and started coding Superhuman in 2015. A year later, our team had grown to seven and we were still furiously coding. By the summer of 2017, we had reached 14 people — and we were still coding. I felt intense pressure to launch, from the team and also from within myself. My previous startup, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>, had launched, scaled and been acquired by LinkedIn in less time. Yet here we were, two years in, and we had not passed go.
</p>
<p>
But no matter how intense the pressure, I wasn’t ready to launch. Common practice would be to "throw it out there and see what sticks,” which may be fine after a few months of effort when the sunk cost is low. But the “launch and see what happens” method seemed irresponsible and reckless to me — especially given the years that that we had invested.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Rahul Vohra, Founder of Superhuman" src="https://pmfguru.com/assets/blog/Rahul-Vohra-22cbde9d5bf1eefdec11bb9c0b818b2347fbfba9465266a1c73df5333c710d03.jpg">
</p><p><small>Handsome Rahul Vohra, Founder of Superhuman</small>
</p>

<p>
Further compounding the pressure, as a founder, I couldn’t just tell the team how I felt. These super-ambitious engineers had poured their hearts and souls into the product. I had no way of telling the team we weren’t ready, and worse yet, no strategy for getting out of the situation — which is not something they would want to hear. I wanted to find the right language or framework to articulate our current position and convey the next steps that would get us to product/market fit, but was struggling to do so.
</p>
<p>
That’s because the descriptions of product/market fit I found were immensely helpful for companies <em>post-launch</em>. If, after launch, revenue isn’t growing, raising money is tough, the press doesn't want to talk to you and user growth is anemic, then you can safely conclude you don't have product/market fit. But in practice, because of my previous success as a founder, we didn’t have problems raising money. We could have gotten press, but we were actively avoiding it. And user growth wasn't happening because we deliberately choosing not to onboard more users. We were pre-launch — and we didn’t have any indicators to clearly illustrate our situation.
</p>
<p>
The descriptions of product/market fit all seemed so post hoc, so unactionable. I had a clear understanding of where we stood, but I had no way of conveying that to others — and no plan for the part that should come next.
</p>
<p>
So I racked my brain for an answer on how to travel the distance between where Superhuman was and the high bar that we needed to hit. And I eventually started to wonder: <b>what if you could measure product/market fit?</b> Because if you could measure product/market fit, then maybe you could optimize it. And then maybe you could systematically increase product/market fit until you achieved it.
</p>
<p>
Reoriented around this purpose and reinvigorated by the new direction, I set out to reverse engineer a process for getting to product/market fit. Below, I outline the findings that followed, specifically unpacking the clarifying metric that made everything fall into place and the four-step process we used to build an engine that propelled Superhuman forward on the path to finding our fit.
</p>
<h5>
ANCHORING AROUND A METRIC: A LEADING INDICATOR FOR PRODUCT/MARKET FIT
</h5>
<p>
On my quest to understand product/market fit, I read all I could and spoke with every expert I could find. Everything changed when I found Sean Ellis, who ran early early growth in the early days of Dropbox, LogMeIn, and Eventbrite and later coined the term “growth hacker.”
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>
<h4>

</h4>
<h5>
<small>Built for startups. Setup in 2 minutes.</small>
</h5>
</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>
The product/market fit definitions I had found were vivid and compelling, but they were <em>lagging</em> indicators — by the time investment bankers are staking out your house, you already have product/market fit. Instead, Ellis had found a <em>leading</em> indicator: <b>just ask users “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the percent who answer “very disappointed.”</b>
</p>
<p>
After benchmarking nearly a hundred startups with his customer development survey, Ellis found that the magic number was 40%. Companies that struggled to find growth almost always had less than 40% of users respond “very disappointed,” whereas companies with strong traction almost always exceeded that threshold.

Tick tock.🕐</strong></p>
<p>As the clock ticks on, with a deafening silence we have never known before, like many of us, I didn't want to sit and count those seconds scrolling by.</p>
<p>Time ain't really money (I mean we should have been rich by that logic long time back) but it sure is an opportunity.</p>
<p>So, I decided to put this period of lockdown to unlock more of my potential, by diving into the clouds!</p>
<p>The World of Big Data and Cloud Services</p>
<p>By the end of this sentence, millions and billions of bytes of data would have been sent and received. And every time that happens, there are curious minds waiting to listen to what the data is saying.</p>
<p>This ever-growing avenue led to the concept of Big Data and Cloud Services, which is becoming not just a capability, but a necessity in all fields today.
Cloud is the Captain America version of Steve Rogers, basically on-premise services on steroids. </p>
<p>Like a nineties kid, I watched the big bang of bits and bytes and revolution of the internet.
The next wave is gonna be of big data and cloud services, and this time I want to be right at the centre of it rather than being a kid staring at it with jaw-dropping to the floor.</p>
<p>Becoming an AWS Ninja!</p>
<p>When I decided to jump in the world of cloud services, the first question was to go with which tech on offer?</p>
<p>Simple. I chose AWS.</p>
<h2 id="why-">Why? 🤔</h2>
<p>Well, it's like asking why Tesla is the talk of the town and not GM anymore.
Gartner's famous Magic Quadrant released in July 2019 paints a clear picture that AWS is the lead runner in race of cloud technology.
Azure and Google are definitely catching up, but so is GM and Ford for Tesla (not yet there!)</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/uw4loiyleu6n4c521l3s.png" alt="Alt Text"></p>
<p>Even if you are working towards a promotion, or churn some more dollars, AWS is the skill to have right now.</p>
<h2 id="my-journey-of-aws-certifications-">My journey of AWS Certifications 🚴‍♀️:</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-">Step 1:</h3>
<p>My baby steps on the journey to becoming a certified developer on AWS started with the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification back in November 2019.</p>
<p>So, if you are still working towards that, this article might not be for you. You can check this article out to ace the Practitioner certification.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-">Step 2:</h3>
<p>From thereon, the next thing you need to do is practice. Try to experience AWS first hand. Explore around, learn new stuff and implement what all you need.</p>
<p>For me, working in an environment where the work revolves around cloud services was a blessing as I spent good part of the last year honing my skills on the platform before feeling ready to step up the game.</p>
<p>You can also use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">Free Tier</a>, Amazon provides on AWS to further brush your skills before you jump into the advance stuff.</p>
<h3 id="step-3">Step 3</h3>
<p>Resources I used 📘:</p>
<p>As much as one would love to have a single source for all there is to learn, more often than not we need to club multiple sources to get the most out of them.
For AWS, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate">ACloud Guru's Solutions Architect Associate</a> course and another one by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/Ia-UEYYR44s">Andrew Brown on freecodecamp's youtube channel</a> worked the best for me.</p>
<h3 id="step-4">Step 4</h3>
<p>One of the biggest add on for me, was to go through the FAQ's provided by AWS for service's like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/">S3</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/">EC2</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/faqs/">Load Balancers</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/">VPC</a>and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/faqs/">Route53</a>.
This will help to clear all your doubts and get you better prepared for the test.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-practice-tests">Step 5: Practice Tests</h3>
<p>Nothing sets you up nicely for the real test than the practice tests.
It might be boring, but believe me, they will go a long way as a reality check for you.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.whizlabs.com/">Whizlabs</a> provides the best tests out there at a minimal cost at $17(may have changed). The 7 practice tests are the seven steps to clearing your test.
In case you have passed the previous AWS certificate for Cloud Practitioner, you are provided with a free practice test and 50% off for the exam fee as well.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-support">Step 6: Support</h3>
<p>I would recommend to join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/awscertified-challenge-free-path-aws-cloud-certifications/">#AWSCertified</a> challenge and the #100DaysOfCloud. Here is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.gg/dvUh79v">discord for #100DaysOfCloud</a>.
I am available for any doubt clarification or any other stuff you might need.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-notes">Step 7: Notes</h3>
<p>If you just want to refresh your concepts or want to just go through concise notes before the tests, I have posted them <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rishabkumar7.github.io/CloudNotes/">here</a> for your reference.</p>
<h3 id="step-8-the-t-day">Step 8: The T-Day</h3>
<p>Well, if you are here, it means you are ready for the test!
Just fill up for the test and in no time you will be a certified AWS Solution Architect.</p>
<p>I took around 15 days to brush up my skills, go through practice tests before I went ahead to ace my test.
It might take a little longer/shorter for you, but following these steps will certainly set you up for the test.</p>
<p>And you can follow me on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/rishabk7">Twitter</a> to see my journey in the Cloud☁</p>
<p><strong>Good Luck 👍</strong></p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p><a href="https://prestosql.io/docs/current/release/release-334.html">Presto 334</a>
adds significant performance improvements for queries
accessing nested fields inside struct columns. They have been optimized through
the pushdown of dereference expressions. With this feature, the query execution
prunes structural data eagerly, extracting the necessary fields.</p>

<p><code>RowType</code> is a built-in data type of Presto, storing the in-memory
representation of commonly used nested data types of the connectors, eg.
<code>STRUCT</code> type in Hive. Datasets often contain wide and deeply nested structural
columns, i.e. a struct column having hundreds of fields, with the fields being
nested themselves.</p>
<p>Although such <code>RowType</code> columns can contain plenty of data, most of the
analytical queries access just a few fields out of it. Without dereference
pushdown, Presto scans the whole column, and shuffles all that data around
before projecting the necessary fields. This suboptimal execution causes higher
CPU usage, higher memory usage and higher query latencies, than required. The
unnecessary operations get even more expensive with wider/deeper structs and
more complex query plans.</p>
<p>LinkedIn’s data ecosystem makes heavy usage of nested columns. It is common to
have 2-3 levels of nesting, and up to 50 fields in most of our tracking tables.
Because of the query execution inefficiency for nested fields, ETL pipelines
were set up at LinkedIn to copy the nested columns as a set of top-level columns
corresponding to subfields. This step added overhead in our ingestion process
and delayed data availability for analytics. It also caused ORC schemas to be
inconsistent with the rest of the infrastructure, making it harder to migrate
from existing flows on row-oriented formats.</p>
<p>Similarly, Lyft’s schemas make heavy use of nested data to decompose a ride
into its routes, riders, segments, modes, and geo-coordinates. Prior to the
performance improvements, analytical queries would either need to be run on
clusters with very long timeouts, or the data would have to be flattened before
being analyzed, adding an extra ETL step. Not only would this be costly, it
would also cause the original schema to diverge in our data warehouse making it
more difficult for data scientists to understand.</p>
<p>The dereference pushdown optimization in Presto is having a massive impact on
the ingestion story at both LinkedIn and Lyft. Nested data is now being made
available faster for consumption with a consistency of structure across all
stores, while maintaining performance parity for analytical queries.</p>

<p>Say we have a Hive table <code>jobs</code>, with a struct-typed column <code>job_info</code> in the
schema. The column <code>jobs</code> is wide and deeply nested, i.e. <code>ROW(company
varchar, requirements ROW(skills array(...), education ROW(...), salary ...) ,
...)</code>. Most queries would access a small percentage of data from this struct
using the dereference projection (the <code>.</code> operation). Consider such a query <code>Q</code>
below.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span><span>appid</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>J</span><span>.</span><span>job_info</span><span>.</span><span>company</span> <span>c</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>applications</span> <span>A</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>jobs</span> <span>J</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>A</span><span>.</span><span>jobid</span> <span>=</span> <span>J</span><span>.</span><span>jobid</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>100</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It should suffice to scan only one field <code>company</code> from <code>J.job_info</code> for
executing this query. But, without dereference pushdown, Presto scans and
shuffles everything from <code>job_info</code>, only to project a single field at the end.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/original_plan.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With dereference pushdown, Presto optimizes queries by extracting the sufficient
fields from a <code>ROW</code> as early as possible. This is enforced by modifying the
query plan through a set of optimizers, and can be broadly divided into two
parts.</p>
<p>First, dereference projections are extracted in the query plan and pushed as
close to the table scan as possible. This happens independent of what the
connector is. Secondly, there is a further improvement for Hive tables. The
Hive Connector and ORC/Parquet readers have been optimized to scan only the
sufficient subfield columns.</p>
<p>Pushdown of predicates on the subfields is also a crucial optimization. For
example, if a query has filters on subfields (i.e. <code>a.b &gt; 5</code>), they should be
utilized by ORC/Parquet readers while scanning files. The pushdown helps with
the pruning of files, stripes and row-groups based on column-level statistics.
This optimization is achieved as a byproduct of the above two optimizations.</p>
<p>With the dereference pushdown, queries observe significant performance gains in
terms of CPU/memory usage and query runtime, roughly proportional to the
relative size of nested columns compared to the accessed fields.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-in-query-plan">Pushdown in Query Plan</h2>
<p>The goal here is to execute dereference projections as early as possible. This
usually means performing them right after the table scans.</p>
<p>A projection operation that performs dereferencing on input symbols (i.e.
<code>job_info.company</code>) reduces the amount of data going up the plan tree. Pushing
dereference projections down means that we are pruning data early. It reduces
the amount of data being processed and shuffled in query execution. For the
example query <code>Q</code>, the query plan looks like the following when dereference
pushdown is enabled.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/transformed_plan.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The projection <code>job_info.company</code> now directly follows the scan of <code>jobs</code> table,
avoiding the propagation the <code>job_info</code> through <code>Limit</code> and <code>Join</code> nodes. Note
that all of <code>job_info</code> is still being scanned, and pruning it in the reader
requires connector-dependent optimizations.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-in-the-hive-connector">Pushdown in the Hive Connector</h2>
<p>In columnar formats like ORC and Parquet, the data is laid out in a columnar
fashion even for subfields. If we have a column <code>STRUCT(f1, f2, f3)</code>, the
subfields <code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code> and <code>f3</code> are stored as independent columns. An optimized
query engine should only scan the required fields through its ORC reader,
skipping the rest. This optimization has been added for Hive connector.</p>
<p>Dereference projections above a <code>TableScanNode</code> are pushed down in the Hive
connector as “virtual” (or “projected”) columns. The query plan is modified to
refer to these new columns. For the query <code>Q</code>, <code>jobs</code> table would be scanned
differently with this optimization, as shown below. The projection is now
embedded in the Hive connector. Here, <code>job_info#company</code> can be thought of as
a virtual column representing the subfield <code>job_info.company</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/connector_pushdown.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Hive connector handles the projections before returning columns to Presto’s
engine. It provides the required virtual columns to format-specific readers.
ORC and Parquet readers optimize their scans based on subfields required,
increasing their read throughput. Subfield pruning is not possible for
row-oriented format readers (e.g. AVRO). For them, Hive connector performs
adaptation to project the required fields.</p>
<h2 id="pushdown-of-predicates-on-subfields">Pushdown of Predicates on Subfields</h2>
<p>Columnar formats store per-column statistics in the data files, which can be
used by the readers for filtering. eg. if a query contains filter <code>y = 5</code> for a
top-level column <code>y</code>, Presto’s ORC reader can skip ORC stripes and files by
looking at the upper and lower bounds for <code>y</code> in the statistics.</p>
<p>The same concept of predicate-based pruning can work for filters involving
subfields, since the statistics are also stored for subfield columns. i.e.
Presto’s ORC/Parquet reader should be able to filter based on a constraint like
<code>x.f1 = 5</code> for more optimal scans. Good news! In the final optimized plan,
predicates on a subfield are pushed down to the hive connector as a constraint
on the corresponding virtual column, and later used for optimizing the scan.
The complete logic is a bit complicated to explain here, but can be illustrated
through the following example.</p>
<p>Given an initial plan with a predicate on a dereferenced field (<code>x.f1 = 5</code>), a
chain of optimizers transform it to a more optimal plan with reader-level
predicates. In the future, the same optimization will be added to the Parquet
reader.</p>
<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/predicate_pushdown.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the final plan, Hive connector knows to scan the column <code>y</code> and the subfield
<code>x.f1</code>. It also takes advantage of the “virtual” column constraint <code>x#f1 = 5</code>
for reader-level pruning.</p>
<h2 id="performance-improvement">Performance Improvement</h2>
<p>Dereference pushdown improves performance for queries accessing nested fields
in multiple ways. First, it increases the read throughput for table scans,
reducing the CPU time. The pruning of fields during the scan also means lesser
data to process for all downstream operators and tasks. So the early
projections result in more optimal execution for any operations that involve
shuffle or copy of data. Moreover, for ORC/Parquet, the read performance
improves in the case of selective filters on subfields.</p>
<p>Below are some experimental results on a production dataset at LinkedIn which
contains 3 <code>STRUCT</code> columns, having ~20-30 small subfields in each. The
example queries used in the analysis access only a few subfields. The queries
have been listed as their approximate query shape for the sake of brevity. The
plots compare CPU usage, peak memory usage and averaged query wall time.</p>

<p><img src="https://prestosql.io/assets/blog/dereference-pushdown/runtime_perf.png" alt=""></p>
<p>CPU usage and peak memory usage show orders-of-magnitude improvement in
presence of dereference pushdown. Query wall times also reduce considerably,
and this improvement is more drastic for the relatively complex <code>JOIN</code> query,
as expected.</p>
<p>Please note that these are not benchmarks! The performance improvement you’ll
see will vary depending on how many columns are contained in your nested data
versus how many you’ve referenced. At Lyft we saw improvements of <code>50x</code> for some
queries!</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>The pushdown of dereference expressions can be extended to arrays. i.e.
dereference operations applied after unnesting an array should also get pushed
down to the readers. For example, using our jobs table from before, our
<code>jobs.job_info</code> structure may contain a repeating structure such as
<code>required_skills</code>. With the following query, the entire required_skills
structure would be read even though only a small part of it is being referenced.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>S</span><span>.</span><span>description</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>jobs</span> <span>J</span>
<span>CROSS</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>UNNEST</span> <span>(</span><span>job_info</span><span>.</span><span>required_skills</span><span>)</span> <span>S</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>S</span><span>.</span><span>years_of_experience</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The work for this improvement is being tracked in <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/issues/3925">this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to Hive Connector, connector-level dereference pushdown can be extended
to other connectors supporting nested types.</p>
<p>Another future improvement will be the pushdown of …</p></div></article></div></div>

              <div>  <div>
          
            <div><p>It's conference season…virtually speaking. The health and safety of our community are more important than anything else, which means in-person events are a no-go in 2020 (and likely beyond). Rather than canceling, most tech events in 2020 have decided to go online. These very virtual venues aren't the only change. If you've attended conferences before, you're in for a completely different experience with an online event.</p>

<p>How can you make the most of this new world of virtual conferences? We have eight tips to help get you started.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Understand your goals.</strong> Before attending, make sure you know what you want to get out of the event. So many people attend conferences on autopilot. "It's just what you do" is not a valid reason for spending your valuable time. Think it through first.</li>
	<li><strong>Be selective.</strong> If you're there for training, select talks that will be most helpful for moving you toward your goals. This isn't different from an in-person event, but it's something I find few people actually do. Plan to spend your time on the things that matter most for you.</li>
	<li><strong>Adjust your expectations.</strong> If you're there for networking, you might be disappointed. Most online conferences fall short on this element. It's nearly impossible for online events to duplicate the serendipitous experience of walking around and hanging out at an in-person event. Most attempts to do so feel contrived at best and worryingly like Chatroulette at worst, leaving them ripe for abuse.</li>
	<li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Speaking of abuse, don't be That Guy in the session chatroom. Just because typing in the chat may not interrupt the speaker's delivery, it doesn't give you license to type a bunch of “well actually”s during their session. The session chat is not the place to show off your knowledge or bring up a pet project that you feel the speaker should have mentioned. Just like at in-person events, legitimate questions are welcome but comments are not. If you want to show off your knowledge, do it the way the speaker did: by doing the hard work of getting a proposal accepted then writing and delivering a good talk.</li>
	<li><strong>Branch out.</strong> Because nearly every conference seems to be going virtual right now, you may find that these online events give you the opportunity to test the waters in a conference you'd never otherwise attend. Want to learn more about technical writing? Accessibility? Product management? HR? Robotics? Whatever the topic, you can find an online conference for it. A few introductory sessions may give you a lot of valuable perspective on other roles and industries.</li>
	<li><strong>Take a break.</strong> Many people find all-day video conferences even more exhausting than the real-life version of the event. Remember: You don't need to attend a session in every time slot. Take care of yourself by taking breaks to go for a walk, play with your pets or kids, stretch, read comic books, or whatever helps you relax. You'll get a lot more out of the event this way.</li>
	<li><strong>Make the format work for you.</strong> A lot of video conferencing systems allow you to join the video on one device and the audio on another, such as your phone. This can be really helpful to battle conference fatigue because, by using your phone for the audio, you're no longer chained to your workspace and can move around without missing much. At a real-life conference, it's typically bad form to move around a lot in the middle of a session, but not so when the event is virtual, and using your phone for the audio can maximize your flexibility in this regard. In a virtual conference, it's perfectly fine to go get another cup of tea, walk around the room, or take a bathroom break (just make sure you're on mute).</li>
	<li><strong>Choose wisely.</strong> The best conference may be the one you never attend. If you don't feel you'll be able to meet your goals or have a good experience at an online event, don't attend it. You may be able to select the content that's best for your needs by viewing recordings of talks or by setting up online networking video chats with colleagues and fellow community members.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi everybody, happy Friday! I am Aaron Klotz, a Staff Software Engineer on the GeckoView team at Mozilla Corporation.</p>
<p>I have worked at Mozilla since the fall of 2012 and have worked on three different teams across that time: Performance, Platform Integration &amp; Security Hardening, and finally GeckoView.</p>
<p>Given the recent news about layoffs, I thought it might be cathartic to do an AMA to share my experiences at Mozilla and try to set the record straight the best that I can. I would not dare try this in other forums, but since the Tildes community is capable of civil discussion, I'll do it here! I provided some proof a long time ago when I first joined Tildes, and I'd like to think that many people in this community are willing to vouch for me at this point, but if you want more, I can add it.</p>
<p>Obviously I cannot discuss issues that are covered by my NDA (but fortunately most issues are <em>not</em> covered), and some details I might want to avoid out of sensitivity for people who were laid off. AMAA!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Also to make clear (if it wasn't obvious): These opinions are mine and mine alone, do not reflect the opinion of any Mozilla entity, etc. etc.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I'm logging off for the night, but I'll try to follow up throughout the weekend if I have time. Thanks for all the questions! Hopefully I've cleared up some things for you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I remember shopping for my first house with my wife and ignoring the school zones and their ratings.  We were solely concentrating on price, square footage, location and appearance.  </p>



<p>While these are all important considerations to take when buying a house, the quality of the schools should have been a big part of it as well.  We didn’t really realize this until it was a bit too late and we had already made a purchase in a bad school district. </p>



<h2>Why would you even ignore school districts?</h2>



<p>Those of you that are new to real estate may wonder why we would ignore it at all.  The reason is simple, price!  It is not uncommon in my city to see a 20% price difference in identical houses in the same general area <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/the-right-school-district-how-much-do-schools-affect-real-estate-prices/" target="_blank">based on the school district</a>.</p>



<p>The school district a house is in can be the difference between the house costing $400,000 and $500,000.  It is easy to say “I am not paying $100,000 extra for the same house in a different school district”.</p>



<p>This seems like the reasonable thing to do but it is a false economy.  Your house will become one of your most valuable <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/05/22/assets-explained/">assets</a> so you owe it to yourself to do a bit more research.  </p>



<h2>How Much Does That Savings Really Cost Me?</h2>



<p>I never asked myself this question until my oldest child was getting close to school age.  Then I sat down and did the math.</p>



<h4>Private School Tuition</h4>



<p>If you plan on having children then I would suggest calling a few of the local private schools and inquiring about their tuition.  In my case private school tuition was around $15,000 per year for each kid!  To make matters worse tuition was rising at rates over 5% a year.</p>



<p>I did some <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/time-value-of-money/">time value of money</a> calculations on the tuition costs for my two children and 13 years of K-12 private school education for each.  Not accounting for the inflation of prices, each child was going to cost me $195,000 apiece in tuition.  With 5% growth the actual number was <em>over $265,000 for each child</em> through high school!</p>



<p><em>That $100,000 savings on the purchase price of the house was going to cost me over half a million dollars over 13 years.</em></p>



<p>This money would be far better utilized by <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/college-529-savings-goal/">investing in a 529 plan</a> and using it to pay for a great college education.</p>



<h4>Education is always in demand</h4>



<p>We decided that the poor schools in my area were a cost we were not willing to bear.  We decided to change houses.  </p>



<p>Of course this comes with the huge expense of selling a house where you can lose up to 10% of your house value in fees, expenses, commissions, and closing costs.  This cost around $40,000 in our case.  </p>



<p>On top of that, we found out the hard way that houses in poor school districts are harder to sell while good school district homes can be somewhat recession proof.  In a cool market it took us longer and cost more discounts to unload our old house than expected.  At the same time we had to get into bidding wars on houses in top school districts.</p>



<h4>You can’t sell a diploma but you can sell a house</h4>



<p>When your kids graduate from high school you can always sell the house to get your money back.  Many people want to downsize by this point in their life anyhow.  Since education will still be in demand, you can always sell the house to recoup the extra money you spent.</p>



<p>As the population in our area grew but the number of quality schools stayed the same there was evidence that appreciation of home values were actually higher in good school district areas.  This is likely very local market oriented so you will need to do your own research here.</p>



<h4>What if I don’t and won’t have kids</h4>



<p>I would still consider it even if you don’t plan on needing schools.  Demand was more stable and appreciation rates higher in my area which made it a good financial decision for me even without the private school tuition savings.  </p>



<p>It has been my experience that when people buy into an area based on the quality of schools, parks, etc, they tend to be very motivated to maintain and improve the community.  This just means a better place to hang your hat.</p>



<h4>What if we want to do private school anyhow</h4>



<p>Many people will want to send their kids to private school regardless of the quality of public schools in their area.  What I found was that quality public schools in the area help control the price of private schools in the area.</p>



<p>In a community with bad public schools, private schools can charge whatever they want and people will pay it.  In a community with good public options, private schools have some limitations over what they can get away with.  </p>



<p>It is probably a good idea to do some basic research and check the tuition rates of some private school options.  For my situation they were significantly cheaper in the area with great public schools.</p>



<h4>What about risks to my investment</h4>



<p>Buying in a great school district is not totally risk free.  The schools could devolve in your district and change from an asset to a liability.  I personally don’t see this as a major risk though, as I mentioned earlier the people that buy there are invested in maintaining the community and schools.  If anything, I think the risk of the community falling apart while you live there is lower.</p>



<p>The other way you can be impacted is if you are re-zoned into a different district.  This can be a real risk if you have areas with poor schools adjacent to areas with good schools.  You can get rezoned into a poor school district.  Research how often the schools in the area redistrict.  Moving very close to the school itself can help reduce the risk you are rezoned.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I wish I had known then what I know now.  I could have saved myself a lot of hassle and tens of thousands of dollars.  While it may seem like a steep price to pay to get into a good school district, it is often worth it.  </p>



<p>If you don’t ever end up having kids you should at least break even on the purchase difference.  </p>



<p>If you do have kids it will probably save you hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of their education as well as give you better and easier sales options when you decide to move on. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Welcome to Part 2 of my shameless attempt at explaining Docker to beginners. I struggled so you don't have to!</p>
<p>In last week's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.antoniolofiego.com/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-containers-a-foolproof-hands-on-docker-tutorial-part-1-ckdc4tni0031759s14z0pdd2j">article</a> we covered what Docker is, some of its jargon, and why it outperforms VMs in many use cases in today's typical software development lifecycle. This week we'll go deeper into running Docker on our machines, all while figuring out the most interesting and useful underlying technicalities.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3aGZA6WLI9Jde/giphy.gif" alt="Let's go!"></p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-docker">Getting started with Docker</h2>
<p>If you don't have Docker installed on your machine, head over to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker Download page</a> to get the version that will work on your system.</p>
<p>The Linux version is the easiest to install, given that Docker is built off of Linux utilities. On Mac and Windows, on the other hand, there are two main ways of using Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/">Docker Desktop</a>
The newer and recommended version of Docker. It is a native solution that works directly along with your OS's processes, so we are free to interface with Docker with your favorite terminal and your favorite IDE/text editors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/">Docker Toolbox</a>
This is an old version for machines that don't meet the minimum requirements for Docker Desktop. It is not a native solution as it runs on VirtualBox, so we are forced to use the tools that the Toolbox comes packaged with, making everything more cumbersome and prone to errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main catch is that Docker Desktop is not easy to install on every system. While it is straightforward on macOS 10.13+ and Windows 10 Pro, the Windows 10 Home version needs extra attention.</p>
<p>Docker Desktop on Windows leverages Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's Type 1 hypervisor and only available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education. Fortunately, Windows Home supports <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (WSL), a Linux kernel developed by Microsoft that allows us to run Linux processes to run natively without emulation. Since March 2020, Docker Desktop supports WSL version 2 as a backend on Windows Home.</p>
<p>To install Docker Desktop on Windows Home we need to install WSL2 first, then install Docker Desktop specifying WSL2 as the backend during the installation process. we can find the whole process to install WSL2 <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">here</a> and the subsequent Docker Desktop installation process <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/">here</a>. If you would like to see a walkthrough video of the installation process, let me know and I will work on making one available.</p>
<p>Once installed, we can open our favorite terminal and check that the installation went smoothly by typing</p>
<pre><code>docker --version
</code></pre>
<p>If this returns something the likes of</p>
<pre><code>Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
</code></pre>
<p>we are good to go!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In case you are unable to make it work on your machine or if you don't want to install anything yet, Docker also offers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker">online playgrounds</a> to run your code and everything you find in this tutorial would work the same.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-run-our-first-container-">Let's run our first container!</h2>
<p>As we saw last week, to run a container we first need to find an image on the Docker registry. Like everything in the programming, Docker has a Hello World container that we can easily get from its Docker Hub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world">page</a>. As we can see on the website, the command we have to run is</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull hello-world
</code></pre>
<p>which will welcome us with an unsightly wall of output which looks like</p>
<pre><code>Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pulling fs layer
0e03bdcc26d7: Verifying Checksum
0e03bdcc26d7: Download complete
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:49a1c8800c94df04e9658809b006fd8a686cab8028d33cfba2cc049724254202
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
</code></pre>
<p>We can see a few things that we need to cover, namely <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>layers</strong>.</p>
<p>We can check all the images that we have in our machine simply by running <code>$ docker images</code> and inspecting its output:</p>
<pre><code>REPOSITORY       TAG        IMAGE ID        CREATED           SIZE
hello-world      latest     bf756fb1ae65    7 months ago      13.3kB
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we have a <code>hello-world</code> image tagged latest, with a unique image ID (yours may be different) and it weighs only 13.3KB! That is where the gold is! Running a similar basic job using a VM would entail installing an entire OS just to output "Hello world!".</p>
<p>The first column of the <code>docker images</code> output is called <strong>repository</strong>. If you have ever used Git or GitHub, the name might sound familiar. In a Docker Registry, a repository is a collection of different versions of images that share the same base name. Each of the versions is identified by a <strong>tag</strong>, but images can have multiple tags as well!</p>
<p>In general, Docker images follow the naming convention of <code>username/repository:tag</code>. As a quick example, let's suppose that I built an image called <code>mysimpleapp</code> and I shared version 1.0 on the Docker Hub. You could get that image by running</p>
<pre><code>$ docker pull antoniolofiego/mysimpleapplication:1.0
</code></pre>
<p>If we do not specify the tag portion, Docker will by default download the image that is tagged as <code>latest</code>. This is not a special tag, but just the one that Docker assigns by default to images when no other tags are specified at build time.</p>
<p>Now that we have the image locally, we want to run it, right? Surely enough, the command to run images is <code>$ docker run &lt;image&gt;</code>. There are mainly three ways to reference an image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By repository</strong>, but it works only if we have a single version of the image (ex: if I have two versions from the same repository, Docker will be confused about which I am referring to).</li>
<li><strong>By repository/tag combination</strong>, which solves the previous problem.</li>
<li><strong>By image ID</strong>, the preferred way, given that every image will always have a unique ID. Note, we can use just the first few characters from the ID and Docker will pick up the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the Image ID method, for our <code>hello-world</code> image example we will run</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run bf756
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image that runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
</code></pre>
<p>We have successfully pulled and run our first Docker Image! 🎉 Let's recap all we learned so far by visualizing a repository structure and all the ways to pull or run an image in a simple way</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596760605560/zssexvySE.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Repo structure"></p>
<p>We know how to pull and run simple images! We just scratched the Docker surface, however. Are you ready to go to the next level?</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/570/0*y8AuUHSoTGRqX40h.jpeg" alt="We need to go deeper!"></p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-a-docker-image">Breaking down a Docker Image</h2>
<p>We know from last week that a Docker Image starts as a Dockerfile, which is a recipe that Docker follows to package our application. It is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which specifies a command that Docker needs to run in sequential order.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a Dockerfile that deploys a simple Node.js Express server and try to understand how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download all the code from this example via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/antoniolofiego/hashnode-dockerseries-expressapp">this</a> GitHub repository.</p>
<p>The folder structure for this example is as follows</p>
<pre><code>📦docker-express-app
 ┣ 📂src
 ┃ ┗ 📜server.js
 ┣ 📜.gitignore
 ┣ 📜Dockerfile
 ┣ 📜package-lock.json
 ┗ 📜package.json
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, the Dockerfile sits at the root level of my project folder. Let's now look at its content.</p>
<pre><code>FROM node:11-alpine

RUN mkdir app

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go through each step one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>FROM node:11-alpine</code> tells Docker to download the Docker image for Node.js version 11 running on Linux Alpine, a very lightweight Linux distribution. This will be the base image used by our container.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN mkdir app</code> creates a local folder named <code>app</code> at the root of the environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>WORKDIR /app</code> changes the working directory for all subsequent commands to the <code>/app</code> folder that we created in step 2.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>COPY . .</code> tells Docker to copy all the files in the current folder on my machine (my <code>docker-express-app</code> folder) in the current directory of the Docker image (the <code>/app</code> directory).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>RUN npm install</code> installs all the dependencies that I specified in my <code>package.json</code> file, in this case only <code>express</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]</code> is the command that the container will run at instantiation time, in this case, the <code>start</code> script defined in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is to build the image. As you can imagine, we have a <code>docker build</code> command that does just that! The standard usage for the build command is</p>
<pre><code>docker build -t &lt;username/repository:tag&gt; &lt;path/to/Dockerfile&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that, when tagging an image, if we only provide a repository name Docker will assign the <code>latest</code> tag to the image by default. Let's take a look at the output.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build -t docker-express-app .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.013MB
Step 1/6 : FROM node:11-alpine

</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, each instruction is carefully followed. On each step, Docker creates a <strong>layer</strong>. Every image is built out of several read-only layers, with each layer corresponding to certain instructions in your Dockerfile. Each step builds …</p></div></div>

        <p>Writing good commit messages can save you a lot of time. In this blog post I
want to show you an example of that. At some point in the past I changed the
colours of the links on this blog from grey to blue, but where did I make
this change again? Commit messages to the rescue!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-07-10-good-commit-messages/img.png"></p>

<p>I was unable to recall where in the code I made the changes by browsing
through the files so I went over my commit history and… lo and behold.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.janmeppe.com/assets/2020-07-10-good-commit-messages/commit.png"></p>

<p>Thank you, past me, for writing these awesome commit messages!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-write-good-commit-messages">How to write good commit messages</h2>

<p>Writing good commit messages is a tricky thing and there are a
<a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/">lot</a> of
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/">different</a>
opinion on <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-message">this</a>.</p>

<p>What I like to do is follow a rule that I picked up somewhere. Sadly, I can’t
find the source for this but it has served me well. The rule is as follows. When you write a commit messages you think to yourself</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When applied, this commit will…</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here it is applied in action:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When applied this commit will <strong>makes links blue</strong></li>
  <li>When applied this commit will <strong>add logos and splash image</strong></li>
  <li>When applied this commit will <strong>add splash post, leetcode post, update tags</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I never thought that my commit habits would save me this much time, but here we are. To summarize, to write good commit messages simply think to yourself:</p>

  <p>August 14, 2020 | <span>7</span> Minute Read</p>
  
  <p>TLDR - Quite a lot!</p>

<p>I have reached my first goal with <a href="https://supportman.io/">Supportman</a> of $100 MRR (monthly recurring revenue)! I picked this number because at $100, <a href="https://supportman.io/">Supportman</a> would be profitable, as well as make enough money to pay for my wife and I’s weekly coffee dates.</p>

<p>I knew it would be tough to get my first paying customers, but I didn’t know it would be this hard! When you’re dreaming about starting a business, it can be difficult to forsee all the work and effort that will go into it. I wanted to share my experience so you could see an example of what it could take to reach $100 MRR.</p>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/jls5k3a7L1N0XRM9d0/giphy.gif" width="30%"></center>

<p>I started Supportman on January 1st, 2020. At that point, I started doing customer discovery and talking to people in the support industry.</p>

<p>I made the first commit for the project on March 27th and then I launched the product on June 12. It wasn’t until August 7th that I had reached $100 MRR.</p>

<p>So it took a little over three months to create the MVP. And it took just about two months to reach $100 MRR after launch. It took 7.5 months in total.</p>

<p>That’s a long time! Or at least it feels longer than what I was expecting. $100 really isn’t that much, but it definitely is a start!</p>

<p>I should also mention that I have been working on Supportman on the side while maintaining my full-time job. I probably spend somewhere from 10 to 20 hours per week, but that can vary some from week to week.</p>

<p>Remember, not every founder has the same experience and yours will most likely be different. Some markets are faster to get going and it will definitely vary widely depending on if you are doing B2B or consumer.</p>

<h3 id="selling-to-customers-and-building-rapport">Selling To Customers and Building Rapport</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/6o0jq0G2tfv7W/giphy.gif" width="40%"></center>

<p>Like most software developers, this is my least favorite part - selling to potential customers. I did quite a lot of direct sales.</p>

<p>It takes so much time to find potential customers, research them on LinkedIn, find their email address, and then message them a handcrafted, personal email.</p>

<p>One of the ways that I found lots of my potential customers was by being in customer support slack communities. I DM’ed quite a few people in these groups.</p>

<p>Overall I probably private messaged/emailed around 120 potential customers. Some of those ended up being helpful conversations to learn more and some just flat out said no. Of course, the large majority didn’t reply at all.</p>

<p>Out of all of that grueling time-consuming work, only one of my current paying customers came from a cold slack DM.</p>

<p>I knew sales would be hard but I didn’t know it would be this hard!</p>

<p>I think the other part of the pie in sales is building rapport. If I am a person that people trust in the customer support community, they are going to be more willing to chat with me.</p>

<p>I can see how entrepreneurs who have grown a big audience or network in their industry would really have an upper hand here. They could get off to a much quicker start.</p>

<p>On the other hand - I am starting my customer support relationships from zero. And it is a lot of work! I was able to start with some of the companies that I did customer discovery with but none of them ended up converting to paid customers.</p>

<p>I have a lot more work to do in regards to building rapport and I have some ideas to do this in the future. I think the bottom line is, be helpful to the communities your customers are in and you will start to be seen as an expert in the space.</p>

<h3 id="intercom-app-store">Intercom App Store</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/IffZTS1F0nR0T7PMgd/giphy.gif" width="40%"></center>

<p>The <a href="https://www.intercom.com/app-store">Intercom app store</a> was what I had hoped would be my main distribution channel. This was one of my reasons for wanting to create a <a href="https://noahbragg.com/blog/why-im-building-a-side-dish/">Side Dish</a>. I had hoped that I could build an app on a platform and that platform could bring me most of my leads.</p>

<p>So far this hasn’t really been the case. I have probably been getting about two sign ups a week from Intercom. And that is even with Supportman getting into the Intercom <a href="https://www.intercom.com/app-store/?category=new-and-noteworthy">New and Noteworthy</a> category. This is a category that shows Supportman on the front page of the app store!</p>

<p>There could be other problems causing this. It could mean that the problem I am solving or how I am showing it in my listing isn’t resonating with Intercom companies. Another problem is that it’s really hard to tell how many people are coming across my listing since Intercom doesn’t have any analytics.</p>

<p>So that being said, there is still a lot of work for me to do to figure the Intercom app store out and optimize it to help me find customers.</p>

<h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YAGcqpFNT5DXO/giphy.gif" width="50%"></center>

<p>So, where did my first customers come from then? As I mentioned already, one was from cold messaging. The other three came from Twitter!</p>

<p>I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/supportmanHQ">Supportman Twitter account</a> and started tweeting updates that I had made to the app. I also tried to create some value for Intercom customers by writing a couple of <a href="https://supportman.io/blog">how to blog posts</a>.</p>

<p>Every time that I made a new tweet, I would mention Intercom. A couple of these they liked and a couple of them they retweeted. Intercom customers saw the tweets and checked out Supportman.</p>

<p>This was great! There is definitely more I can do on Twitter to help push engagement and ultimately push users to Supportman. But again, creating valuable content takes time.</p>

<h3 id="building-more-features">Building More Features</h3>

<center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hrRJ41JB2zlgZiYcCw/giphy.gif" width="40%"></center>

<p>I started Supportman out as a pretty basic MVP. It was very minimal. It could just send Intercom conversation ratings to a Slack channel and a weekly report of the metrics support teams care about. I thought this was all I would need to get started but I was only partially right. Some of my customers just wanted those features, but just about everyone started to ask for more.</p>

<p>They also wanted more preferences around the features I had already created. I pretty quickly learned that I needed to make these changes and add them to get my first paying customers.</p>

<p>It looked something like this… a customer would ask for something to be added and then I would do it and have it ready for them a day later. This allowed me to blow them away by my fast response times which helped convert them to paying customers.</p>

<p>That being said, I had to build more features and update my existing MVP more than I would have expected in the beginning. This is all good though since it is helping to make my product even better and push it in the right direction.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>You can probably already tell the conclusion and theme that I am pushing in this post. Building a SaaS business takes a lot of time and it is really hard to get to even something as little as $100 MRR! It was a lot harder than I expected.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I am excited that I have made it this far and feel like there is hope for Supportman in the future.</p>

<p>Just getting one paying customer is a pretty big deal because it means you have created something valuable for someone else.</p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you a glimpse of what it could take for you to reach this milestone as well!</p>

<h3 id="support">Support</h3>

<p>I hope this was helpful in some way. If you liked it, sharing the thread on Twitter is really appreciated!</p>

<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>
<!-- more-->



<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>emptyLike</span><span>(</span><span>val</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>val</span> <span>===</span> <span>"number"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>

<p>This post will teach you <strong>how to see HTTPS in-action</strong>, but not every detail of how HTTPS works. Instead, you’ll gain a <strong>real life example</strong> to reference if you ever want to study the nitty gritty details.</p>

<p>To do this, we’ll learn how to <strong>snoop on our own HTTPS requests via Wireshark</strong> and witness as your computer establishes a secure connection.</p>

<p>Although the nitty gritty details of HTTPS are outside the scope of this post, we’ll <strong>review the basics</strong> before embarking on this exercise to provide a bit of context.</p>

<p>If you’re already familiar with the basics of HTTPS and TLS, feel free to skip to the <a href="#how-to-snoop-on-your-own-requests">next section</a>.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-https">What is HTTPS?</h2>

<p>HTTP stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>. And at the very least, you likely know that whenever you see <code>https://</code> in the address bar, the <strong>S</strong> in <strong>HTTPS</strong> stands for <strong>secure</strong>: ensuring that communication between your browser and the server is secure.</p>

<p>But how does HTTPS secure communication between you and the server? Your browser will perform a <strong>TLS handshake</strong> before sending any sensitive data.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-tls-handshake">What is a TLS Handshake?</h2>

<p>At the beginning of any <code>https://</code> request, your browser performs a TLS handshake: a protocol that ensures <strong>confidentiality</strong>, <strong>authentication</strong>, and <strong>integrity</strong> between your computer and the server it talks to.</p>

<p>Today, we’ll focus on confidentiality which promises to <strong>keep your data secret</strong> from snoopers by encrypting your request. To achieve confidentiality, your computer and the server perform a TLS handshake to negotiate the <strong>master secret</strong> used to derive keys that encrypt and decrypt messages sent between each other.</p>

<p>During this exercise, we’ll capture the “secret sauce” used to establish the master secret in order to decrypt our requests!</p>



<h2 id="capture-an-encrypted-request">Capture an Encrypted Request</h2>

<p>Now that we understand the basics of HTTPS and TLS, let’s see it in-action. To do so, we’ll snoop on our own HTTPS request. First, let’s capture a plain ol’ HTTPS request without any clever tricks yet:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the latest version of <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>*</li>
  <li>Install and boot up <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a></li>
  <li>Type <code>curl https://github.com</code> in the console (but don’t press enter yet!).</li>
  <li>Start a capture via Wireshark</li>
  <li>Execute our <code>curl</code> command</li>
  <li>Stop the capture</li>
</ol>

<p><em>*NOTE: Since v7.58.0, curl accepts a filename specified by the environment variable <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code>: this file logs secrets established during the TLS handshake. These logged secrets let us retroactively decrypt our HTTPS request in the next step– so be sure to install curl &gt;= v7.58.0. Be aware that curl installations may contain varying TLS libraries, and only some libraries support it. For example, MacOS’ default curl installation uses Apple’s Secure Transport library which does not support this flag– so you may need to <code>brew install curl-openssl</code> and rewire your path to prefer it.</em></p>

<p>Now that we captured the request via Wireshark, let’s inspect the relevant packets:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Type <code>tls.handshake</code> in Wireshark filter bar and press enter</li>
  <li>Locate packet labelled <code>Client Hello</code> in the <code>Info</code> field</li>
  <li>Copy IP address from the packet’s <code>Destination</code> field</li>
  <li>Type <code>ip.dst == foobar || ip.src == foobar</code> in Wireshark filter bar (where <code>foobar</code> is the IP address from previous step)*</li>
</ol>

<p><em>*NOTE: Wireshark captures any and all network traffic which produces a lot of noise in our capture. To reduce noise, we filter packets exclusively to and from the server we just curl’d.</em></p>

<p>With our packets filtered, let’s take a peak at the <code>Client Hello</code> packet:</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/client_hello.png" alt="client hello readable"></p>

<p><em>The contents of this Client Hello packet can be read clear as day.</em></p>

<p>This “Client Hello” packet is the first step of the TLS handshake. You may notice it’s readable while every packet afterwards is encrypted. Why?</p>

<p>One of the main selling points of HTTPS (and the underlying TLS handshake) is that it <strong>encrypts traffic so onlookers can’t snoop on data</strong> sent between your computer and the server. Unfortunately, that even includes <em>you</em> snooping on your own requests via Wireshark!</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/encrypted.png" alt="encrypted"></p>

<p><em>From this point on, TLS encrypts all data sent and received.</em></p>

<p>Perhaps you want to see the remaining traffic, decrypted and readable, for educational purposes. Hell, it’s your computer after all. This is indeed possible, and it’s only a quick 5 minute configuration away.</p>

<h2 id="capture-a-decrypted-request">Capture a Decrypted Request</h2>

<p>To do this, we must convince curl’s underlying TLS library to dump valuable secrets established during the handshake to decrypt the data. Repeat the initial steps from the <a href="#capture-an-encrypted-request">Capture an Encrypted Request</a> section but replace the <code>curl https://github.com</code> command with this:</p>

<p>Windows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>cmd /c "set SSLKEYLOGFILE=%HOMEPATH%\sslkeylog&amp;&amp; curl https://github.com"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unix:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>SSLKEYLOGFILE=~/sslkeylog curl https://github.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>NOTE: Notice we temporarily set <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code> for this one-off command. It’s not wise to set this variable permanently because someone could retroactively decrypt your traffic using this file. While you likely have bigger problems if someone has unauthorized access to your files, it’s best not to leave any trace regardless.</em></p>

<p>If you crack open that SSL key log file we just specified, you’ll see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SERVER_HANDSHAKE_TRAFFIC_SECRET 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
EXPORTER_SECRET 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
SERVER_TRAFFIC_SECRET_0 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
CLIENT_HANDSHAKE_TRAFFIC_SECRET 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
CLIENT_TRAFFIC_SECRET_0 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can essentially think of this data as the “secret sauce” used to negotiate our secure connection: this is exactly what Wireshark needs to decrypt our request!</p>

<p>With Wireshark containing the capture of our last <code>curl</code> request, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Protocols &gt; TLS</li>
  <li>Click “Browse” next to (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename</li>
  <li>Select and confirm the <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code> location</li>
  <li>Press “OK”</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at that previously encrypted packet:</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/decrypted.png" alt="decrypted"></p>

<p><em>This previously encrypted packet is now decrypted and readable.</em></p>

<p>Voila! What was once labeled “Encrypted Application Data” is now readable– and we can see that this packet sent over additional TLS extension data.</p>

<p>Peaking even further in our capture, we can find the actual HTML response to our curl request!</p>

<p><img src="https://bitwiser.dev/public/imgs/html_response.png" alt="html response"></p>

<p><em>The HTML response to our curl request.</em></p>

<p>And there you have it. With this neat trick, you can capture and study the steps of the TLS handshake– or even just see the inner workings of an HTTPS request that your browser dev tools abstracts away from you.</p>

<p>Happy snooping! 🕵️</p>



<h2 id="curl-vs-browser">curl vs. Browser</h2>

<p>Why fire a request using curl instead of the browser? The simple answer is that curl produces less noise in your Wireshark capture.</p>

<p>When you request a URL via the browser, it scans the response and fires <strong>many more requests</strong> to fetch images, scripts, etc. defined in the HTML.</p>

<p>When you request a URL via curl, it fires a single request and returns the raw HTML: it does not subsequently request other resources defined in the HTML like your browser does.</p>

<p>Thus, the Wireshark capture is shorter and sweeter.</p>



<p>Why capture our request via Wireshark instead of just using our browser’s dev tools (which automatically decrypts the data for us)?</p>

<p>For 99.9% of web development, browser dev tools does the job because we mainly work on the level of HTTPS and above.</p>

<p>Though if you want to learn about the abstractions below HTTPS, Wireshark lets you see all the nitty gritty details that browser dev tools normally abstracts away from you– as it should, because it’s a lot of noise you often don’t need to worry about!</p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bash is a language that is quite useful for automation no matter what language you write in. Bash can do so many powerful system-level tasks. Even if you are on windows these days you are likely to come across bash inside a cloud VM, Continuous Integration, or even inside of docker.</p>
<p>I have three techniques that help me write more composable bash scripts.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#functions">functions</a></li>
<li><a href="#arguments">Arguments</a></li>
<li><a href="#positional-arguments">positional arguments</a></li>
<li><a href="#all-arguments">All Arguments</a></li>
<li><a href="#error-handling">Error Handling</a></li>
<li><a href="#main-script">main script</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p><em>Break scripts down into reusable components</em></p>
<p>Functions in bash are quite simple. They are something that I wish I would have started using long ago. They make your code much more reusable. I often use them in my aliases as well since they can simplify the process and allow more flexibility.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>syntax</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>hello_world</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"hello world"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Source the file to load the function and run it from the terminal.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>run it</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello_world
hello_world</code></pre></div>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>outputs</em></p>

<hr>
<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p><em>Make functions a little more flexible</em></p>
<p>Arguments and options are quite a bit more complex in bash. For now, we will focus on the basics which are not all that bad.</p>
<h3>positional arguments</h3>
<p><em>easiest and most common to use</em></p>
<p>Positional arguments can be pulled out quite easily using <code>$1</code> for the first one, <code>$2</code> for the second, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong> <code>$0</code> is the command that was called. You will see this often used to find the command called to open up your current shell.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>syntax</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>hello</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"hello <span>$1</span>"</span></code></pre></div>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>run it</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello
hello Waylon</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have a function that accepts positional arguments and we can call it by passing things into it.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>outputs</em></p>

<p>More than one argument would be ignored since we are only looking at <code>$1</code>.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>run it</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello
hello Waylon Walker</code></pre></div>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>outputs</em></p>

<p>Just the same as before since we do not use the second argument.</p>
<h3>All Arguments</h3>
<p>Bash has another special variable <code>$@</code> that stores <strong>all arguments</strong> in one.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>syntax</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>hello</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"hello <span>$@</span>"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Just the same as before.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>run it</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>source</span> hello
hello Waylon Walker</code></pre></div>
<p>Now the function will output all arguments that are passed into it since we are using the <code>$@</code> variable.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>outputs</em></p>

<hr>
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p><em>Super powers in a single line</em></p>
<p>The easiest and most common way to handle an error in bash is through the use of the logical operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (and) and <code>||</code> (or).</p>
<p>Here I have a concrete example from earlier today. I was creating a bash script to run a python script from cron. The bash script is there to make sure that we have the python environment, activate it, and run. If it doesn't have it, it should create it.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
<span>create_env</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    conda create -n <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span> <span>python</span><span>=</span><span>3.8</span>
    conda activate <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span>
    pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt
<span>}</span>



<span>env_exists</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
conda info --envs <span>|</span> <span>awk</span> <span>'{print <span>$1</span>}'</span> <span>|</span> <span>tail</span> -n +3 <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> -w <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/null
<span>}</span>


<span></span><span><span>create_if</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><span>env_exists <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"environment exists"</span> <span>||</span> create_env <span>"<span>$1</span>"</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span></span>create_if my_env</code></pre></div>
<p>If we look at the <code>create_if</code> function, it will check if the environment exists if there is a passing status code <code>0</code>, then it will run <code>echo "environment exists"</code> otherwise it will run <code>create_env $1</code>.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong> Inside of <code>env_exists</code> grep will look for whole words if there is a match it will give a status code 0 if it finds a match and not 0 if there is no match.</p>
<hr>
<h2>main script</h2>
<p>_<code>if __name__ == " __main__"</code>_</p>
<p>The last thing I want to discuss is making a bash script both runnable and sourceable. This makes it so that you can <code>source filename.sh</code> and run each function individually, or <code>bash filename.sh</code> to run the script. This is a similar concept to <code>if __name__ == " __main__"</code> from python.</p>
<p>I did try this from bash and zsh with success. The following is an example that would pass all arguments into a main function.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>syntax</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>"<span>${<span>BASH_SOURCE</span><span>[</span>0<span>]</span>}</span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"<span>${0}</span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    main <span>"<span>$@</span>"</span>
<span>fi</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Extending the example above that created a python example if necessary we can create the env if necessary, activate the environment, and run the script.</p>
<p><em><small></small><mark></mark>syntax</em></p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>"<span>${<span>BASH_SOURCE</span><span>[</span>0<span>]</span>}</span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"<span>${0}</span>"</span> <span>]</span><span>]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
create_if my_env
conda activate my_env
python script.py
<span>fi</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using this syntax to run our "main" functions will allow us to both runs the script or source the script to utilize the functions that we created.</p></div><p>If you found value in this post <br>and want to send a tip.</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597246382317/_1gWA2FZu.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text">

<p>There are some essential points you should clarify before accepting a job offer. It is easy to miss them at the moment and take a job offer straight away. </p>
<p>As a result, in this article, I want to talk about some questions you should ask before accepting the offer. I suggest you make a small checklist because you might forget them in the interview.</p>
<p>Thus, the questions you could ask are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the company claiming ownership if I release a side project?</li>
<li>Does the company have a clear progression path? </li>
<li>Does the company offer me a mentor?</li>
<li>Is the company allowing me to contribute to open source projects? </li>
</ol>

<p>The first question you might want to ask is "<strong>is the company claiming ownership if I release free/paid side projects?</strong>". There are many examples where companies claimed ownership of the employee's projects. That can happen even if you build the project in your free time and on your equipment.</p>
<p>Therefore, you do not want to invest your resources and time to have a company "take" your project away. Moreover, you can even have legal disputes, which is even worse.</p>
<p>As a result, before accepting a job offer, ensure that the company does not claim ownership of your projects. </p>

<p>Another important question is "<strong>do you have a clear progression path?</strong>". It is essential to know if you can progress in the company and what support is available for you.</p>
<p>The years of experience do not matter too much. The reason is that you can do a job for a long time without getting better at it. You have to try to improve actively.</p>
<p>As a result, your progress can stagnate. That means you do not improve as a developer and a person, and it is going to be difficult for you to find another job. Believe me; you do not want that to happen. Thus, ask the company how they support their employees to improve as developers and persons.</p>

<p>If the opportunity of contributing to an open-source project arises, can you do it? This is another point you want to clarify with your prospective employers.</p>
<p>Contributing to open-source projects is an excellent way of getting out a rut, and improve your programming skills. As long as the projects do not clash with the company, they should allow you to contribute to open-source projects. And of course, as long as you do it in your free time.</p>
<p>In conclusion, do not forget to ask your prospective employer if they allow you to contribute to OSS.</p>

<p>Having a mentor is super beneficial for you. Especially at the beginning of your career. Being able to go to someone when you struggle to give you a hand is instrumental. However, do not confuse a mentor with a person that should spoon-feed you.</p>
<p>The mentors should be there to give you pointers and guide you. A mentor is not a person that solves your problems. However, if mentoring is available and done right, it is beneficial for both persons.</p>
<p>In conclusion, make sure the company is offering you mentorship. Proper mentorship helps you develop faster.</p>

<p>The questions from the article are not exhaustive, and you can add more questions. In fact, I would like to hear and discover more questions. You can never be too careful with contracts.</p>
<p>Until then, do not forget to ask about the:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ownership of you side projects</strong></li>
<li><strong>progression paths</strong></li>
<li><strong>mentorship</strong></li>
<li><strong>contributing to OSS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I hope the article helps you understand what should you clarify before accepting a job offer!</p>

<p>Just-In-Time learning means you learn a thing because you need to know it right then. Just-In-Case learning means you learn a thing because it may come in handy at some point in your life. This separation is <a href="https://hackernoon.com/just-in-case-vs-just-in-time-learning-c87f61d24360">already well documented</a>, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_learning">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>



<p>It gets more interesting when you combine it with <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/expiring-vs-permanent-skills/">expiring skills vs. permanent skills</a>. Expiring skills will eventually stop being useful, and permanent skills will be just as useful decades from now as they are today. Permanent skills compound over time, and expiring skills don’t. So if you learn an expiring skill, and don’t end up using it right away, then it’s only a matter of time until that skill is irrelevant, and all your time spent learning it was wasted. </p>



<p>If you know a skill is going to eventually expire, then you should only learn it if you’re sure you can use it. <em>Expiring skills should only be learned Just-In-Time, but permanent skills are worthwhile to learn Just-In-Case</em>. But the tricky and somewhat disappointing bit is that the only skills we can consider permanent are soft skills – things like attitude, discipline, charisma. Hard skills like Typescript and Kubernetes will eventually be obsolete, so learning them Just-In-Case is a waste of time.</p>



<p>But then how can I ever become a well rounded technologist, you ask? You work really freaking hard to get on projects with technology you haven’t used before. If you get an opportunity to hop onto a project using some tech that’s new to you, then do it. </p>



<p>When someone asks for some help with a build system you’ve never used before, raise your hand. When a project needs realtime streaming data and you have no idea how to do it, raise your hand. When a client gets excited about creating an Alexa skill, raise your hand. </p>



<p>Raising your hand gets you the best of both worlds. You get to become a well rounded technologist <em>and</em> avoid wasting your time learning technology you won’t ever use.</p>



<p>So raise your hand to learn the hard skills when they’re needed, and spend your Just-In-Case learning on the stuff that will stick around. Put down the Python book (unless you’re working on a Python project) and pick up the book on habit forming, or dealing with difficult people, or taking ownership. That’s the stuff that will compound for the rest of your life.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>I'm a highly opinionated developer. I've been doing it a little while, and worked with a few other developers, and this is a pet peeve of mine. The <code>this</code> keyword, at least in C#, is oft misused and abused. From henceforth, the context of this post is C# development.</p>
<p>This post seems to have caused a bit of controversy. More to my point, even in base Visual Studio, there are warnings to remove <code>this</code> from your code:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9F6Lyx8.png" alt="visual studio 2019"></p>
<p>I've had managers want developers to use <code>this</code> to signify calling a base class's method, which is incorrect. You should be using <code>base</code>.</p>
<pre><code>public class MyClass : YourClass {
    public void MyMethod() {
        if(!base.YourMethod()) return;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>I've had coworkers who would put <code>this</code> before every method call, because...? When calling your own method, in your own class, that inherits/implements no other classes, why on earth would you decorate your own method call with <code>this</code>?</p>
<p>The only time I have seen prepending <code>this</code> to anything as <em>kind of</em> acceptable, is when you have parameters in a method that are the same as fields/properties on your class, and you need to access those fields/properties inside said method. I am still not a fan of this, but the closest I will get to accepting it is in a constructor where you are passing values that will be stored as <strong>private</strong> fields.</p>
<pre><code>public class SomeClass {
    int maxAmount;
    SomeClass(int maxAmount) =&gt; this.maxAmount = maxAmount;
    ValidateMe(int someValue) =&gt; someValue &lt;= maxAmount;
}</code></pre>
<p>But even in this case, you should really be using Pascal casing as per <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions">Microsoft's Capitalization Conventions</a>. I know, capitalization conventions change over time, and I could have <strong>sworn</strong> there was a time when camel casing was the recommended approach for fields (specifically private fields), but times they are a changing, and cleaner code will hopefully prevail, especially cleaner code without the misuse/abuse of <code>this</code>.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm the only one this matters for, or maybe I'm just having a bad day and came across <code>this</code> too many times this morning. I do hope you agree though.</p>

In this workshop, Christoph Hegemann will show you that none of that is true, and type checking can be understood by everyone from first principles. To do so, we'll implement a type checker (with inference) for a small functional programming language in Kotlin. After familiarizing ourselves with our language for a few minutes, we'll dive right into ...</p></div></div>

So, now we’re all stuck inside, working on our next platinum indie game, why don’t we try it out?

In this talk, we’ll look at some of the techniques used in procedural generation, discuss how they translate to Haskell, and put it all together in time for our next best-seller.

Full Presentation Description

The very essence of functional programming relies on a fairly simple premise: write side-effectless programs, so that you can reason about them equationally. Side-effects however are predominant in every program that . . . well, does something useful. In light of this, the modelling of effects in functional programs has become a fairly active domain of study. ...</p></div></div>

<p>This opportunity to build an online community from the ground up gave me the excuse to really study what it means to build community (both online and offline) and validate a lot of my own assumptions.</p>
<p>And tl;dr: I’m all in on <a href="https://jayclouse.com/circle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circle</a>, and I’ll explain why below.</p>
<p>But before I can share all the lessons learned, we need to start from the beginning.</p>

<h2>What is community?<span></span></h2>
<p>Community means a lot of different things to different people. To me, community is a group of people with commonality – shared interests, values, or beliefs.</p>
<p>With Startup Weekend, we all shared an interest in technology, but we also shared values like ambition, kindness, and generosity too.</p>
<p>At any given Startup Weekend event, I knew I’d leave with some new, lifelong friendships. And the connection I felt with other people at a Startup Weekend is what made that community so special.</p>
<p>In fact, connection is what makes <em>any </em>community special.</p>
<p>I believe people are drawn to community for three core reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human connection</li>
<li>Transformation</li>
<li>Finding a sense of identity</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s break each of those down.</p>
<h3>Human connection</h3>
<p>The experience of community goes back to the beginning of humans. We’re a social species and we relied on cooperation to survive.</p>
<p>Community was built into our lives when we lived in a tribal setting. Our community was the people we lived around day in and day out – the people we hunted and gathered with!</p>
<p>We felt that we <strong>belonged </strong>to that tribe. And there’s a lot of comfort in belonging.</p>
<p>As civilization evolved, humans became more socially isolated. Forget about living in tribes – we want to move out of our parents’ house and into our own studio apartments as quickly as we can!</p>
<p>But our brains haven’t actually evolved past that desire for close social connections – our lifestyle has. Our cultural expectations have.</p>
<p>And so we seek out that missing human, social connection elsewhere. We seek out that sense of belonging that we’re missing.</p>
<p>We seek out community.</p>
<h4>Connection through shared experience</h4>
<p>Often, one of the easiest ways to find connection is through shared experience. When we share an experience together, whether it’s a tailgate, an escape room, or starting at a new school, we start from a known commonality.</p>
<p>Commonalities give humans something to talk about and bond over. It’s that shared experience that starts conversation, creates a relationship, and ultimately makes us feel connected to one another.</p>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>We also look to other humans to help us grow.</p>
<p>And when we’re looking to make a change, there are communities there to help.</p>
<p>A great example here is the Crossfit or any fitness-based community. When you join a fitness community, you’re seeking very tangible, physical transformation.</p>
<p>Physical transformations (gaining muscle, losing weight) are easy to recognize in ourselves. We seek out psychological and knowledge transformations too – though they may be a little little harder to recognize.</p>
<p>But when you join a coding bootcamp and leave being able to build a web app, you see the transformation.</p>

<h3>A sense of identity</h3>
<p>Most of us are in a constant battle to understand ourselves. With social media and comparison traps around us all the time, a lot of us have a hard time really knowing who we are and what we care about.</p>
<p>When you ask someone to introduce themselves, they’ll probably launch right into their work. “I’m [position] at [company].”</p>
<p>Our work shouldn’t define our identity – but it gives us something to tether ourselves to when we don’t have a better sense of who we are.</p>
<p>Community provides an alternative.</p>
<p>When someone joins a community, connects with others or experiences transformation, they learn something about themselves. They learn more about their own interests, and those interests may be stronger than their day-to-day work.</p>
<p>That’s why we see so many people identify with Crossfit or Yoga or even volunteering for a nonprofit.</p>

<h4>Finding identity in a movement</h4>
<p>Sometimes, community offers us the opportunity to identify with an idea bigger than ourselves. These communities go beyond shared values and actually call their community members to action.</p>
<p>These communities become a movement. People join a movement because they want to see change, and every member of the community powering a movement has the same shared goal.</p>
<p>When we are part of a movement, we feel that same belonging and connection of other communities, but may even begin to identify with that movement.</p>
<p>And, of course, the best movements exist to create change (transformation) too.</p>
<p>So, any way you slice it, the most thriving communities help us find connection, facilitate transformation, or help us to better understand ourselves and our identity.</p>
<h2>Building community in real life<span></span></h2>
<p>We’ve been part of communities throughout our whole lives. Your graduating class, the clubs you joined in high school or college, your college dorm, local meetup groups…</p>
<p>Any group that you’ve belonged to through shared interests or shared experience is, on some level, a community.</p>
<p>A graduating class is a social cohort with a shared goal: complete your courses, graduate on time. You have the shared experience of joining that cohort at the same time, and you’re pursuing the same transformation: becoming a graduate.</p>
<p>Meetup groups are built around shared interests like painting, anime, yoga, or anything else. We go to these meetups because we feel like we belong there.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten <em>really good </em>at creating in person, analog communities – we’ve had all of evolutionary history to figure it out!</p>
<p>As long as we have a reason for gathering people into a common space, it’s easy to convey that reason and create a sense of belonging.</p>

<p>But analog community is much easier than digital community, because <strong>physical space creates discomfort</strong>. When we show up to a space and may not immediately recognize anyone, we’re filled with equal parts fear and excitement.</p>
<p>We’re afraid to be alone. We’re afraid that the group will decide that we don’t belong. But at the same time, we’re eager for connection.</p>
<p>And that discomfort creates a healthy tension that we often solve by walking up to someone, extending our hand, and saying, “Hi, I’m Jay.”</p>
<p>That’s the magic of physical space. If we show up, we will usually push through the discomfort of feeling like we don’t belong until we feel like we do.</p>
<p>After all, it’s equally embarrassing to walk right back out the door in front of everyone. People who we may see again in our local community!</p>
<p>And in great communities, existing members will notice anyone feeling that discomfort and welcome them in.</p>
<h2><span id="why-many-online-communities-fail"></span>Why many online communities fail<span></span></h2>
<p>On its face, it seems like it should be easy to translate analog communities into digital communities. And even better, because they’re digital, they can scale! You don’t <em>need </em>to be in the same city to connect over your shared love of <em>Hamilton</em>.</p>
<p>But, very quickly, most online communities fall flat.</p>
<h3>The wrong motivation for building your online community</h3>
<p>Many online communities are started purely for selfish reasons. The creator thinks of it as purely an effort to build their audience.</p>
<p><em>If I create a community, it will self-govern, people will invite others in, and my brand will be at the center of their universe.</em></p>
<p>When creators follow <em>this </em>logic – when the online community is built to serve the creator – it’s doomed from the start.</p>
<p>Community has to be about serving people. If you aren’t serving people – if people aren’t finding connection, transformation, or identity within the space – then it will fail.</p>
<p>And any community managers will tell you, fostering online community is a LOT of time and a LOT of work.</p>
<p>If you aren’t planning to dedicate a huge amount of time and resources from the beginning…if you believe that the community will be so emergent that it will self-govern and thrive from day one, you’re wasting your time.</p>
<h3>Lack of intention in building your online community</h3>
<p>In the analog world, if we have a reason for gathering and a space to gather in, the hardest part is just bringing people into that space.</p>
<p>Because as I shared before, the discomfort of feeling like an outsider in a physical space will propel us into connecting with people until we no longer feel like an outsider.</p>
<p>So in the world of online communities, we overestimate the power of the platform. Tools like Discord, Discourse, Slack, Mighty Networks, and Facebook Groups all promise to give you the ROOM to gather your online community.</p>
<p>So creators pick their favorite tool and create an account.</p>
<p>Sometimes the creators of these communities do a really good job of configuring that digital space with specific channels and spaces for specific causes too.</p>
<p>In theory, that’s great! Of course a thriving online community would utilize all of these specific spaces so that they could have even more confidence that <em>this </em>area is …</p></div></div>

I imagine his job involves identifying and investing in the companies of tomorrow, but I know him for the pithy wisdom he puts out weekly.&nbsp;</p><p>As expected, he writes about finance and investing. What’s unexpected is that a lot of the lessons that you can learn aren’t confined to just that field. There’s history, psychology, business, and pretty much anything you can apply to your own life.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve went back in time to dig up his articles since his days as a columnist and put them into categories. You’ll find that they overlap, which is another sign that Morgan draws from multiple disciplines in his writing.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want more, check out his latest book,&nbsp;<a href="https://geni.us/KJixVU" target="_blank">The Psychology of Money.</a>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="004196a" data-element_type="section"></section><section data-id="c88a5d7" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="36df759" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="3f776d8" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h2>Many Powerful Ideas Are Simple</h2><p>Morgan’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/21/simple-financial-advice-for-new-grads.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lesson for newcomers</a>&nbsp;to finance that’s applicable to everything else:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Simple almost always beats complex. That’s true for investing, mortgages, insurance, and everything else related to money. If there’s one thing I wish I knew when I graduated, it’s that.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Simple rules triumph in a complex world. <a href="http://constantrenewal.com/boninis-paradox">Bonini’s Paradox</a> states that the more complete a model of a complex system, the less understandable it becomes. Morgan provides one more reason why we shouldn’t pursue complexity: you’re going to make mistakes:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">If you’re going to act on a problem that is monstrously complex and uncertain, the stripped-down, rules-of-thumb response is not only good enough. It can be superior to tripping over yourself in pursuit of something that appears marginally more accurate.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Complexity can also be misleading:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>The U.S. constitution is 7,591 words. A typical business management book covering a single topic is perhaps 250 pages, or something like 65,000 words. […]<br></em><em><br></em><em>Complexity gives a comforting impression of control, while simplicity is hard to distinguish from cluelessness. In most fields a handful of variables dictate the majority of outcomes. But only paying attention to those few variables can feel like you’re leaving too much of the outcome to fate. The more knobs you can fiddle with – the 100-tab spreadsheet, or the Big Data analysis – the more control you feel you have over the situation, if only because the impression of knowledge increases.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>There’s a simple idea in investing. If you want to know what stock to buy, look at Main Street instead of Wall Street. The power of taking this simple idea seriously might surprise you:&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><span>J.M. Smucker makes jelly and instant coffee. Its stock is up 1,211% since 1995. Microsoft changed how almost every human on the planet processes information. Its stock is up less, 1,183% since 1995. McCormick makes garlic powder. Its stock is up 1,423% since 1995. Oracle has a near-monopoly database management software. Its stock is up 1,419% since 1995. V.F. Corp makes jeans and flip-flops. Its stock is up 1,444% since 1995. Cisco Systems connects the entire world together in one place. Its stock is up 1,018% since 1995. Valspar makes industrial coatings, and has returned 1,521% since 1995. Adobe makes some of the most popular software in the world, and has returned 1,230%. Google is one of the most exciting companies of all time. Its stock is up 345% since 2008. Altria makes cigarettes in the rapidly declining U.S. market. Its stock is up 494% since 2008.</span></p><p>The best-performing industry over the last 50 years, by far, is consumer staples – things like food, toothpaste, and toilet paper. The worst-performing industry, by far, is technology.</p></blockquote><p><span>Granted, this was in 2016, and technology stocks have since soared. But it’s amazing how such a simple idea has served as a reliable guide for investors who have decided to pick their own stocks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And among the simple ideas shared by Morgan, this is my favourite. Nothing comes close to this mix of prose and math:&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p>What if Buffett got serious about investing when he was age 22 – just out of college – instead of age 10? Imagine he spends his 20s learning about investments, and his net worth at age 30 was in the still-impressive 90th percentile. Using today’s net worth percentiles and adjusting them for 1960s-era inflation, that would mean he’d be worth about $24,000 at age 30. Now we can do some fun calculations. If, at age 30, Buffett was worth $24,000 instead of the $1 million he actually accumulated, and went on to earn the same returns, how much would he be worth today? $1.9 billion. That’s 97.6% lower than his actual net worth of $81 billion.</p><p>The punchline is that 97.6% of Buffett’s current success can be directly tied to the base he built in his teens and 20s. Like World War II-era stuff. $1.9 billion is nothing sneeze at. But you’d need twice as much to make Bloomberg’s list of 500 richest people in the world. Which is to say: Without the capital base Buffett built before he could grow a beard, you’d probably never have heard of him.</p><p>[…] It is so easy to overlook how powerful it can be to take something small and hammer away at it, year after year, without stopping. Because it’s easy to overlook, we miss the key ingredients of what caused big things to get big. How can most of Buffett’s success be attributed to what he did as a teenager? It’s so crazy, so counterintuitive. And since it’s crazy and counterintuitive we overlook the right lessons. So we write 2,000 books on how Buffett sizes up management teams when the biggest and most practical takeaway from his success is, “Start investing when you’re in third grade.”</p></blockquote><p><span>It sounds simple. And it is. But don’t mistake simple for easy.&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Everyone wants a shortcut. It’s always been this way, but I suspect it’s getting worse as technology inflates our benchmark of how fast results should happen. Hacks are appealing because they look like paths to prizes without the effort. Which, in the real world, rarely exists.&nbsp;<br></span><span><br></span><span>There’s a scene in Lawrence of Arabia where one man puts out a match with his fingers, and doesn’t flinch. Another man watching tries to do the same, and yells in pain. “It hurts! What’s the trick?” he asks.&nbsp;<br></span><span><br></span><span>“The trick is not minding that it hurts”, the first man says. Another useful hack.</span></p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="993a38d" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="7c2c60c" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="c445764" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h2>Risk and Luck</h2><p>Risk means there’ll always be outcomes outside your control.</p><blockquote><p>Not every poor investment is the result of a poor decision. No matter your strategy, investing is a game of probabilities. And even really high-probability bets won’t always work out in your favor. Just as you can be right for the wrong reasons, you can be wrong for the right reasons. … You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune … You shouldn’t play Russian Roulette even if the odds are in your favor.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>We lie to ourselves about risk.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Risk and luck are different sides of the same coin, but we treat one as critically important, and the other like it doesn’t exist – at least for you, when you succeed. This is partly about ego, but even more about the desire to identify patterns of what works, relishing the thought of repeating those actions to win again in the future. We love narratives that explain things, and the most comfortable narrative is, “I’m good at this and will continue to be good at it.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot=""><a href="http://.https//www.collaborativefund.com/blog/risk-is-what-you-dont-see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risk is what you don’t see</a>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot=""><span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Paying attention to known risks is smart. But we should acknowledge that what can’t see, aren’t talking about, and aren’t prepared for will likely be more consequential than all the known risks combined.&nbsp;That’s how history has worked.</span></span></p></blockquote><p><span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot=""><span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">There are normal consequences of risk, and then there are tail end consequences. The tails are all that matter.</span></span></p><blockquote>In investing, the average consequences of risk make up most of the daily news headlines. But the tail-end consequences of risk – like pandemics, and depressions – are what make the pages of history books.&nbsp;They’re all that matter. They’re all you should focus on. We spent the last decade debating whether economic risk meant the Federal Reserve set interest rates at 0.25% or 0.5%. Then 36 million people lost their jobs in two months because of a virus. It’s absurd.<p>Tail-end events are all that matter. Once you experience it, you’ll never think otherwise.</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="6cf5aa7" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="387b858" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="49547a3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><h2>Perspective</h2><div><p>Morgan has an answer to why people disagree about economic data. His intuition is spot on in other areas too, whether it’s politics, social issues, or science.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Most economic data references “the economy,” in the aggregate or average. But no one lives in the economy. They live in their economy. And the difference between “the” and “their” is now enormous, and growing.</blockquote></div><p>The world has improved over time, and that’s a reason to be optimistic. Why are people pessimistic then? What does that tell us?</p><blockquote>Pessimism comes across as smart because it appears to be cognisant of risks, appeals to those who believe that misery loves company, often provides a call for action, sounds like someone trying to help you, and is often based on an extrapolation of current trends. However, pessimists are the best indication of what’s unsustainable, and thus probably about to change, and thus the soil of what’s to be optimistic about.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Keep your eye on the ball. Don’t lose sight of what’s important.</p><blockquote><span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">An owner walks a dog on a generally predictable route, though along its way, the dog jumps around randomly, stops to smell leaves, and barks at other dogs. The owner and the dog in this scene can be analogised to businesses and markets respectively. What is surprising]</span> <span data-token-index="2" data-reactroot="">is that almost all investors, big and small, seem to have their eye on the dog, and not the owner.</span> <span data-token-index="4" data-reactroot="">As you navigate your life as an investor, pay more attention to the owner (businesses) and less to the dog (markets).&nbsp;</span></blockquote><p>Options should always be weighed against their alternatives:</p><blockquote><span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Awful decisions can be smart if the alternative is worse …</span> <span data-token-index="2" data-reactroot="">Chesley Sullenberger intentionally steered an Airbus A320 into the Hudson River with 150 passengers onboard. Which is something you should never, ever do. Unless your plane has lost power and the only other option is to crash into the world’s second largest city.

      <!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Why</h2>
<p>One encoding covering <em>most</em> of the world’s writing systems. Standard
encoding of the web, most operating systems, Java and .NET.</p>
<p>Before Unicode, each script (or script family) had its own encoding, or
worse, lots of different incompatible encodings. Unicode is a superset
of almost all of them, so can be used for interchange.</p>
<p>It’s been around for <a href="http://www.unicode.org/history/unicode88.pdf">over 30 years</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: code examples are Perl-centric so far, because it has really good Unicode
support and I know it; if you have examples for other languages, please do post
a comment!</em></p>
<h2>What</h2>
<p><img alt="Unicode character examples" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/unichar-examples.png"></p>
<p>Unicode defines a <em>code point</em> (number) for every character, such as <span><span data-code="0061" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER A" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER A (U+0061)">a</span></span>, <span><span data-code="00E3" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE (U+00E3)">ã</span></span>,
<span><span data-code="06D0" data-name="ARABIC LETTER E" title="ARABIC LETTER E (U+06D0)">ې</span></span>, <span><span data-code="4E0D" data-name="CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E0D" title="CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E0D (U+4E0D)">不</span></span> and <span><span data-code="2603" data-name="SNOWMAN" title="SNOWMAN (U+2603)">☃</span></span>. As of <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/">Unicode 6.2</a> there are <strong>109,976</strong> code points!
<em>(You can mouseover any highlighted character for more information.)</em></p>
<p>It also includes <em>combining characters</em> such as <span><span data-code="0300" data-name="COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT" title="COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT (U+0300)">◌̀</span></span> which can be added to
other characters; this way, Unicode does not need a code point for every possible
combination of letter and accent. On the other hand, Unicode <em>generally</em> doesn’t care
about fonts or stylistic differences: it gives <img alt="a (double-story)" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/a1.png">
and <img alt="a (single-story)" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/a2.png"> the same codepoint.</p>
<p>It’s <em>more than just a character set</em>: it also covers standard encodings such
as UTF-8; <nobr>lower/upper/title</nobr> case mapping; collation (sorting); line breaks;
rendering; right-to-left script handling, and more.</p>
<h2>Normalization</h2>
<p>For compatibility with other encodings Unicode sometimes includes <em>precomposed</em>
versions of characters, for example, these three:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>For these to be treated as the same string in equality tests etc. you should
run all input through <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalisation</a>. The most common form is
<abbr title="Normalisation Form C (canonical decomposition + canonical composition)">NFC</abbr>, which uses pre<strong>C</strong>omposed characters where possible, and defines a strict ordering
of diacritics if more than one exists. <abbr title="Normalization Form D (canonical decomposition)">NFD</abbr> <strong>D</strong>ecomposes characters where possible.<sup id="fnref:gory"><a href="#fn:gory" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what form you use as long as you are consistent; NFD is
faster in general (fewer codepoints) and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6163129/74496">tchrist</a> suggests running input
through NFD and output through NFC.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility decomposition</strong> also maps characters such as <span><span data-code="FB03" data-name="LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI" title="LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI (U+FB03)">ﬃ</span></span>, <span><span data-code="2168" data-name="ROMAN NUMERAL NINE" title="ROMAN NUMERAL NINE (U+2168)">Ⅸ</span></span>
and even <span><span data-code="2075" data-name="SUPERSCRIPT FIVE" title="SUPERSCRIPT FIVE (U+2075)">⁵</span></span> to ‘ffi’, ‘IX’ and ‘5’ respectively. This <abbr title="Normalization Form KC (compatibility decomposition + canonical composition)">NFKC</abbr> normalisation
helps when searching for text.</p>

<h2>Casefolding</h2>
<p>Casing is not so simple in the Unicode world:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some strings actually change length when they change case: <span><span data-code="00DF" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF)">ß</span></span> uppercases
  to ‘SS’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span data-code="017F" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S (U+017F)">ſ</span><span> LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S</span></span> should be seen as equal to ‘s’ and ‘S’ in case-insensitive comparisons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span data-code="03A3" data-name="GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA" title="GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA (U+03A3)">Σ</span><span> GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA</span></span> has <em>two</em> lowercase forms: <span><span data-code="03C3" data-name="GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA" title="GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA (U+03C3)">σ</span></span> at the beginning or middle of the
  word, and <span><span data-code="03C2" data-name="GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA" title="GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA (U+03C2)">ς</span></span> at the end of a word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casing is <em>mostly</em> consistent across locales, but Turkish is an exception: it
  has both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I">Dotted and dotless I</a>, in both lower and upper cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure your code handles these cases, and any new ones, Unicode provides a
<em>one-way</em> ‘casefold’ operation that allows case-insensitive comparison:</p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>CaseFold</span><span>;</span>   <span># or: use v5.16;</span>
<span>sort</span> <span>{</span> <span>fc</span><span>(</span><span>$a</span><span>)</span> <span>cmp</span> <span>fc</span><span>(</span><span>$b</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>@stuff</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Casefolding does <em>not</em> include normalization, so do that too.</p>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>Sorting (or <em>collation</em>) is <strong>locale specific</strong> and just as riddled with
pecularities as casing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>German and Swedish both have ä and ö but sort them differently - German
    treats them as variants of the same letters without umlauts (i.e. ‘a<strong>ä</strong>bcdefghijklmno<strong>ö</strong>pqrstuvwxyz’)
    whereas Swedish considers them new letters, and puts them at the end (‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<strong>äö</strong>‘)</p>
<p>It’s important that things are sorted in the order the user expects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorting varies by application too; phonebooks are often sorted differently to book
    indices, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Chinese characters and other ideographs, there are many possible orders, e.g.
    pinyin (phonetic), by stroke count, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collations can be <em>tailored</em> based on user preferences, e.g. lower or upper-case first?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not enough to just sort by binary comparison. And codepoints aren’t generally in any
sensible order either. Fortunately Unicode specifies a <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/">Collation Algorithm</a>
that is immensely customisable, covers all the edge-cases, and does clever things to make
it reasonably fast. Here’s an example:<sup id="fnref:locale"><a href="#fn:locale" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::Collate::</span><span>Locale</span><span>;</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$collator</span> <span>=</span> <span>Unicode::Collate::</span><span>Locale</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>locale</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>'DE'</span><span>);</span>
<span>my</span> <span>@sorted</span> <span>=</span> <span>$collator</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>@array</span><span>);</span>
<span>$collator</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cmp</span><span>(</span><span>$word</span><span>,</span> <span>$another_word</span><span>);</span>  <span># -&gt; -1, 0 or 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <abbr title="Unicode Collation Algorithm">UCA</abbr> can do other clever things, such as sort ‘10’ after ‘2’ numerically, or sort
the character ‘?’ as if it was the string ‘question mark’.</p>
<h2>Encodings</h2>
<p>The big ones are <code>UTF-8</code>, <code>UTF-16</code> and <code>UTF-32</code>. Each one guarantees a reversible
mapping of almost every codepoint<sup id="fnref:every"><a href="#fn:every" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to a byte sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-32</strong> is dead simple: each codepoint gets four bytes. Takes up tons of space,
  not recommended for interchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-8</strong> is very common the web. It’s byte-oriented (no endianness issues),
  handles corruption well, is ASCII-compatible and takes up minimal space for text
  that is mostly ASCII (e.g. HTML).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Code points between U+0800 and U+FFFF, which includes commonly used <abbr title="Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese">CJKV</abbr>
  characters, will take up 3 bytes instead of 2. So UTF-16 may be more space
  efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASCII-compatibility is helpful to allow UTF-8 to stealth its way through
  scripts and processes that are not Unicode-aware. But if such a system tries to
  do anything with the data (casing, sub-strings, regex), that data may be
  corrupted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-16</strong> is used by Java, .NET and Windows. It uses 2 bytes (16-bit) to
  represent the most common 63K codepoints, and 4 bytes for the less common 1M
  codepoints (using two ‘surrogate’ codepoints).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, UTF-16 is not a fixed-width encoding. But as
  long as it contains no surrogates, it can be treated as one, which can speed
  up string operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTF-16 streams typically begin with <span><span data-code="FEFF" data-name="ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" title="ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE (U+FEFF)">U+FEFF</span></span><sup id="fnref:bomnote"><a href="#fn:bomnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to detect the endianness
  (byte order) of the stream. Otherwise, you can explicitly encode or decode
  via ‘UTF-16BE’ or ‘UTF-16LE’ to specify the endianness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unicode and internationalised domain names</h2>
<p>International characters create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">big problem</a>
for domain names. Just as <span><span data-code="0049" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049)">I</span></span> and <span><span data-code="006C" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER L" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER L (U+006C)">l</span></span> look similar, Unicode multiplies that problem
by 1,000, in addition to adding numerous invisible control characters, spacing characters
and right-to-left text.</p>
<p>Browsers and registrars have implemented several measures against this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many TLDs restrict which characters can be used in domain names.</li>
<li>Browsers may display the domain in Punycode (see below) if the domain includes characters
  from multiple scripts and/or characters not belonging to one of the user’s preferred languages.</li>
<li>Internationalised country codes such as .рф (Russia) only accept Cyrillic names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>nameprep/stringprep</h3>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3491">RFC 3491</a> defines <em>nameprep</em>, a mechanism
to case-fold, normalize and sanitize strings before they can be used in domain names. This
removes many invisible characters and throws an error if prohibited code points are in use.</p>
<p>It is implemented in terms of a wider framework called <em>stringprep</em>. In Perl, one can use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Net::IDN::Encode">Net::IDN::Encode</a> which will also perform Punycode conversion.</p>
<h3>Punycode</h3>
<p>For legacy reasons DNS does not allow extended characters outside of ASCII, so Punycode
is an ASCII-compatible encoding scheme. For example, <code>café.com</code> becomes <code>xn--caf-dma.com</code>.
All Punycode-encoded domain components are instantly recognisable by their <code>xn--</code> prefix.</p>
<p>This goes for TLDs too: .中国 is really known as <em>xn—fiqs8s</em>.</p>
<h2>The problem of ‘user characters’</h2>
<p>In Perl at least, everything (<code>substr</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>reverse</code>…) works on the level
of codepoints. This is often not what you want, because what a user considers to be a
character such as ў is actually two codepoints (<span><span data-code="0079" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER Y" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER Y (U+0079)">y</span></span> + <span><span data-code="0306" data-name="COMBINING BREVE" title="COMBINING BREVE (U+0306)">◌̆</span></span>). Here’s a <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2011/10/msg178687.html">really good
usenet post</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>Even seemingly innocuous things like <code>printf "%-10s", $str</code> breaks completely for combining characters,
double-width characters (e.g. Chinese/Japanese) or zero-width characters.</p>
<p>Fortunately Perl provides the <code>\X</code> regular expression metachar which matches exactly one
‘extended grapheme cluster’, i.e. what a user would consider a character to be. A more robust
solution is to install <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Unicode::GCString">Unicode::GCString</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>GCString</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>Normalize</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>utf8</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>open</span> <span>qw(:std :encoding(UTF-8))</span><span>;</span>

<span>print</span> <span>"1234512345123451234512345|\n"</span><span>;</span>
<span>printf</span> <span>"%s%*s|\n"</span><span>,</span> <span>$g</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>25</span> <span>-</span> <span>$g</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>columns</span><span>),</span> <span>''</span><span>;</span>  <span># 25 columns long (ᵔᴥᵔ)</span>

</pre></div>


<h3>Line breaks</h3>
<p>Line breaking (or word wrapping) is another thing that becomes <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/">insanely complicated</a>
once Unicode is involved. You have to account for various non-breaking and breaking control
and spacing characters, punctuation in every language (e.g. <span><span data-code="00AB" data-name="LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK" title="LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+00AB)">«</span></span> and <span><span data-code="00BB" data-name="RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK" title="RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+00BB)">»</span></span> quotes, or the
full stop or comma being used in numerics such as <code>2,140</code>) and the width of each character.</p>
<p>In Perl, this has all been handled for you - just use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Unicode::LineBreak">Unicode::LineBreak</a>.</p>
<h2>Regular expressions</h2>
<p>Some useful Perl regular expression syntax:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>\R</code></dt>
<dd>Match any Unicode linebreak sequence (including <code>\n</code>, <code>\r\n</code> and six others)</dd>
<dt><code>\p</code>, <code>\P</code></dt>
<dd>Match any codepoint possessing (or not possessing) a Unicode property.</dd>
<dd>Common ones are <code>\pL</code> (Letter), <code>\pU</code> (Uppercase), <code>\pS</code> (Symbol), or even <code>\p{script=Latin}</code>,
<code>\p{East_Asian_Width=Wide}</code>, <code>\p{Numeric_Value=4}</code>.</dd>
<dd>See <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perluniprops.html">perluniprops</a> for a big list.</dd>
<dd>Built-in character classes such as <code>\w</code>, <code>\b</code>, <code>\s</code> and <code>\d</code> are Unicode-aware since Perl
5.6 (though you need to make sure your string or pattern has the <code>UTF8</code> flag on!) Disable this
with the <code>/a</code> flag (see <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#Character-set-modifiers">perlre</a>).</dd>
<dt><code>\X</code></dt>
<dd>Match an extended grapheme cluster, which is basically …</dd></dl></div></div>

If you’re not part of the lucky 1% who are able to make it big on their product launch date, your passion slowly starts to decline.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because not getting enough responses from other people about your work sucks.</p><p>While in the planning stage the feedback you received was mostly feed by your own desire to create what you wanted to create. When the project is live you now rely on outside people to give you boost. If such is not present – there are few or no orders, no one is liking your photos, people don’t reply to your emails – you start to lose motivation.</p><p>That’s why you want to quit and go do something else. Something more exciting. You convince yourself that this new thing will be “way better” and people will love it.</p><h2>Why Receiving Feedback is Important?</h2><p>As in a regular 9 to 5 job, if you work for a boss who doesn’t provide feedback, it’s easy to feel directionless. You start to wonder all sorts of things, “Is my performance good enough?”; “Should I focus more on A instead of B?”; “How can I get better at my work?”</p><p>Similar questions circle one’s mind when the caresses from their spouse stops, “Does he still loves me?”; “Why I’m no longer receiving lovely texts from him?”; “Am I getting older?”</p><p>In ancient times, when our ancestors first discovered fire, and even before that, tribes relied on cues from the environment to find food, useful tools, and avoid injuries from wild animals – a.k.a. losing an arm or being killed.</p><p>But not only this, from a biological standpoint, it makes sense to anticipate external feedback all the time. After all, the main function of the brain is to keep you well and alive.</p><p>During wars, people were constantly alarmed and conscious of their surroundings because they wanted to prevent themselves from being killed or badly injured.</p><p>This feedback loop is present all the time in different shapes and forms. Fortunately, getting caught in a crossfire or attacked by a wild animal is unlikely to happen nowadays. Our brains are now mainly worried about not getting validation from our own kind.</p><p>If you share a picture online and you get zero or not enough likes – whatever enough means for you – this translates into, “I’m not good enough.” The pressure to be socially accepted, online, can create a lasting feeling of unworthiness.</p><p>But measuring your self-worth by the number of likes is not a new discovery.<span id="easy-footnote-1-10677"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-10677" title="Validation seeking online has been around the block since social media was invented."><sup>1</sup></a></span> Yet, few people realize that the same thing carries over other important areas in our lives.</p><ul><li>Your spouse is no longer talking to you.</li><li>Your boss is rarely talking about your performance.</li><li>Your business is just a dusty place no one enters.</li></ul><p>No wonder you want to bail out. Go do something else to associate your I, <a aria-label="your ego (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/ego-is-the-enemy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your ego</a>, with something “better” hoping that you’ll get recognition.</p><p>That’s also the reason people indulge in <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/well-being/internet-rabbit-holes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">careless scrolling</a>. If the project you’re working on is not getting the desired traction you start to doubt your own existence. That’s why we enter the artfully curated social media feeds to feel good about ourselves and escape the harsh reality.</p><p>But here’s the interesting part: The more time you can bear working on a project without getting external feedback the higher the chances of this thing to thrive and succeed.</p><p>The same applies to your relationships. If you can endure the arguments and don’t seek comfort in other people’s arms (i.e. cheat), you have a chance in creating a long-lasting marriage.</p><p>It’s quite a paradox. Half of the brain is logging for positive feedback to feed the ego while the other half is trying to stay reasonable and sane even when the first is not present.</p><h2>Getting Positive Feedback is The Main Desire of The Brain</h2><p>But it’s not only projects and relationships. Our brain is constantly seeking for positive cues. After all, the core goal of the whole body system is to keep you alive, make you feel good so you can survive for a longer period of time and pass your genes along.</p><p>What does all of this mean for our long term goals?</p><p>That if you want to make some positive changes in your life it will surely require enduring through long periods that are absent of any feedback – in a lot of cases both good and bad.</p><p>Want to lose weight and add a nice six-pack to your abs? It might take you months of starvation and hard exercises. During this transition period, the guy who stares at you back in the mirror is still going to be fat and asymmetrical.</p><p>Want to create a profitable online business? Despite praying to Google to show your content a bit higher in the search results you also have to write extremely good essays over a long period of time.</p><p>But I’m not here only to warn you about the loneliness and the years of hard work without immediate return. I’m here to help.</p><p>Here’s what you can do to make your journey to what you want to become, create, or whatever, a bit more bearable…</p><h2>How Can You Cope With Not Getting Feedback For Your Project?</h2><h3>Create Visual Feedback Loops</h3><p>“Don’t break the chain!” said Jerry Seinfeld when asked how he was able to keep delivering amazing jokes to people around the world.<span id="easy-footnote-2-10677"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-10677" title="A lot of people call it <a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;The Seinfeld Strategy (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>The Seinfeld Strategy</a>."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p>He’s famous for his practice of writing jokes daily and checking off boxes on a calendar.</p><p>Jerry Seinfeld famously said, “Do something related to your craft every day, no matter how small the action is.”</p><p>That’s the first tactic that will help you cope with the lack of feedback when you want to create a business or adopt a new habit.</p><p>The idea is to create a visual representation of the progress you’re making.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1024x512.jpg" alt="Don't-break-the-chain" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dont-break-the-chain.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>Writing or exercising regularly is a good idea on paper, but you can easily lose motivation when you feel tired or when the weather outside is giving you blues.</p><p>Things feel quite different once you have a graph that’s showing your progress. You’ll feel obligated to put another checkmark. After all, you don’t want to feel like the previous days were wasted, right?</p><p>That’s the simplest strategy you can create, today, to move the needle closer to where you want to go.</p><h3>Find a Support Group</h3><p>The second tactic that you can use to handle the dry periods that are absent of feedback is to join a group that will keep you accountable.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1024x512.jpg" alt="support-group" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/support-group.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>I know. You probably heard it before. But having someone waiting for you to get the job done is a butt-kicker. You can handle disappointing yourself in most of the cases. But disappointing someone else? You don’t want to do that.</p><h3>Temper Your Emotions by Reminding Yourself Why You Started</h3><p>The reasons you started a project often fades after months or years of execution. You started because you wanted to make reading more available to others? Or, because you wanted to inspire more people to exercise?</p><p>Soon enough, though, you forget why your project exists. You are carried away by the daily tasks and “trendy” methods you obsessively try to grow your business.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="512" src="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-1024x512.jpg" alt="why-you-started" srcset="https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-300x150.jpg 300w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-770x385.jpg 770w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-566x283.jpg 566w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-1151x575.jpg 1151w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-1481x740.jpg 1481w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-274x137.jpg 274w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-751x376.jpg 751w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started-1381x691.jpg 1381w, https://durmonski.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/why-you-started.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>Your eagerness to <em>make it</em> consumes you thinking and you forget why …</p></div></div></div>

August 14, 2020 | https://catalins.tech/i-migrated-my-blog-from-wordpress-to-hashnode-ckdsn5h4100h2a9s1crmv7a3q | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://catalins.tech/i-migrated-my-blog-from-wordpress-to-hashnode-ckdsn5h4100h2a9s1crmv7a3q">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597313376856/yGQnQpTIu.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text">

<p>If you are following me on Twitter, chances are you already know I migrated my blog from WordPress to Hashnode. The tweet below shows my announcement of moving to Hahshnode:</p>

<p>Therefore, in this article, I want to shine some light on why I chose to leave WordPress, and become part of the <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> community.</p>

<p>As you might know, or not, I am a big fan of WordPress. The reasons are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is easy to use</li>
<li>it is free</li>
<li>there are lots of free themes available</li>
<li>there are integrations with almost any service available on the internet</li>
</ul>
<p>... and many more.</p>
<p>However, it can be very bloated, slow, and overkill for a technical blog. For instance, to add code snippets to my articles, I had to install a special plugin. Then, every time I wanted to add a code snippet to an article, I had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>go to the plugin settings</li>
<li>select the language of the code snippet</li>
<li>create a name and a description for the snippet</li>
<li>choose a tag</li>
<li>write the code</li>
<li>save the snippet</li>
<li>embed the snippet into the article</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, to add a snippet of code, I need to follow seven steps. Now let us say I have to embed five code snippets. As a result, I have to do thirty-five extra steps! Moreover, I did not have any control over my snippets, and I could not customise the design. </p>
<p>Anyway, the above is just an example to show you laborious some tasks can be in WordPress. I decided enough is enough, and I started to look for alternatives, as shown by the tweet below. </p>


<p>I believe there is not the best alternative because everyone has different needs and use cases. However, for my use case, I had to choose between:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hashnode</li>
<li>Gatsby + MDX</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though I love Gatsby blogs, and the level of customisation they allow, it can be very time-consuming to create such a blog. And then you have to maintain it too. Therefore, the only option left was Hashnode.</p>
<h3 id="why-hashnode-">Why Hashnode?</h3>
<p>The thing that attracts me the most to Hashnode is that it combines both worlds of a dynamic blog like a WordPress blog and a static site like a Gatsby blog. It has more features than a static blog, but it is less-bloated than a WordPress blog. </p>
<p>Besides that, you get to be part of an awesome and fantastic community. It is one of the most supportive communities I have ever been involved in, and they do not pay me to say this. It is my opinion. </p>
<p>Other reasons why I prefer Hashnode:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMP pages</strong> =&gt; The blog is very fast on mobile, and poor internet.</li>
<li><strong>Publishing articles is swift and easy</strong> =&gt; You write your articles in Markdown. Also, you can easily embed YouTube videos, tweets, content from other sites, and so on. </li>
<li><strong>Free SSL certificate</strong> =&gt; How cool is that? You do not have to pay anything for the certificate.</li>
<li><strong>Your domain</strong> =&gt; You can use your domain for your blog. You are not tied to a blog URL like <code>pit.hashnode.dev</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Back up your articles on GitHub</strong> =&gt; Do you want to migrate to another platform? Well, you are not locked on Hashnode. They provide you with the opportunity of backing up your articles on GitHub in a JSON format. As a result, you can switch platforms without losing your content.</li>
<li><strong>I can talk straight to the founders</strong> =&gt; How cool is that I can speak straight with the people that founded the platform? I cannot do this with WordPress, Dev To, Medium, and other platforms. If I have feedback or ideas, I can pitch them. (<em>that does not mean I bother them all day long</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Discord server</strong> =&gt; I already said that they have a great, tight, supportive community. Thus, they have an exclusive Discord server with all the people using Hashnode, including the founders. You can exchange ideas, ask questions, and many more. Check it out! </li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, these are the reasons why I choose to use and become part of the Hashnode community. If you have other good reasons, feel free to drop them in the comments.</p>

<p>I hope the article makes it clear why I chose Hashnode and why it can be an excellent choice for anyone. I want to emphasise again that I did not get paid to move to Hashnode or write this article. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>S</span>arah Dolman heard the porpoiseâ€™s cries not in the waters where the animalâ€™s voice was actually recorded, but on the sound system at a marine mammal conference held in late 2019. To Dolman, policy manager at the nonprofit UK-based conservation organization <a href="https://uk.whales.org/" target="_blank">Whale and Dolphin Conservation,</a> time and distance made the experience no less painful.</p>

<p>The porpoise was using its voice—which sounds alternately like a buzzing insect, a creaky door blowing open then clicking shut, and a high-frequency whistle that humans cannot hear without the aid of sound-amplifying technologies—to call to another porpoise who was caught in a fishing net. The entangled porpoise struggled to surface while trying to break free. That proved impossible, and the porpoise drowned. But the dead creatureâ€™s companion stayed nearby for hours, speaking in protracted clicks, buzzes and whistles—in mourning or perhaps confusion, alarmed by the sudden death of its friend.</p>
<p>Globally, fishing gear kills <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123735539000444" target="_blank">at least 300,000 marine mammals</a> every year, and leaves many more individuals with scars both physical and psychological. Some governments, including those of the U.S. and E.U., may temporarily close fisheries or regulate gear after a specified number of marine mammals are killed, but those measures are limited. At a moment when the cruel captivity of several dozen orcas inspires public outrage and aquarium boycotts and new laws, the global fishing industry and its regulators generally accept the widespread killing and maiming of marine mammals as a part of doing business. And so we unwittingly continue to eat fish, in huge amounts, and marine mammals continue to suffer.</p>
<p>Dolman says present approaches, which focus on maintaining specific populations above a minimum size, still allow too much killing and preventable suffering. She says itâ€™s time for fisheries policies to consider the welfare of individual whales and dolphins and other marine mammals. â€œBeing caught in fishing gear is a horrible way to die,â€� says Dolman. â€œHow would the public feel about this when theyâ€™re eating fish and seafood, if they knew about these animalsâ€™ suffering? We need another solution.â€�</p>
<p>Dolman and her colleague Philippa Brakes, a research fellow at Whale and Dolphin Conservation, outlined their approach for regulating â€œbycatch,â€� as unintentionally caught animals are called, and preventing entanglement in fishing gear in a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00287/full" target="_blank">2018 paper</a> published in the journal <em>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</em>. They say that fisheries policies must account for the well-being of individuals, not just populations, ideally with zero tolerance for marine mammal bycatch.</p>
<p>They also argue for updating the definition of â€œsustainableâ€� fisheries, now set according to whether the exploitation of a given fish population can be continued without jeopardizing it, to include marine mammals killed as bycatch. In their paper, Dolman and Brakes point out that â€œbuying â€˜sustainableâ€™ fish or indeed some fish products labeled â€˜dolphin-friendlyâ€™ provide no guarantees that incidental bycatch of protected species does not occur alongside the targeted catch.â€�&nbsp; And not only should sustainability encompass mortality, but also the suffering of survivors—something thatâ€™s a bit more challenging to measure, though scientists acknowledge that itâ€™s real, and goes beyond the pain of scars and severed limbs caused by the constricting ropes of the gear they carry.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_911411818e26b80488c996ad7cfe7d4d.jpg" alt="nautilus whale calf"><figcaption><span>A humpback whale mother swims with her newborn calf in their traditional breeding waters in the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. </span><br><span>Credit: NOAA News</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if we are quite far from fully understanding the experiences of animals who spend their lives primarily underwater, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-31011-0_10" target="_blank">research clearly reveals</a> that harbor porpoises like the one whose cries haunted Dolman and other marine mammals are, like us, highly intelligent and social creatures. Ecologist and author <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/review-beyond-words-carl-safina.html" target="_blank">Carl Safina</a>, who has written extensively about the inner lives of nonhuman animals including orcas and sperm whales, says the loss of even one individual whale—particularly if she happens to be an adult female—can be catastrophic for others.<br></p>
<p>â€œSperm whales stay together their entire lives, very intentionally living together in a family the way elephants live together in a family,â€� says Safina. â€œIf you lose even one member of that female support group, you increase the risks and hazards to the young ones.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like baby humans, young marine mammals depend on their eldersâ€™ vigilance and protection, as well as their practical knowledge and cultural wisdom, for survival. Older animals in a family bestow younger members with all sorts of knowhow, such as what to eat and how to hunt for food. Scientists have discovered that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1313" target="_blank">orca grandmothers</a> play an outsized role in the lives of young orcas, boosting youngstersâ€™ chances of survival. Even for less family-oriented marine mammal species, like humpback whales, notes Safina, â€œthe death of a mother—or severe distress of a mother due to entanglement in fishing gear—can be, depending on age of a young one, completely devastating or very stressful.â€�
</p>
<p>Research like this â€œopens a rich seam of understanding,â€� Brakes says. â€œSuch understanding shows us that we can no longer treat marine mammals like a homogenous group or numbers on a spreadsheet.â€� She and Dolman propose a multi-pronged strategy of implementing fisheries closures and new fishing practices, as well as requiring new gear that minimizes bycatch and entanglements. Fisheries regulation would need to include enhanced monitoring and reporting systems that keep track of every harmed marine mammal. Right now basic data about bycatch and entanglements, much less the long-term physiological and psychological affects, are not being collected.</p>
<blockquote>â€œWe can no longer treat marine mammals like a homogenous group or numbers on a spreadsheet.â€�</blockquote>
<p>According to Dolman, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a key independent labeler of sustainable seafood, has received much criticism in recent years about its inadequate consideration of bycatch. â€œMSC bycatch standards are under review at the moment,â€� Dolman said. â€œThis is something thatâ€™s long overdue. But, I have to say, Iâ€™m not feeling very positive about whatâ€™s coming. The fishing industry is very vocal and oppositional to regulatory change. Consumers and scientists must begin pushing for laws and certification schemes to seriously incorporate welfare into the â€˜sustainableâ€™ label. Most of the public feels comfortable when they see a dolphin-safe label—though really, right now, they shouldnâ€™t.â€�<strong>
</strong></p>
<p>Adding to marine mammalsâ€™ collective challenges is the fact that fishing isnâ€™t their only threat. In addition to depleting populations of the fish they eat, humans have made the oceans a much noisier place, with engine noise and seismic surveys and naval tests causing both chronic stress and acute damage. We push ship traffic into ever-more remote areas once only known to marine animals; disrupt marine life by developing coastlines and dredging channels; pollute with plastic and toxic chemicals; and cause ocean-warming climate change.
</p>
<p>These are not matters to frame purely in terms of populations and environments, but the lived experiences of animals who share many intellectual properties with us. â€œPeople need to understand that other living things can suffer and that these individuals donâ€™t want to suffer. They want to exist in a state of wellbeing. Thatâ€™s what they strive to do,â€� says Safina. â€œI think the big first step is for people to understand and talk about that and drive away from things that cause suffering.â€�</p>

Heck, that’s true for basically every technology: they all come with <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em>.</p><p>One of the most valuable benefits I see in Serverless and I believe hard to confute though is, well… that less toil work dedicated to server administration means that as an engineer you can focus on arguably more valuable tasks at hand and, probably, the end result of what you build will be a more robust and reliable infrastructure too.</p><p>Take this case for example: perform daily backups of remote (i.e. fully managed, no shell access) MongoDB instance, store these archives somewhere offsite and delete them once they are older than a defined amount of time. I’m sure if you’ve ever did system administration (or call it <em>DevOps</em> if you prefer) this sounds like a very familiar kind of task, doesn’t it?</p><h2 id="a-conventional-approach">A conventional approach</h2><p>In the old days, when Serverless was not yet a thing, a common way to approach this was to:</p><ol><li>setup some <em>admin</em> or <em>ops</em> kind of server responsible for this and most probably other kind of similar back-office activities. No need to say you and your team also need to take good care of it for the forseeable future (i.e. have redundant storage drives in some kind of RAID scheme and replace them once they fail, keep the server itself backupped, monitor that it’s up and running 24/7, etc)</li><li>set up some kind of cronjob to do the above backup routine every evening (or every X amount of time, depending on the needs, etc)</li><li>in the same above cronjob or as an independent task, have some kind of <em>pruning</em> process that takes care of deleting old archives once their expiry date has passed</li></ol><h2 id="a-serverless-approach">A Serverless approach</h2><p>Instead, in this article I’m going to show you how this very same problem might be approached from a Serverless perspective.

By the way, I’ve worked around this using <code>debian:buster-slim</code> as Docker base image given that I don’t care that much about image size anyway, my AWS bill is basically unaffected by a few more MBs stored in the ECS registry so what the heck</p></li><li><p>every single time a Fargate task is executed without explicitly setting a security group <strong>will create a brand new one</strong> and, given that there’s a quota of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html">maximum 2500 security groups per region</a>, this might very well cause a few headaches in the close future unless properly addressed. To avoid that I explicitly set the Fargate Task to use the default VPC security group which has open <code>EGRESS</code> rules and works fine in my scenario, it’s implemented at at <a href="https://github.com/shaftoe/api-l3x-in/tree/0.13.0/lib/stacks/mongodumper/__init__.py#L66">line 66</a> of the CDK stack. I believe this is a more sensible default behavior and I hope ECS developers will address this in the future, I bet some user might not be as lucky as I’ve been to notice it before deploying to production and discover it the hard way</p></li><li><p>another annoying default setting in ECS: when running a Fargate Task in a public VPC subnet the container won’t receive proper networking setup unless explicitly set, i.e. it will not be able to pull the image from the ECS registry, hence it will never reach the <code>RUNNING</code> stage and, even worse, no error log will be sent to CloudWatch Logs.</p><p>Unfortunately CDK doesn’t let you change this setting for CloudWatch Events yet, there’s an <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/9233">open feature request</a> for that and given the recent speed of development in the CDK project I expect this to be solved soon.</p><p>For the time being I worked around it manually changing the setting via the web console (yeah, I know, <em>the horror</em> 😱), another way around it that doesn’t require manual intervention and makes the solution 100% <em>Infra as Code</em> would have been to put a Lambda proxy between the CloudWatch Event and the Fargate task. It might be I’ve been either too lazy or too optimistic in CDK fixing this promptly, only time will tell</p></li><li><p>currently the above solution supports storing archives for a single (MongoDB) database, it should be fairly trivial to extend it to support multiple databases though (e.g. defining multiple CloudWatch Events, each one setting different <code>MONGODB_URI</code> value via <code>container_overrides</code> parameter)</p></li><li><p>for my simple need a <em>delete permanently after 7 days</em> bucket lifecycle policy is all right, you might want to consider more complex policies like storing old archives to Glacier instead, S3 is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html">quite flexible</a> in that regard</p></li></ul><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2><p>Once more I’m delighted by how easy it is to work with CDK on AWS and I have the feeling those solutions I come up with are simple, robust, and basically require zero maintenance from my side (which is gold in itself).</p><p>Comparing the above solution to a more conventional approach which might require maintaining (and monitoring! and keeping secured! etc.) a server 24/7 for running actual work only for a few seconds per day is… wasteful, to say little.</p><p>Beside, I bet today there’s no way to come up with a cheaper production-ready solution: a few seconds of Fargate execution per day won’t even show up in the AWS monthly bill, and if it does it might be for just a few Euro (or Dollar) cents. Of course this might not be true in case of big datasets where the cost for S3 storage/data transfer might make an in-house solution (or even better, a fully managed solution, automated backups included) more cost effective, but I bet this is never going to be the case in many real scenarios where archives are relatively small sized (i.e. a few GBs or so).</p><p>That said, the current shortcomings in the integration between ECS and CDK are annoying and enforce the <em>Serverless is not 100% ready for production</em> argument validity, at least for the time being.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this article at least a fraction of how much I did while working on it, and don’t forget to let me know what you think.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>



<p>When I was learning about Continuum Mechanics for the first time, the <em>covariance
and contravariance of vectors</em> confused the hell out of me. The concepts gain
meaning in the context of Riemannian Geometry, but it was surprising to find
that one doesn’t need to learn an entire subject to grasp the logic behind
co-/contravariance. An intermediate knowledge of linear algebra is enough—that
is, one has to be acquainted with the concept of vector spaces and one-forms.</p>
<p>The duality of co-/contravariance arises when one has to define vectors in terms
of a non-orthonormal basis. The reason such terminology doesn’t show up
in engineering education is that Cartesian coordinates are enough for most
engineering problems. But every now and then, a complex problem with funky
geometrical requirements show up, like one that requires measuring distances and
areas on non-flat surfaces. Then you end up with dual vector spaces. I’ll try to
give the basics of duality below.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Let $\CV$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space.
The space $\CV^\ast = \CL(\CV,\IR)$,
defined as the
the space of all one-forms $\Balpha:\CV\to\IR$, is called the
<strong>dual space</strong> to $\CV$.</p>
<p>Let $B=\cbr{\Be_1,\dots,\Be_n}$ be a basis of $\CV$. Any vector $\Bv\in\CV$ can be written
in terms of $B$ as</p>

<p>with the components $a_1,\dots,a_n\in\IR$.
For any $i=1,\dots,n$, we can define the $i$-th component $a_i$ by a one-form as</p>

<p>These elements are linear and thus are in the space
$\CL(\CV,\IR)$<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.
Given any basis $B=\setveci{\Be}$, we call $B^\ast = \setveciup{\Be}$
the basis of $\CV^\ast$ <strong>dual</strong> to $B$.
The fact that $B^\ast$ really is a basis of $\CV^\ast$ can be proved
by showing that $\Be^i$ are linearly independent.
Then $\Bv$ has the following
representation</p>

<p>Instead of $a_i$, it is practical to denote the components of $\Bv$ as $v^i$,
lightface of the same symbol with a raised index corresponding to
the raised index of the dual basis:</p>

<p>In fact, this convention is more compatible with
the symmetry caused by the duality.
This point will be more clear after the introduction of
dual basis representation of one-forms.</p>
<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> Each $\Be^i \in \CL(\CV,\IR)$ can be identified by its action on the basis
$B$:</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> For any $\Bv\in\CV$, $\Be^i(\Bv)$ must give $v^i$, the
$i$-th component of $\Bv$.
Setting $\Bv = \Be_j$, one sees that
$\Be^i(\Bv)=v^i = 1$ when $i=j$, and is zero otherwise.</p>
<p>Geometrically, \eqref{eq:dualbasis2} implies that a basis vector is
perpendicular to all the dual basis vectors, except its own dual.</p>
<h2 id="dual-basis-representation-of-one-forms">Dual Basis Representation of One-Forms</h2>
<p>Let $\Balpha$ be a one form in $\CV^\ast$ with the corresponding
dual basis $\setveciup{\Be}$. Then similar to a vector,
$\Balpha$ has the following representation</p>

<p>where the <strong>components of the one-form</strong> $\Balpha$
are defined as</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> We substitute \eqref{eq:vectorrep2} and obtain</p>

<p>using $\Balpha$’s linearity.</p>
<p><strong>Notation:</strong>
Let $\CV$ be a finite-dimensional real vector space.
For $\Bv\in\CV$ and $\Balpha\in\CV^\ast$</p>

<p>denotes the action of $\Balpha$ on $\Bv$, and is called
a <strong>natural pairing</strong> or <strong>dual pairing</strong>
between a vector space and its dual.
<em>It is of the essence to understand that $\abrn{\cdot,\cdot}$ does not
denote an inner product in $\CV$</em>; that is,
$\abr{\Bv,\Balpha}$ means $\Balpha(\Bv)$.</p>
<p>With this notation, \eqref{eq:vectorrep2} can be written as</p>

<p>and \eqref{eq:dualbasis2} as</p>

<p>Using the convention that $\Be_i$ are column vectors and
$\Be^i$ are row vectors,
\eqref{eq:dualbasis1} can be rearranged in the following manner</p>

<p>which can be used to compute a dual basis.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Given a two-dimensional vector space $\CV$ with a basis
$\Be_1=[2,-0.5]\tra$, $\Be_2=[1,1]\tra$, we use
\eqref{eq:computedualbasis1} to compute</p>

<p>and obtain the dual basis vectors as
$\Be^1=[0.4,-0.4]$ and $\Be^2=[0.2,0.8]$.
The result is given in the
following figure,</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://solmaz.io/img/duality_vector_spaces/fig2.svg"></p>
</figure>
<p>where one can see that $\Be_1\perp\Be^2$, $\Be^1\perp\Be_2$.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://solmaz.io/img/duality_vector_spaces/fig1.svg">
A body $\CB$ embedded in $\IR^2$ with curvilinear coordinates.
Every point $\CP$ at $\BX$ has an associated two-dimensional vector space,
called $\CB$’s tangent space at $\BX$, denoted $\tang_\BX\CB$. The basis
$\Be_i$ corresponding to coordinates $\theta_i$ are not necessarily
orthogonal and can admit corresponding duals $\Be^i$, due to
curvilinearity.
The coordinates appear to be affine at the point’s immediate vicinity,
and thus in the tangent space.</p>
</figure>
<p>The introduction of the dual space
allows us to reinterpret a one-form $\Balpha$
as an object residing in the dual space. In fact,
the <strong>canonical duality</strong> $\CV^{\ast\ast}=\CV$
states that every vector $\Bv$ can be interpreted as a functional
on the space $\CV^\ast$ via</p>

Let's explore how.</p><p>At Stackbit, we believe that the Jamstack can help make a better web for everyone because Jamstack sites are fast and secure. We want to make it easy for any developer to adopt the Jamstack for their next project. That's why one of the foundational elements that has defined Stackbit since day one has been the ability to generate a Jamstack site with just a few clicks. The basic steps are:</p><h2>1. Choose a theme</h2><p>We currently have eight themes to choose from, including our new, highly customizable theme called <a href="https://themes.stackbit.com/demos/starter/">Starter</a>. Plus, there are dozens of community themes available on GitHub, such as the popular <a href="https://github.com/snipcart/stackbit-theme-planty">Planty ecommerce theme</a> by Snipcart, or even more on <a href="https://jamstackthemes.dev/">JamstackThemes.dev</a>. You also have the ability to import a custom theme of your own (for details on how to configure that, you can <a href="https://docs.stackbit.com/site-builder/custom-themes/">check the docs</a>)</p><h2>2. Choose a static site generator (SSG)</h2><p>All of our themes can be generaed using Gatsby, Hugo or Jekyll (with additional support coming <em>very</em> soon...but I won't spoil the surprise). This gives you options to choose the tool and language you prefer to use for developing your Jamstack site. (Not sure which one to choose? <a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/choosing-your-ssg/">We have some advice here</a>.)</p><h2>3. Choose a headless content management system (CMS)</h2><p>One of the powerful things about buildng a site through the Stackbit site builder is that it is pre-configured for content management through your choice of <a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/what-is-a-headless-cms/">headless CMS</a>, including Sanity, Contentful, DataCMS, Forestry and NetilfyCMS. We've even added a new option for using files in your GitHub repository that can still get the full inline content editing features in Stackbit. (More on that in an upcoming post!)</p><p>One you've made these three choices, you are ready to go. Stackbit will build the site, place the source in GitHub and deploy to Netlify. Within minutes your site is ready and deployed!</p><p>Let's be honest though, telling you about this is far less exciting than simply showing you...so let's see what this looks like in action.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1Xlr4L44KE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>Make the site your own</h2><p>The really important thing you should know about your new Jamstack site is that <strong>the code is yours.</strong> The code ends up in a GitHub respository you own. You can edit and customize it as you wish. In fact, we've made it easy to get your site running on your local machine and start editing by providing the instructions in the project's <code>README.md</code> or via Stackbit's online editor. This gives you the ability to do things like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/stackbit-gatsby-site-improvements/">Add a favicon, analytics, social sharing and a sitemap</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/gatsby-search/">Add site search using Algolia</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/jamstack-gatsby-mailchimp/">Add a mailing list form that connects to Mailchimp</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stackbit.com/blog/complete-guide-netlify-forms/">Customize how your form submissions are handled</a></li></ul><p>...and anything else you can think of!</p><p>The best part is that everything I have described to you here is also available at no cost. Just head on over to the <a href="https://app.stackbit.com/create">Stackbit Site Builder</a> and start creating your Jamstack site!</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><i>Disclaimer: I’m not a current or former Mozilla employee and have no other affiliation with Mozilla.</i> This is my own analysis of the publically-available information surrounding Mozilla’s decision to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/">radically downsize</a> in a way that seems to further threaten Firefox’s future.

</p><p>A lot of people are very angry at Mozilla’s management for their decision to restructure the foundation, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/withoutboats/status/1217558588857544704">not unreasonable.</a> But seen in context, I think most people would, if in their position, make the same decision.

</p><p>Why is Mozilla cutting staff on its most popular product (Firefox) and refocusing on things that look like unsuccessful stunt projects? <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/could-google-crush-firefox-in-2020-13a55b5d4526">Because they’re about to lose the revenue from it.</a> <em>Google</em> is to blame for not renewing the contract that gives Mozilla a share of the ad revenue from the Firefox search bar. The web browser market has been walking on thin ice since 2008 when Chrome came out, because with Chrome available and under its own control, Google no longer had a reason to support the ecosystem with revenue-sharing deals. Now it seems like Google wants to see just how thin it can make the ice before Mozilla goes under.

</p><p>And why are they focussing on products nobody uses? Because they can make money by selling VPN subscriptions and premium bookmarking accounts without depending on the (obviously limited) goodwill of their competitors.

</p><p>What can you do about this? Here are some suggestions:

</p><ul>
  <li><strong>Buy one of Mozilla’s other products.</strong> It might seem like validating the bad decision made by Mozilla management, but it is reasonable to hope that income from, say, Mozilla VPN might be enough to keep a rag-tag Firefox team going.
  </li><li><strong>Just straight up <a href="https://donate.mozilla.org/">donate to Mozilla.</a></strong> Remember, Mozilla is a non-profit organization. While Google is developing Chrome to strengthen its bottom line and pay out more to shareholders, Mozilla’s interest in the Web platform is actually public-spirited. They fought against DRM in HTML and the mandatory use of patent-encumbered technologies on the open web, and when these efforts failed (largely for the same reasons Google is now able to crush Firefox entirely) they adopted laudable compromises, giving their users a genuine choice about using these technologies. And more than that&nbsp;—&nbsp;they’re actively participating in projects to create new, widely-supported and superior alternatives to these problematic technologies for the future. The web would be a worse place without Mozilla, and for that they deserve your goodwill.
  </li><li><strong>Write to your lawmaker urging an investigation into Google’s anti-competitive practices</strong> in the web browser and web markup space. This could be particularly effective if you live in the EU and write to your European Parliamentarians. Google is probably counting on the Trump administration not caring about their blatant repeat of Microsoft’s anti-trust violations&nbsp;— but other major jurisdictions which still have functioning regulatory systems can make a difference.
  </li><li><strong>Actually use Firefox, or one of its derivatives like the Tor Browser.</strong> One reason Google feels able to do this is probably because of Firefox’s shrinking market share. But Firefox is a vital part of the browser ecosystem, not least as the only major browser left that isn’t based on a WebKit-derivative engine, and as a hackable open-source browser that’s a vital component of equally-vital privacy projects like Tor. And Firefox still has really great features, especially for web developers. Switch back to Firefox&nbsp;— especially if you’re on Chrome!
  </li><li><strong>Switch away from Google products as much as possible.</strong> I know that other web search engines are still embarrassingly bad&nbsp;—&nbsp;I’m not here to guilt-trip anyone into using DuckDuckGo. But if you use Gmail, stop. There are <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">fantastic</a> <a href="https://protonmail.com/">alternatives</a> out there which, yes, filter spam just as well as Gmail does these days. Use Apple Maps or OpenStreetMap or Yelp instead of Google Maps. Run an ad blocker that blocks YouTube ads, and support your favourite YouTubers directly over Patreon instead.
</li></ul>

<div>
<p>Epic Games introduced an update to their mobile (iOS and Android) version of Fortnite that allows users to buy directly from Epic Games at a 20% discount, removing incentives to pay with the officially sanctioned payment systems on the App Store and Play Store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Soon after this update, Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store, Google was not far behind in doing the same. In response, Epic Games has filed individual suits against both tech giants claiming that their behaviour is monopolistic control over their respective ecosystems. However, there is some nuance and differences that we should explore between the two ecosystems that could have implications for the validity of the anti-trust lawsuits that Epic will have to contend with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at the two ecosystems holistically, it is perhaps more appropriate in this case to think of Android and iOS as marketplaces rather than solely focusing on their function as operating systems. The contention is that the marketplaces are being monopolised and controlled to the disadvantage of developers. This is especially true of Apple iOS, where the entire OS is a marketplace, where the App Store is the only access point for third-party applications to the ecosystem. If an application is removed from the App Store, the third-party application simply cannot exist on the iOS ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comparatively, Google’s Android OS functions a little differently. The OS acts as an open ecosystem which is augmented by the Play Store. The Play Store, not the OS, is the marketplace – the place for discovery. The Play Store as a standalone application can have comparative and competitive marketplaces on the Android OS, like the Samsung store. Further, the Android OS allows for third-party installs of applications albeit with security warnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Epic might have a hard time arguing that Google is being anti-competitive when it has avenues of access – albeit less direct – outside of the Google Play Store. Applications can still exist within the Android ecosystem even when the Play Store removes listings according to their marketplace rules.</p>



<p>Apple, on the other hand, has its entire ecosystem siloed as a marketplace, with no third-party marketplaces allowed and no ability to legally install third-party applications – placing them in a much more difficult position when it comes to anti-competitive claims. In recent months, Apple has come under increasing scrutiny as they butt heads with application developers, most notably Hey email client, Google’s Stadia platform and Microsoft’s xCloud platform.&nbsp;</p>

the new data which unfortunately would need a new database schema.</p>
<p>Another quite big changes was contributed by Taavi Eomäe, who refactored the
device discovery activity which fixes tons of bugs and also new features,
like displaying already paired devices an notes about devices needing a
pairing key.</p>
<p>The release 0.45.0 did not have its own blog post, please refer to the list below
for details on what changed with the 0.45.0 and 0.45.1 releases.</p>
<p>But there is one thing I would like to highlight. There is a new,
experimental way of getting weather data from an new open source app developed
by Pawel Dube, that directly supports Gadgetbridge. No need for API keys.
The App is still alpha and work in progress, but we highly recommend trying it.
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Starfish/TinyWeatherForecastGermany">TinyWeatherForecast</a>
Don't be fooled by the name it supports a lot of locations worldwide.
If you like it please give it a star on Codeberg.org!</p>
<p>For all user-facing changes since the previous blog post, check the following list:</p>
<h4>0.46.0</h4>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for Mi Band 5</li>
<li>Initial support for TLW64</li>

The web application isn’t the whole story, though. Surrounding it are many supporting services, and we are increasingly using Rust to write these services.</p></div><p>We’re also using more Lambdas in our architecture, and we want to use Rust in those as well. The landscape for Rust lambdas isn’t barren, but it’s not well-trodden either.<br></p><p>This post is going to cover how we write, build, and deploy our Rust lambdas. Our lambdas have the following qualities that we’re proud of and want to share with you:<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Fast, standardised build.</strong> All of our lambdas use the same Dockerfile to build, and make good use of Docker’s layer caching. Incremental builds in CI take under a minute.</li><li><strong>Run locally. </strong>If you’re working on a lambda, you don’t want to have to sit through a CI build to see if your changes work. All of our lambdas can run locally and in AWS using the same code.</li><li><strong>Private GitHub dependencies. There aren’t many options out there for private Cargo repositories, so we use private GitHub repositories for our internal libraries.</strong></li></ol><h2>The code<br></h2><p>The starting point for writing a Lambda in Rust is to use the official <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime">Rust lambda runtime</a>. At the time of writing, the last release of this library is version 0.2, which doesn’t support async/await. Async/await support is present in master, though. Here’s how it looks in practice:</p><div><pre><code>
use lambda::{lambda, Context};
use serde_json::Value;

type Error = Box<dyn std::error::error="" +="" send="" sync="" 'static="">;

#[lambda]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main(event: Value, _: Context) -&gt; Result<value, error=""> {
    Ok(event)
}

</value,></dyn></code></pre></div><p>The problem with this is that you can’t run it locally. The #[lambda] attribute wraps your main function in another main function that calls in to the AWS lambda API.<br></p><p>To get around this, we write two main functions:<br></p><div><pre><code>

#[cfg(feature = "with-lambda")]
use lambda::{lambda, Context};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

type Error = Box<dyn std::error::error="" +="" send="" sync="" 'static="">;

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct Input {
    name: String
}

#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]
struct Output {
    greeting: String
}

async fn handler(input: Input) -&gt; Result<output, error=""> {
    Ok(Output { greeting: format!(“Hello, {}!”, input.name) })
}

#[cfg(feature = "with-lambda")]
#[lambda]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main(input: Input, _: Context) -&gt; Result<output, error=""> {
    handler(input).await
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "with-lambda"))]
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {
    let input_str = std::env::args().nth(1);
    if input_str.is_none() {
        panic!(
            "you must pass an input parameter as the first argument, and it must be a JSON string"
        );
    }
    let input = serde_json::from_str(&amp;input_str.unwrap())?;
    let output = handler(input).await?;
    println!("{}", serde_json::to_string(&amp;output)?);
    Ok(())
}

</output,></output,></dyn></code></pre></div><p>We’re making use of Rust’s “feature” flags to compile a different harness around the handle function depending on whether we want to run locally or in AWS.</p><p>Here’s the Cargo.toml file:</p><div><pre><code>
[package]
name = "rust-lambda-template"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Sam Rose <sam@cvpartner.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
lambda = { git = "https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime/", rev = "c8dbcd39e0b1cf9ecf395e2b2f9df6c6c0d97780" }
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_derive = "1"
serde_json = "1"

[features]
with-lambda = []

</sam@cvpartner.com></code></pre></div><p>Two noteworthy things:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>We’re using a version of the aws-lambda-rust-runtime that hasn’t officially been released. This isn’t ideal, and we’re eagerly awaiting a 0.3 release.</li><li>We have a features section, which is where we define the with-lambda feature we use in the Rust code shown above.<br></li></ol><p>Running our lambda now gives us the following:</p><div><pre><code>
$ cargo run -- ‘{ “name”: “Sam” }’
{ “message”: “Hello, Sam!” }

</code></pre></div><h2><strong>The Dockerfile</strong></h2><p>All of our lambdas build with the same Dockerfile. I’ll show it in all of its glory and then explain what’s going on bit by bit. Brace yourself.</p><div><pre><code>
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:experimental

FROM rust:latest as cargo-build

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install musl-tools -y

FROM alpine:latest
ARG name
COPY --from=cargo-build /usr/src/${name}/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/${name} /usr/local/bin/${name}

</code></pre></div><p>First of all, shout out to Shane Utt whose <a href="https://shaneutt.com/blog/rust-fast-small-docker-image-builds/">blog post</a> we used as a starting point for this.<br></p><p>The first line is a Docker directive that says we want to use some experimental Dockerfile syntax. The syntax in question is the --mount=type=ssh flag to the RUN commands, but we’ll talk about later.</p><div><pre><code>
FROM rust:latest as cargo-build
ARG name

</code></pre></div><p>This next bit says we want to use the latest Rust image, and we’re passing in a build arg called “name.” This is how we’re able to share this Dockerfile between all of our lambdas without having to modify it.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install musl-tools -y
RUN rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Next we run an update on the image, and we install <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a>. If you’re not familiar, musl is a libc replacement that you can link to statically. This means the resulting binary won’t depend on the system’s libc, which makes it more portable. It’s not a strict requirement for running on AWS Lambda, but it’s good practice.</p><div><pre><code>
WORKDIR /usr/src/${name}
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.toml
RUN mkdir src/
RUN echo "fn main() {println!(\"if you see this, the build broke\")}" &gt; src/main.rs

</code></pre></div><p>The next few lines set up a pseudo project, where the only things we’re going to compile are our dependencies and a dummy main.rs. The idea behind this is to use Docker’s layer caching to avoid having to compile our dependencies every build. This leads to significantly faster incremental builds in Docker.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com &gt; $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN test "$(cat $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts | ssh-keygen -lf -)" = "2048 SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8 github.com (RSA)"

</code></pre></div><p>Up until now, we’ve done exactly what Shane Utt did in his version of this. These three lines, though, are new. Because we use SSH to fetch private dependencies (more on this later), we would sometimes find that our builds would fail with the error “host key verification failed.” To get around that we pull down GitHub’s host keys and make sure they’re what we expect them to be based on the values <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints">here</a>.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Our first bit of experimental syntax! The --mount flag is a new thing introduced with the BuildKit engine for Docker, you can read about it in depth <a href="https://medium.com/@tonistiigi/build-secrets-and-ssh-forwarding-in-docker-18-09-ae8161d066">here</a>. The type=ssh bit is us telling Docker that we want to use an SSH agent for this command. In the docker build invocation, which we’ll see later, we can tell Docker what keys to add to this SSH agent.</p><p>The reason we do this is because it was the only way we could find that let us depend on private GitHub repositories in our Cargo.toml file, in a way that worked both locally and in CI. It means we can do this in our Cargo.toml file:</p><div><pre><code>
[dependencies]
private-library = { git = "ssh://github.com/cvpartner/private-library", tag = "1.0" }

</code></pre></div><p>And it Just Works<strong>™</strong>.</p><p>The rest of the RUN command is our first cargo build. It looks a lot scarier than it is. Most of it is us telling rustc to link against musl instead of the default libc. The only other interesting bit is the --features with-lambda. This matches up with the code we saw earlier to produce a binary that’s going to work properly when deployed in AWS.</p><div><pre><code>
RUN rm src/main.rs
COPY src/* src
RUN touch src/**
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo test --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
RUN --mount=type=ssh RUSTFLAGS=-Clinker=musl-gcc cargo build --features with-lambda --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

</code></pre></div><p>Next up, we’re copying over our actual source code. The touch command is necessary for cargo to realise the files are new, because when we created our dummy main.rs file earlier we created a new file with a timestamp later than the one on the real main.rs file. This is different to the approach taken by Shane Utt, as we found that approach would often result in builds where the dummy main.rs file was the one that ended up in the final build.</p><p>Another addition is the cargo test invocation. Tests are good!</p><div><pre><code>
FROM alpine:latest
ARG name
COPY --from=cargo-build /usr/src/${name}/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/${name} /usr/local/bin/${name}

</code></pre></div><p>Lastly we create a new build stage and copy over the final executable. The new build stage is in order to keep the final image small. Ours tend to clock in at around 8MB.<br></p><h2><strong>The build script</strong><br></h2><p>Invoking Docker is done in a shell script which is also identical for all of our lambdas.</p><div><pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e
set -x

DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &amp;&amp; pwd )"
cd $DIR

NAME=$(cat Cargo.toml | grep "name" | head -n 1 | sed -E 's/name = "(.*)"/\1/')

    &nbsp; — &nbsp;
    June 21, 2020
  </p>
  <p>I show how to use heterogeneous lists and traits to implement a type-safe printf in Rust. These mechanisms can ensure that two variadic argument lists share important properties, like the number of format string holes matches the number of printf arguments.</p>
  <p><em>Part of an ongoing series about type-level programming in Rust. Consider reading <a href="http://willcrichton.net/notes/type-level-programming/">part one</a> first! All code in this note can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/willcrichton/e7fcf1b0e84b4be7f172f0e0245cf149">this gist</a>.</em></p>

<p>Rust has a great printf function, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code></a>. It has a rich formatting language, but also catches mistakes at compile-time. For example, <code>println!</code> will check that the number of arguments matches the number of holes in the format string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: 2 positional arguments in format string, but there is 1 argument
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:36:13
   |
36 |   println!("{} {}", "Hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How does the Rust compiler make this check? Because both the format string and the argument are within the macro, Rust will check that the number of holes matches the number of arguments. Consequently, format strings <em>have</em> to be within the macro. If we write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"{} {}"</span><span>;</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>"hi"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: format argument must be a string literal
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:42:12
   |
42 |   println!(s, "hi");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ll show you how to implement type-safe printf without using procedural macros. More generally, this note contains a Rust recipe for functions where:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arguments are variadic</li>
  <li>Each argument can be a different type (<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> not allowed)</li>
  <li>Multiple variadic inputs share a parallel property, e.g. the number of arguments should match the number of format holes</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="core-mechanism-hlist">Core mechanism: HList</h2>

<p>First, we need to understand the main type-level mechanism: a heterogeneous list (or H-list). An H-list is a sequence of values of potentially different types. For example, <code>[1, "a", true]</code> is an H-list, but not a valid Rust vector. H-lists are implemented in Rust using a linked-list style:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>HNil</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Head</span><span>,</span> <span>Tail</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>Head</span><span>,</span>
  <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>Tail</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>let</span> <span>example</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>HNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>}};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key idea is that the type of an H-list changes every time you make a change to it. By contrast, if you push to a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, the type of the vector stays the same.</p>

<p>Just like Rust has <code>vec![]</code>, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/lloydmeta/frunk#hlist">frunk</a> crate to get an <code>hlist!</code> macro.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>];</span> <span>// same as above</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="setting-up-printf">Setting up printf</h2>

<p>Let’s go back to the ingredients of printf. We need a format string and an argument list. The key idea is to represent both with an H-list, and carefully use Rust’s traits to ensure our desired property: the number of arguments should match the number of holes.</p>

<p>First, to represent format strings, we will have a sequence of structs that represent each part of the string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>str</span><span>);</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Assume that we compile "Hello {}! The first prime is {}" into this code.</span>
<span>// That would be a simple syntactic transformation.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To represent arguments, we will use a matching H-list of values. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, our goal is to create a function <code>format</code> such that this is true:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this should be a compile-time (NOT run-time) error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"Only one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-format-trait">The Format trait</h2>

<p>In the spirit of type-level computation, we start by defining a trait.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <code>self</code> is the H-list of the format directives, and <code>ArgList</code> is the H-list of the variadic arguments. <code>Format</code> need to take <code>ArgList</code> as a type parameter, because its type will change as we remove elements from the <code>ArgList</code> list.</p>

<p>Now, we proceed to implement the <code>Format</code> trait by cases. First, the base case for reaching the end of the format list <code>HNil</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HNil</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>HNil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>""</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This impl says that when we reach the end of a format list, just return the empty string. And the only argument we will accept is an empty argument list. Combined with the next impls, this inductively ensures that extra arguments are not accepted.</p>

<p>Next, we will implement <code>FString</code>. This implementation should use the string constant contained in the <code>FString</code> struct, and combine it recursively with the rest of the format list. We don’t use variadic arguments for <code>FString</code>, so they get passed along. In Rust, this English specification becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FString</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.head</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.to_owned</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we have to add <code>FmtList: Format&lt;ArgList&gt;</code> to ensure the recursive call to <code>self.tail.format</code> works. Also note that we aren’t implementing <code>Format</code> directly on <code>FString</code>, but rather on an H-list containing <code>FString</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the most complex case, <code>FVar</code>. We want this impl to take an argument from the <code>ArgList</code>, then format the remaining format list with the remaining arguments.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>ToString</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>args</span><span>.head</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Be careful to observe which H-list is being accessed by <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>. Here, the <code>args</code> H-list provides the data to fill the hole via <code>args.head</code>.</p>

<h2 id="checking-our-properties">Checking our properties</h2>

<p>With this implementation, our correct example successfully compiles and runs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about our incorrect example? If we write this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"just one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:48:18
   |
48 |   example.format(hlist!["just one arg"]);
   |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |                  expected struct `Cons`, found struct `HNil`
   |
   = note: expected struct `HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;`
              found struct `HNil`
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the error is enigmatic, our mistake is at least correctly caught at compile-time. This is because Rust deduces that <code>example.format()</code> expects an H-list of the shape <code>HCons&lt;_, HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;&gt;</code>, but it finds <code>HNil</code> too soon in our 1-element H-list. A similar error occurs when providing too many args.</p>

<p>Stupendous! We have successfully implemented a type-safe printf using H-lists and traits.</p>

<h2 id="extending-our-abstraction">Extending our abstraction</h2>

<p>Right now, our <code>Format</code> function just checks that the format list and argument list are the same length. We could extend our format structures, for example to ensure that an <code>FVar</code> must be a particular type, or must use <code>Debug</code> vs. <code>Display</code>. Here’s the sketch of such a strategy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Add flags for whether using Display or Debug</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDebug</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use a type parameter with PhantomData to represent the intended type</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Now, T has to be the same between the format list and arg list</span>
<span>// Also, FDisplay flag requires that `T: Display`</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Display</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// using format! is cheating, but you get the idea</span>
    <span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Similar impl for `T: Debug` when `FDebug` is used</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this approach, if our format list and arg list differ in type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"n: "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>)];</span>
<span>fmt</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"not a number"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the code will not compile with the error, <code>&amp;'static str is not i32</code>.</p>

<p>Shout-out to <a href="https://www.servant.dev/posts/2018-07-12-servant-dsl-typelevel.html">this blog post</a> from Haskell’s servant framework which got me thinking about adapting their strategy into Rust.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><article><p>React Components for wrapping content often use the <code>children</code> pattern. For example, this <code>&lt;Card&gt;</code> wraps the text "Hello World":</p><p>The size of the <code>&lt;Card&gt;</code> could be set with a prop:</p><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>Card</span><span> </span><span>size</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>large</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Hello World</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Card</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div><p>This pattern works if <code>&lt;Card&gt;</code> has just one content section but not if it has multiple. In that case the content might be provided by <code>props</code> instead of <code>children</code>:</p><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>Card</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>size</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>large</span><span>"</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>title</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>Hello World</span><span>"</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>subtitle</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>This is a basic example</span><span>"</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>/&gt;</span></code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately this makes unfamiliar components hard to understand since prop might configure the appearance of the <code>&lt;Card&gt;</code> or defines its content.

</span><span></span><span>/&gt;</span></code></pre></div><p>The <em>Named Children</em> pattern helps with the mixing of concerns. Instead of setting <code>children</code> as content it's set as an object that maps section names to content. This approach separates content from config making it easier to guess each prop's purpose.</p><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>Card</span><span> </span><span>size</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>large</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>

<p>There are three types of infrastructure. One is visible: roads, dams and bridges. The second is invisible: broadband internet provisions and the entirety of our cellular infrastructure. Both are still vital in building our present. The third form of infrastructure is one being rebuilt in order to be repurposed for future use. I explained in <em>J-Curves and Agglomeration</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Postal Service is a key component of the eCommerce economy. Packages are just 5% of its shipping volume but eCommerce accounts for nearly 30% of the agency’s revenue. Partnerships with vendors like Amazon (or providers like FedEx and UPS) provide a majority of its package volume but small businesses and direct-to-consumer brands rely on USPS’ pricing. Raising costs on retailers may lead to more attrition. […]</p>
<p>By raising prices to combat Amazon’s growing influence over the economy, disrupting the postal economy is no different than digging up paved roads before a period of heightened freight transit. [<a href="https://2pml.com/2020/05/18/agglomeration/">2PM, 1</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Postal Service is all three. When an American institution is 250 years old, it may as well be the ground that we stand on. The service has contributed services and innovations that we don’t readily attribute to it. Consider its contribution to the middle class: the U.S. Postal Service is one the country’s biggest employers with nearly 330,000 career employees and an average salary of $50,000. They are building the future of eCommerce, a still-nascent industry.</p>
<p>Critics of the USPS will cite cost of labor as a reason for the service’s obsolescence. A common refrain is “Why couldn’t Amazon takeover the service?” Consider that in the fourth quarter of 2019, eCommerce was just 11.9% of all retail. Amazon constituted right under half of that volume. And without the postal service, Amazon would not exist. The market costs of shipment subsidized a number of Amazon’s operations, allowing it to capture market share.</p>
<h2>“The Ground We Stand On”</h2>
<p>The postal service began before the founding of the United States. Benjamin Franklin was fired from his role as postmaster due to his involvement with the American Revolution. Just one year later in 1775, the Continental Congress appointed Franklin the Postmaster General of the “United Colonies.” His tenure left a mail system that offered service between the then-colonies and Great Britain. By 1802, the first African-Americans to work for the Postal Service were enslaved mail carriers. Senator James Jackson of Georgia, Chairman of the Committee of the Senate on the Post Office Establishment, once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>… The most active and intelligent [slaves] are employed as post riders. By travelling from day to day, and hourly mixing with people […] they will acquire information. They will learn that a man’s rights do not depend on his color. They will, in time, become teachers to their brethren.</p></blockquote>
<p>Within two months of Senator Jackson’s proclamation, African-Americans would be banned from the postal service, lasting from 1802 to March 1865, just one month before the conclusion of the Civil War. This disbarment ended by congressional decree.</p>
<blockquote><p>No person, by reason of color, shall be disqualified from employment in carrying the mails. (13 Stat. 515)</p></blockquote>
<p>The next decades would see an unparalleled push for African-American financial stability. Nearly 800 would serve as postal employees prior to the 20th century. More than 200 African Americans are known to have served in the high rank of postmaster prior to the conclusion of Reconstruction and the Progressive Era (1863-1920). Of them, nearly 20 were women. The postal service has always been politicized.</p>
<p>Soon after, the U.S. Government expanded on the postal service’s role in democratizing America, both literally and figuratively. President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt expanded on this with the <em>Square Deal</em> in 1902, communicating a fairness policy in hiring and leadership. The result was momentous for many. Roosevelt stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is and should be my consistent policy in every State, where their numbers warranted it, to recognize colored men of good repute and standing in making appointments to office. […] I can not consent to take the position that the door of hope – the door of opportunity – is to be shut upon any man, no matter how worthy, purely upon the grounds of race or color. <a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/african-american-workers-20thc.htm#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, 21% (or nearly 70,000) of the agency’s employees are African-American. However, the postal service was consequential beyond matters of social equity. By 1823, the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Government established 80,000 miles of “post roads” to help carriers navigate new rural areas. By 1860, these roads connected nearly 28,000 post offices. Today, the postal service maintains nearly 40,000 post offices, clearing 212 billion letters and mail to 144 million homes.</p>

<p>Today, the service is tasked with another generational shift: supporting online retail. The pandemic shifted the American consumer towards online retail, this while reducing the number of units shipped. As such, companies like UPS and FedEx have responded by hiking prices. In response to USPS’ distress, FedEx recently stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mail volumes and mix resulting in a further decrease in revenues and negative financial impact for the USPS. Additionally, the USPS continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations.</p>

<p>Cost inflation is the most concerning obstacle ahead for digitally native retailers. Without the treatment that the United States’ oldest civilian service afforded Amazon in its infancy, it will be more difficult to build more businesses of Amazon’s scale. The economics were difficult enough as is; these added costs will only add pressure to pass along costs to consumers, many of whom are facing down one of the most economically vulnerable periods since 2008.We should consider the postal service an investment into our present and future and a monument to our past.</p>
<p>If our economy is to begin addressing the shortfalls caused by the overwhelming contraction in the traditional retail industry, it will need the support of the postal service. For eCommerce, their service is the industry’s last mile for thousands of direct-to-consumer small businesses. The postal service uniquely sits at the intersection of our physical roads and our digital infrastructure. There isn’t a direct substitute and we shouldn’t wait to find out the hard way. Save the USPS. We will need more companies like the the successful hundreds that were built on its 250 year old infrastructure. That includes Amazon.</p>

Trump doesn’t like TikTok. He doesn’t like Tik-Tok because of the Chinese. Apparently, they use it for espionage. That’s why he wants the app banned in the United States. He also wants to ban the WeChat app. He has already issued a decree to do this. (<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/trump-tik-tok-verfuegung-101.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Analyst-Trump-Verfuegung-gegen-WeChat-schaedigt-iPhone-Geschaeft-4866876.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>)</p><p>TikTok is a video app. Entertainment on the go. WeChat is an app for communication and even with payment function. Mainly used in China.</p><p>I am over 40 years young. I had already heard TikTok. But I have never used it. I do not have the time for that. A few days ago, a visitor came to see my daughter. The girl had TikTok on her smartphone. She explained the app to me and I observed how it was used.</p><p>I had made a judgement very quickly. I have to test TikTok. Installed on my test phone and started. At the beginning you choose a few categories to get started. I chose humorous, learning and society. The consumption of videos should finally bring me some value. The good thing is that everyone of you can test the app that way. A registration beyond this level is not necessary for the consumption. Only those who want more would have to open an account.</p><p>I had planned to test TikTok for two hours. It should already be one movie length to make a judgement. If my daughter’s classmates use this app, she will sooner or later come across TikTok as well.</p><p>I have given myself the additional task of keeping a tally sheet. I wanted to know how many videos I watch in the two hours and how many videos I have to laugh or take something positive with me. It is not about casual laughter when there is a small funny scene, but hearty, beautiful laughter. Knowledge must trigger an eye-opening effect.</p><p>And so it began … and I was there for 24 minutes. After that I was completely exhausted.</p><p>I consumed 74 videos. I laughed once.</p><p>TikTok is continuous bombardment with short videos. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stalin organ</a> of entertainment. You can really feel how big parts of your own brain explode and are useless afterwards.</p><p>TikTok is the cruelest app, the worst entertainment I have ever experienced. I have seen different actors performing the same sketch. I’ve seen German stars in bad performances. I’ve seen people acting as if they already have no brain at all. I’ve seen young people acting as if they were the children of adults who have no brains. It was a culture shock.</p><p>I can’t explain how bad, how underground, how primitive the content if TikTok is. Respect for every TikTok entertainer who produces trash every day and finds fans who give him presents for it. I don’t know if it should be the goal of life to produce trash, but 24 minutes showed me that nuclear waste is less toxic than the contents on TikTok.</p><p>TikTok does not exist in our household. The domains are blocked in the router. It is completely irresponsible to let underaged people use this app. At Apple and in the Google Play Store the app is listed from 12 years of age. And just like my daughter, however, the visitor was younger than 12 years. And according to her, many of her classmates use this app. Do parents buy their children smartphones to turn them into zombies on purpose? Terrifying. TikTok is proof that parents who don’t monitor their children’s online use must be severely punished.</p><p>TikTok should not be banned for fear of Chinese espionage. TikTok should be banned for being stupid on a massive scale. A realistic classification would be from the age of 18. Then it would be ensured that ex-minors can only go through this garbage dump of do-it-yourself entertainment when it can be assumed that they have developed a few brain cells.</p><p>If you have never tested TikTok, but there are people in the household who consume the contents, then inform yourself. Be prepared, however, that you will start to doubt the viability of some TikTokers and especially the users. And if not, I wish you a happy life, but please never go to a democratic election.</p><p>TikTok? Never!</p> <p><span>Tagged <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/app/" rel="tag">App</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/diy/" rel="tag">diy</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/entertainment/" rel="tag">entertainment</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/minors/" rel="tag">minors</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/smartphone/" rel="tag">Smartphone</a>, <a href="https://kowabit.de/tag/tiktok/" rel="tag">tiktok</a></span></p></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522776851755-3914469f0ca2?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;h=500&amp;q=80"></p>

<p>I noticed something odd today while working on two different Ruby codebases. This simple line of Ruby behaved differently in both applications:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"luck"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"L`auguste"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Executing <code>"luck".casecmp("L`auguste")</code> in application A returned <code>-1</code>, while executing it in application B returned <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>â€œDid the alphabet change at some point and I didnâ€™t get the memo?â€�, I thought.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Aside</strong></p>

  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/String.html#method-i-casecmp"><code>String#casecmp</code></a> is a built-in Ruby method that returns <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>nil</code> depending on whether the object on which itâ€™s called is less than, equal to, or greater than the function argument, and it does so in case-insensitive fashion. Here are a few simple examples of how it behaves:</p>

  <div><div><pre><code><span>"aBcDeF"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"abcde"</span><span>)</span>     <span>#=&gt; 1</span>
<span>"aBcDeF"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"abcdef"</span><span>)</span>    <span>#=&gt; 0</span>
<span>"aBcDeF"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"abcdefg"</span><span>)</span>   <span>#=&gt; -1</span>
<span>"abcdef"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"ABCDEF"</span><span>)</span>    <span>#=&gt; 0</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="looking-for-monkey-patches">Looking for monkey patches</h2>

<p>Seeing as one of the applications is built on top of Ruby of Rails and the other isnâ€™t, my first thought was that maybe there was a Rails and/or ActiveSupport patch on <code>String#casecmp</code> that would change the behavior of this line in one of the applications. However, I didnâ€™t find anything that pointed to this. I kept digging, hoping to maybe find a patch in the <em>other</em> application that could explain this difference in behavior. Again, I didnâ€™t find anything. ðŸ™ˆ</p>

<h2 id="different-rubies">Different Rubies</h2>

<p>Eventually, after exploring a bit more, I realized that both applications ran on different versions of Ruby: application A was on Ruby 2.6, while application B was using Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>Running the same command on both versions of Ruby indeed gives us different results:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>~/.rubies/ruby-2.6.6/bin/ruby <span>-e</span> <span>'puts "luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")'</span>
<span>-1</span>

<span>$ </span>~/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby <span>-e</span> <span>'puts "luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")'</span>
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ah ha! Weâ€™re getting closer. While I could have called it a day here and simply updated application B to Ruby 2.7 to resolve the issue, I wanted to understand: what causes it?</p>

<h2 id="changelogs--bindingpry">Changelogs &amp; <code>binding.pry</code></h2>

<p>I then started to comb through Ruby changelogs, trying to find if anything changed between Ruby 2.6 and Ruby 2.7 for <code>String#casecmp</code>, or anything somehow related to string comparison. I didnâ€™t find anything.</p>

<p>Of course, it would be nice to debug this using <code>binding.pry</code> or other similar Ruby-level debugging tools by stepping into the <code>String#casecmp</code> call to see whatâ€™s going on inside. However, this doesnâ€™t get us very far, as trying to use Rubyâ€™s <code>Tracer</code> or <code>binding.pry</code> doesnâ€™t really help.</p>

<p>Running this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>ruby <span>-r</span> tracer <span>-e</span> <span>'"luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>â€¦ returns this output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#0:-e:1::-: "luck".casecmp("L`Auguste")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>â€¦ and not much else. Thatâ€™s because <code>String#casecmp</code> is implemented in C, directly inside MRIâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/string.c"><code>string.c</code></a>, so thereâ€™s no actual Ruby code underneath <code>String#casecmp</code> that we can step into using Ruby-level debugging tools.</p>

<p>Here comes the GDB part: because weâ€™re essentially dealing with C code at this point, we can use GDB to understand what happens inside the call to <code>String#casecmp</code>. So with that, I fired up GDB for the first time in years (I typically work with Ruby, so GDB is not something I commonly use).</p>

<h2 id="identifying-the-root-cause-using-gdb">Identifying the root cause using GDB</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s see how to use GDB to understand why both Ruby 2.6 and Ruby 2.7 behave differently with the same input to <code>String#casecmp</code>.</p>

<p>I first prepared a simple Ruby file containing the source that replicates the issue:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># ~/casecmp.rb</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"luck"</span><span>.</span><span>casecmp</span><span>(</span><span>"L`Auguste"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the second character in the input to <code>casecmp</code> is a backtick (<code>`</code>), which has ASCII code 96. This is relevant for paragraphs below.</p>

<h3 id="in-ruby-270">In Ruby 2.7.0</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s start by firing up GDB with a self-compiled version of Ruby 2.7.0:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>gdb /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby
Reading symbols from /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we add a breakpoint on the <code>str_casecmp</code> function so execution pauses once we reach it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) break str_casecmp
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1001fa766: file string.c, line 3371.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perfect. Weâ€™re now ready to run the <code>casecmp.rb</code> Ruby script from above.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) run casecmp.rb
Starting program: /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.7.0/bin/ruby casecmp.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We eventually hit the breakpoint we just set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Thread 2 hit Breakpoint 1, str_casecmp (str1=4329352680, str2=4329352640) at string.c:3371
3371	    enc = rb_enc_compatible(str1, str2);
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Aside</strong></p>

  <p>Internally, <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/4318aba9c94ebff53e4168886e1a35a24013924f/string.c#L3467-L3468"><code>String#str_casecmp</code></a> is quite simple: it iterates over each character in both inputs by index starting from the first character, converting both characters to the same case so that the function behaves in a case-insensitive way, and returns early if the two currently considered characters from each input are different. In doing so, it determines which character is â€œbiggerâ€� than the other using the character code (an <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII code table</a> is a useful asset to have nearby for the rest of this blog post).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Ruby 2.7.0, notice that the case conversion <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/e9e4f8430a62f56a4e62dd728f4498ee4c300c12/string.c#L3381-L3382">converts both inputs to lowercase using <code>TOLOWER</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>p1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>p1end</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>p2</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>p2end</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>p1</span> <span>!=</span> <span>*</span><span>p2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>c1</span> <span>=</span> <span>TOLOWER</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>p1</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xff</span><span>);</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>c2</span> <span>=</span> <span>TOLOWER</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>p2</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xff</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>c1</span> <span>!=</span> <span>c2</span><span>)</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>INT2FIX</span><span>(</span><span>c1</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>c2</span> <span>?</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>p1</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>p2</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After navigating in <code>str_casecmp</code> using <code>next</code> a few times, we enter the loop and arrive at a point where we can print <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code>, which are the codes for the characters at the current index for both inputs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3382	                unsigned int c2 = TOLOWER(*p2 &amp; 0xff);
(gdb) print c1
$11 = 108
(gdb) next
3383	                if (c1 != c2)
(gdb) print c2
$12 = 108
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the buffers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c1
 â†“
108  ?   ?   ?
 l   u   c   k

108  ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?
 l   `   a   u   g   u   s   t   e
 â†‘
c2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>108 is the decimal ASCII character code representation for the first letter of both inputs: <code>l</code> (lowercase â€œLâ€�), so the loop continues to the next iteration because <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> are the same.</p>

<p>On the second iteration of the loop (on the second character of both inputs), we get the following results:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3382	                unsigned int c2 = TOLOWER(*p2 &amp; 0xff);
(gdb) print c1
$14 = 117
(gdb) next
3383	                if (c1 != c2)
(gdb) print c2
$16 = 96
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the buffers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    c1
     â†“
108 117  ?   ?
 l   u   c   k

108  96  ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?
 l   `   a   u   g   u   s   t   e
     â†‘
     c2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>c1</code> contains <code>117</code>, which is the decimal ASCII character code representation for <code>u</code>, while <code>96</code> (in <code>c2</code>) is the character code for a backtick (<code>`</code>). We then enter the <code>if (c1 != c2)</code> conditional, and the return value is <code>1</code> because <code>c1 &gt; c2</code> (<code>117 &gt; 96</code>).</p>

<p>Okay. So far so good. This lines up with the initial observation of the issue. How are things different in Ruby 2.6.6?</p>

<h3 id="in-ruby-266">In Ruby 2.6.6</h3>

<p>We do almost the same setup as above (same one-line Ruby script to replicate the issue, same breakpoint on <code>str_casecmp</code>), but we fire up GDB with Ruby 2.6.6:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>gdb /Users/maximevaillancourt/.rubies/ruby-2.6.6/bin/ruby

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Letâ€™s look at the loop we presented above in Ruby 2.7.0, but <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/a9a48e6a741f048766a2a287592098c4f6c7b7c7/string.c#L3413-L3414">in Ruby 2.6.6</a> this time:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that instead of using <code>TOLOWER</code> as in Ruby 2.7.0, Ruby 2.6.6 uses <code>TOUPPER</code>. Interesting.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s fast-forward to the part where we get to <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> for the second character in the input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3414			unsigned int c2 = TOUPPER(*p2 &amp; 0xff);
(gdb) next
3415	                if (c1 != c2)
(gdb) print c1
$5 = 85
(gdb) print c2
$6 = 96
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the buffers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>     c1
     â†“
108  85  ?   ?
 L   U   C   K

108  96  ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?
 L   `   A   U   G   U   S   T   E
     â†‘
     c2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>c1</code> is <code>85</code>, which is the character code for <code>U</code>, and <code>c2</code> is <code>96</code> (just like in Ruby 2.7.0), which is the character code for a backtick (<code>`</code>).</p>

<p>This time though, the comparison result is different, because <code>c1 &lt; c2</code> (<code>85 &lt; 96</code>), so <code>str_casecmp</code> returns <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p>There it is: because Ruby 2.6 uses <code>TOUPPER</code> and Ruby 2.7 uses <code>TOLOWER</code> before comparing the inputs, and because one of the characters to compare is a backtick (<code>`</code>, which canâ€™t be converted to uppercase or lowercase in any way), the other characterâ€™s code â€œmovesâ€� differently around the â€œfixedâ€� backtick character code, affecting the result of the <code>String#casecmp</code> function.</p>

<hr>

<p>To summarize, the root cause of the issue is that <code>String#casecmp</code> was updated in Ruby 2.7 to <strong>lowercase</strong> the two inputs before comparing them, while Ruby 2.6 used to <strong>uppercase</strong> the two inputs before comparing them. <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/082424ef58116db9663a754157d6c441d60fd101#diff-7a2f2c7dfe0bf61d38272aeaf68ac768">This is the commit where this change was introduced.</a></p>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve lived in my house for just under two years. Last summer, I noticed something strange. Our electricity bill increased by 40-90% depending on the month. This year, I finally tracked it down and discovered our meter was being mixed up with our neighbor’s. Here’s how I tracked this down and what you can do to prevent it from happening to you.</p>



<p>I have an amateur interest in electricity, conserving energy, and energy efficiency in general. I care about my carbon footprint, as well as my bill, and I’m passionate about innovation in this space. I’ve made it a habit to have a good idea of how much electricity different appliances use and, in general, I try to be aware of where my electricity is going. Years ago, I bought a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_A_Watt">Kill A Watt</a> to quickly get an idea of how much power things use.</p>



<p>The first time I noticed a problem was when we got our July bill in the summer of 2019. It was about 40% higher than usual. My grandparents stayed with us (in their motorhome) for a week that month, and their motorhome has a big air conditioner, so I chalked it up to that, though that still seemed high.</p>

<p>A couple months passed and the problem got worse. It went from 40% higher than normal, to a peak of about 90%. I couldn’t explain that. We don’t have central air conditioning. Most of our heavy appliances use natural gas. We did use a portable air conditioner briefly, but never for more than a couple hours a night. I also measured the power usage of the A/C and thought, there’s no way this adds up. This confusion continued until we got our October bill and it returned to normal, and I forgot about it for another year.</p>



<p>And…it came back! I first noticed this year in June when the bill jumped about 20%. I figure it’s reasonable for the bill to fluctuate a little, but not by that much. Plus, what made even less sense is that we used supplemental electric heating this winter, so if anything, our bill should’ve been higher in the winter! Again, no central air conditioning, so another unexplained bill. I tracked power usage on everything I could think of, to make sure I hadn’t missed something. For awhile, my big suspect was our fridge. It’s 18 years old, so I figured, maybe there’s a problem with it and it uses more power when it should, especially when the ambient temperature is higher. I cleaned the coils and played around with the fridge settings, then waited for our next bill. It got worse.</p>

<p>This year, I noticed our power company has a cool interface online where you can see your daily power usage. Very handy. I noticed that, in non-summer months, it was very consistent, ranging between 9-12 kWh per day. Then, in the summer months, it just goes all over the place. Sometimes it was 8, other days it went as high as 24! This seemed loosely correlated with the temperature but I just couldn’t explain that, due to a lack of central cooling in our house. I finally decided to call the power company at this point. Naturally, they did not take me too seriously, and were fairly insistent that it was my air conditioning (that I didn’t have). I was told to hire an electrician to investigate.</p>

<p>Then it got weirder. In late July, I noticed that in recent weeks, our daily power usage (according to the power company) dipped as low as 1 kWh per day! That’s just not possible, I thought. My electronics, combined, should use more than that per day, not even counting heavier users like the fridge. The power usage still fluctuated quite a bit, but there were several days where the power usage was as low as 1-3 kWh. I called the power company again and, no surprise, they took this much more seriously and agreed that wasn’t possible. I insisted that the peaks in usage didn’t make sense either, that I couldn’t explain those, but no luck there…they were really only interested in the low days and said they were opening an investigation that could take “at least a few weeks” to finish.</p>



<p>One night, I finally put it together. I wondered if my bill was mixed up with my neighbor’s. My neighbor had moved out in July, and that’s about when the daily power usage fell to almost nothing. I also happened to know that they have central air conditioning. I looked at my bill and noticed it actually has the meter number on it, very helpful! I looked at my meter and the number on the bill wasn’t even remotely close. It wasn’t off-by-one. The format looked consistent, but the values looked randomized. I was wondering whether I was even looking at the right number. So, the next morning, I took a look at my neighbor’s (vacant) house’s meter. Sure enough, it exactly matched what was on my bill.</p>

<p>A few frustrating phone calls later (not important), and the issue is fixed. We got the charges corrected and are enjoying a large credit on our account that ought to last us about 6 months (after having lived here only 2 years).</p>

<p>In any future house I live in, I will be sure to check that my bill’s meter number matches what’s on the property. I highly recommend everyone do the same, because I get the impression this is fairly common. A quick search online and I found about half a dozen news articles about this happening, often more egregious cases than my own. Most of us may not notice a mixup, either because the usage is fairly consistent or we just don’t know how much power we use. Thankfully, you should be able to check the accuracy of your bill in about 5 minutes if your meter is easily accessible. Simply look for the meter number on your bill (hopefully all power companies give this info), and then look physically at the meter for a sticker from your power company, and see if the numbers match.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In machine learning, we typically work with input pairs (x, y), and we try to figure out how x and y depend on each other.
To do so, we gather many such pairs and hope that the dependence will reveal itself if a) we have enough data, b) our model is expressive enough to approximate this dependency, and c) we get the hyperparameters right.
In the simplest case, both x and y are just scalar values (or vectors \(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\)); for example, given some measurements of a plant’s shape, we might want to predict its species. The measurements here are real vectors \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}\), where the input space \(\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d\) is usually Euclidean, and the species is a label \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}\) (usually an integer or a one-hot vector), but it is common for \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\) to have more structure.</p>

<p>One of the main assumptions we rely on is that the pairs of (x, y) points are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables</a>.
Let us unpack this a bit, starting from the end,</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>random variable</code>: there exists some stochastic generative process from which the variables were randomly sampled,</li>
  <li><code>identically</code>: all samples come from the same probability distribution,</li>
  <li><code>independent</code>: the generative process has no memory of generated samples, and hence any generated sample does not change the distribution over future generated samples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any structure in \(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\), or both introduces constraints, and a successful application of an algorithm to a particular problem does heavily depend on whether or not this algorithm takes the relevant constraints into account.
A common constraint in image-related problems is translation equivariance<sup id="fnref:cnnequiv" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cnnequiv">1</a></sup>—the output of the algorithm should shift with any shifts applied to the image (you can read more about equvariances in <a href="https://fabianfuchsml.github.io/equivariance1of2/">this excellent blog post</a>).
In natural language-related problems, a typical constraint is causality: a token at position t can depend on any previous tokens at position 1:t-1, but it cannot depend on any future tokens<sup id="fnref:languecausality" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:languecausality">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In the above examples, the dependencies between points (e.g., autoregressive dependence in NLP) are clear from the context.
However, if a data point is not a vector, matrix, or a sequence of vectors, but it is a <strong>set of vectors</strong>, these dependencies become less clear.
In particular, elements in an input set resemble elements in a dataset (i.e., lack of order), but the critical difference is that they are <strong>not independent</strong>, therefore breaking the i.i.d. assumption.
Accounting for this specific structure in inputs or outputs of an ML model leads to a family of set learning problems, which have recently gained considerable attention in the machine learning community.
I thought it would be useful to delve into the machine learning of sets.
In the following, we will consider set-to-vector, vector-to-set, and set-to-set problems and provide implementations of simple algorithms in <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku">haiku</a>.</p>

<p>First some imports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import haiku as hk
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>Before we start, it is useful to introduce some notation.
Let \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) be an input vector, \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^k\) the output vector, and let \(X = \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^M\) and \(Y = \{\mathbf{y}_j\}_{j=1}^N\) be sets of \(M\) and \(N\) elements, respectively.
Note that, until now, \(y\) or \(\mathbf{y}\) were simply labels.
From now on, however, \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\) can live in the same space, and simply be elements of different sets.
I will also use \(\mathcal{L}(X, Y)\) as a loss function operating on two sets, and \(l(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})\) will be a loss function for pairs of elements.</p>


<p>This is perhaps the simplest set-learning problem since it only requires permutation invariance.
A function \(f\) is invariant to permutations \(\pi\) if \(\forall \pi\): \(f(X) = f(\pi X)\).
Permutation invariance has always been known in machine learning, as loss functions we use almost never<sup id="fnref:acn" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:acn">3</a></sup> depend on the ordering of elements in our datasets or minibatches.
This is not for the lack of order: to create a minibatch, we stack multiple data elements in an array; this pairs every element in the minibatch with its minibatch index, therefore implicitly creating an order.
Loss functions tend to discard information about the order, usually by taking the mean over data examples.
We can create permutation-invariant functions by following a similar logic.</p>

<p>Examples in a minibatch are processed independently (which reflects their i.i.d. nature), but if each entry in the minibatch contains more than just a single data point (many pixels in an image, points in a point cloud, tokens in a language sentence), then flattening these points into a vector and feeding it into an MLP or a CNN results in different parameters being used for processing different data points, and hence order is used implicitly; feeding the points into an RNN reuses parameters, but introduces an explicit dependence on the order.</p>

<p>A straightforward solution to this issue is to treat points in a single example in the same way we treat examples in the minibatch: treat them independently.
This approach, followed by a permutation-invariant pooling operation such as max or mean pooling, is explored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114">Zaheer et al., “Deep Sets”, NeurIPS 2017</a> and is proven to be a universal set-function approximator<sup id="fnref:deepsetdim" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:deepsetdim">4</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>class DeepSet(hk.Module):

  def __init__(self, encoder, decoder):
    super().__init__()
    self._encoder = encoder
    self._decoder = decoder
    
  def __call__(self, x):
    """Compute the DeepSet embedding.

    Args:
      x: Tensor of shape [batch_size, n_elems, n_dim].
    """
    return self._decoder(self._encoder(x).mean(1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While newer approaches with better empirical performance exist, they all draw from the Deep Sets framework<sup id="fnref:setembeddings" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:setembeddings">5</a></sup>.
Another factor contributing to the fact that the set-to-vector problem is quite easy is that pooling operations naturally work with variable-sized sets–there is nothing extra we have to do to handle sets of variable cardinality.
This is not the case in the following two problems, where we have to take the set size into account explicitly.</p>


<p>In vector-to-set, the task is to generate a set of real vectors from some (usually vector-valued) conditioning.</p>

<p>The majority of approaches out there focus on generating ordered sequences instead of unordered sets, and usually of fixed or at least known size.
This allows using MLPs<sup id="fnref:setae" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:setae">6</a></sup> and RNNs<sup id="fnref:order_matters" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:order_matters">7</a></sup> to predict fixed- and variable-length sets, respectively, but at the price of having to learn permutation-equivariance from data.
Learning permutation-equivariance can be induced by data augmentation. It is easy to generate different permutations, but usually comes at a decreased performance and/or longer training times compared to truly permutation-equivariant methods<sup id="fnref:data_augmentation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:data_augmentation">8</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  def set_mlp(conditioning, decoder, n_elements):
    """Predicts a set.

    Args:
      conditioning: tensor of shape [batch_size, n_dim].
      decoder: callable, e.g. an MLP.
      n_elements: int.
    """
    z = decoder(conditioning)
    batch_size = conditioning.shape[0]
    # all we can do here is reshape!
    return z.reshape(batch_size, n_elements, -1)

  def set_rnn(conditioning, state, rnn, n_elements):
    """Predicts a set.

    Args:
      conditioning: tensor of shape [batch_size, n_dim].
      state: initial state for the rnn.
      rnn: rnn core.
      n_elements: int.
    """
    zs = []
    for _ in range(n_elements):
      z, state = rnn(conditioning, state)
      zs.append(z[:, None])  # add an axis

    return jnp.concatenate(zs, 1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="permutation-invariant-loss-functions">Permutation-Invariant Loss Functions</h4>
<p>Learning to generate sets based on some conditioning typically requires scoring that set against the conditioning.
If we have ground-truth sets at our disposal, we can compare the generated sets against the ground-truth ones for the same conditioning.
This can take the form of supervised learning (think of detecting objects in an image, where we need to generate a set of bounding boxes) or unsupervised learning (autoencoding point-clouds, say).
Since we generally have no guarantee that the generated sets will obey any ordering (why should they?), we have to apply losses invariant to that ordering.
We have two options here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can find an optimal matching between two sets<sup id="fnref:bipartite_matching" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bipartite_matching">9</a></sup>, which comes down to finding a permutation \(\pi\) of one of the sets that minimizes the computed loss, that is: \(\pi^\star = \arg \min_\pi \mathcal{L}( \pi X, Y)\), with \(\mathcal{L}( \pi X, Y) = \sum_i l(\mathbf{x}_{\pi(i)}, \mathbf{y}_i)\). This can be done exactly using the cubic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm">Hungarian matching</a> algorithm, or approximately using e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1925">optimal-transport</a>- or <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~bayati/papers/bpmwmIT.pdf">message-passing</a>-based algorithms.</li>
  <li>Instead of finding a matching, we can find a lower bound on what the matched loss would be. A popular choice here is the Chamfer loss<sup id="fnref:chamfer" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:chamfer">10</a></sup>, which computes \(\sum_{x \in X} \min_{y \in Y} l(x, y) + \sum_{y \in Y} \min_{x \in X} l(x, y)\). For every element in one set, it finds the element in the other set that results in the lowest pairwise loss. This loss does not work for multisets as elements can be repeated.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we do not have ground-truth for each conditioning (we have just sets), or if we have many possible sets for each conditioning (e.g., a group of possible sets for one of a few labels), we can instead learn by matching distributions e.g., in the GAN setting.
If we take this approach, we have two problems, really: that of vector-to-set for the generator and set-to-vector for the discriminator. 
Fortunately, we know how to solve the set-to-vector problem with a permutation-invariant neural net, and shortly I am going to describe some permutation-equivariant methods for generation.
This is precisely what we recently explored in <a href="https://oolworkshop.github.io/program/ool_32.html">Stelzner et al., “Generative Adversarial Set Transformers”, ICML 2020 Object-Oriented Learning Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, sometimes we have to deal with a set of latent variables inside a model. For example in …</p></div></div>

If you want to create a truly open standard, you _need_ to make it simple.

There are no exceptions to this rule. When a standard becomes harder to fully implement than what your average motivated programmer can do in two months (max!), it _shouldn't_ be considered "open" anymore.

Why?

</p>
<h2>Complicated Standards Lead to Implementation Monopolies</h2>
<p>Since implementing a complex standard is hard, you will eventually end up with the implementation that started the earliest and maintained since, being the only implementation that is actually usable. And that implementation will most likely be the one created by the standard's creators.

In cases where the standard's creators don't maintain an implementation like "the web"⁰, the only choices are either the standard dying out because of it's complexity, or the actively maintained implementations requiring tons of effort, with (most likely) companies backing said implementations.

</p>
<h2>Implementation Monopolies Lead to Extensions</h2>
<p>If a big implementation just decides one day that your standard is lacking, they can just extend the parts they want. The two outcomes of this being that:

</p>
<ul><li>The other implementations copy their extensions</li>
<li>That one implementation getting more users, and eventually, a near monopoly because of a bigger feature set</li></ul>
<p>
At that point, the "standard" implemented by said implementations is longer the actual defined standard, but because people will inevitably use the said extensions, any new implementation that wants to be considered usable will eventually need to support said proprietary extensions.

</p>
<h2>Too Many Extensions Spoil The Standard</h2>
<p>Even if you have an "open" extension system, where implementations can all propose and agree on extensions to the standard, you need to be able to keep those implementations in check, so their extensions don't overcomplicate the standard.

Remember: Having a simple standard with a million extensions is no better than a complex standard with no extensions.

</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Please note that I will be skipping the elephant in the room: "the web", as it has been discussed _to death_.

</p>
<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>Matrix is _technically_ an open standard. But because of the complexity it has accumulated over the years, Synapse is the only usable server implementation. Even Dendrite, the new implementation by *the same folk that created the standard*, is barely usable after _years_.

The same applies to Matrix clients, with Element being the only usable client implementation. That space definitely seems healthier than the server space, but the same issues are there.

</p>
<h3>Various Programming Languages</h3>
<p>I will not be specifying any language, as I might get any specifics incorrect, but a general pattern I have seen is that most programming languages have only a few compiler/interpreter implementations, even though the language is standardized in some form.

This example actually has some interesting reasoning behind this issue on top of the complicated standards:

</p>
<ul><li>Writing a compiler/interpreter can be hard.</li>
<li>Especially if the current implementations do optimizations or other "clever" tricks.</li></ul>
<p>
These issues can devolve into arguments regarding seeing the complexity of these issues as a part of the standard, and other "technology is too complicated in general" arguments, which I will not dive into here.

</p>
<h3>X Display Server</h3>
<p>The X Display Server standard got so complicated, the people developing it decided to abandon it entirely and create Wayland.

It probably didn't help that most of the standard was no longer being used, and a lot of extensions are required for its use today.

Wayland probably will also suffer the "too many extensions" problem at some point, so I am looking forward to that too...

</p>
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p>0: Well, Google, Mozilla and Apple all had a hand in most of the "modern" parts of the standards...

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>If you have ever wondered what is inside Valve Index, you might have stumbled upon my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/cpayc5/valve_index_disassembly/">reddit post from 2019</a>. I’ve decided to dive into the details of what makes Valve Index great and share my thoughts on tech inside.</p>

<p>Teardown should begin from the simplest parts - remove the face mask (held by just magnets), unplug the main cable, and remove headphones that are held in place by a single screw each. Next remove the rubber cover that is glued around lenses. It’s not that well glued, you can just pull it off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index1.jpg" alt="">
<em>Rubber cover that prevents dust from getting inside lenses</em></p>

<p>Let’s start with a front panel - glossy front panel is removed by hand, since it is only held by magnets (but you already knew that from all the numerous pictures of people shoving stuff in the frunk of the headset). The rest of the front panel can be easily split in two parts. First is the frunk section, it will give you access to the main circuit board of the headset. You can remove it quite painlessly if you have the correct screwdriver. This panel does not contain any electronics.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index-face.jpg" alt="">
<em>Just look at this beauty</em></p>

<p>Second part of the front panel is more complex. It contains tracking points for the SteamVR tracking - you can see them by looking at the plastic at different angles - plastic covering tracking points is thinner so laser beams from base stations could shoot through it. SteamVR trackers are split in two independent parts, which are connected to the main circuit separately. Also this panel contains two front facing cameras, which makes the process of taking it off even more delicate. You have to disconnect two cameras and two halves of the tracking plate’s system to finally fully reveal the main circuit.</p>

<h2 id="main-circuit">Main Circuit</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index2.jpg" alt="">
<em>The “meat” of Valve Index</em></p>

<p>Finally we get to the main computing power of the headset. You can identify the main points of the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index3-1.png" alt="">
<em>This is where all the cables connect to the HMD</em></p>

<p>On the top there is a metal connector with FPC cable going in. It is going to the smaller circuit in the top part of the headset where the cable plugs in the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index4.jpg" alt="">
<em>Circuit board with main cable and 3.5 mm audio port. It also connects to the proximity sensor</em></p>

<p>Same circuit has a 3.5 mm audio port for connecting headphones (I bet you didn’t know there is an audio jack) and proximity sensor between lenses. Last one is used for turning off the screens when the headset is not on the head.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index2-1.png" alt="">
<em>SteamVR tracking points are connected here</em></p>

<p>On the sides of the main circuit board there are two black FPC cables. Those are going to the SteamVR tracking dots located in the sides of the headsets. Here is a picture of the tracking “web” when taken out of the headset.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index5.jpg" alt="">
<em>One side of SteamVR tracking web taken out of the HMD</em></p>

<p>Final two FPC cables are orange color and located at the bottom of the main board. They are connecting to a pair of displays located right behind this circuit.</p>

<h2 id="microchips">Microchips</h2>

<p>Now it is time to dive in a wonderful world of microchips and circuit boards. I want to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/popovs/">Sergejs Popovs</a> for helping to identify most of the components on the board.</p>

<p>Let’s start with simple chips. Here are two bluetooth <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52840">chips from Nordic Semiconductors</a>. Each of these chips is used for connecting one controller with the headset. That’s why there is a limitation of two devices connected to the HMD. If you want to connect more devices (Vive Trackers or other controllers) you will need to use a USB dongle with a separate Bluetooth chip.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index6.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index7.jpg" alt="">
<em>Bluetooth microchips, each connects to one device</em></p>

<p>Do you remember the USB port in the frunk? Well, this is a <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/USB5744-Data-Sheet-DS00001855J.pdf">chip from Microchip</a> for that USB port - hence USB in the name.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index4-4.jpg" alt="">
<em>USB chip for USB port next to it</em></p>

<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.via-labs.com/product_show.php?id=96">chip from Via-Labs</a>. It has a purpose of converting USB 3.1 signal to the 2.0 one. Some of the chips on the circuit are not advanced enough to understand 3.1 USB, so this chip “dumbs it down”. When the signal will need to go back to the PC, the chip will convert the signal back to the USB 3.1.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index8.jpg" alt="">
<em>USB signal converter chip</em></p>

<p>This is a flash memory chip from <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/memory/774?k=w25q32jw">Winbond Electronics</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index9.jpg" alt="">
<em>Flash memory can be used for different kinds of tasks</em></p>

<p>Next are these two microchips. The smaller one is a <a href="https://www.analogix.com/en/products/dp-mipi-converters/anx7530">SlimPort® 4K receiver from Analogix</a>. It is capable of receiving Image in 4K at 60 Hz, but since screens in Valve Index are only 1440 by 1600 pixels it allows to process video at 90, 120, and even 144 Hz. It also splits the signal in two allowing each display to get its own image.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index10.jpg" alt="">
<em>Video chips convert image that you see in your SteamVR mirror in beautiful VR image</em></p>

<p>Larger chip is a multipurpose <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/integrated-circuits-ics/embedded-fpgas-field-programmable-gate-array/696?k=ICE40HX8K">FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chip from Lattice Semiconductor</a>. It is used for tracking - all the data received from the tracking sensors is gathered here. This chip combined with the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-11289-32-bit-Cortex-M4-Microcontroller-SAM-G55_Summary-Datasheet.pdf">Atmel MCU</a> (located on the other side of the circuit board) are doing all the necessary tracking calculations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.etron.com.tw/cn/products/webcam_detial.php?Product_ID=10">EtronTech microchip</a> is used for merging video feeds from external cameras and transmitting it to your PC.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index11.jpg" alt="">
<em>Microchip for processing image from webcams</em></p>

<p>Last two chips on this side of the circuit from <a href="https://www.silabs.com/power/efp01-power-management-ic">SiliconLabs</a> are most likely related to power regulation. Both of them are located near the capacitors and an inductor (metal thingy with 150 written on it). These are making sure that nothing will get too hot on your face.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index12.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index13.jpg" alt="">
<em>Power regulating microchips</em></p>

<p>Next step is to remove the main circuit board and look on its other side. Other side is less interesting and has very little information to offer. Most parts are related to the power regulation mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index14.jpg" alt="">
<em>Back side of the main circuit board</em></p>

<p>Largest chip is an Atmel MCU, which I’ve already mentioned is related to the tracking system. On the left from it is a <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/LPC11U1X.pdf">microcontroller from NXP</a>. These are all the chips we managed to identify. One chip that is missing, is the additional Bluetooth module. Unlike Vive and Vive Pro, Index has bluetooth in the headset. It is used for connecting to the base stations, updating base station firmware, and sending them to sleep mode when the headset is turning off. Last one is completely optional - I prefer to keep my base stations 2.0 on all the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index14-2.jpg" alt="">
<em>The only two chips worth noting on this side of the motherboard - larger one is for tracking calculations</em></p>

<p>Why there is no separate Bluetooth chip for this purpose is still a mystery for me. Only possible explanation is that two Bluetooth chips for controllers are capable of switching to different modes and control the base stations.</p>

<h2 id="screens">Screens</h2>

<p>After the circuit is removed you will reveal several key components. First - you can see two displays - quick search shows that those panels are made by BOE Technology - Chinese display manufacturer. Those are 1440×1600, 615PPI 3.5” <a href="https://www.panelook.com/VS035ZSM-NW0-69P0_BOE_3.5_LCM_overview_37926.html">panels</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index15.jpg" alt="">
<em>View of the HMD with main board removed</em></p>

<p>Note some key elements in this view. On the bottom there is a circular mechanism with a metal pin with springs going through the whole headset. Similar pin is barely visible on the top of the headset. This is an IPD adjustment system - movement of the knob at the bottom of the HMD will rotate circular element in the bottom center which will push screens apart.
On the left and right sides of HMD you can see black gears - this is a system for eye relief - rotating a knob on the side of the headset will move the facemask relatively to the screens. Gear system is making sure both sides are rotating simultaneously, without giving too much pressure to the mechanism.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index16.jpg" alt="">
<em>IPD knob is actually a screw</em></p>

<p>In order to take the central part out from the headset, you will need to take the cap off the IPD adjustment knob and unscrew it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index17.jpg" alt="">
<em>Lens chambers with IPD mechanism still attached</em></p>

<p>Next was what I call the “wondering in the dark” part of teardown - for about 30 minutes we were trying to find a way of taking it apart without breaking anything, eventually using force to break one gear inside that was holding display chambers in place.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index18.jpg" alt="">
<em>Right eye lens chamber removed</em></p>

<p>After this step you can easily take off separate lens chambers and view the details. Chambers are sealed shut so nothing will get inside - they are assembled in perfectly clean conditions with no dust particles. 
In order to take it apart you can probably try to melt glue or something like that. But we are no iFixit, we used good ol’ force. Here you can see the screen separated from the chamber.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index19.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index20.jpg" alt="">
<em>BOE screen removed from the chamber</em></p>

<p>Screen has a polarised diffuser glued to it, which is particularly difficult to remove. It is made of very thin crystal glass and it cracks easily. You can see that the corners of it are cracked.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index21.jpg" alt="">
<em>Crystal polarisation diffuser</em></p>

<p>Diffuser is added to blend pixels better, making the screen door effect even lower.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index22.jpg" alt="">
<em>Fancy multilayered lens</em></p>

<p>Finally - the lenses. I was expecting them to be thicker with the effect that they create. Valve are saying “The custom lenses built into the Valve Index Headset maximize field of view without sacrificing edge-to-edge clarity. High geometric stability allows you to look around the scene by moving your eyes (not just your head) with minimal shape distortion”. I tend to agree that these are the most advanced lenses in modern mass produced HMD, even though they have their own flaws. Main issue is the light spill when using a headset, you can see the bright light’s reflections in spots where they shouldn’t be.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can clearly see, it is not possible to replace a damaged screen or scratched lens all by yourself (even though for latter one you might try to take the lens out using a suction cup, however I don’t think that is a good idea, as lenses and screens are calibrated in the factory).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thevrist.com/assets/images/index-end.jpg" alt="">
<em>Sometimes… I feel like a monster…</em></p>

<p>I am going to put the high-resolution images of the teardown and of the motherboard <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dhuPVWTu6P5XWo4HA">here</a> so you can see and check all the details by yourself.
