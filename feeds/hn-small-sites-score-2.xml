<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-main"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"> <meta itemprop="mainEntityOfPage" content="//defense-xml/"> <meta itemprop="description" content="">  <figure itemscope="" itemprop="image" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"> <meta itemprop="url" content="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/defense-xml/XML_icon.svg"> </figure> <section> <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>When I started my career, XML was ubiquitous. The meta-information in a Java JAR file - the manifest - follows a proprietary format. But Java EE designers built it from the ground up on XML: meta-information of all artifacts is in XML format <em>e.g.</em> <code>web.xml</code>, <code>ejb-jar.xml</code>, <code>application.xml</code>, etc.</p> <p>Java EE is one example I experienced personally. But XML was everywhere in the enterprise world at the time. Its prevalence manifested itself in two areas: configuration and data transfer.</p> <p>Ever since then, it would be an euphemism to say XML has been losing in popularity. Other formats, such as JSON and YAML, have replaced it in the hearts of developers. In this post, I’d like to:</p> <ul><li><span>Explore some of the reasons why the mighty XML has fallen</span></li><li><span>Raise some downsides of the popular alternatives</span></li><li><span>And describe how XML already solved those problems</span></li></ul> <div> <h2 id="the-downfall-of-xml">The downfall of XML</h2> <div> <p>I think there are several reasons that led to the downfall of XML. It’s not a single one, but the conjunction of them that led to the current state.</p> <div> <h3 id="associated-with-enterprise">Associated with "Enterprise"</h3> <p>I’m afraid the worst flaw of XML is its close association with the enterprise world. As everybody knows, Enterprise is notoriously bad - by definition: bloated, heavy, not nimble, etc. And yes, that’s sarcasm if you wondered.</p> <p>In general, perception trumps truth. Developers are no different in that regard. In the end, that’s how Hype-Driven Developers - and most developers, perceive XML nowadays.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="lack-of-integration-with-front-end">Lack of integration with front-end</h3> <p>One of the main usages of XML was in the realm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOAP web services</a>. Let’s be frank about it: the ease of consuming those web services from JavaScript and/or the browser is not spectacular.</p> <p>It' no wonder that JavaScript Object Notation, <em>aka</em> JSON became a <em>de facto</em> standard. JSON brought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REST</a> along with it. As its name implies, JSON is JavaScript native, while XML is not.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="steep-first-steps">Steep first steps</h3> <p>JSON is quite easy to start with, YAML even more so. Even with bare XML, one has the concept of namespaces, which are not beginner-friendly. XML allows one document to use elements from different namespaces. On the flip side, it makes designing simple documents more complicated.</p> <p>XML has a lot of powerful features, but all this power can be confusing to beginners. I willingly admit that they make easy things more complex than they should.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="performance">Performance</h3> <p>I’ve stumbled upon the performance "argument" a couple of time. This is usually "proven" by using a sample describing the same in XML, JSON and YAML. Because of its opening <strong>and</strong> closing tags, the writer shows that XML is quite noisy compared to the other two.</p> <p>IMHO, this argument is shallow, as all 3 formats are text-based. Thus, you can - and should - compress files. Parsing might be a bit slower, but it depends a lot on the exact parser (and the associated technology stack). In the end, the overhead of transmitting and parsing in XML - if any - is negligible compared to the total time in the whole use-case.</p> <p>People who favor YAML over JSON use the same reasoning: less characters.</p> </div> <div> <h3 id="abuse">Abuse</h3> <p>The above reasons are more or less congruent with XML. Yet, I’m more than willing to admit architects have been abusing XML. I’ve personally seen SOAP webservices with payload in the order of several megabytes. At that time, you might imagine the performance of such design was not stellar.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="failings-of-alternatives">Failings of alternatives</h2> <div> <p>JSON, YAML &amp; al. all have their own failings. Here’s a sample of them:</p> <ul><li><span>JSON has no comments. The most usual fallback is to use the <code>"_comment"</code> property.</span><div> <div> <pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"foo"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"_comment"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"My important comment"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"bar"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre> </div> </div></li><li><span>YAML has no governing body. Individuals manage the specification.</span></li><li><span>YAML has <strong>22 ways to write booleans</strong> - no less!</span></li></ul> <div> <div> <div> <blockquote> <p>Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway.</p> </blockquote>  </div> </div> </div> <div> <div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>YAML is to config syntaxes what Python is to programming languages.

Issues arise when the provider changes the data format:</p> <ol><li><span>How to make clients aware that the format changed?</span></li><li><span>What information to communicate to the client about the format change?</span></li><li><span>How to keep validation synchronized across clients?</span></li></ol> <p>XML has this issue solved since the beginning by providing a <strong>grammar</strong>. A grammar plays the same role for a XML document as constraints and types in a SQL database. The most important difference is that you can externalize the grammar.</p> <p>Several XML grammar implementations are available: <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-19980910.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Document Type Definition</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XML Schema</a>, <a href="https://relaxng.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relax NG</a>, etc. The most widespread one is XML Schema. Since a XML Schema is also written in XML format, a web server can host it. Then you can reference it by a publicly-accessible URL.</p> <p>This approach solves the above issues: when a client receives an XML document, the former looks at the XML Schema URL. It can then fetch it, and check that the data conforms to the schema.</p> <p>Changing the data format is as simple as versioning the XML Schema file, and publishing it under a new URL.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="other-benefits-of-xml">Other benefits of XML</h2> <div> <p>In this section, I’d like to list a couple of benefits of using XML.</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Public open stewardship</dt> <dd> <p>XML is not under the stewardship of a single person or a company, but of a <abbr title="Non-Governmental Organization">NGO</abbr>, namely the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3C</a>. A W3C specification has a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly documented process and defined lifecycle</a>.</p> </dd> <dt>Battle-proven</dt> <dd> <p>XML is not hype, but benefits from plenty of documentation, blog posts, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQs</a> available</p> </dd> <dt>Composable</dt> <dd> <p>While XML doesn’t strictly enforces namespaces, it’s considered a good practice. This way, similarly-named entities defined in different namespaces can co-exist in the same document without confusion about semantics.</p> </dd> <dt>Different flavors</dt> <dd> <p>XML parsing comes into two flavors:</p> <ol><li><span>Tree-based parsing <em>i.e.</em> <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Document Object Model</a>. It loads the whole document in memory</span></li><li><span>Event-based parsing <em>i.e.</em> <a href="http://www.saxproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simple API for XML</a>. It makes possible the parsing of large documents. Note that SAX is <strong>not</strong> a W3C specification.</span></li></ol> </dd> <dt>Implementation in different languages</dt> <dd> <p>Every commonly-used language in the industry offers at least one XML parsing implementation. This is either baked in the standard library that comes along the language, or available in a third-party one. Here are a couple of them:</p> </dd> </dl> </div>  <div> <dl> <dt>Document transformation</dt> <dd> <p><abbr title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation">XSLT</abbr> is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a W3C specification</a>. It allows to transform one XML document into another document in a declarative way. Target documents can be either XML themselves, or not.</p> </dd> <dt>Document querying</dt> <dd> <p><abbr title="XML Path Language">XPath</abbr> is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-xpath-31-20170321/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another W3C specification</a>. It defines how to query XML documents, similar to CSS selectors.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <div> <p>XML has a lot of advantages compared to other more alternative technologies. In addition to what I described above, it benefits from a <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/xml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rich ecosystem</a>.</p> <p>It’s not considered hype by a lot of young (and not so young) developers. I believe would be beneficial if our industry would value more battle-proven technologies than new shiny ones.</p> </div> </div>    </div> </section>   </article> </div> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I started reading <a href="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/">Node.js Design Patterns</a> this week. I got the Third Edition, and have not spent any time looking into what's changed from prior editions. The first 6 chapters cover fundamental knowledge, before getting into the meaty named Design Patterns, so these notes are from that first "half" of the book.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="1-libuv-and-the-reactor-pattern"><a href="#1-libuv-and-the-reactor-pattern">1. <code>libuv</code> and the Reactor Pattern</a></h2>
  <p><code>libuv</code> is something I've often heard about as a low level Node.js library, but now I have a glimpse of what it does for us. As the book says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Libuv represents the low-level I/O engine of Node.js and is probably the most important component that Node.js is built on. Other than abstracting the underlying system calls, libuv also implements <strong>the reactor pattern</strong>, thus providing an API for creating event loops, managing the event queue, running asynchronous I/O operations, and queuing other types of task.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern">Reactor pattern</a>, together with demultiplexing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ">event queues and the event loop</a>, is core to how this works - a tightly coordinated dance of feeding async events into a single queue, executing them as resources free up, and then popping them off the event queue to call callbacks given by user code.</p>

  <h2 id="2-module-design-patterns"><a href="#2-module-design-patterns">2. Module Design Patterns</a></h2>
  <p>I am superficially familiar with the differences between CommonJS modules and ES Modules. But I liked the explicit elaboration of 5 module definition patterns in CommonJS:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Named exports: <code>exports.foo = () =&gt; {}</code></li>
    <li>Exporting a function: <code>module.exports = () =&gt; {}</code></li>
    <li>Exporting a class: <code>module.exports = class Foo() {}</code></li>
    <li>Exporting an instance: <code>module.exports = new Foo()</code> which is <em>like</em> a singleton, except when it is not because of multiple instances of the same module.</li>
    <li>Monkey patching other modules (useful for <a href="https://github.com/nock/nock">nock</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In ES Modules, I enjoyed the explanation of "read-only live bindings", which will look weird to anyone who has never seen it and has always treated modules as stateless chunks of code:</p>
  <pre><code><span>// counter.js</span>
<span>export</span><span> </span><span>let</span><span> count </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span>
<span>export</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>increment</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>   </span><span>count</span><span>++</span><span> </span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// main.js</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>count</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>increment</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>./counter.js</span><span>'</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(count) </span><span>// prints 0</span>
<span>increment</span><span>()</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(count) </span><span>// prints 1</span>
<span>count</span><span>++</span><span> </span><span>// TypeError: Assignment to constant variable!</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>This mutable module internal state pattern is endemic in <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1221586490674696193?s=20">Svelte and Rich Harris' work</a> and I enjoy how simple it makes code look. I don't know if there are scalability issues with this pattern but so far it seems to work fine for ES Modules people.</p>
  <p>The last important topic I enjoyed was ESM and CJS interop issues. <code>ESM</code> doesn't offer <code>require</code>, <code>__filename</code> or <code>__dirname</code>, so you have to reconstruct them if needed:</p>
  <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>url</span><span>'</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>dirname</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>path</span><span>'</span>
<span>const</span><span> __filename </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>fileURLToPath</span><span>(</span><span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>url) </span>
<span>const</span><span> __dirname </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>dirname</span><span>(__filename)</span>

<span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>createRequire</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>module</span><span>'</span>
<span>const</span><span> require </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createRequire</span><span>(</span><span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>url)</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>ESM also cannot natively import JSON, as of the time of writing, whereas CJS does. You can work around this with the <code>require</code> function from above:</p>
  <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>createRequire</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>module</span><span>'</span>
<span>const</span><span> require </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createRequire</span><span>(</span><span>import</span><span>.</span><span>meta</span><span>.</span><span>url) </span>
<span>const</span><span> data </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>./data.json</span><span>'</span><span>) </span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(data)</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>Did you know that? I didn't!</p>

  <h2 id="3-unleashing-zalgo"><a href="#3-unleashing-zalgo">3. Unleashing Zalgo</a></h2>
  <p>APIs are usually either sync or async in Node.js, but TIL you can design APIs that are <em>both</em>:</p>
  <pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>createFileReader</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>listeners</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> [] </span>
<span>  </span><span>inconsistentRead</span><span>(</span><span>filename</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>value</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>listeners</span><span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>listener</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)) </span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>onDataReady</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>listener</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>listeners</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span>) </span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>This looks innocent enough, except when you use it as async and then sync:</p>
  <pre><code><span>const</span><span> reader1 </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createFileReader</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>data.txt</span><span>'</span><span>)  </span><span>// async</span>
<span>reader1</span><span>.</span><span>onDataReady</span><span>(data </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>   </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>First call: </span><span>${</span><span>data</span><span>}`</span><span>)</span>
<span>   </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>reader2</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createFileReader</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>data.txt</span><span>'</span><span>)  </span><span>// sync</span>
<span>   </span><span>reader2</span><span>.</span><span>onDataReady</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>     </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>Second call: </span><span>${</span><span>data</span><span>}`</span><span>) </span>
<span>   </span><span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>// only outputs First call - never outputs Second call</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>This is because module caching in Node makes the first call async and the second call sync. <a href="https://blog.izs.me/2013/08/designing-apis-for-asynchrony">izs famously called this "releasing Zalgo"</a> in a blogpost.</p>
  <p>You can keep Zalgo caged up by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>using direct style functions for synchronous APIs (instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">Continuation Passing Style</a>)</li>
    <li>make I/O purely async by only using async APIs, using CPS, and deferring synchronous memory reads by using <code>process.nextTick()</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The same line of thinking can also be done for EventEmitter Observers as it is for Callbacks.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Callbacks should be used when a result must be returned in an asynchronous way, while events should be used when there is a need to communicate that something has happened.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You can combine both the Observer and Callback patterns, for example with the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob"><code>glob</code> package</a> which takes both a callback for its simplier, critical functionality and a <code>.on</code> for advanced events.</p>
  <p>A note on ticks and microtasks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>process.nextTick</code> sets up a microtask, which executes just after the current operation and before any other I/O</li>
    <li>whereas <code>setImmediate</code> runs after ALL I/O events have been processed.</li>
    <li><code>process.nextTick</code> executes earlier, but runs the risk of I/O [starvation] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)</a>) if takes too long.</li>
    <li><code>setTimeout(callback, 0)</code> is yet another phase behind <code>setImmediate</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It's easy to spawn race conditions and accidentally launch unlimited parallel execution bringing down the server, with Node.js. The <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async">Async</a> library gives battle tested utilities for defining and executing these issues, in particular, queues that offer limited concurrency.</p>
  <p>The book steps you through 4 versions of a simple web spider program to develop the motivations for requiring managing async processes and describe the subtle issues that present themselves at scale. I honestly cant do it justice, I didn't want to just copy out all the versions and discussions of the web spider project as that is a significant chunk of the book, you're just gonna have to read thru these chapters yourself.</p>

  <h2 id="5-streams"><a href="#5-streams">5. Streams</a></h2>
  <p>I've often commented that <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1201528574236217345">Streams are the best worst kept secret of Node.js</a>. Time to learn them. Streams are more memory and CPU efficient than full buffers, but they are also more <em>composable</em>.</p>
  <p>Each stream is an instance of <code>EventEmitter</code>, streaming either binary chunks or discrete objects. Node offers <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_api_for_stream_consumers">4 base abstract stream classes</a>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Readable</code> (where you can read in <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_two_reading_modes">flowing (push) or paused (pull) mode</a>)</li>
    <li><code>Writable</code> - you're probably familiar with <code>res.write()</code> from Node's <code>http</code> module</li>
    <li><code>Duplex</code>: both readable and writable</li>
    <li><code>Transform</code>: a special duplex stream with two other methods: <code>_transform</code> and <code>_flush</code>, for data transformation</li>
    <li><code>PassThrough</code>: a <code>Transform</code> stream that doesnt do any transformation - useful for observability or to implement late piping and lazy stream patterns.</li>
  </ul>
  <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>PassThrough</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>stream</span><span>'</span>
<span>let</span><span> bytesWritten </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span>
<span>const</span><span> monitor </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>PassThrough</span><span>() </span>
<span>monitor</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>data</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>chunk</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>  </span><span>bytesWritten</span><span> </span><span>+=</span><span> </span><span>chunk</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span> </span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>monitor</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>finish</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span>
<span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`${</span><span>bytesWritten</span><span>}</span><span> bytes written</span><span>`</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>monitor</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Hello!</span><span>'</span><span>) monitor</span><span>.</span><span>end</span><span>()</span>

<span>// usage</span>
<span>createReadStream</span><span>(filename)</span>
<span> </span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>createGzip</span><span>())</span>
<span> </span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(monitor) </span><span>// passthrough stream!</span>
<span> </span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>createWriteStream</span><span>(</span><span>`${</span><span>filename</span><span>}</span><span>.gz</span><span>`</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>izs recommends <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/minipass">minipass</a> which implement a PassThrough stream with some better features. Other useful stream utils:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/maxogden/mississippi">https://github.com/maxogden/mississippi</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamx">https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamx</a></li>
    <li>You can make streams lazy (create proxies for streams, so the stream instance isn't until some piece of code is consuming) with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazystream">lazystream</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Although the authors do recommend that piping and error handling be best organized with the native <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream_pipeline_source_transforms_destination_callback">stream.pipeline</a> function.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>September 28, 2020</p><p>If you have ever contributed to an open source project, chances are you have opened a pull request on GitHub or a similar platform to present your code to the maintainers. While this is a very approachable way of getting your code reviewed, some projects have decided against using pull requests and instead accept patches via email.</p><h2 id="an-introduction-to-patches"><a href="#an-introduction-to-patches"></a>An introduction to patches</h2><p>A patch is essentially a git commit expressed in plain text. It describes what commit the change is based on, and what has changed. A basic patch looks like this:</p><div><pre><p><span>From 92132241233033a123c4fa833449d6a0d550219c Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001</span></p><p><span>From: Bob &lt;bob@example.com&gt;</span></p><p><span>Date: Tue, 25 May 2009 15:42:16 +0200</span></p><p><span>Subject: [PATCH 1/2] first change</span></p><p><span>---</span></p><p><span> test.txt |    1 +-</span></p><p><span> 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)</span></p><p><span>diff --git a/test.txt b/test.txt</span></p><p><span>index 7634da4..270eb95 100644</span></p><p><span>--- a/test.txt</span></p><p><span>+++ b/test.txt</span></p><p><span>@@ -1 +1 @@</span></p><p><span>-Hallo Bob</span></p><p><span>+Hallo Alice!</span></p></pre></div><p>As you can see, it is very readable for both the reviewer and the machine.</p><h2 id="sending-and-receiving-patches"><a href="#sending-and-receiving-patches"></a>Sending and receiving patches</h2><p>The easiest way you can generate a patch from a commit is to use <code>git-format-patch</code>:</p><p>This will generate a <code>.patch</code> file, that can be embedded into an email and sent to the maintainers. Oftentimes they will then reply to your mail with some inline comments about your code.</p><p>To simplify this process further, git has the <code>send-email</code> command, which let’s you send the patch directly to someone without needing to embed it manually. I won’t go into details about this, but there is a <a href="https://git-send-email.io/">well written guide</a> on how to set it up.</p><p>If you have received a patch from someone, you can apply it to your tree with the <code>am</code> (apply mail) command:</p><div><pre><p><span>git am &lt; 0001-first-change.patch</span></p></pre></div><p>check your <code>git log</code> to see the patch in form of the latest commit.</p><h2 id="why-even-bother"><a href="#why-even-bother"></a>Why even bother</h2><p>You might think that this is just a silly and outdated approach to collaborative development. “Why not simply open a pull request?” you might ask. Some projects, especially low-level oriented ones like the Linux kernel, do not want to rely on third-party platforms like GitHub to host their code, with good reasons:</p><ol><li>Everyone can participate! You don’t need to register an account on some proprietary website to collaborate in a project that uses a patch-based workflow. You don’t even have to expose your identity, if you don’t want to. All you need is an email-address, and frankly most of us have one.</li><li>It’s plain simple! Once you get used to generating and applying patches on the command line, it is in fact easier and faster than opening a pull request in some clunky GUI. It doesn’t get simpler than plain text.</li><li>It is rewarding! Once you have submitted a patch to a project, there is no better feeling than getting a simple “Applied, thanks!” response from a maintainer. And if it’s a response that contains feedback rather than an approval, it feels even better to submit that reworked code again and get it eventually applied.</li></ol><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The patch-based workflow is an alternative way to collaborate with developers. If it helps you in your day to day business depends on the projects you are contributing to, but in the end it is always good to have many tools under your belt.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div><article>  <p>It's common to hear engineers muttering "cryptography is scary" or "oh no its a cert problem."</p> <p>The topic is a dense one full of maths, mailing lists, and vulnerabilities which quite literally shock the world. It's understandable how a lot of engineers put learning about the topics to another day.</p> <p>In my career I have been asked to build two different certificate signing backends for IoT purposes. These tasks provided the opportunity to work with authentication, encryption, and cryptography at a lower level then typical.</p> <p>This post will outline the bare minimum engineers should understand before working with authentication and encryption systems.</p> <h2>Part 1: Conceptual Overview</h2> <p>This section will provide a gentle introduction to authentication and encryption. These topics are to be read as a conceptual overview and not as literal implementation details.</p> <h3>Authentication and Encryption</h3> <p>Cryptography can lend itself to many utilities but as software developers our usage centers around authentication and encryption.</p> <p>Authentication is the act of identification. Cryptography can guarantee authentication and thus provide trust that the subject you are communicating with is indeed who they say they are. Authentication is implemented by cryptographic signing.</p> <p>Encryption is the act of concealing communications from unintended audiences. When a communication is encrypted it is guaranteed to be viewable only by the intended party.</p> <p>Authentication and encryption are used together to device a notion of trust in our applications and on the internet.</p> <h3>Cryptographic Signing</h3> <p>Cryptographically signing a message proves authentication in a single direction. It works like so:</p> <ul> <li>Sender: constructs a message to be sent.</li> <li>Sender: constructs a key to sign the message with.</li> <li>Sender: uses a signing algorithm to sign the bits of the message with the constructed keys.</li> <li>Sender: sends message along with signature to client.</li> <li>Receiver: receives the message and signature.</li> <li>Receiver: retrieves the sender's key.</li> <li>Receiver: uses the sender's key to sign the received message.</li> <li>Receiver: compares the sender's signature with the one computed by the receiver itself.</li> </ul> <p>If the receiver sees both signatures as equal and knows it can trust the key used to create the signature, the receiver can trust the message is from the sender.</p> <p>The various ways to securely transfer the sender's key to the receiver will be covered a bit later in the post.</p> <p>Typical signing algorithms are:</p> <ul> <li>HS256 - HMAC with SHA256</li> <li>RSA256 - RSA Signature with SHA256</li> </ul> <h3>Cryptographic Encryption</h3> <p>While similar in procedure, cryptographic encryption serves a separate purpose. It works like so:</p> <ul> <li>Sender: constructs a key</li> <li>Sender: construct a message to send</li> <li>Sender: run the message bits and the key through an encryption algorithm, producing unintelligible ciphertext.</li> <li>Sender: sends cipher text message to receiver.</li> <li>Receiver: receives the message</li> <li>Receiver: retrieves the sender's key</li> <li>Receiver: runs the message's ciphertext and the retrieved key through the same encryption algorithm, producing an intelligible message.</li> </ul> <p>In the above scenario the key is being utilized on every message to encrypt the message and conceal its contents.</p> <p>Typical encryption algorithms are:</p> <ul> <li>DES &amp; 3DES</li> <li>RSA</li> <li>Blowfish</li> <li>AES</li> </ul> <h2>Part 2: Applied Technologies</h2> <p>Several widely used technologies apply signing and encryption in practice. We will cover the following:</p> <ul> <li>Private Key Infrastructure And x509 Certificates</li> <li>TLS (SSL)</li> <li>JSON Web Tokens / JSON Web Signatures</li> </ul> <h3>Private Key Infrastructure And x509 Certificates</h3> <p>Private key infrastructure, or PKI for short, is a grouping of technologies, protocols, and policies. This grouping can be used in tandem to ensure both authentication and encryption and securely transfer keys between parties.</p> <p>PKI is based on a private/public key model. In this model a private key is used for signing or encryption while the public key is used for verification or decryption.</p> <p>*aside: Often the terms "asymmetric" and "symmetric" encryption come up. When the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt a message, this is known as "symmetric" encryption. When a key is used to encrypt a message as a different key is used to decrypt the message, this is known as "asymmetric" encryption. Public/Private key encryption is considered "asymmetric".</p> <p>The private key is kept secret and used to sign data while the public key can verify what the private key signs. The public key can never be used to derive the private key and this is mathematically proven.</p> <p><em>aside: PKI infrastructure will typically use RSA public and private keys. We dig into this more later in the post.</em></p> <p>In our examples above the sender would sign a message with its private key, make its public key available to the receiver, and the receiver would verify the message utilizing the sender's public key.</p> <p>PKI is called an 'infrastructure' because it provides a trust policy in addition to authentication and encryption.</p> <p>In PKI the trust policy takes the form of a tree. At the root of the tree is the "root CA", where CA is short for certificate authority. The root can create one or more "intermediate CA(s)" by creating and signing their certificate with its own private key, providing authenticity that the intermediate CA was created by the root. This creates a chain of trust as I can confirm an intermediate is signed by its root by obtaining the root's public key and verifying the certificate's signature.</p> <p>The intermediate CA is then kept online while the root CA is kept offline. This is for security purposes, if the intermediate CA private keys are compromised they can be revoked and the collateral damage can be managed. If the root CA's key is compromised all certificates created by any CA in the tree must be revoked.</p> <p>A diagram can help provide a visual aide.</p> <p><img alt="pki hierarchy diagram" src="https://www.ldelossa.is/pki_hierarchy_diagram.png"></p> <p>Each node in the chain has both a private key and a certificate.</p> <p>PKI utilizes a standardized certificate model specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2459">rfc-2459</a>.</p> <p>A certificate is an envelope containing metadata and the public key of the owner. It may be used as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Sender: Signs a message with it's private key.</li> <li>Sender: Sends message to receiver.</li> <li>Receiver: Receives message.</li> <li>Receiver: Obtains the sender's certificate.</li> <li>Receiver: Verifies the certificate's authenticity by following the certificate trust chain.</li> <li>Receiver: Extracts public key from certificate and verifies message.</li> </ul> <p>Note that it is not enough to simply extract the public key and verify the message. The receiver must verify the encountered certificate was indeed signed by the issuer's private key. This is typically performed by the receiver having a local copy of popular root and intermediate certificates, extracting the public key from the one matching the issuer of the encountered certificate, and verifying the signature.</p> <p>It is worthwhile to take a pragmatic look at setting up a root CA, intermediate, and signing client certificates. A wonderful tutorial can be found <a href="https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/">here</a></p> <h3>TLS</h3> <p>TLS utilizes PKI to implement encryption over HTTP also known as "HTTPS". TLS guarantees that every bit of data between two HTTP clients is encrypted and unintelligible to any other parties which may route the traffic.</p> <p>TLS is a protocol which exchanges asymmetric keys, generates symmetric keys, and uses the symmetric keys to encrypt data between parties.</p> <p>When a browser connects to an HTTPS website a handshake occurs. Within this handshake the server's certificate is verified and a set of symmetric keys are crafted. All communication on this secure channel is now encrypted and decrypted with the symmetric keys.</p> <p>The reason symmetric keys are used is for performance. Encrypting and decrypting with a private/public key can be expensive due to key size. Encryption and decryption can occur quicker with smaller symmetric keys.</p> <p>TLS also provides authentication.</p> <p>Each https server is assigned a client certificate. From our PKI diagram, client certificates are the leafs. When a user requests information from a server, the user's browser will check the server's certificate. If the browser cannot prove the certificate was created by a trusted root or intermediate CA the connection will fail.</p> <p><em>aside: if you ever had to install a certificate bundle to a server because ssl was failing you are installing a well known set of trusted root and intermediate certificates. This is used in the above verification process.</em></p> <p>With TLS comes maintenance. TLS certificates expire over time and must be kept up to date. Traditionally a server TLS certificate would be purchased from a well known root CA such as DigiTrust. Today, "let's encrypt" has paved the way for free certificates, albeit these certs expire much sooner then ones you can purchase from a trusted root ca.</p> <h3>JSON Web Tokens and JSON Web Encryption</h3> <p>JSON Web Tokens or JWT for short has become a popular form of authentication in modern web applications. When coupled with JSON Web Encryption both authentication and encryption can be utilized.</p> <p>The ubiquity of JWT and JSE is due to it's simplicity and ease of use. Both specifications use JSON to transfer a signed and optionally encrypted token between parties.</p> <p>This token can optionally contain claims, key/value information potentially useful for the receiving party along with several other "sections" which are base64 encoded and signed. The full details of generating a token can be viewed <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/">here</a>.</p> <p>The flow of jwt interaction follows:</p> <ul> <li>Sender: generates the header and the payload for the JWT.</li> <li>Sender: generate the signature for the JWT utilizing a key.</li> <li>Sender: places the token in an "authorization" http header.</li> <li>Receiver: parses the "authorization" header and retrieves the token.</li> <li>Receiver: retrieves the sender's key.</li> <li>Receiver: verifies the signature portion with the sender's key.</li> </ul> <p>JWT alone provides no key transfer facilities and the token's data is in plain text. However, with JSON Web Encryption (JWE) it becomes possible to piggyback off PKI and retrieve public keys via the public key infrastructure.</p> <p>More than a high level overview is further then this post would like to go.

<p>Essentially frameworks are designed to help speed up your build process and ultimately give you a clean finish.</p>
<p>As a frontend web developer, you have heard or came across a couple of frameworks, like Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation, or maybe TailwindCSS which is our focus for today.</p>
<p>At the end of this article, you would understand what TailwindCSS is, the difference between TailwindCSS from other CSS frameworks, it's pros, and cons and how to install and use it in your project.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-tailwindcss">What is TailwindCSS</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a> is a low-level utility first CSS framework. Like Bootstrap, it is a CSS framework but unlike Bootstrap which comes straight out of the box with predefined components like cards, buttons, or dropdowns, TailwindCSS gives you a whole lot of power and flexibility with its utility classes which let you build your own components.</p>
<p>Essentially TailwindCSS doesn't have a set look or feel, where you can look at a website and tell that it was built with Bootstrap, you can't do that with Tailwind CSS, each component you see on a website built with TailwindCSS is custom to the developers taste, and that's the beauty of Tailwind CSS. </p>
<p>Let's look at an example below, to solidify your understanding of this  concept; </p>
<pre><code>    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"rounded shadow bg-white"</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>In the example above we used three utility classes on our <code>div</code> element, notice how we never left our HTML file? Now let's look at how we could have done that with Vanilla CSS.</p>
<pre><code><span>div</span>{

    <span>border-radius </span>: <span>15px</span>;
    <span>box-shadow</span>: <span>2px</span> <span>2px</span> <span>5px</span> <span>rgba</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0.5</span>);
    <span>background-color</span>:white;
}

</code></pre><p>Now do you see the power and flexibility of TailwindCSS, just by adding a few classes, we can do something amazing where we would have otherwise have to have written more lines of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You should already have an understanding of CSS before using TailwindCSS, TailwindCSS is not a replacement for CSS.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-does-tailwindcss-work">How does TailwindCSS work?</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h3pPokP.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Tailwind works simply by converting its core styles and functionality into vanilla CSS that can be used in our HTML file. Let me further explain this;</p>
<p>We create an <strong>src</strong> and <strong>public</strong> folder in our project directory, the <strong>src</strong> folder is going to have a <strong>styles.css</strong> file in it, this file is where we import tailwinds core styles and functionalities.</p>
<p>Now at build time tailwind is going to convert those core styles and functionalities into vanilla CSS and then sent to the <strong>styles.css</strong> file in our public folder which we can use in our HTML.</p>
<p>No problem if you don't quite understand this now, as you read further, you would get a grasp of it.</p>
<h2 id="installation-and-setup">Installation and Setup</h2>
<h3 id="install-using-npm-node-package-manager">Install using npm (node package manager)</h3>
<p>let me walk you through a quick installation process and how to get tailwind CSS set up for a simple <strong>Hello world</strong> project.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have node-js installed on your computer before you can use npm. You can install node-js <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>.</li>
<li><p>Once you have node installed, create a new folder in your desktop directory or where ever you would like to have the folder.</p>
<p> let's do that from the command line using these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>open up the command line </li>
<li>create a new folder with this command, <code>mkdir folder name</code></li>
<li>now go into that directory using <code>cd folder name</code></li>
<li>open up your folder in your favorite text editor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you have created a new folder and navigated into it, you need to create a new <strong>package.json</strong> file using npm like so; <code>npm init -y</code></p>
<p> the <strong>package.json</strong> file helps to keep track of all your dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The next step is to install tailwindCSS using <code>npm install tailwindcss</code> on the command line. This will install tailwindcss dependency into then <strong>package.json</strong> file.</p>
<p> Now you should see a <strong>node_module</strong> folder in your project folder, a <strong>package-lock.json</strong> file and you should have tailwindCSS as a dependency in your <strong>package.json</strong> file</p>
<p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kVmDrMl.png" alt="tailwindcss example"></p>
<p> great if you can see this, you are on the right track, let's carry on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a new <strong>src</strong> folder and <strong>public</strong> folder in your project directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside the <strong>src</strong> folder create a <strong>styles.css</strong> file</li>
<li><p>now let us add tailwinds core styles into our <strong>styles.css</strong> file. We do so by pasting these directives onto our stylesheet </p>
<pre><code>  <span>@tailwind</span> base;

  <span>@tailwind</span> components;

  <span>@tailwind</span> utilities;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Now we can we process the <strong>styless.css</strong> file in our <strong>src</strong> folder so that it can bring out a final output file in our <strong>public</strong> folder;</p>
<ul>
<li>go to your <strong>package.json</strong> file, there is a section called <strong>scripts</strong> which allows us to register different scripts into our terminal, right now you should see a <strong>test</strong> script there.</li>
<li><p>now we have to change the test script into our own script which is going to convert tailwindCSS into vanilla CSS, pretty sweet right. we can do that with the line of code below;</p>
<pre><code>  <span>"build"</span>:<span>"tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o public/styles.css"</span>
</code></pre><p>let's analyze this line of code. On the left-hand side of the colon, we have <strong>build</strong> which can be called anything we like, it is essentially the name of our script. </p>
<p>the right side of the colon holds <strong>tailwindcss build</strong> which is our tailwind package, also we have <strong>src/styles.css</strong> which is specifying our source file with the tailwind directives.</p>
<p>Then we specify our output using <strong>-o</strong> and the destination of our output file which is <strong>public/styles.css</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>now lets run our build script on the terminal, like so; <code>npm run build</code>, build here is the name of our script file which we created earlier.</p>
<p>Awesome, now we have tailwindCSS set up and working perfectly, we can now use it to finish our simple hello world project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Create an HTML file in the <strong>public</strong> folder and have it linked to our newly built vanilla CSS file in the same folder and let's add some tailwind utilities to it, like so;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>    <span>&lt;<span>h1</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"text-4xl font-bold text-center text-blue-500"</span>&gt;</span>Hello world !<span>&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="tailwindcss-vs-bootstrap">TailwindCSS vs Bootstrap</h2>

<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</h2>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>utility first</li>
<li>highly flexible and customizable </li>
<li>Responsive</li>
<li>Build a beautiful responsive website without leaving your HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tailwind comes with a pretty large file, and unless you purge it, you have this large file with unused CSS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Frameworks are designed to make our lives easier, and TailwindCSS does a pretty good of that, it provides us with a lot of power and flexibility with its utility classes, to help us make very customizable components and ultimately give us a good finish.</p>
<p>You've made it to the end of this article, I hope it explains the concept of tailwindCSS to you. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I spend a lot of my day on video calls.

(Of course, your personal ranking might be different depending on your situation.)</p><ol><li><p>($depends) Don’t work in a space where your noise can bother other people, or vice versa.</p></li><li><p>($10-30) If you ever have network issues, run <a href="https://amzn.to/3luTVdV" target="_blank">a cable</a> between your computer and router. You’ll probably need an <a href="https://amzn.to/2YOFis9" target="_blank">adapter</a>. (Contrary to popular belief that a bad connection is your ISP’s fault, it’s <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/">more likely to be flaky wifi</a>.)</p></li><li><p>(~$100) Buy <a href="https://amzn.to/3bULynH" target="_blank">open-back headphones</a>, which let you hear your own voice normally and are extremely comfortable.</p></li><li><p>(~$30) Switch from your built-in computer mic to a <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/BoomProMic--v-moda-boompro-microphone-communication-mic-for-headphones" target="_blank">headset mic</a> (and <a href="https://amzn.to/3hOU5JU" target="_blank">pop filter</a>), which will sound much better and pick up less noise. Note this requires a headset with detachable cable, like the one I linked above.</p><p>You can now leave yourself unmuted! If the other person also has headphones, you can also talk at the same time. Both of these will make your conversations flow better.</p></li><li><p>($0) Prefer Zoom to most alternatives; it has higher sound quality, better echo cancellation, and fewer silly behaviors. If you have headphones and a good mic, enable “original sound” to turn off some unnecessary audio filtering.</p></li><li><p>(~$200) Get a second monitor for notes so that you can keep Zoom full-screen on your main monitor. It’s easier to stay present if you can always glance at people’s faces. (I use an iPad with <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380" target="_blank">Sidecar</a> for this; for a dedicated device, the right search term is <a href="https://amzn.to/3iZRUVz" target="_blank">“portable monitor”</a>. Also, if your meetings frequently involve presentations or screensharing, consider getting a third monitor too.)</p></li><li><p>($0?) Arrange your lighting to cast lots of diffuse light on your face, and move any lights that shine directly into your camera. Lighting makes a bigger difference to image quality than what hardware you use!</p></li><li><p>(~$20-80 if you have a nice camera) Use your camera as a webcam. There’s software for <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/self-help-center/eos-webcam-utility" target="_blank">Canon</a>, <a href="https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/support/download/software/x-webcam/" target="_blank">Fujifilm</a>, <a href="https://downloadcenter.nikonimglib.com/en/download/sw/176.html" target="_blank">Nikon</a>, and <a href="https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/app/webcam/en/" target="_blank">Sony</a> cameras (Windows-only for Nikon and Sony); for others, if they can output clean HDMI (check <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/cam-link/camera-check" target="_blank">this list</a>), you can buy an <a href="https://amzn.to/3kgunjj" target="_blank">HDMI capture card</a>. You will also want to be able to plug your camera into a power source, for which you may need a “dummy battery.”</p></li><li><p>(~$40 if you have a smartphone with a good camera) Use that as a webcam via <a href="https://reincubate.com/camo/" target="_blank">Camo</a>.</p></li><li><p>(~$350) If you don’t own a nice camera but want one, you can get a used entry-level mirrorless camera + lens + dummy battery + boom arm. See <a href="#camera-buying">buying tips below</a>.</p></li></ol><p>More detailed recommendations and justifications follow.</p><h2 id="network">Network</h2><p>Connection problems are the thing that makes video calls suck the most. They do this in three different ways:</p><ol><li><p>If your connection ever gets really bad, your audio will break up, which is exhausting to listen to and ruins the flow.</p></li><li><p>Even if it doesn’t get that bad, a poor connection will increase <em>latency</em>, or the time between when you speak and when the other person hears you. High latency is what causes the dreaded “you first, no <em>you</em> first” dance.</p></li><li><p>Finally (and least importantly), a bad connection limits the amount of data you can exchange, forcing you to use lower-quality video. This doesn’t really matter if you’re using a webcam, but by the end of this post, you might have a good enough camera that it matters.</p></li></ol><p>I wrote a whole post of its own on how to troubleshoot your home network for video calls, but realistically, most connection problems are because <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/">wifi sucks</a> and you can avoid them by not using wifi. So, first try running an <a href="https://amzn.to/3luTVdV" target="_blank">Ethernet cable</a> between your computer and your router. If you still notice high latency or your connection dropping, or if you really can’t run a cable for some reason, <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/vcnet/">check the guide</a> for more troubleshooting advice.</p><h2 id="audio">Audio</h2><p>Video improvements are flashy and noticeable, but audio is the reason you’re having the call, thus ultimately more important. So audio comes first.</p><h3 id="get-away-from-other-people">Get away from other people</h3><p>This is a basic prerequisite for everything below. Coworking spaces and cafés are nice if you plan to be silent all day, but will make natural-feeling meetings impossible due to your crippling self-consciousness about noise levels. If you’re going to be on a call for more than 5 minutes, get your own space.</p><p>(If you are committed to taking your meetings in a crowded and noisy space, ignore the rest of the audio section. You’re mostly just doomed to crappy calls in this case, though you might be able to limit the damage by getting <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/BoomProMic--v-moda-boompro-microphone-communication-mic-for-headphones" target="_blank">a nice headset mic</a> and installing <a href="https://krisp.ai/" target="_blank">krisp.ai</a>.)</p><p>If you’re talking to someone else who’s in a noisy environment, you can apparently also use krisp.ai to filter their audio yourself, though I haven’t tried this.</p><h3 id="get-full-duplex-audio-with-no-echo">Get full-duplex audio with no echo</h3><p>One key ingredient to making voice conversations feel “natural” is that both participants need be able to talk and hear the other person talking at the same time (“full-duplex audio”). Full-duplex audio is important because it allows you to talk simultaneously (“overlap”) with the other person.</p><p>You might think that overlap should be rare, because interrupting someone else is rude. While that’s true of large-scale overlaps, we often use small-scale overlaps to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-taking#Overlap" target="_blank">negotiate conversational turn-taking</a> (e.g. starting talking when the speaker is trailing off but hasn’t finished), or to signify that we’re paying attention (“uh-huh,” “yeah”).</p><p>The hard problem of full-duplex audio is that if someone else is talking, their voice is going to come out of your computer’s speakers and go back into your microphone. If your computer leaves the microphone on, in that case, it’ll end up playing back an “echo” of their own voice to them, which is extremely annoying. So video call tries to filter out feedback from your speakers into your microphone, which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_suppression_and_cancellation" target="_blank">echo cancellation</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, removing <em>only</em> the speaker echo from your microphone stream is really hard to do. So instead, the software often ends up completely muting your mic if someone else is talking. If you’ve ever tried to micro-overlap with someone and noticed that their audio cut out briefly, that’s what’s going on.</p><p>If your listeners can’t overlap with you, it’s harder to tell whether they’re following along, and it’s harder to negotiate whose turn it is to speak. This makes the conversation feel less natural, especially in larger groups.</p><p>To get full-duplex audio, you need to (a) have an audio setup that doesn’t produce echoes, then (b) convince your video call app not to try to suppress echoes.</p><p>(a), “an audio setup that doesn’t produce echoes,” means that your microphone should not pick up any sound from your speakers. In practice this means that your “speakers” must be headphones.</p><p>(b), “convince your video call app not to try to suppress echoes,” seemed surprisingly tricky when I tried to research it, because each video call app has its own heuristics for when to engage echo-cancellation.</p><p>So I did my own tests of echo cancellation Zoom, Skype, and Hangouts in Chrome and Firefox. I started a chat between two computers, both with headphones attached—a setup that should have required no echo cancellation. I then played music into the microphone of one computer. On the other, I spoke into the microphone and listened for whether the music got quieter.</p><p>Zoom, Skype and Hangouts in Firefox all seemed to slightly decrease the audio volume when I spoke, indicating light echo cancellation. For Hangouts in Chrome, the audio cut out <em>completely</em> every time I said anything. In Zoom, I was able to eliminate all echo cancellation by selecting the “use original audio” option, which you can also permanently enable for particular audio devices—I’d recommend doing this.</p><h3 id="throw-your-wireless-headset-in-the-trash">Throw your wireless headset in the trash</h3><p>The gear I recommend in this guide is all wired, not Bluetooth. While Bluetooth seems like it should be great, in practice it has <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/">horrible problems with audio latency, quality and reliability</a>. Also, I don’t think wireless open-back headphones (see below) exist.</p><p>If you finished the previous paragraph and still think you can get away with using wireless audio gear, read the post at the link :)</p><h3 id="hear-yourself-clearly-with-open-back-headphones">Hear yourself clearly with open-back headphones</h3><p>Most headphones are <em>closed-back</em>, which means they form an acoustic seal over your ear that attenuates outside sound. This is good for “noise isolation” when you’re listening to music. But it’s bad in calls because it also isolates you from your own voice, making you sound muffled and unnatural to yourself. (The same thing also happens with any earbuds that form a seal, i.e. pretty much everything except EarPods or non-Pro AirPods.)</p><p>Personally, without the feedback from hearing myself, I also tend to start speaking louder or shouting on calls. This tires out my voice, and can get stressful for whoever I’m <del>shouting at</del> talking to.</p><p>To avoid this, you can buy <em>open-back headphones</em>, which have mesh instead of a closed covering over your ears. I bought the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bULynH" target="_blank">Philips SHP9500</a>, which I like a lot; I haven’t tested any other pairs. (I chose a low-end pair because for …</p></article></div>

September 27, 2020 | https://mbuffett.com/posts/structured-editing-syntax/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mbuffett.com/posts/structured-editing-syntax/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I was aimlessly browsing Github and came across
<a href="https://github.com/kneasle/sapling">sapling</a>, a very early-stage structured
editor. It was inspired by <a href="http://shtanton.com/ex.html">this blog post</a>, which
talks about structured editing.</p>
<p>Structured editing has had my interest for a while. I’ve put a lot of time and
effort into getting really good at text editing, but I’m holding out hope that
in 10 years plaintext editing will be outdated. The idea behind structured
editing is to edit code instead of text, so instead of “move cursor to next
parentheses, delete in parentheses”, you’d have operations like “change function
argument”.</p>
<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>
<p>With auto-formatters like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">rustfmt</a>,
<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">gofmt</a>, and <a href="https://prettier.io/">prettier</a>,
some of the promise of structured editors have been achieved in regular editors.
Because now the ambiguity of syntax is eliminated by formatters. These editors
take the text, transform it into an AST (abstract syntax tree), and then print
the AST, using their formatting rules.</p>
<p>Conveniently, they provide an easy way to get started with creating a structured
editor. Ex. since rustfmt can already print an AST, why not use the output of
rustfmt to display the AST in a structured editor. I added some syntax
highlighting to rustfmt and got something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/rust.png"></p><h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>
<p>I’m not a semicolon fan; sometimes I wish Rust was written python-style, with
newlines meaning new statement, instead of semicolons representing the end of a
statement. It’s always a pain when
I forget a semicolon, and I wish my editor would just automatically insert them
for me. Since they’re always followed by a newline, they’re just a wasted character, in my mind.</p>
<p>Well now I’ve got this alpha structured editor, how about I just remove
the semicolons when printing the AST? Obviously I couldn’t do this in a
plaintext editor, since the code wouldn’t be valid. But the underlying AST is
the same regardless of how I print it, so let’s print without semicolons:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/no-semicolons.png"></p><h3 id="taking-it-further">Taking it further</h3>
<p>There’s so many details of a language that matter more
than syntax; performance, type system, available libraries, community, standard
library, dev tools, etc. Unfortunately, syntax is the first thing people see,
and therefore gets a disproportionate amount of attention. There’s also the
inertia of C-style syntax; languages that want to have any chance of being
popular have to use curly brackets for blocks, parens for invocations, dots for
method access, etc.</p>
<p>I think structured editors offer an escape from this. For example, here’s the
same example from above, with the same AST, but with python-esque syntax instead:</p>
<p><img src="https://mbuffett.com/python.png"></p><p>Now when learning Rust coming from Python, I wouldn’t need to learn about
implicit returns, or re-learn that <code>{}</code> means a block, instead of <code>:</code>. The
underlying AST has the <code>block</code> and <code>return</code> nodes, and I can view them however
I’m most comfortable. This would free up time to learn more important things,
like lifetimes and borrowing.</p>
<h2 id="other-syntax-thoughts">Other syntax thoughts</h2>
<h3 id="unicode-symbols">Unicode symbols</h3>
<p>Some languages, like Haskell, have embraced unicode symbols. Using <code>∀</code> instead
of <code>forall</code>, or <code>→</code> instead of <code>-&gt;</code> is becoming more popular. The problem is
that these are a lot harder to type. With a structured editor, you wouldn’t be
typing these anyway, so it’s no longer such a tradeoff between unicode and ASCII
characters.</p>
<h3 id="non-text-representations">Non-text representations</h3>
<p>When you have an editor representing an AST, you’re not limited to text to
convey information. For example, instead of writing <code>mut foo</code> for mutable
params to a function, you may want mutable params to have a squiggly line below
them. Or maybe you want a graph-like representation of your code instead of
text, to get an idea of which functions call which other functions.</p>
<h3 id="parsing-considerations">Parsing considerations</h3>
<p>Part of the discussion around Go generics involved the use of <code>&lt;&gt;</code> brackets for
generics, like in other languages. If you use angle brackets, seeing a <code>&lt;</code> means
you then have to determine whether what follows is a type or an expression,
which results in unbounded lookahead, something the compiler devs wanted to
avoid for performance reasons. So now Go developers have to get used to seeing
and using <code>[]</code> brackets for generics. If structured editors and ASTs were used
instead, not only would there not be a parsing step at all, eliminating the
unbounded lookahead problem, but Go developers could use whatever generic
annotation they like.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Don’t know if I have much of a conclusion, besides that I hope
that syntax will continue to lose importance as a defining characteristic of a
language. It’s already been losing importance with auto-formatters. In the
languages I use where auto-formatters are the norm, I’ve seen way less
bikeshedding about spaces vs tabs, bracket styles, trailing commas, etc.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Napkin project is a personal exposition project of mine
aimed at making higher math accessible to high school students.
The philosophy is stated in the preamble:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll be eating a quick lunch with some friends of mine who are still in high school.
They'll ask me what I've been up to the last few weeks, and I'll tell them that I've been learning category theory.
They'll ask me what category theory is about.
I tell them it's about abstracting things by looking at just the structure-preserving morphisms between them, rather than the objects themselves.
I'll try to give them the standard example Gp, but then I'll realize that they don't know what a homomorphism is.
So then I'll start trying to explain what a homomorphism is, but then I'll remember that they haven't learned what a group is.
So then I'll start trying to explain what a group is, but by the time I finish writing the group axioms on my napkin, they've already forgotten why I was talking about groups in the first place.
And then it's 1PM, people need to go places, and I can't help but think:</p>
<p><em><span>Man, if I had forty hours instead of forty minutes, I bet I could actually have explained this all.</span></em></p>
<p>This book is my attempt at those forty hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This project has evolved to more than just forty hours.</p>

            <article>
    
    <p>February 26, 2015</p>

    <p>Ever wonder what exactly is inside a font? We know it contains letters — or actually, drawings of letters, but what else is in there? Well, why not crack one open and see, and while we’re there, find a way to make this world a little less buzzwordy?</p>

<h2 id="laying-out-our-plan">Laying out our plan</h2>

<p>We’re going to create a font called <a href="http://www.sansbullshitsans.com/">Sans Bullshit Sans</a> and it’ll do something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://pixelambacht.nl/img/sans-bullshit-sans-in-action.gif" alt="A text full of buzzwords is being typed out, with all the buzzwords being replaced with a sign saying 'bullshit'"></p>

<p>When using Sans Bullshit Sans, every buzzword will be replaced by a Comic Sans-styled censorship bar. And the cool part is, we won’t be using CSS or JavaScript for this, but plain ol’ OpenType font technology.</p>

<p>We’ll need three things for this project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A font we can examine and edit</li>
  <li>Tools that allow us to edit fonts with a texteditor</li>
  <li>Our own ligatures</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll take care of step one right away. Since we’re more or less reverse-engineering a font, we need one that allows us to legally do this. I decided on the open source font <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans">Droid Sans</a>, as its Apache license allows us to modify and redistribute it afterwards. Download it and save it to your favorite font hackin’ directory.</p>



<p>Most font tools focus on the designey part of fonts: drawing the actual letter shapes, and tweaking their details like kerning and hinting. Think of them like Photoshop for fonts: very graphical and with quite a steep learning curve.</p>

<p>But there is another way to edit fonts. Once they have been saved as a TTF, they hold all their data in a special format. This is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType">OpenType format</a>, in which each letter has its own occurrence in various <em>tables</em>, each describing a specific property of that letter.</p>

<p>For example, the <em>glyf</em> table holds information about the shape of the characters in a font — it actually stores a drawing for each character. Other tables hold different info: the name of the type’s designer, the maximum height of the font, or which combinations of letters should be replaced by a ligature.</p>

<p>Fonts are binary files, generally unsuitable for being picked apart by humans. So if we want to look at those tables, we better translate them into something more readable, like plain text. Luckily for us, there’s TTX/Fonttools, a command line tool that converts fonts to XML and vice versa. The XML document can be opened, read, and edited with your favorite text editor and is actually quite readable for us humans.</p>

<p>You can download the original version on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/">Sourceforge</a>, but I recommend <a href="https://github.com/behdad/fonttools/">a fork by Behdad Esfahbod</a>. It’s actively maintained and gets bugfixes and new features (for instance, decoding of the <a href="http://pixelambacht.nl/2014/multicolor-fonts/">new color tables</a>. Follow either page’s installation instructions, or <a href="http://glyphrstudio.com/ttx/">this detailed one</a> for Windows.</p>

<h2 id="looking-under-droid-sans-hood">Looking under Droid Sans’ hood</h2>

<p>With TTX/Fonttools installed, let’s fire it up and have it decode Droid Sans:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ttx DroidSans.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p>TTX/Fonttools translates all the binary data in <code>DroidSans.ttf</code> to XML. While it does so, the output looks a little like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">Dumping <span>"DroidSans.ttf"</span> to <span>"DroidSans.ttx"</span>...
Dumping <span>'GlyphOrder'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'head'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'hhea'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'maxp'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'OS/2'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'hmtx'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'cmap'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'fpgm'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'prep'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'cvt '</span> table...
Dumping <span>'loca'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'glyf'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'name'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'post'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'gasp'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'FFTM'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'GDEF'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'GPOS'</span> table...
Dumping <span>'GSUB'</span> table...</code></pre></figure>

<p>You can see that besides the <em>glyf</em> table we talked about, there are about 18 other tables in Droid Sans. Some fonts have less, some more, but there’s always a basic set of tables that are needed for a valid font.</p>

<p>These tables hold every single detail about the font: a list which letters are in the font, the shapes of the letters, the name of the font — everything. Let’s take a quick look at Droid Sans’ <em>head</em> table, which contains global information about the font:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;!-- Most of this table will be recalculated by the compiler --&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;tableVersion</span> <span>value=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;fontRevision</span> <span>value=</span><span>"1.0"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;checkSumAdjustment</span> <span>value=</span><span>"0x2e9ffae7"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;magicNumber</span> <span>value=</span><span>"0x5f0f3cf5"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;flags</span> <span>value=</span><span>"00000000 00011111"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;unitsPerEm</span> <span>value=</span><span>"2048"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;created</span> <span>value=</span><span>"Mon May 17 19:56:38 2010"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;modified</span> <span>value=</span><span>"Fri Jul  9 07:55:05 2010"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;xMin</span> <span>value=</span><span>"-352"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;yMin</span> <span>value=</span><span>"-492"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;xMax</span> <span>value=</span><span>"1966"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;yMax</span> <span>value=</span><span>"1907"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;macStyle</span> <span>value=</span><span>"00000000 00000000"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;lowestRecPPEM</span> <span>value=</span><span>"8"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;fontDirectionHint</span> <span>value=</span><span>"2"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;indexToLocFormat</span> <span>value=</span><span>"0"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;glyphDataFormat</span> <span>value=</span><span>"0"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/head&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/head.htm">This table is required</a> for all OpenType fonts, and contains info like the minimum and maximum size for all glyphs in the font, and the number of units per em, which is the grid the glyphs are drawn against.</p>

<p>For now we’re only interested in those units per em:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;unitsPerEm</span> <span>value=</span><span>"2048"</span><span>/&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When we create our ligatures, we’ll use the same value. That way the dimensions of our characters, most importantly the vertical height, will match up precisely with that of Droid Sans.</p>

<p>For now we leave the TTX file for what it is. We’ll come back to it later when we add our actual ligatures.</p>

<h2 id="designing-our-ligatures">Designing our ligatures</h2>

<p>This is the plan: we have <a href="http://ngenworks.com/blog/250-buzzwords-we-love-to-hate/">a list of buzzwords</a>, and we’re going to (ab)use the OpenType feature of <em>ligatures</em> to replace those words with something of our own choosing: a sign that says “bullshit”:</p>

<p><img src="http://pixelambacht.nl/img/bs-medium.svg" alt="Crude hand drawn black bar with the word 'bullshit' written over it"></p>

<p>A ligature is when a string of characters (or a sequence of <em>glyphs</em> representing those characters) are replaced by one single glyph:</p>

<p><img src="http://pixelambacht.nl/img/infinite.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Ligatures improve legibility: instead of awkwardly overlapping parts of the letters (like the upper curve of the <em>f</em> and the dot of the <em>i</em>), the type designer can create a custom shape that looks a lot nicer. Another function of ligatures is joining letters in a different way in handwritten or brush typefaces. Fun fact: the well known ampersand, <em>&amp;</em>, was originally a ligature for “et”, meaning “and” in Latin.</p>

<p>Not all fonts offer ligatures: it’s the choice of the type designer, or the distributor of the font, to create or include them. For instance, Google’s web versions are stripped of ligatures so they result in smaller files. Type aficionados might cringe, but it makes sense: ligature support in web browsers is still kinda shaky, so it would be a waste to have people download stuff they can’t use.</p>

<p>For ligatures to work, a font has to have a <em>GSUB</em> table (the Glyph Substitution table), which has entries about which combination of letters should be replaced by a ligature. It’ll say “for the letter combination <em>f</em> and <em>i</em>, show the <em>fi</em>-ligature.”</p>

<p>We’re going to use this table to turn words like “synergy” into a “bullshit”-ligature.</p>

<p>It’s probably worth noting that what we’re doing here is far from proper use of the ligature functionality. True type-folks will rightfully scoff at this juvenile misuse of a feature like this, but I thought it was a neat way to learn about how fonts work.</p>

<p>With that disclaimer out of the way, let’s draw three ligatures — one for short words, one for medium words, and one for long words. Fire up Illustrator or any other vector drawing tool that can save SVGs, and draw our soon-to-be ligatures:</p>

<p><img src="http://pixelambacht.nl/img/three-bullshits.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Looking good? I think so. Let’s turn these into ligatures!</p>

<h2 id="turning-svg-files-into-a-font">Turning SVG files into a font</h2>

<p>We now have three SVG files and a reverse-engineered font waiting for ‘em. But even though both SVG and glyphs are vector images, they’re different formats, so we can’t just copy them over. We need to convert them to something OpenType can understand.</p>

<p>To do this, I find it easiest to create a new font from our SVGs, with specs matching our target font. If we’d pass that font through TTX, we can simply copy-and-paste the parts of the XML.</p>

<p>To create a font from SVGs, we can choose from a wide range of command line tools, web apps, or full-fledged font editors. I used the web based tool <a href="http://icomoon.io/">Icomoon</a>.</p>

<p>The steps are straightforward: create a new empty font, import the SVG images, and export the font. All Icomoon’s settings can be left on default, except the units per em. If we keep those the same as Droid Sans’, we can simply copy our glyphs over without recalculating dimensions and offsets. On the download screen, click the preferences-button and head over to the font metrics. Under “Em square height” we fill in 2048, the number we noted from Droid Sans.</p>

<p>To make creating our own ligatures a lot easier, we already define one for each SVG. Click the “fi” button on the top of the screen to enable ligatures for our font, and you’ll see an input field appear for each character. Enter a word, like “ninja” for the smallest ligature, to create a <em>GSUB</em> table entry that we’ll use as blueprint for our word list.</p>

<p>We’re ready to download the font! Unzip it, and move the TTF over to your font hackin’ directory.</p>

<h2 id="transplanting-our-ligatures">Transplanting our ligatures</h2>

<p>We now have a font that contains only our three bullshit drawings — no letters, no punctuation marks, no icons, just our bullshit images. At this point, they’re mapped to characters in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas">Unicode’s PUA</a> (0xE600, 0xE601 and 0xE602). As you will see in a minute, these codes also make up their internal name.</p>

<p>Next step: moving our bullshit characters over to Droid Sans. We do this by converting <code>bullshit.ttf</code> to <code>bullshit.ttx</code> so it’s openable in our favorite text editor. This is the same thing as we did with Droid Sans:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>ttx bullshit.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p>We don’t need everything in this TTX file. All the data we’re interested in is contained in five tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GlyphOrder (entry GlyphID)</li>
  <li>hmtx (entry mtx)</li>
  <li>cmap (entry map)</li>
  <li>glyf (entry TTGlyph)</li>
  <li>GSUB</li>
</ul>

<p>As we seen before, each table handles one specific feature or detail for each of the characters in a font. Let’s take a look:</p>

<h3 id="table-one-glyphorder">Table one: GlyphOrder</h3>

<p>This is a table generated by the TTX/Fonttools tool, and is not part of the OpenType spec. It simply lists all the characters inside the font. The glyph ordering is stored explicitly-but-implicitly in the <em>glyf</em> table, TTX/Fonttools just makes it easier for you to reorder them by giving you this <em>GlyphOrder</em> table.</p>

<p>We need to take our two entries in <code>bullshit.ttx</code> and stick ‘em to the end of the <em>GlyphOrde…</em></p></article></div></div>

In one, the lesson focuses on how a caption differs from a title or a subtitle, in that it’s a “label for a picture.” The children clamor to know more about the pictures themselves: What’s the shark eating? What planet is that? But the teacher deflects their questions, trying to get the six-year-olds to focus on locating the captions.</p><p>In the other classroom, children listen in fascination as their teacher reads a book about mummies. In passing, the teacher points out a caption on a photo of a sarcophagus. But the focus is on mummies: how they were preserved, how scientists can tell that they had used hair gel or eaten vegetable soup when they were alive. At the end, the kids are full of questions, which the teacher answers until it’s time to stop.&nbsp;</p><p>The first class reflects the now standard approach of focusing on “comprehension skills” like finding the main idea, making inferences or identifying text features like captions. The theory is that kids who master these skills will, later on, be able to use them to acquire knowledge from their own reading—and to do well on high-stakes standardized reading tests.</p><p>As a result, the subjects that could build kids’ knowledge—social studies, science, the arts—<a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational_leadership/mar11/vol68/num06/High-Stakes_Testing_Narrows_the_Curriculum.aspx">have, over the last twenty years, been edged out</a> to make more time for comprehension skill practice. But as cognitive scientists&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/opinion/sunday/how-to-get-your-mind-to-read.html">have discovered</a>, the key factor in comprehension isn’t skill; it’s subject-specific knowledge and vocabulary. And so, for all its good intentions, the approach that now dominates public schools across America only ends up further penalizing disadvantaged students. (Comprehension, of course, is only one aspect of reading. Children also need to learn how to sound out words—and there are huge problems with the way many schools teach that, also with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apmreports.org/episode/2020/08/06/what-the-words-say">a disproportionately negative impact</a> on disadvantaged students.)</p><p>Children from wealthier and better educated families are likely to pick up the background knowledge they need to understand a wide variety of texts at home. Their parents are better able to provide enriching experiences and engage them in conversations that involve sophisticated concepts and vocabulary. Such kids start school better equipped to understand more complex books. And because knowledge tends to build on related knowledge, they’re able to acquire more knowledge through their reading, allowing them to read even more complex books.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, their less advantaged peers fall farther behind every year. By high school, the gap between these two groups is huge—as is the gap between what teenagers are assumed to know and what many actually do. At high schools serving low-income populations, students may arrive unaware of the difference between a city and a state or a country and a continent, or confuse the Civil War with the Civil Rights movement. That’s because they have not been taught these things early enough.</p><p>Testing may have exacerbated the focus on skills over content. But the roots of the obsession with skills go deeper. They rest on suspicion of the very idea that knowledge should be transmitted.</p><p>For decades, prospective teachers have been inculcated with the belief that it’s better for students to discover knowledge for themselves than to have someone explain things to them. Storing information in your head, they are told, is unnecessary since students can always look up what they need; besides, kids find facts boring. Far better, the theory goes, to focus on skills like comprehension and critical thinking. And many educators are skeptical of&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>prescribed curriculum on the grounds that teachers should be guided by the interests of their particular students.</p><p>Learners do need to participate in constructing their knowledge, and students who are merely lectured at can become disengaged. But we can’t assume that all elementary students will acquire the&nbsp;information they need for themselves. For children starting out with limited knowledge of the world, this approach is often a dead end.</p><p>When students are new to a topic, direct instruction&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1">works best</a>. Factual knowledge&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Crit_Thinking.pdf">is also a prerequisite</a> for critical thinking: the more knowledge you have relating to a topic, the better equipped you are to think about it critically. And despite the current pedagogical consensus, kids are excited about discovering things and learning facts. As for following students’ interests, kids rarely express interest in subjects they don’t know anything about—and they often become intensely interested in new topics if they’re explained in an engaging way.</p><p>Another objection to foregrounding content is that it may reflect political or cultural bias. That objection isn’t new. An effort to craft voluntary national history standards in the 1990s foundered when right-wingers denounced them as being anti-American and focusing too squarely on marginalized groups. Conversely, leftists have, since at least the 1980s, expressed concerns that students of color will not feel represented if the knowledge covered in schools is too “Eurocentric,” or if all the books they study are written by dead white males.</p><p>Now, the old battles over historical and cultural content are being reignited. In some quarters, attributes like rational, linear thinking and an emphasis on the written word are <a href="https://www.amny.com/opinion/cathy-young-nyc-diversity-1-31720835/">being</a> denounced as part of&nbsp;<em>white culture</em>. Donald Trump is making “left-wing indoctrination” in the nation’s schools a campaign issue,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-white-house-conference-american-history/">citing</a>, among other things, the New York Times’ 1619 Project, which has inspired a&nbsp;<a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/lesson-plan-grouping/1619-project-curriculum">curriculum</a> focused on the history and legacy of slavery. To avoid battles over “whose” knowledge to teach, even some who acknowledge the defects of a skills-focused curriculum may feel the need to stick with it.&nbsp;</p><p>But if we don’t provide all children with access to the knowledge that children of the elite routinely acquire, we will continue to preserve, not lessen, social inequities. One group of students—and adults—will understand references to key cultural touchstones while others will feel mystified and excluded.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past few years, some new curricula for elementary schools have put the emphasis on building knowledge rather than skills. But some on the left have resisted these initiatives on the ground that they don’t sufficiently center the experience of black and brown students. </p><p>If these critics aim to help disadvantaged students gain the kind of education that will enable them to escape poverty and fulfill their responsibilities as citizens, it’s incumbent on them to create curricula that answer these objections&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>build knowledge. The worst thing we can do to children who rely on schools for their education is to deny them access to knowledge until it’s too late.</p><p><strong>Natalie&nbsp;Wexler&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;The Knowledge Gap: The Hidden Cause of American's Broken Education System—And How to Fix It.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

    <p>Swift was introduced a couple of years ago at Apple's 2014 WWDC. Over the years I analyzed iOS to measure how many built-in applications were using Swift. iOS 9 released in 2015 included a single application written with Swift: Calculator. Since then this number has grown with each iOS release: <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">iOS 10.1</a>, <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2017/1115-state-of-swift-ios11-1-macos10-13/">iOS 11.1</a>, <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2018/0924-state-of-swift-ios12/">iOS 12.0</a> and finally <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2019/0926-state-of-swift-ios13/">iOS 13.1</a>.</p>
<p>iOS 14 is now available so let's check how this number evolved since iOS 13. Apple announced SwiftUI during WWDC 2019, a year ago. In this article I will also try to measure which built-in apps are using this new UI framework.</p>

<p>The methodology and tools used for this article have been detailed in the previous posts. If you are interested, please refer to <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">Apple’s use of Swift in iOS 10.1 and macOS 10.12</a>.</p>
<p>Later in this article, I describe how I adjusted the tools to detect SwiftUI.</p>

<p>iOS 14.0 contains 351 binaries and frameworks using Swift. Note that these binaries might contain a single line of Swift code and are not necessarily entirely written in Swift. This list has been built using iOS 14.0 (18A373) for iPhone 11 Pro Max:</p>

<p>You can get the full list here: <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/BinariesUsingSwift.txt">BinariesUsingSwift.txt</a></p>

<p>SwiftUI, announced at WWDC 2019, is a new framework to build user interfaces with Swift. As a consequence a binary using SwiftUI will use Swift. Can we get the list of built-in apps using SwiftUI?</p>
<p>When I worked on the iOS 14 widgets for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters 3.0</a>, I noted that the widgets were linking against <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/Versions/A/SwiftUI</code>.</p>
<p><em>( <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters</a> lets you easily monitor in one place your brand, product or any other keyword on your favorite social networks - Twitter, Reddit, HackerNews and even comments on the iOS App Store. You should check it out at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237</a>! 😜 )</em></p>
<p>The script detecting Swift could easily be adjusted to detect SwiftUI by using this line:</p>
<pre><code>otool -L $1 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -o /System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/SwiftUI | wc -l
</code></pre>

<p>Until now I did not publish the list of apps using SwiftUI in iOS. To have a first reference, I built the list for iOS 13.7. With no surprise, iOS 13.7 only contained a handful of binaries relying on SwiftUI:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/SharingViewService.app/SharingViewService
/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/SwiftUI
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Settings/LegalAndRegulatorySettingsPrivate.framework/LegalAndRegulatorySettingsPrivate
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Settings/SettingsUIKitPrivate.framework/SettingsUIKitPrivate
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Settings/WallpaperSettings.framework/WallpaperSettings
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/VideosUI.framework/VideosUI
</code></pre>

<p>iOS 14.0 contains a lot more binaries using SwiftUI. The primary reason is without a doubt WidgetKit, the first public SwiftUI-only framework.
Each widget available in iOS 14 appears in this list. Another shiny new iOS 14 feature is the Translate app  which appears to be built with SwiftUI.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The engineering team of <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/">RainforestQA (YC S12)</a> is remote and distributed around the globe, with developers in America, Europe, and Asia. Our working hours cover almost all time-zones, about 22 hours from full time-zone coverage. Yet for distributing our on-call schedule, we were unhappy with PagerDuty’s standard daily rotation. ​​For a distributed team, why does somebody need to be on-call at night when other team members are working right now?</p>
<h2 id="the-tyrant">The Tyrant</h2>
<p>Starting in 2017, a new internal project for on-call scheduling was born - the Tyrant - as tool to handle On-Call scheduling across time-zones.</p>
<p>Over time the project evolved - scheduling algorithm and technology. In 2019, during a hackathon session in Kuala Lumpur (<a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/blog/2019-10-09-a-guide-to-running-company-offsites">learn how to run off-sites for distributed teams</a>), the latest version created with discrete optimization as its core.</p>
<p>Tyrant runs as a cron job every Saturday. It gets hour’s preferences from developers, builds on-call schedule, and pushes it to PagerDuty ​​plus emails to folks.</p>
<p>This series of blog posts will describe all the technical details about using discrete optimization for building schedule.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.optduty.com/images/schedule_after-min.png"></p>
<h2 id="what-is-discrete-optimization">What is Discrete Optimization</h2>
<p>Discrete optimization is the selection of a best element (answer) with regard to some criterion, and where some of the variables are restricted to be discrete. For practical purposes it is a DSL. A user models the problem in specific language, and solvers finds the best answer.</p>
<p>I had used discrete optimization for a few small hobby projects and for programming challenges. But for a long time I could not find a use in day-to-day jobs; every time I had a project solvable by discrete optimization - some naive algorithms always beat it. Sometimes by speed; sometimes better quality over naive algorithms was not worth paying by extra complexity.</p>
<p>Tyrant is a completely different story. As it creates the schedule only once per week, speed isn’t important - the quality of the result is.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.minizinc.org/MiniZn_logo.png" width="100"></p>
<p>Tyrant’s core is implemented in <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/">MiniZinc</a> and the first 3 blog posts will cover it. MiniZinc is a high-level modelling language and compiler. MiniZinc compiles into FlatZinc, a low-level language that is understood by a wide range of solvers (an implementation of a discrete optimization algorithm). For us it means faster development, self-explanatory model, and ability to switch solvers.</p>

<p>In Part 4, we’ll look inside MiniZinc by manually translation an on-call model to low-level mixed integer format <a href="http://polip.zib.de/pipformat.php">PIP-format</a>, and then solve the problem with <a href="https://www.scipopt.org/">SCIP</a> solver.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-minizinc">Introduction to MiniZinc</h3>
<p>Let’s explore a simple problem to familiarize ourselves with the basic MiniZinc syntax. Imagine a small car factory named “BetterThanTesla”. You have 100 lithium batteries, and 190000 kilograms of metal. Building a “Cybertruck” requires 1 battery and 2500 kg of metal, while building “Model3” requires also 1 battery, but only 1500 kg of metal. You would like to know how many of each cars to produce to maximize profit if you can sell “Cybertruck” for $40k and “Model3” for $35k.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>int</span>: total_nb_battery <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;  <span>% fixed, input parameters
</span><span></span><span>int</span>: total_kg_metal <span>=</span> <span>190000</span>; <span>% fixed, input parameters
</span><span></span>
<span>% variable, possible number of different cars
</span><span></span><span>var</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span>total_nb_battery: nb_cybertruck;
<span>var</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span>total_nb_battery: nb_model3;

<span>var</span> <span>int</span>: profit <span>=</span> nb_cybertruck <span>*</span> <span>40000</span> <span>+</span> nb_model3 <span>*</span> <span>35000</span>;

<span>% limit total number of kilograms
</span><span></span><span>constraint</span> nb_cybertruck <span>*</span> <span>2500</span> <span>+</span> nb_model3 <span>*</span> <span>1500</span> <span>&lt;=</span> total_kg_metal;
<span>% limit total number of batteries
</span><span></span><span>constraint</span> nb_cybertruck <span>+</span> nb_model3 <span>&lt;=</span> total_nb_battery;

<span>solve</span> <span>maximize</span> profit;
</code></pre></div><p>The amount of words to describe the problem in English would be about the same as in MiniZinc. The code is self-explanatory even without knowing a lot about the syntax.</p>
<p>There’s a few nuances:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int</code> (first 2 lines) fixed integer variables - value should be defined</li>
<li><code>var int</code> unfixed integer variable - MiniZinc figures out the value later</li>
<li><code>constraint</code> some expression that should be true</li>
</ul>
<p>The line: <code>var 0..total_nb_battery: nb_model3;</code> says variable <code>nb_model3</code> should be an integer from 0 to total_nb_battery. This could be written as:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>var</span> <span>int</span>: nb_model3;
<span>constraint</span> nb_model3 <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>;
<span>constraint</span> nb_model3 <span>&lt;=</span> total_nb_battery;
</code></pre></div><p>The last line <code>solve maximize profit</code> tells MiniZinc what to optimize.</p>
<p>If you run: <code>minizinc hello1.mzn --output-objective</code>, you should get how many cars to build in order to maximize profit: $3.7M:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">nb_cybertruck <span>=</span> <span>40</span>;
nb_model3 <span>=</span> <span>60</span>;
_objective <span>=</span> <span>3700000</span>;
<span>----------</span>

<h3 id="with-data-file">With data file</h3>
<p>To reuse the model we skip defining fixed variables in the model.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>int</span>: total_nb_battery;
<span>int</span>: total_kg_metal;
</code></pre></div><p>And create separate data file <code>hello2.dzn</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">total_nb_battery <span>=</span> <span>100</span>;
total_kg_metal <span>=</span> <span>190000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Command to run model with the separate data file: <code>minizinc hello2.mzn hello2.dzn</code> (Btw, file extension is important for MiniZinc)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/hello2">Source code of hello world with data file</a></p>
<h2 id="building-our-first-on-call-schedule-model">Building our first On-call schedule model</h2>
<p>Now we’re prepared to build our first, simplified on-call scheduling model. For input, the model takes developers' preferences (does developer X want to be on-call at hour Y). The output: assign a developer to every hour next week.
The final assignment should follow only one constraint: assign a developer to an hour according to their preferences.</p>
<h3 id="data-structures-of-scheduling-model">Data Structures of scheduling model</h3>
<p>A famous book by Niklaus Wirth was named <code>Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs</code>. For discrete optimization modeling, MiniZinc does <code>Algorithms</code>, so only <code>Data Structures</code> left to us. For this problem, we have 2 core data structures to define: Input and Output.</p>
<p>For output we use an array <code>assignment</code>, which maps from week hour to a developer. The size is 168 (7 days * 24 hours).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>int</span>: nb_workers;
<span>set</span> <span>of</span> <span>int</span>: HOURS <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>..</span><span>168</span>;
<span>set</span> <span>of</span> <span>int</span>: WORKERS <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>..</span>nb_workers;

<span>array</span>[HOURS] <span>of</span> <span>var</span> WORKERS: assignment;
</code></pre></div><p>Consider <code>set of int</code> as some sort enumeration of numbers from start to end (including end). MiniZinc arrays have named indexes. In our example, <code>assignment</code> has named indexes based on range <code>HOURS</code> (1..168). The statement <code>array[HOURS] of var WORKERS: assignment = [7, 8, 9, ..]</code> means developer <code>7</code> will be on-call at hour <code>1</code> (first index of <code>HOURS</code> range).</p>
<p>Input data will also be array, but 2 dimensional, with size <code>WORKERS</code> × <code>HOURS</code>. It’s a mapping from a developer and an hour to a 0..1 integer. Where 1 means a developer is available for on-call.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>array</span>[WORKERS, HOURS] <span>of</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>1</span>: working_hours;
</code></pre></div><p>Example of a data file (notice how rows separated with <code>|</code> symbol):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">nb_workers <span>=</span> <span>3</span>;

working_hours <span>=</span> [|
<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>0</span> |
<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>0</span> |
<span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>1</span> |];
</code></pre></div><p>One note about nb_workers. Theoretically we could get the value of <code>nb_workers</code> from <code>working_hours</code>, but in practice it’s chicken or egg problem. MiniZinc needs to know <code>nb_workers</code> to define indexes(type) for the <code>working_hours</code> array.</p>
<h3 id="constraint-and-objective">Constraint and objective</h3>
<p>We have only one constraint for now: follow the <code>working_hours</code> input data. We iterate all elements of the <code>working_hours</code> array, and if some developer is unavailable at a specific hour (== 0), then <code>assignment</code> at that hour should not be equal to the unavailable worker.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>constraint</span> <span>forall</span>(h <span>in</span> HOURS, w <span>in</span> WORKERS)(
    working_hours[w, h] <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> assignment[h] <span>!=</span> w
);
</code></pre></div><p><code>-&gt;</code> means implication. For me it’s easier to understand in pseudocode:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>if</span> working_hours[w, h] <span>==</span> <span>0</span>:
    add_constraint(assignment[h] <span>!=</span> w)
</code></pre></div><p>Unlike the car example, here we don’t need optimization, as we don’t have an the expression to optimize. Instead, we ask to satisfy all constraints:</p>
<p>A solution will be available in a few milliseconds.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc">assignment <span>=</span> <span>array1d</span>(<span>1</span><span>..</span><span>168</span>, [<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>..</span><span>.</span>, <span>1</span>]);
<span>----------</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The solution says it’s not so much fun to be the first developer.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/oncall1">Source code of unfair model</a></p>
<h3 id="fairness">Fairness</h3>
<p>Let’s add fairness to the model. Fairness means total on-call hours for each developers should be as similar as possible. To make life easier later we can create an intermediate array <code>total_hours</code>, which for every developer returns the number of hours on-call for the week.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>array</span>[WORKERS] <span>of</span> <span>var</span> <span>int</span>: total_hours <span>=</span> [
    <span>sum</span>( [assignment[h]<span>=</span>w | h <span>in</span> HOURS ] )
    | w <span>in</span> WORKERS
];
</code></pre></div><p>Here we can see new syntax, a list comprehension. We iterate for every worker, and in the inner list comprehension, calculate the actual number of working hours.</p>
<p>To ask for fairness, we need an expression to convert <code>total_hours</code> to one number. One option is <code>min-max</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>solve</span> <span>minimize</span> <span>max</span>(total_hours) <span>-</span> <span>min</span>(total_hours);
</code></pre></div><p>The minimal possible objective is 0 when all developers has equal total on-call hours per week. The expression is provably correct, but in practice it’s pretty slow with default optimizer. MiniZinc assigns the first developer to all hours as initial solution and tries to improve it.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.optduty.com/images/blog/oncall2-slow.gif" alt="slow min max optimization">
(pay attention to the objective value)</p>
<p>One option to fix it is to ask MiniZinc to select developers randomly during search with search annotation. As I’ll focus on another solution, to find our more, check out check out <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.4.3/en/mzn_search.html">this part of MiniZinc tutorial</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>solve</span> :: <span>int_search</span>(assignment, first_fail, indomain_random)
      <span>minimize</span> <span>max</span>(total_hours) <span>-</span> <span>min</span>(total_hours);
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://static.optduty.com/images/blog/oncall2-fast.gif" alt="fast min max optimization"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/oncall2">Source code of min-max model</a></p>
<h3 id="even-fairer-fairness">Even fairer fairness</h3>
<p>The min-max objective is simple, but unfortunately, in some edge cases, it will not work. Minimum and maximum create boundaries and the algorithm will try to push them together as much as possible, but it will not try to optimize developers between boundaries.</p>
<p>Instead, we could use a much more complicated expression:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>var</span> <span>int</span>: absolute_diff <span>=</span> <span>sum</span>(w1 <span>in</span> WORKERS, w2 <span>in</span> WORKERS <span>where</span> w1 <span>&gt;</span> w2)(
     <span>abs</span>(total_hours[w1] <span>-</span> total_hours[w2])
);
</code></pre></div><p>Again there is new syntax, but it’s slightly different list comprehension with an aggregation function on top. We iterate for all unique workers pairs and for each pair, calculate the absolute difference. As the last step, we sum all such differences.</p>
<p>Only one line left, to ask to minimize the sum of absolute differences:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="MiniZinc"><span>solve</span> <span>minimize</span> absolute_diff;
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://github.com/skrypka/minizinc_workshop/tree/master/oncall3">Source code of absolute diff model</a></p>

</ol>

<p>In Chapter 3 we managed to put together a first implementation of <code>POST /subscriptions</code> to fulfill one of the user stories of our email newsletter project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a blog visitor,<br>
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have not yet created a web page with a HTML form to actually test the end-to-end flow, but we have a few black-box integration tests that cover the two basic scenarios we care about at this stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>if valid form data is submitted (i.e. both name and email have been provided), the data is saved in our database;</li>
<li>if the submitted form is incomplete (e.g. the email is missing, the name is missing or both), the API returns a 400.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we be satisfied and rush to deploy the first version of our application on the coolest cloud provider out there?<br>
Not yet - we are not yet equipped to properly run our software in a production environment.<br>
We are blind: the application is not <strong>instrumented</strong> yet and we are not collecting any <strong>telemetry data</strong>, making us vulnerable to <strong>unknown unknowns</strong>.</p>
<p>If most of the previous sentence makes little to no sense to you, do not worry: getting to the bottom of it is going to be the main focus of this chapter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Discuss the article on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24608100">HackerNews</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/j0uo0t/are_we_observable_yet_an_introduction_to_rust/">r/rust</a></em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a few tests. Tests are good, they make us more confident in our software, in its correctness.<br>
Nonetheless, a test suite is not <em>proof</em> of the correctness of our application. We would have to explore significantly different approaches to <em>prove</em> that something is correct (e.g. <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/formal-methods-amazon.pdf">formal methods</a>).<br>
At runtime we will encounter scenarios that we have not tested for or even thought about when designing the application in the first place.</p>
<p>I can point at a few blind spots based on the work we have done so far and my past experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>what happens if we lose connection to the database? Does <code>sqlx::PgPool</code> try to automatically recover or will all database interactions fail from that point onwards until we restart the application?</li>
<li>what happens if an attacker tries to pass malicious payloads in the body of the POST <code>/subscriptions</code> request (i.e. extremely large payloads, attempts to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>, etc.)?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are often referred to as <strong>known unknowns</strong>: shortcomings that we are aware of and we have not yet  managed to investigate or we have deemed to be not relevant enough to spend time on.<br>
Given enough time and effort, we <em>could</em> get rid of most known unknowns.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are issues that we have not seen before and we are not expecting, <strong>unknown unknowns</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes experience is enough to transform an unknown unknown into a known unknown: if you had never worked with a database before you might have not thought about what happens when we lose connection; once you have seen it happen once, it becomes a familiar failure mode to look out for.</p>
<p>More often than not, unknown unknowns are peculiar failure modes of the specific system we are working on.<br>
They are problems at the crossroads between our software components, the underlying operating systems, the hardware we are using, our development process peculiarities and that huge source of randomness known as "the outside world".<br>
They might emerge when:</p>
<ul>
<li>the system is pushed outside of its usual operating conditions (e.g. an unusual spike of traffic);</li>
<li>multiple components experience failures at the same time (e.g. a SQL transaction is left hanging while the database is going through a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby-failover.html">master-replica failover</a>);</li>
<li>a change is introduced that moves the system equilibrium (e.g. tuning a retry policy);</li>
<li>no changes have been introduced for a long time (e.g. applications have not been restarted for weeks and you start to see all sorts of memory leaks);</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these scenarios share one key similarity: they are often impossible to reproduce outside of the live environment.<br>
What can we do to prepare ourselves to deal with an outage or a bug caused by an unknown unknown?</p>

<p>We must assume that we will not be there when an unknown unknown issue arises: it might be late at night, we might be working on something else, etc.<br>
Even if were paying attention at the very same moment something starts to go wrong, it often isn't possible or practical to attach a debugger to a process running in production (assuming you even know in the first place <em>which</em> process you should be looking at) and the degradation might affect multiple systems at once.<br>
The only thing we can rely on to understand and debug an unknown unknown is <strong>telemetry data</strong>: information about our running applications that is collected automatically and can be later inspected to answer questions about the state of the system at a certain point in time.</p>
<p>What questions?<br>
Well, if it is an unknown unknown we do not really know <em>in advance</em> what questions we might need to ask to isolate its root cause - that's the whole point.<br>
The goal is to have an <strong>observable application</strong>.<br>
Quoting from <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/what-is-observability/">Honeycomb's observability guide</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observability is about being able to ask arbitrary questions about your environment without — and this is the key part — having to know ahead of time what you wanted to ask.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"arbitrary" is a strong word - as all absolute statements, it might require an unreasonable investment of both time and money if we are to interpret it literally.<br>
In practice we will also happily settle for an application that is <em>sufficiently</em> observable to enable us to deliver the level of service we promised to our users.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, to build an observable system we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to instrument our application to collect high-quality telemetry data;</li>
<li>access to tools and systems to efficiently slice, dice and manipulate the data to find answers to our questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will touch upon some of the options available to fulfill the second point, but an exhaustive discussion is outside of the scope of this book.<br>
Let's focus on the first for the rest of this chapter.</p>

<p>Logs are the most common type of telemetry data.<br>
Even developers who have never heard of observability have an intuitive understanding of the usefulness of logs: logs are what you look at when stuff goes south to understand what is happening, crossing your fingers extra hard hoping you captured enough information to troubleshoot effectively.</p>
<p>What are logs though?<br>
The format varies, depending on the epoch, the platform and the technologies you are using.<br>
Nowadays a <strong>log record</strong> is usually a bunch of text data, with a line break to separate the current record from the next one.
For example</p>
<pre><code><span>The</span><span> application is starting on port 8080
</span><span>Handling</span><span> a request to /index
</span><span>Handling</span><span> a request to /index
</span><span>Returned</span><span> a 200 OK
</span></code></pre>
<p>are four perfectly valid log records for a web server.</p>
<p>What does the Rust ecosystem have to offer us when it comes to logging?</p>
<h2 id="3-1-the-log-crate">3.1. The <code>log</code> Crate</h2>
<p>The go-to crate for logging in Rust is <a href="https://docs.rs/log"><code>log</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>log</code> provides five macros: <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.trace.html"><code>trace</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.debug.html"><code>debug</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.info.html"><code>info</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.warn.html"><code>warn</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.11/log/macro.error.html"><code>error</code></a>.<br>
They all do the same thing - emit a log a record - but each of them uses a different <strong>log level</strong>, as the naming implies.<br>
<em>trace</em> is the lowest level: trace-level logs are often extremely verbose and have a low signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. emit a trace-level log record every time a TCP packet is received by a web server).<br>
We then have, in increasing order of severity, <em>debug</em>, <em>info</em>, <em>warn</em> and <em>error</em>.<br>
Error-level logs are used to report serious failures that might have user impact (e.g. we failed to handle an incoming request or a query to the database timed out). </p>
<p>Let's look at a quick usage example:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>fallible_operation</span><span>() -&gt; Result&lt;String, String&gt; { ... }

</span><span>pub fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>match </span><span>fallible_operation</span><span>() {
        Ok(success) =&gt; {
            log::info!("</span><span>Operation succeeded: {}</span><span>", success);
        }
        Err(err) =&gt; {
            log::error!("</span><span>Operation failed: {}</span><span>", err);
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We are trying to perform an operation that might fail.<br>
If it succeeds, we emit an info-level log record.<br>
If it doesn't, we emit an error-level log record.</p>
<p>Notice as well how <code>log</code>'s macros support the same interpolation syntax provided by <code>println</code>/<code>print</code> in the standard library.</p>
<p>We can use <code>log</code>'s macros to <em>instrument</em> our codebase.<br>
Choosing what information should be logged about the execution of a particular function is often a <em>local</em> decision: it is enough to look at the function to decide what deserves to be captured in a log record. This enables libraries to be instrumented effectively, extending the reach of our telemetry outside the boundaries of the code we have written first-hand.</p>
<h2 id="3-2-actix-web-s-logger-middleware">3.2. <code>actix-web</code>'s <code>Logger</code> Middleware</h2>
<p><code>actix_web</code> provides a <a href="https://docs.rs/actix-web/2.0.0/actix_web/middleware/struct.Logger.html"><code>Logger</code> middleware</a>. It emits a log record for every incoming request.<br>
Let's add it to our application.</p>
<pre><code><span>//! src/startup.rs
</span><span>use crate</span><span>::routes::{health_check, subscribe};
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::dev::Server;
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::web::Data;
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer};
</span><span>use </span><span>actix_web::middleware::Logger;
</span><span>use </span><span>sqlx::PgPool;
</span><span>use </span><span>std::net::TcpListener;

</span><span>pub fn </span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span>: TcpListener, </span><span>db_pool</span><span>: PgPool) -&gt; Result&lt;Server, std::io::Error&gt; {

                    Automatic layout algorithms compute layouts for diagrams.
                    Never tried them?
                    Well, here's your chance.
                    Choose one of the thingies below and start playing!
                </p>

                        <h3><a href="https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/elklive/elkgraph.html">Interactive Editor</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            Interactively edit a textual description of a graph
                            while a corresponding diagram is generated on-the-fly.
                            Basically,
                            build your own graphs
                            and see what automatic layout does with them.
                            You can choose out of the following two formats,
                            both supporting content&nbsp;assist (<code>Ctrl+Space</code>) and formatting (<code>Shift+Alt+F</code>):

                        <p>
                            An annotated collection of example graphs.
                            Their main purpose is to illustrate
                            various configuration possibilities,
                            in particular those that are often-used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The source of the examples can be found in ELK's

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ (Namaskāra)! This is not a post on fintech, or even technology for that matter. This is the story of a product of tenacity, selflessness, and passion; a product that will transcend and outlive most technology we know of. This is the story of a massive dictionary that will become the window to a language spoken by tens of millions of people for generations to come, a resource its author has donated to posterity. This is the story of V. Krishna, <a href="https://alar.ink/"><em>Alar</em></a>, his Kannada-English dictionary, and its accidental discovery and open sourcing at an unlikely place, a stock brokerage, Zerodha. This post is also a personal note, something I have not attempted in a long time.</p><h3 id="prologue">Prologue</h3><p>I have been running <a href="https://olam.in/">Olam</a>, an English-Malayalam and Malayalam-Malayalam dictionary, since 2010. It was built out of the frustration of not having an easily accessible online Malayalam dictionary, of the frustration at dictionary websites that insulted the reader’s intelligence with poor usability, terrible ad-ridden spamminess, and no respect for language. Olam’s website has stayed exactly the same for 10 years. It has an input box that responds to dictionary lookups in under ~50ms, exactly as it did in 2010. It is actively used by millions of Malayalam speakers.</p><p>The first version of the Olam corpus was seeded with unattributed word lists I scraped together from random parts of the web, and several thousand entries I entered myself. Since then, the English-Malayalam dictionary has been expanding slowly with crowdsourced entries.</p><p>The entire Olam corpus is <a href="https://olam.in/open">open source</a> (licensed under <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/">OdBL</a>), or open data, rather. While the English-Malayalam corpus is crowdsourced, the Malayalam-Malayalam corpus (now known as the <em>Datuk Corpus</em>) was created out of the mammoth digitisation project the late <a href="https://www.asianetnews.com/pravasam/datuk-kj-joseph-passes-away-pm1xdr">“Datuk” K. J. Joseph</a> undertook in the late 90s, when he single-handledly digitised an out-of-copyright Malayalam-Malayalam dictionary along with many other books and posted them online at the expense of copious amounts of time out of his retirement. He was a Malayali settled in Malaysia, a prominent active social worker and educator. The Malaysian government conferred the title “Datuk” upon him in recognition of his exemplary services in the country, which then ended up being his nickname too. I do not know of the origin of the dictionary Datuk digtised, but it is poignant to think that the original author’s work lives on after a century.</p><p>I discovered the RTF file Datuk had posted a decade prior on an inactive Yahoo groups page around the time I was working on Olam. Needless to say, I was stumped by the scope of this project, and immediately started working on integrating it into Olam. It took more than two years of on and off work to convert the text from the original ASCII input to Unicode, and to clean, structure, and correct close to 200,000 entries. The dataset was named <em>Datuk Corpus</em>, and was published on Olam in 2013. I wrote to the Swathanthra Malayalam Computing (SMC) mailing list <a href="http://lists.smc.org.in/pipermail/discuss-smc.org.in/2013-May/015592.html">announcing it</a>, and we launched it with some fanfare at the SMC conference held in Thrissur, Kerala, that year. Datuk’s story was covered by the press, and his work was now open and available to everyone.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, I was connected to Datuk by an old friend of his I had met at the conference, and we spoke briefly on the phone. He had seen the news clip of the dictionary’s release, and was thrilled to know that his work was now accessible as he had originally intended. Open data lives on. He found it amusing that a random stranger had somehow unearthed a relic he had lost to the annals of internet history. Life is absurd like that, shaped in infinite ways by tiny, random events.</p><p>Datuk <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amma.org.my/posts/tribute-to-the-late-datuk-k-j-josephthe-late-datuk-k-j-joseph-was-a-prominent-ed/2157527197640248/">passed away in January 2019</a>. He was 89 years old. RIP Datuk. Your work’s utility will span generations. The data you created will proliferate and continue to be useful to humanity in ways we never imagined. Such is the beauty of open data. I consider it a privilege to have been able to speak to you just that one time.</p><h3 id="open-data">Open data</h3><blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data">Open data</a> is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.</p></blockquote><p>I shudder to think of a world without Wikipedia. The open data movement shares strong parallels with the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement. The gist is that certain knowledge should be freely available to everyone with no restrictions and with one goal—collective advancement of humanity.</p><p>I consider dictionaries to be on top of that list. The stepping stone to language, the underpinning of civilisation. Dictionaries should be open, free, and easily accessible to everyone, everywhere. If we cannot share something as fundamental as language without motives of profit, we ought to do some serious introspection as members of an advanced civilisation.</p><p>An open data dictionary for every Indian language, the largest collection of open source dictionaries in the world, would be an immense resource for not only India but for humanity in general. Ideally, this is the kind of project governments should do. State governments could very easily partner with local universities and undertake the creation and maintenance of open data dictionaries.</p><p>That said, at Zerodha, we would be happy to fund projects to create high quality open data dictionaries if there are scholars out there working on them.</p><h3 id="a-kannada-dictionary">A Kannada dictionary</h3><p>I moved from Kerala to Bengaluru in early 2012 to get access to fast internet. Bengaluru is a melting pot of people from all over India, and English is the glue that holds the “IT sector” together. I can comprehend Kannada speech reasonably well and speak rather poorly, but cannot read the script, thanks to the lack of opportunities to learn over the many years spent between home, where we speak Malayalam, and work, an English speaking environment. With the guilt of not being able to learn Kannada, and the great satisfaction of having Olam as an open data corpus, I had been looking for ways to build a Kannada dictionary right after I had moved to Bengaluru.</p><p>Sometime in 2016, I presented the idea of having an open source Kannada dictionary created from scratch to Nithin. He was immediately on board to commission the project. A perk I enjoy, the privilege of having a resourceful backer who believes in public good. Not knowing where to start, I asked around a few places but nothing materialised for the next two years, and as always, I continued to bring up this conversation once in a while.</p><p>Then, sometime in October 2018, I randomly brought up the conversation again, and Srihari, who had just joined the tech team, happened to overhear it. He vaguely remembered that someone in his family had been associated with a dictionary for a long time. This would be one of those minuscule, random events that would significantly change the timeline; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">Butterfly effect</a> in action. I crossed my fingers and he soon setup a meeting with V. Krishna, the relative of his. Shortly thereafter, Srihari, Sharath (also from the tech team), and I went to <a href="http://www.kagapa.in/">KaGaPa’s</a> office to meet V. Krishna and to find out what exactly it was that Srihari remembered about him and a dictionary. KaGaPa (Kannada Ganaka Parishat) created the popular Nudi font and input method for Kannada, an important early innovation for digital Kannada, and V. Krishna had worked with them on several projects.</p><p>V. Krishna and Narasimhamurthy, KaGaPa’s proprietor, spoke passionately about Kannada literature and digitisation projects in the quaint little office room, surrounded by stacks of old Kannada books and literature. It was the perfect setting. Then, the extremely soft-spoken and mild-mannered V. Krishna fired up a computer and showed us his lifelong side project, his Kannada-English dictionary. Researched and written over a period of more than 40 years, 150,000+ Kannada words and 240,000+ English definitions, all neatly typed up in a Word document, complete with parts of speech tags and phonetic notations with diacritics for Kannada words. The ambition of the project, its scholarly quality, the depth of the data, the culmination of one man’s passion, perseverance, and tenacity over a lifetime, all lying in obscurity, stumbled upon by sheer coincidence. Absolutely mind blowing.</p><h3 id="v-krishna">V. Krishna</h3><figure><img src="https://zerodha.tech/static/images/vkrishna-alar.png" alt="V. Krishna's photo" height="150"></figure><p>V. Krishna was born in 1950 in the Malanayakana Halli village in Mysore district in Karnataka. He studied in a Kannada medium school, followed by a year at a pre-university college that he was forced to drop out of before moving to Bengaluru with his family in 1968.</p><p>He found a job at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in 1970. At IARI, around this time, noticing him struggle with the English language, his boss casually suggested that he procure a dictionary to learn English. This conversation would turn out to be pivotal, and would set V. Krishna on a lifelong journey of language research and scholarship, an amazing case of autodidacticism.</p><p>So, he took his boss’s advice and got himself an English dictionary and started studying it. Then he got himself another dictionary, and another, until he had five of them. At the same time, he took an interest in Kannada literature and started studying Kannada and English together. To help with this, he started jotting down notes, and at some point, began structuring them. A dictionary was being born. In the meanwhile, he took evening classes and obtained a commerce degree in 1976 from MES college, Malleshwaram.</p><p>Around 1980, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_Sahitya_Parishat">Kannada Sahitya Parishattu</a> published a Kannada - English dictionary, and unsurprisingly, V. Krishna got himself a copy. He was surprised by the sheer number of errors he spotted—more than 200 in the first 50 pages. He wrote to the editor with his findings, and impressed by it, the editor met him in person in Bengaluru, where V. Krishna presented his manuscripts to him. Surprised by its quality, he suggested that V. Krishna continue his work and turn it into a full-fledged dictionary. This was the …</p></div></div>

                <p>Should you need to get familiar with <a href="https://turkogluc.com/apache-kafka-connect-introduction/">Kafka Connect Basics</a> or <a href="https://turkogluc.com/kafka-connect-jdbc-source-connector/">Kafka JDBC Connector</a><strong> </strong>check out the previous post. This post focuses on PostgreSQL backup-replication mechanism and streaming data from database to Kafka with using Debezium connector.</p><p>There are basically 3 major methods to perform backups or replication in PostgreSQL:</p><ul><li>Logical dumps (Extracting SQL script that represents the data, for example with using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a>)</li><li>Transactional Log Shipping (Using Write-Ahead Log)</li><li>Logical Decoding</li></ul><p>The first method is relatively harder to maintain and creates more load on the database. <code>Log shipping</code> and <code>Logical Decoding</code> is low level solutions that make use of transaction logs and have the major advantage of efficiency.</p><h2 id="understanding-the-transactional-log">Understanding the Transactional Log</h2><p>Transactional Log is the essential part of the modern relational database systems. It is basically <strong>history log of all actions and changes</strong> applied on the database. The database stores the data eventually in the filesystem, however this I/O operation is relatively costly and if any failure interrupts the writing process the file becomes inconsistent and it would not be easy to recover. </p><p>Therefore database writes the data to a log which is called <strong>Write-Ahead Log</strong> (WAL) directly and transaction is completed. When the data is logged in the WAL, it is considered to be successfully stored even though it is not written to file system yet. So even if system crashes or some failure arises, it will be read from the log when system restarts. </p><p>A process constantly reads the WAL, sets a <code>checkpoint</code> as point in time and writes the changes appended since the last checkpoint time to the actual database file system (every 5 mins by default). As the disk space is limited, the WAL files that are already processed are either archived or recycled (old ones are removed) in order to clean up disk space.</p><p>Each transaction log is divided into 16 MB file that is called <strong>WAL segment</strong> that consist of <strong>records</strong>. Each record has an identifier named <strong>Log Sequence Number</strong> (LSN) that shows the physical location of the record. Processing the transactions and checkpointing could be demonstrated as follows:</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-27-at-01.51.59.png"></figure><h2 id="it-s-all-about-wal-">It's All About WAL!</h2><p>The WAL has important role in replication as it contains the details about transactions, and these records are very important and useful in terms of representing the database state. Note that the WAL segments are not stored forever, once it is consumed it is removed from the disk. So one way to backup locally is copying segment files to a different directory (default dir: <code>pg_wal</code>). Sharing these records with remote servers gives the opportunity to create replicas efficiently.</p><h3 id="transactional-log-shipping">Transactional Log Shipping</h3><p>It is a solution to replicate the database in different servers by shipping the WAL segments. Replica server operates on recovery mode all the time and replays the WAL records that it receives to be consistent with primary server. This solution could be implemented by sending the complete 16MB WAL segments files or streaming individual records as they are written. Streaming is a better solution in terms of durability. See the details of psychical replication implementation details: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/warm-standby.html">Log Shipping</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-27-at-10.36.31.png"></figure><p>In Log Shipping method the segment files which contains binary data copied physically (byte-by-byte) to another server. So it can be also called <strong>physical replication</strong>. This approach has some limitations and drawbacks as it is not possible to replicate between different versions of Postgres or different operating systems, and also it can not replicate part of a database. Logical replication is introduced to address these limitations.</p><h3 id="logical-replication">Logical Replication</h3><p>Logical replication is a method that decodes the binary WAL records into a more understandable format and sends this decoded data to remote server. It uses <code>publish</code> and <code>subscribe</code> model with one or more subscribers receiving data from publishers. In contrast to physical replication, there is no Primary and Standby servers but data can flow both sides, but from publishers to subscribers. Publisher creates a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-createpublication.html"><code>PUBLICATION</code></a>:</p><pre><code>CREATE PUBLICATION mypublication FOR TABLE users, departments;
CREATE PUBLICATION alltables FOR ALL TABLES;</code></pre><p>And Subscribers creates <code><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-createsubscription.html">SUBSCRIPTION</a></code>:</p><pre><code>CREATE SUBSCRIPTION mysubcribtion
         CONNECTION 'host=localhost port=5432 user=foo dbname=foodb'
        PUBLICATION mypublication, alltables;</code></pre><p>The changes send by publisher are replicated in the subscriber database to ensure that the two databases remain in sync. It is important to remember that after some time WAL segments are deleted. So if a subscriber stops for some and the the WAL record is deleted in the publisher it causes a FATAL error. </p><p><strong><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/logicaldecoding-explanation.html">Replication slots</a></strong> solves this problem for us. By assigning a subscriber to a replication slot we can guarantee that the WAL records that it related with the subscription are not going to be removed until the subscriber consumes them. <code>CREATE SUBSCRIPTION</code> command automatically generates a replication slot in the publisher side for us so we do not need to create it manually.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-27-at-12.14.55.png"></figure><p>Now having the necessary knowledge of PostgreSQL replication concepts we can proceed to configure and manage the Debezium Connector.</p><h2 id="debezium-connector">Debezium Connector</h2><p>Debezium is an open source <strong>Change Data Capture</strong> platform that turns the existing database into event streams. Debezium Kafka Connector captures each row level change in the database and sends them to Kafka topics.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/debezium-architecture.png"></figure><p>Debezium uses the <code>logical replication</code> feature of PostgreSQL in order to capture the transaction records from the WAL. The connector acts the subscriber role for the changes published from tables. It handles all the low level configuration for us, as creating publisher, subscribers replication slots etc.</p><p>In order to use the connector we need an <code>output plugin</code> installed in the PostgreSQL server so that it can decode the WAL records. Debezium connector supports number of output plugins:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/debezium/postgres-decoderbufs"><code>decoderbufs</code></a>: based on Protobuf and maintened by Debezium Community</li><li><a href="https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json/blob/master/README.md"><code>wal2json</code></a>: based on JSON</li><li><code>pgoutput</code>: is the standard logical decoding output plug-in in PostgreSQL, also supported by Debezium Community.</li></ul><p>I personally recommend using <code>pgoutput</code> as it is the native plugin and it does not require any additional installation. If you would like to use another plugin you need to install it in the database server. See the <a href="https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.2/postgres-plugins.html">documentation</a> for installing plugins. We can setup the all architecture with the following steps</p><h3 id="1-running-kafka-cluster">1-Running Kafka Cluster</h3><p>We can use the following docker-compose file to get Kafka cluster with a single broker up and running.</p><pre><code>version: '2'

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Dunlop CryBaby is a timeless effect pedal. Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, David Gilmour, and a host of other rock musicians began popularizing the wah effect in the mid 60s, and just about every rock guitarist onwards has toyed with them at one point or another. Seems like a natural choice to look at next using LTSpice.</p><p>If you’d like to follow along at home, <a href="https://github.com/Cushychicken/ltspice-guitar-pedals/tree/master/dunlop-crybaby-wah">I’ve put the LTSpice file up on GitHub for your persual</a>. Find mistakes? Want to submit mods? Feel free to submit a pull request.</p><p>This is the first design I’ve analyzed with no opamps. Cool! Light on active components, but heavy on fun circuit tricks.</p><p>The bulk of the excitement in the Dunlop CryBaby is in the Active Filter + Output section, but we’ll take a look at the Input and Feedback Follower segments as well. (Power is very simple - a few bulk caps, and a Zener for reverse voltage clamping in the event that the battery accidentally gets wired backwards. Doesn’t meaningfully affect any of the audio stuff we’re discussing.)</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979249553.png" alt="Dunlop Crybaby - Whole Schematic"></p><p>This isn’t anything special - just a high impedance BJT follower. This forms a nice, cheap buffer to redrive the input signal into the downstream components.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/2020-09-25-ltspice-dunlop-crybaby/Image-1600979302189.png" alt="Input Buffer"></p><p>Q1 is actually strongly biased. Based on my limited research, this is pretty rare in guitar pedals. Lotsa vendors out there who want to save a few fractions of a cent on a resistor, apparently. That, and the fact that audio electronics is a pretty small community. Lots of designers bouncing from one company to the next, and a reasonable amount of ripping off of other companies’ designs.</p><p>At the end of the day, though, lousy biasing isn’t that big of a deal. This is just audio. It’s not medical equipment, or critical infrastructure. Worst case, the biasing sucks, and someone’s pedal dies.</p><p>Q2 is a standard common-emitter amp. It also provides the bias for Q3, the downstream feedback amplifier, via R11.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979345975.png" alt="Active Filter + Output Stage"></p><p>L1 and C11 form a resonant tank. This LC tank circuit accentuates different frequencies based on the setting of the potentiometer (R14 + R12), which alters the feedback into the tank. (More on the Q3 feedback circuit in a minute.)</p><p>This affects the damping, and also the resonant frequency, of the resonant tank. It’s easiest to see in the time domain; a simple step response shows that for Rtone = 100 ohms, you get a mildly underdamped circuit with a resonance at ~2.1kHz.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979387157.png" alt="Step Response: Rtone=100 ohm"></p><p>Crank Rtone up to 100kOhm (i.e. short the feedback path to the output), and you get a wildly underdamped circuit with a resonance at ~430Hz.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979449819.png" alt="Step Response: Rtone=100k"></p><p>The feedback follower is really just another emitter follower, like the input stage. Unlike the input stage, it’s got a potentiometer serving as a variable attenuator at the input.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1600979641895.png" alt="Feedback Follower"></p><p>Rtone is really controlling two things:</p><ul><li>how much current is fed back into the LC tank in the active filter stage, and</li><li>which frequencies are fed back into the LC stage.</li></ul><p>Rtone and C8 form a very simple RC filter which determines which range of frequencies get fed back. When the potentiometer is at 100k, Vfb_in shorts to Vout, and you’re feeding the unattenuated signal back into the LC tank, with no meaningful guitar frequencies suppressed: \[R12||C8 = (100k\Omega) || (0.22uF) = 7.2[Hz]\]</p><p>Conversely, when the potentiometer starts to short Vfb_in to GND, you’re not feeding anything back into the tank. The RC passband moves down, with most current getting shunted to ground instead of thru C8: \[R12||C8 = (100 \Omega) || (0.22uF) = 7200[Hz]\]</p><p>You can see this as you plot Vfb_in against Vout for a sweep of Rtone values across frequencies:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20200925141159987.png" alt="Vbn_in magnitude decreases as Rtone shorts to GND"></p><p>Without the feedback component, Q2 is basically just an active highpass filter. The feedback element formed by Rtone, C8, and Q3 is a variable lowpass filter. Adding feedback mixes this lowpass element with the highpass filter, forming an <em>active bandpass filter</em>.</p><p>The net effect of this a nice moving central peak in the magnitude response of the Wah pedal, allowing you to accentuate any signals within the 500Hz to 2kHz band:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1601057975751.png" alt="Tone Setting vs Frequency"></p><p>Plotting phase with this many sweep components is a bit of an eye exam, but it reveals a pretty useful corollary to understanding the Wah at a conceptual level:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1601058017485.png" alt="Tone Setting vs Frequency, with Phase"></p><p>Note that the peak of each output magnitude in the plot aligns nicely with the 180deg phase delta of the input. That’s not an accident - in fact, that’s the crux of what this pedal is doing. The feedback stage is a simple emitter follower. An emitter follower inverts whatever signal it is fed, leaving you with a signal shifted 180 degrees at the output. That shifted signal, in this case, is fed back into the input, through the resonant tank. If you’ve done any oscillator design, this 180 degree criterion will sound familiar:</p><ul><li>take a high gain amplifier,</li><li>offset its output 180 degrees from the input,</li><li>and feed the output back into the input,</li></ul><p>…and you have an oscillator! That’s the same idea behind the CryBaby. It’s basically a crude voltage tuned oscillator, but without the near-infinite gain. You’re effectively selecting the oscillator tuning frequency by controlling how much current is fed back into the LC tank.</p><p>ElectroSmash, of course, is an excellent reference on all things guitar pedal, and <a href="https://www.electrosmash.com/crybaby-gcb-95">their wah analysis is no exception</a>.</p><p>The timeless R.G. Keen also has <a href="http://www.geofex.com/article_folders/wahpedl/wahped.htm#whatwah">a wondrous overview of wah pedals</a>, consisting of both circuit and qualitative analysis.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>Real world data analysis projects are often quite complicated.
They can involve multi-gigabyte input files, complex data cleaning procedures, week-long computations, and elaborate reports.
Making changes and then tracking down the parts that need to be recomputed becomes close to impossible.
In this article I describe my approach for dealing with this problem, which is based on a lesser known build automation tool - redo<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>.</p>

<h2 id="redo">Redo</h2>

<p>Data science projects typically have complex pipelines involving input files, code, results, and reports.
Analyses can be computationally intensive and take hours if not days or weeks to complete.
Hence data science practitioners need to be able to make changes without restarting the whole pipeline from scratch.
Workflow management becomes essential and many projects turn to build automation tools like Make<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>.
However Make has its warts, in particular when applied to data analysis, and so people end up designing their own variants, such as SCons<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>, Snakemake<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>, and Drake<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>, among others.</p>

<p>One lesser known alternative to the above mentioned tools goes by the name of “redo”.
Redo is a recursive build automation system that promises to be simpler and more powerful than Make.
Unlike Make or its derivatives redo is tiny, recursive, and has no special syntax of its own.
It allows us to declare target dependencies straight from within the code being executed, which enables writing scripts that “know” they will need to rerun themselves whenever their input data changes all without maintaining a separate dependency configuration file.
In this demonstration we will be using the redo version by “apenwarr”<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a> who rediscovered, documented, and popularized the idea and is the author and current maintainer of its most comprehensive implementation<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>A typical data analysis workflow has four parts: 1) obtaining the data; 2) cleaning the data; 3) estimating a model; 4) producing a report.
Similarly our dummy project will consist of four steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Obtain a dataset of chicken weights and their feed supplements.</li>
<li>Subset the data by only selecting one type of feed supplement.</li>
<li>Produce a “model” for the selected supplement using empirical density estimation.</li>
<li>Summarise the obtained results in a report.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each step will produce an output and save the results to a separate file.
To keep things simple all the scripts for the steps above will be written in R.
The overall goal is to construct a pipeline that can detect changes in our stored data files or our code and automatically reproduce the final report with all its dependencies.
This demonstration will start simple and add complexity along the way.</p>

<h2 id="doingandredoing">Doing and redoing</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the most basic redo command.
In the first step we have to obtain a dataset of chicken weights plus the type of supplements they were fed and store it in a file.
The dataset is already freely available from within R so all we have to do is save it.
We enter the commands to do the task in a file named <code>'rawdata.rds.do'</code>:</p>

<pre><code>1.  #!/usr/bin/env Rscript
2.
3.  outfile &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)[3]
4.
5.  saveRDS(chickwts, file = outfile)
</code></pre>

<p>Then to obtain the data file we go to a command line and call redo:</p>

<pre><code>$ redo rawdata.rds

redo:  rawdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>Which creates the <code>'rds'</code> file named <code>'rawdata.rds'</code> containing the data and informs us about the result.</p>

<p>Some explanation is necessary.
The redo command simply takes an argument and tries to produce a file of the same name.
In this case the argument was <code>'rawdata.rds'</code> and, given the command, redo starts looking for instructions about how to produce it.
The rule for storing instructions is quite simple - they are stored in a separate file with a name constructed by adding a <code>'.do'</code> suffix to the original argument.
In other words - redo looks for instructions about producing <code>'rawdata.rds'</code> file in a file named <code>'rawdata.rds.do'</code>.</p>

<p>The file itself is treated as a shell script.
This is why it is started with a hash-bang<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a> sequence followed by a path to a program that will be used to interpret the instructions.
We want to write our script in R so we specify Rscript.</p>

<p>Finally, when redo calls our script with <code>'redo rawdata.rds.do'</code> it passes three arguments to it:
1) The target name itself - <code>'rawdata.rds'</code>, 2) The basename of the target file - <code>'rawdata'</code>, 3) The temporary file to save the data in - <code>'rawdata.rds.redo.tmp'</code>.
After the execution finishes the file stored in the temp file (3rd argument) will be moved to the target (1st argument).
This mechanism makes sure that in the case of failed computation the existing target will not be corrupted.
And that is why we do not specify the output filename within the script ourselves but rather use the 3rd variable provided by redo.</p>

<p>The dataset is obtained and stored and so the first step of this project is now complete.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>What happens if we execute the previous redo command again? - nothing spectacular:</p>

<pre><code>$ redo rawdata.rds

redo  rawdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>Redo executed the instruction file again and reproduced the output.
But there exists another command called <code>redo-ifchange</code> that behaves a bit differently:</p>

<pre><code>$ redo-ifchange rawdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>After calling this command - nothing happens.
<code>redo-ifchange</code> differs from redo in an important way: it checks if any dependencies needed to reproduce the specified output have changed.
In our case redo knows only a single dependency for our <code>'rawdata.rds'</code> file - the ‘do’ instruction file itself.
It hasn’t changed so <code>redo-ifchange</code> halts and does not reproduce the target.</p>

<p>So let’s move on to the second step of the project and select a feed type.
To achieve this we produce a separate R file called <code>'subdata.rds.do'</code>:</p>

<pre><code>1.   #!/usr/bin/env Rscript
2.
3.   outfile &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)[3]
4.
5.   system("redo-ifchange rawdata.rds")
6.   rawdata &lt;- readRDS("rawdata.rds")
7.
8.   subdata &lt;- rawdata[rawdata$feed == "soybean", ]
9.
10.  saveRDS(subdata, file = outfile)
</code></pre>

<p>Take a closer look at the 5th line in the file above.
Here, before loading the data, we call the <code>redo-ifchange</code> command on it.
At this step the script temporarily halts and checks if our requested data file, <code>rawdata.rds</code>, needs to be recomputed.
If the target file is missing or some of its dependencies have changed it will be regenerated by calling the <code>'rawdata.rds.do'</code> script.
And if nothing changed the 5th line passes without redoing anything and the already existing data file is used.</p>

<p>Now, to obtain the output for the second step, we request the file with redo, just like before:</p>

<pre><code>$ redo subdata.rds

redo subdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>All done, the result is stored in <code>'subdata.rds'</code>.
Currently we have the following files in our project:</p>

<pre><code>$ tree
.
├── rawdata.rds
├── rawdata.rds.do
├── subdata.rds
└── subdata.rds.do
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s remove all the <code>'rds'</code> data files and try reproducing the <code>'subdata.rds'</code> again:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm *.rds
$ redo subdata.rds

redo  subdata.rds
redo    rawdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>Here we asked for <code>'subdata.rds'</code> but redo was smart enough to reproduce both of the data files.
What we did, in essence, is declared a dependency between two R scripts from within the script itself.</p>

<h2 id="defaultinstructions">Default instructions</h2>

<p>Before moving on we have to spend some time on a few redo implementation details.
By convention when we call <code>'redo a.b.rds'</code> command redo starts looking for an <code>'a.b.rds.do'</code> script.
But if the file doesn’t exist redo will search for a different file named <code>'default.b.rds.do'</code> which should store general instructions for producing any <code>'*.b.rds'</code> file.
As an example we rename our previous <code>'subdata.rds.do'</code> file to <code>'default.subdata.rds.do'</code>.
Now this do script will get executed whenever we use redo to request a file that ends with <code>'subdata.rds.do'</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ mv subdata.rds.do default.subdata.rds.do
$ redo a.subdata.rds b.subdata.rds

redo a.subdata.rds
redo b.subdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>Since both files generated above were produced by the same script <code>'default.subdata.rds.do'</code> they are identical - they both hold the data for soybean feed.
Those files will no longer be needed for our demonstration so we can get rid of them:</p>

<pre><code>$ rm *subdata.rds
$ tree
.
├── default.subdata.rds.do
├── rawdata.rds
└── rawdata.rds.do
</code></pre>

<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>

<p>The default instructions introduced above can be exploited to implement parameters in our do scripts.
In the current stage we have a script - <code>'default.subdata.rds.do'</code> that is executed whenever we request an ‘rds’ file that ends with <code>'subdata.rds'</code>.
It always produces the data for the soybean feed but we can make it return different outputs based on the prefix of the target file.</p>

<p>Currently the feed types we are selecting are hard-coded in the code itself.
It would be nicer if we can specify them as parameters passed to the R script.
We rewrite <code>'default.subdata.rds.do'</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>1.   #!/usr/bin/env Rscript
2.
3.   outfile &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)[3]
4.   feed    &lt;- strsplit(outfile, "\\.")[[1]][1]
5.
6.   system("redo-ifchange rawdata.rds")
7.   rawdata &lt;- readRDS("rawdata.rds")
8.
9.   subdata &lt;- rawdata[rawdata$feed == feed, ]
10.
11.  saveRDS(subdata, file = outfile)
</code></pre>

<p>Two changes were made:
1) the 4th line uses the prefix of the output file in order to decide which feed type should be returned;
2) the 9th line then uses the selected feed type in order to subset the data.
This allows us to request various types of feed data:</p>

<pre><code>$ redo soybean.subdata.rds

redo soybean.subdata.rds

$ redo casein.subdata.rds

redo casein.subdata.rds
</code></pre>

<p>And now we have separate types in separate files.</p>

<h2 id="redoingwithparameters">Redoing with parameters</h2>

<p>In the third step we need a do script that, given subsetted feed data, estimates the density function and stores the result to a separate file.
Like the previous script, we want it to be general and produce the results for any selected feed type.
For this to work we have to know which input file to load based on the given output file.
If the script will be called by <code>'redo soybeen.density.rds'</code> command our target will be <code>'soybean.density.rds'</code>.
And from this we can deduce that the input file needed to obtain its density is <code>'soybean.subdata.rds'</code>.</p></div>

<p>When people envision technology overtaking society, many think of The Terminator and bulletproof robots. Or Big Brother in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four<em>, </em>a symbol of external, omnipotent oppression.</p>
<p>But in all likelihood, dystopian technology will not strong-arm us. Instead, we’ll unwittingly submit ourselves to a devil’s bargain: freely trade our subconscious preferences for memes, our social cohesion for instant connection, and the truth for what we want to hear.</p>
<p>Indeed, as former insiders at Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube attest in our new documentary, <a href="http://thesocialdilemma.com/" data-link-name="in body link">The Social Dilemma</a><em>, </em>this is already happening. We already live in a version of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World<em>.</em> As Neil Postman puts it in his 1985 book Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>In Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity, and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The technology that threatens our society, democracy, and mental health is lurking in our bedrooms, sometimes lying on our pillows, as we fall asleep. We awake to its call, bring its chiming notifications to dinner, and blindly trust where it guides us. We scroll insatiably, unsuspecting that the technology that connects us, especially now in a distanced world, is also controlling us.</p>

<p>Our social media platforms are powered by a surveillance-based business model designed to mine, manipulate, and extract our human experiences at any cost, causing a breakdown of our information ecosystem and shared sense of truth worldwide. This extractive business model is not built <em>for </em>us but built to <em>exploit</em> us.</p>

<p>In 2014, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/" data-link-name="in body link">Pew Research Center</a> found that partisan antipathy and division in America is “deeper and more extensive than at any point in the last two decades”. Over the past six years, social media has only exacerbated these sentiments. In 2019, 77% of Republicans and 72% of Democrats <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/10/10/partisan-antipathy-more-intense-more-personal/" data-link-name="in body link">said</a> voters in both parties “not only disagree over plans and policies, but also cannot agree on the basic facts”.</p>

<p>In The Social Dilemma, Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist and the co-founder of the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/" data-link-name="in body link">Center for Humane Technology</a>, points out that far before technology overpowers human strengths, it will overwhelm human weaknesses. Sophisticated algorithms learn our emotional vulnerabilities and exploit them for profit in insidious ways.</p>
<p>By surveilling nearly all of our online activity, social media platforms can now predict our emotions and behaviors. They leverage these insights and auction us to the highest advertising bidder, and they have consequently become some of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html" data-link-name="in body link">richest companies in the history of the world</a>.</p>
<p>But users aren’t just being sold a pair of shoes. The targeting capabilities of these platforms give anyone with a motive the power and precision to influence us cheaply and with phenomenal ease. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/technology/government-disinformation-cyber-troops.html" data-link-name="in body link">Disinformation campaigns</a> have been cited in more than 70 countries, and doubled from 2017 to 2019.</p>
<p>The whistleblower Sophie Zhang has <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo" data-link-name="in body link">revealed</a> how pervasive the problem is on Facebook’s platform, and how little the company acts on it. Facebook recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/technology/facebook-election-chaos-november.html" data-link-name="in body link">rolled out</a> a series of updates to mitigate political misinformation in the upcoming US presidential election, including a bar on political ads one week before election day, but these measures are too little, too late, and they do not address the fundamental problem of their exploitative business model.</p>
<p>After nearly three years of working on this film, I now see “the social dilemma” as a foundational problem of our time, underlying many of the other societal conflicts that require compromise and a shared understanding to fix. If two sides are constantly fed reflections of their pre-existing ideologies and outrageous straw men of opposing views, we will never be able to build bridges and heal the challenges that plague humanity.</p>
<p>But there is hope. In The Terminator sequels, Arnold Schwarzenegger comes back as a good guy. “Who sent you?” John Connor asks. The Terminator answers, “You did. Thirty-five years from now, you reprogrammed me to be your protector.”</p>
<p>In the absence of time travel, the solution needs to incorporate the work and voices of devoted activists, organizations, scholars, and those who have experienced the harms of exploitative technology, which amplifies systemic oppression and inequality. We can’t rely on the people who created the problem to be the ones to solve it. And I won’t trust these social media companies until they change their business model to serve us, the public. Humans created this technology, and we can – and have a responsibility to – change it.</p>

September 27, 2020 | https://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p>In his bestselling book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens">Sapiens</a>, Yuval Harari argues that humans became the dominating species of planet earth because we are the only animal that can cooperate in large numbers. This, he claims, is due to humans’ ability to believe in purely imaginative things and concepts. A company like Google, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> exist. Sure, there’s the Google.com website and physical Google offices with real Google employees – but the idea of Google as a company is just a fictional concept. It only exists because multiple people believe in it. The same is true for legal systems, nations, religion or money. Every large human cooperation system is based on a fictional idea that only lives in our collective minds.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/qanon.gif" media="min-width: 600px">What Harari doesn’t discuss in his book is the extreme other end of this cognitive ability: Conspiracy theories. I’ve been fascinated by <a href="https://reallifemag.com/this-is-not-a-game/">Jon Glover’s recent essay on QAnon</a>, in which he compares conspiracy theorizing to alternate-reality games. Participating in QAnon conspiracies, he says, feels like playing a real-life multiplayer game based on secret insider knowledge.</p>



<p>Social media has made conspiracy theorizing so addictive and immersive that the line between story and reality can become incredibly blurry. </p>



<p><i>“A lot of these groups are like cults […] They have beliefs that border on religiosity … And when you contradict them, it’s like telling them Jesus isn’t real.”</i></p>



<p>The religion analogy is interesting because it’s a perfect example of why fact checking as a countermeasure is useless. <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/about">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking">Facebook</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-factcheck/with-fact-checks-twitter-takes-on-a-new-kind-of-task-idUSKBN2360U0?il=0">co</a> have all introduced fact checks and fake news labels to combat conspiracy theories. It’s naive to think that they will work.</p>



<p>Think about it: Science (which, you could argue, is also a form of fact checking) has been around for centuries trying to debunk most religious beliefs – and yet religion still plays a major role in Western society. If entire education systems teaching millions of people about science haven’t worked, why do you think adding a small fact check disclaimer below a YouTube video would?</p>



<p>In fact – as you would expect from a perfect alternate-reality game – fact checks (and how to circumvent them) have <a href="https://twitter.com/elisethoma5/status/1303630697567928320">actually long been part of the game</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that science is also just another belief system. We laugh about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">flat earthers</a>, but how many people can actually explain why the world is round in a scientifically correct way? Most of us don’t <em>know</em> science, we <em>believe</em> in science.</p>



<center><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/reality.gif"></center>



<p>What should give us hope though is the fact that many people believe in *both* science and religion despite their contradictions. This means that multiple realities can co-exist even when they are at odds with each other.</p>



<p>We don’t live in just one reality – we switch between different realities (and play different characters within them). It’s a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)">Westworld</a>, where guests can explore different theme parks: Westworld, Shogunworld, Warworld, etc.</p>



<p>Similar to Westworld, it’s increasingly becoming more difficult to distinguish between what’s real and what isn’t. As Aaron Z. Lewis points out in his brilliant essay <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/">You Can Handle the Post-Truth</a>, we have created a fragmented reality with hyper-realistic CGI influencers, bots, deepfakes, AI pretending to be humans and humans pretending to be AI. We don’t live in a single timeline with a single history, but in a variety of “<em>contradictory reality bubbles</em>“.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/narrativeviolations.png"></p><p>Bruno Maçães paints a similar picture in his excellent book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52914599-history-has-begun">History Has Begun</a>. America, he believes, is in the process of transforming into a new, post-liberal society, distinct from current Western civilization. It’s a society that has not only been heavily shaped by television but one where reality and fantasy overlap.</p>



<p>This transformation has been in the making for a while: Kennedy had the aura of a movie star and leveraged his image through the medium of television. Nixon created the first political soap opera with the Watergate scandal. And with Reagan an actual movie star moved into the White House.</p>



<p>Trump is the ultimate culmination of this trend. His entire presidency feels scripted. His tweets end with <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1265819308699070464?lang=en">cliffhangers</a>. A House of Cards screenwriter would not have been able to come up with a better story.</p>



<p>Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger used the social capital and entertainment skills they acquired as actors to appear more likable and competent as politicians, but at least they tried to be politicians. Trump, on the other hand, uses politics as another stage for his acting performance.</p>



<p><em>“Americans see the world as an action movie”</em> Maçães writes. I think this became especially apparent during the current covid-19 crisis and the most recent wildfires in California. People in my social media timelines seemed only superficially worried. Instead, their posts contained an underlying sense of excitement about real life finally catching up with the science fiction aesthetics of Blade Runner and Akira.</p>



<p>Perhaps this is Hollywood’s greatest achievement: It gets us excited about our dystopian future. The world might be ending, but at least it’s an ending that’s entertaining to watch.</p>



<p><iframe width="100%" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_m9TUP_t_Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>If Hollywood created the fantasy worlds that reality is catching up with today, who is creating the fantasy worlds of tomorrow?</p>



<p>Maçães thinks the answer is Silicon Valley, which he describes as <em>“a fantasy land where engineering talent and capital come together to power the serious project of creating new worlds out of nothing”</em>. It’s one of the most idiosyncratic descriptions of how startups work that I have read. VCs are the new Hollywood studios; founders are the directors and actors.</p>



<p>A founder’s job is essentially to create the most compelling narrative of what their company will look like in 10 to 20 years time. <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/09/17/are-founders-allowed-to-lie/">It’s not lying, it’s telling pre-truths</a>. Being contrarian just means that you came up with a novel fantasy plot no one else had thought of yet.</p>



<p>Sometimes founders are able to re-create the fantasy narratives of their pitch decks. Sometimes you end up with Theranos.</p>



<p>And even when you do end up with Theranos, at least you get material for an exciting new Netflix series. Perhaps VCs should buy the movie rights to the startups they invest in as a hedge against their biggest portfolio failures?</p>



<p>The concept of the tech industry as a creator of fantasy worlds immediately reminded me of a conversation I had with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cutler_max">Max</a> recently. His theory is that it’s not the lack of tech talent or venture capital that explains why Europe hasn’t been able to create a tech ecosystem on par with the US. It’s the absence of religiosity that has kept Europe from creating its own Google or Facebook. The US is able to create larger companies because it’s able to believe in larger and more ambitious narratives.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/escher.png"></p><p>Silicon Valley is not just creating new fantasy worlds, it is building tools that allow others to create their own fantasy worlds. Enter social media.</p>



<p>If TV has taught us to think of ourselves as characters in the story of our lives, then social media has allowed us to actually write and edit the script and build fictional characters. Social media is essentially the democratization of virtual world building.</p>



<p>As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, Twitter, Snapchat and Facebook are just massive virtual status arenas that allow us to build social capital through signaling. Some of that social capital might be built on top of real stories and actual achievements, but most of it is not based on reality. Every time you are applying an Instagram filter, you are already changing reality.</p>



<p>It’s not just that we bend reality in our social media narratives, we also play different characters. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Zs74IH0mc">Chris Poole already pointed out</a> years ago, we all have multiple (online) identities. There is not just one reflection of yourself – identity is prismatic. Twitter-Julian (armchair intellectual) is not the same as Instagram-Julian (hobby photographer) or Facebook-Julian (high-school drinking buddy). Google Circles and Facebook Lists always got this wrong: They let us change who we shared <em>with</em>, but not who we shared <em>as</em>.</p>



<p>This is why social networking is not a winner-take-all market. We need different channels for our different, contradicting online personas. </p>



<p>The problem is not that we live in multiple realities or that these realities are sometimes at odds with each other. What’s problematic is that we sometimes get so immersed in one virtual world, that we forget about all the other realities – which brings us back to the problem of online conspiracies.</p>



<p>In Christopher Nolan’s Inception, Dom Cobb uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPy88-E2zo">a spinning tractricoid top that tells him if he is awake or still dreaming</a>. You can think of the mechanisms I describe in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/08/06/proof-of-x/">Proof of X</a> as social media’s equivalent of the spinning top. As <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/10/you-can-rent-a-grounded-private-jet-to-take-instagram-photos.html">influencers rent grounded private jets</a> to pretend living a billionaire lifestyle, social networks introduce new proof-of-work hurdles to make sure our status games remain grounded in truth. Proof of reality.</p>



<p>It feels like some of the new virtual realities we have created need more than that. A kill switch that automatically brings us back to base reality.</p>



<p>So if you have reached this point of my essay, perhaps now would be a good time to close your browser window and enjoy real life. Or at least <a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">the closest simulation you have thereof</a>. </p>

<p>The graphics may be a bit flickery, with a lot of color clashing when
things overlap, but the pixel fill rate is outstanding.

</p><p>The per-object overhead is fairly high, especially for objects that move.
You can observe this by slowing the movement rate of a player projectile
to a crawl (<code>515a:20 00</code>) and tapping the space bar rapidly.
Performance with two dozen projectiles in flight is rather poor; compare
it to the very good performance of the title demo (19-rectangle Epoch logo
and 8 stars), and space region 5 (1 ship and up to 32 stars).</p>

<p>Even so, the cost of moving and projecting objects is lower than it is
in games like Elite or Stellar 7, because Epoch takes a few shortcuts.</p>


<h2>General</h2>

<p>Epoch uses a left-handed three-dimensional coordinate system, with
the viewer at (0,0,0), +X to the right, +Y downward, and +Z away (into the
screen).  The viewer is always at (0,0,0), looking directly down the Z axis
with +Y upward, so object coordinates are always in eye (camera) space.
The view area is treated as square, using a perspective projection with a
45-degree FOV, so an object at (100,100,100) would be at the bottom-right
corner of the screen, as would an object at (200,200,200).</p>

<p>The "far" plane is at Z=+32767, so X/Y are limited to (-32767,+32767).
Anything that moves outside the view frustum is discarded.  If it moves past
the near plane at Z=0, player collision tests are applied.</p>


<p>All math, including object movement and perspective projection, is done
with simple arithmetic and about 4KB of lookup tables.</p>

<p>The points, lines, and rectangles that make up an object are always
drawn parallel to the viewer.</p>

<p>The game uses the full hi-res screen, which is 280 pixels wide.
That's more than will fit in a single byte, so screen X coordinates are
expressed as a signed value in the range [-139,139] (one byte holds the
magnitude, another byte holds the sign).  Y coordinates are simply [0,191].
Because the screen itself is not square, rendered element widths are
effectively multiplied by (280/192)=~1.46 (assuming ideal projection).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/objects.html">objects</a> page explains how objects are
defined.  The most important thing to know is that each object is defined
as a set of elements, which may be points, horizontal lines, vertical lines,
or filled rectangles in different colors.</p>


<h2>Movement</h2>

<p>There are three sources of movement:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Projectiles, enemy ships, and explosion chunks have nonzero
    movement vectors.  (Stars, bases, and time portals don't move
    on their own.)</li>
  <li>The player can move forward.</li>
  <li>The player can turn.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the coordinates were maintained in world space, player rotation
would be something applied at the very end, right before projection.
Because they're always in eye space, every object's position and motion
vector must be updated when the player rotates.</p>

<p>To see why this is, consider what happens when a player projectile
('#') is fired:</p>

<pre>  [player] ...# --&gt;
</pre>
<p>The projectile is moving directly away from the player, with a velocity
vector (0,0,N).  If the player instantly pitched up 45 degrees, the
projectile should be at the bottom of the screen, moving down and away:</p>
<pre>  [player] .
            .
             .
              #

                \
                 v
</pre>
<p>This clearly requires updating the object's position, using a rotation
equation that keeps it at a constant distance.  We also need to update the
movement vector, because if we don't, the projectile will move away as if
it were fired from a position below the player, rather than being fired
by the player:</p>

<pre>  [player] .
            .
             .
              # --&gt;
</pre>

<p>The effects of player rotation on movement are absent or minimal for most
things, because the object is either motionless or moving relatively slowly.
The main exception is player projectiles, which disappear quickly enough
that small errors will go unnoticed.</p>

<p>To see this in the game, reduce the player projectile velocity, fire a
shot, then pitch the camera so the projectile is at the edge of the screen
and check the new vector.  In one test, the vector changed from
xyz=[$0000,0000,0090] to [$0000,0064,0072], which isn't perfect
(speed of 151 vs. 144) but is pretty close, and the projectile doesn't
appear to rise or fall as it recedes into the distance.</p>

<p>One potential area of difficulty is that the game is always dealing with
movement deltas.  When pitching upward in the earlier experiment, the game
updated the vector each frame based on the joystick offset in that frame.
This is different from a conventional world-space approach, in which the
rotations are based on absolute position and orientation.  The reason deltas
can be problematic is that, if the math is imprecise, small errors can
add up over time.</p>


<h4>Double-Plane Quirk</h4>

<p>The 100-point alien ship is defined as two planes, one behind
the other.  The rear plane is defined last, which means it's drawn
on top of the front plane, which causes some erasure artifacts.
But there's a far stranger quirk.</p>

<p>If you disable the ship's forward movement in its object definition
(<code>4aa2:00 00</code>), and apply the game tweaks mentioned on
the main page to create a region of space with one alien ship and
nothing else, you can fly right up to the ship and examine it.  As
you get close, the difference in Z-depth between the two planes
starts to expose the limitations of the coordinate accuracy.</p>

<p>Because shapes are defined without a common center point, the
planes will start to move independently.  If you get fairly close
and move the crosshairs around for a bit, you can see the pieces
start to separate:</p>

<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-before.gif"><img src="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-before.gif" alt="drift-before" width="140" height="96"></a>
<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-after.gif"><img src="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-after.gif" alt="drift-after" width="140" height="96"></a>

<p>If you get really close, the rear part (which you can identify by the
lack of a flashing dot in the middle) will actually start to wander off:</p>

<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-active.gif"><img src="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/images/drift-active.gif" alt="drift-active" width="140" height="96"></a>

<p>In other games that scale with distance, such as Elite or Stellar 7,
this doesn't happen because the position is determined by a point at the
center of the object.  Epoch applies position adjustment to the element
coordinates individually, which works fine so long as all points are at
the same Z depth.  In practice this effect isn't really noticeable when
playing the game because the enemy ship will fly past before it has time
for the two parts to drift noticeably.</p>

<h4>Movement Implementation</h4>

<p>There are two parts, object movement and element movement.</p>

<p>Epoch doesn't store a position for the object, so the object move
routine is only responsible for updating the object movement vectors.
For enemy ships this is done periodically, to give the ships a little
more life than a homing drone (which they mostly feel like anyway).
For everything else, this is only done when the joystick causes the
view angles to change.  This change must be applied to the object's
movement vector, for the reasons discussed earlier.</p>

<p>The element movement code updates each element's position (defined
as left/top and possibly right and/or bottom) with the object's
motion vector, adds the player's forward motion, and applies the
joystick angles to the positions.  The latter isn't quite right, for a
couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Changes to the joystick position don't change the Z coordinates.
    So rotating something from the center to the side makes it farther away.
    However, the projection scaling is based purely on Z distance, so
    things don't actually get smaller as they move away from the center
    of the screen.</li>
  <li>All elements remain parallel to the screen.  Elements should
    appear to rotate so they face toward the viewer as the viewer rotates,
    not slide sideways.  This doesn't feel off because it's just Epoch's
    visual style.  (FWIW, Doom did the same thing with equipment and
    corpses.)</li>
</ol>

<p><i>(Details TBD; math tables at $1000, $ac00, and $b500 require
further examination.  Tables in C++ form
<a href="https://6502disassembly.com/a2-epoch/extra/math_tab.cpp">here</a>.)</i></p>


<h2>Drawing and Erasing</h2>

<p>The basic redraw loop looks like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For each object:
    <ul>
      <li>For each element in the object:
        <ul>
          <li>Erase element from previous position</li>
          <li>Draw element in new position</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Pretty straightforward, notable only in that we erase and redraw each
element before moving on to the next, which means that we'll create some
visual artifacts when an object is in motion if the new position of an
element overlaps the old position of a later element.  Doing it this way
is important to reduce flicker when not using page-flipping.  Erasing the
entire object before redrawing it would increase the amount of time that the
pixels are black, making it more likely that the screen refresh would
show a blank space.</p>

<p>Every element can have one or two of the six hi-res colors assigned.
If two colors are assigned, the renderer will alternate between them at
a rate specified within the element.  As an optimization, black elements
are erased, but not explicitly drawn.  This can cause some interesting
effects when elements overlap.</p>

<h4>Unrolled Loops</h4>

<p>The fastest way to draw a rectangle on the hi-res screen is to draw it
in vertical stripes.  Part of this is because, with 7 pixels per byte
(more or less), the bit patterns for odd columns and even columns are
different.  By drawing columns, we reduce the number of times we have to
switch color patterns.</p>

<p>But the most important reason is that we can use something like this:</p>
<pre>    sta   $2000,y
    sta   $2400,y
    sta   $2800,y
    sta   $2c00,y
    sta   $3000,y
    sta   $3400,y
    sta   $3800,y
    sta   $3c00,y
    ...
</pre>

<p>This is faster than doing the same operation in a loop, because we
don't have to update the loop counter or execute a branch instruction.
Call this with the value to store in the A-reg and the column in the Y-reg,
and we can write bytes to the screen about as fast as can be done on a 6502
(5 cycles per byte).</p>

<p>If we want to blend with existing pixels rather than overwrite them,
we can do something like this:</p>
<pre>    txa
    ora   $2000,y
    sta   $2000,y
    txa
    ora   $2400,y
    sta   $2400,y
    txa
    ora   $2800,y
    sta   $2800,y
    ...
</pre>
<p>This time we pass the value to blend in the X-reg.  For this we have
to spend 11 cycles per byte.</p>

<p>This is a great …</p></div>

    <!--summary-->

<p>Today, we’ll cover a cool <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/">Terraspace</a> feature. It allows you to deploy all of your infrastructure in a single command.</p>



<p>Terraspace calculates the dependencies and deploys your code in the right order.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="terraform-recommendations">Terraform Recommendations</h2>

<p>First, let’s talk about some Terraform recommendations. They recommend separating your code on a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/guides/recommended-practices/part1.html#one-workspace-per-environment-per-terraform-configuration">per configuration and environment basis</a>. Here are examples straight from the docs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>billing-app-dev</li>
  <li>billing-app-prod</li>
  <li>networking-dev</li>
  <li>networking-prod</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a table to help explain these “scoped configurations” in different contexts:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Product</th>
      <th>Scope</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Terraform Cloud</td>
      <td>A workspace</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Terraform OSS</td>
      <td>A terraform module with a separate statefile</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Terraspace</td>
      <td>A stack</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Believe the reasons for the strategy are because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It avoids a monolithic structure and statefile that can take forever to run. See: <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18981">Terraform takes a very long time to run</a>. It’s not fun to wait 20+ minutes for your <code>terraform apply</code>.</li>
  <li>It’s safer to update. Since the changes are more limited in scope, the blast radius is reduced.</li>
  <li>It helps decouple the code to logically reusable units.</li>
</ol>

<p>You deploy these “scoped configurations” separately.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>One of the main issues with separating your code into separate stacks is that you have to deploy them independently. For example, you must manually deploy the VPC and then the instance afterward. You lose a significant advantage of what Terraform does: orchestration.</p>

<h2 id="enter-terraspace-all">Enter Terraspace All</h2>

<p>The <code>terraspace all</code> commands solves this problem by calculating the dependency graph and deploying the stacks in the correct order for you. Terraspace also parallelizes the batches. Here’s a dependency graph example.</p>

<p><img src="https://img.boltops.com/boltops/tools/terraspace/dependencies/deploy-all-a1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s deploy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ terraspace all up
Will run:
   terraspace up b2 # batch 1
   terraspace up c1 # batch 1
   terraspace up c3 # batch 1
   terraspace up d1 # batch 1
   terraspace up b1 # batch 2
   terraspace up c2 # batch 2
   terraspace up b3 # batch 3
   terraspace up a1 # batch 4
Are you sure? (y/N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you confirm, Terraspace deploys the batches in parallel. Essentially, Terraspace handles the orchestration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Are you sure? (y/N) y
Batch Run 1:
Running: terraspace up b2 Logs: log/up/b2.log
Running: terraspace up c1 Logs: log/up/c1.log
Running: terraspace up c3 Logs: log/up/c3.log
Running: terraspace up d1 Logs: log/up/d1.log
terraspace up b2:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up c1:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up c3:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up d1:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Batch Run 2:
Running: terraspace up b1 Logs: log/up/b1.log
Running: terraspace up c2 Logs: log/up/c2.log
terraspace up b1:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
terraspace up c2:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Batch Run 3:
Running: terraspace up b3 Logs: log/up/b3.log
terraspace up b3:  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Batch Run 4:
Running: terraspace up a1 Logs: log/up/a1.log
terraspace up a1:  Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Time took: 41s
$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Terraspace provides a reduced-noise summary of the runs. The full logs are also written for further inspection and debugging. The <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/reference/terraspace-log/">terraspace log</a> command is useful for viewing the logs.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-configure-dependencies">How to Configure Dependencies</h2>

<p>To configure dependencies, you merely wire stack outputs to inputs variables of another stack. Here is an example of an instance stack that depends on a vpc stack.</p>

<p>app/stacks/vpc/outputs.tf</p>

<div><div><pre><code>output "vpc_id" {
  description = "VPC ID"
  value       = aws_vpc.this.id
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>app/stacks/instance/variables.tf</p>

<div><div><pre><code>variable "vpc_id" {
  description = "VPC to launch instance in"
  type        = string
  default     = null
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Wire them together with the <code>terraform_output</code> helper in the instance tfvars file.</p>

<p>app/stacks/instance/tfvars/base.tfvars</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vpc_id = &lt;%= terraform_output('vpc.vpc_id') %&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Terraspace infers the dependency from this connection. It’s that simple.</p>

<p>Learn more: <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/docs/dependencies/deploy-multiple/">Deploy Multiple Stacks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="visualizing-with-graphs">Visualizing with Graphs</h2>

<p>You can create a visual dependency graph diagram with:</p>



<p>The earlier example dependency graph was generated with this command. Here’s the graph again:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.boltops.com/boltops/tools/terraspace/dependencies/deploy-all-a1.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="targeting-subgraphs-and-subtrees">Targeting Subgraphs and Subtrees</h2>

<p>You can also target subgraphs by specifying stack names. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>terraspace all graph b1 b3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Produces:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.boltops.com/boltops/tools/terraspace/dependencies/deploy-all-a1-sub-b1-b3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can filter for stacks with any of all commands. Here’s an example with up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ terraspace all up b1 b3
Will run:
   terraspace up c1 # batch 1
   terraspace up c3 # batch 1
   terraspace up d1 # batch 1
   terraspace up b1 # batch 2
   terraspace up c2 # batch 2
   terraspace up b3 # batch 3
Are you sure? (y/N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This targets the b1 and b3 stacks and their dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="tearing-it-all-down">Tearing it All Down</h2>

<p>Finally, to tear down all the infrastructure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ terraspace all down
Will run:
   terraspace down a1 # batch 1
   terraspace down b3 # batch 2
   terraspace down b1 # batch 3
   terraspace down c2 # batch 3
   terraspace down b2 # batch 4
   terraspace down c1 # batch 4
   terraspace down c3 # batch 4
   terraspace down d1 # batch 4
Are you sure? (y/N)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you’re ready, type <code>y</code> and enter.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Are you sure? (y/N) y
Batch Run 1:
Running: terraspace down a1 Logs: log/down/a1.log
terraspace down a1:  Changes to Outputs:
terraspace down a1:  Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
Batch Run 2:
Running: terraspace down b3 Logs: log/down/b3.log
terraspace down b3:  Changes to Outputs:
terraspace down b3:  Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
Batch Run 3:
Running: terraspace down b1 Logs: log/down/b1.log
Running: terraspace down c2 Logs: log/down/c2.log
terraspace down b1:  Changes to Outputs:
terraspace down b1:  Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
terraspace down c2:  Changes to Outputs:
terraspace down c2:  Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
Batch Run 4:
Running: terraspace down b2 Logs: log/down/b2.log
Running: terraspace down c3 Logs: log/down/c3.log
Running: terraspace down d1 Logs: log/down/d1.log
Running: terraspace down c1 Logs: log/down/c1.log
terraspace down b2:  Changes to Outputs:
terraspace down b2:  Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
terraspace down c1:  Changes to Outputs:
terraspace down c1:  Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
terraspace down c3:  Changes to Outputs:
terraspace down c3:  Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
terraspace down d1:  Changes to Outputs:
terraspace down d1:  Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
Time took: 48s

<p>The infrastructure is destroyed in reverse order.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-of-both-worlds">The Best of Both Worlds</h2>

<p>Terraspace helps you solve the issue of having to deploy individual stacks manually. Instead of having to run <code>terraspace up</code> individually, it allows you to deploy all stacks with a single command:</p>



<p>Additionally, you can target <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/docs/dependencies/subgraphs/">subgraphs</a> to deploy:</p>



<p>Lastly, you can always drop down and run the individual stack to debug. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>terraspace up c1
terraspace up b1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Terraspace gives you the best of both worlds. To learn more about Terraspace check out <a href="https://terraspace.cloud/">terraspace.cloud</a>.</p>

  <article id="bcRUCzpZk7CiGhPPwnJRU3">
	<time datetime="2020-08-16">August 16, 2020</time>
  
	<p>When I start at a new company, I always do a refresher on my key security.</p>

<p>One thing I always hate about SSH is that the encryption scheme is pretty basic actually, and once your ssh-agent is loaded- anything can just request a sign/authorize.</p>

<p>So, in tried and true “over engineering” fashion, I’ve taken to using my GPG key as my ssh key instead, and using gpg-agent instead of ssh-agent.</p>

<p>Another thing is to use elliptic curves instead of RSA, RSA is still secure, but ECC (ECDSA) is faster and theoretically more resistant, and everything from 2016 onwards supports it, so it’s fair to assume it is supported in my SSH programs of choice. :)</p>

<p>First, to create a ECDSA key we have to use expert mode with the <code>--full-gen-key</code>:</p>

<pre><code>jan.harasym@sm-mbp-jmh ~ % gpg2 --full-gen-key --expert
gpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.2.20; Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (7) DSA (set your own capabilities)
   (8) RSA (set your own capabilities)
   (9) ECC and ECC
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (11) ECC (set your own capabilities)
  (13) Existing key
  (14) Existing key from card
</code></pre>

<p>We want to use ECC and ECC here, or “ECC (set your own capabilities)” and skip to the <code>addkey</code> section.</p>

<pre><code>Your selection? 9
</code></pre>

<p>Next we choose our ciphers:</p>

<pre><code>Please select which elliptic curve you want:
   (1) Curve 25519
   (3) NIST P-256
   (4) NIST P-384
   (5) NIST P-521
   (6) Brainpool P-256
   (7) Brainpool P-384
   (8) Brainpool P-512
   (9) secp256k1
</code></pre>

<p>NIST P-521 is the strongest, but NIST P-256 will be more compatible.</p>

<pre><code>Your selection? 5
</code></pre>

<p>And finally expiry and user-info.</p>

<pre><code>Please specify how long the key should be valid.

<p>Now we need to add a key which can be used for authorization, for this we can create a subkey, remove the encryption capability and enable the authorization one.<br>
(Failing this, we can ask for setting our own capabilities during the initial key creation above)</p>

<p>Make sure it’s <code>ECC (set your own capabilities)</code> when selecting a key type.</p>

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

<p>And finally we need to tell the gpg-agent which key we want to load, however this is done by using the ‘keygrip’, not the ‘keyID’, you can get the keygrip with the following:</p>

<p>Look for the keygrip which is associated with the <code>[A]</code> capability in my case:</p>

<pre><code>ssb   nistp521 2020-08-16 [A]
      Keygrip = 1DB1E97B20FD54DF2BAB906EA64C30081DEA8C32
</code></pre>

<p>And enable the “A” key by adding it to the bottom of the sshcontrol file:</p>

<pre><code>echo '1DB1E97B20FD54DF2BAB906EA64C30081DEA8C32' &gt; ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>AWS does not like strong keys, so for AWS I did the same as above but when I added a key for authorization I chose RSA:4096 instead.</p>

<h2 id="background">background</h2>
<p>i bought a macbook pro (16", 2019) in May as my XPS died (motherboard fried maybe?). personally i dont like apple at all, but fuck it, i had never used a mac before, so why not? i really love to try new things</p>
<p>for my experience i am satisfied with my macbook, except for some stupid issues, one of which is what im going to dig into in this article</p>
<p><strong>shutdown/restart hang (caused by a kernel panic)</strong></p>
<p>i found many users have encounterd the (almost) same panic: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/constant-kernel-panics-userspace-watchdog-timeout-no-successful-checkins-from-com-apple-windowserver.2222878/">https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/constant-kernel-panics-userspace-watchdog-timeout-no-successful-checkins-from-com-apple-windowserver.2222878/</a></p>
<p>Also on reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/hwk0o5/how_to_stop_watchdog_timeout_kernel_panics/">it's the exactly same panic</a></p>
<p>if you look at the posts you will find they are actually having different problems except all the problems lead to (the same) watchdog timeout</p>
<p>my panic report looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff7f881a1aae): watchdog timeout: no checkins from watchdogd in 302 seconds (11 totalcheckins since monitoring last enabled), shutdown in progress

<p>everytime the hang happens, it eventually gives me a backtrace like this</p>
<p>i called customer service, the friendly tech support suggested that i should reinstall the system (if i cant figure out how to reproduce the panic),
so i erased the partition table and restarted from scratch, then the hang happened again after a few shutdowns</p>
<p>i was really upset, but as i cant reproduce the panic, i cant even ask apple to fix it</p>
<p>then i decided to look into the panic myself</p>
<h2 id="the-backtrace">the backtrace</h2>
<p>the first glance at panic report tells me it might be something wrong with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Controller">SMC</a>, i followed apple's guide to reset SMC, without luck</p>
<p>apple diagnostics reports no issue</p>
<p>so it must be in the kernel right?</p>
<p>lets start reading the backtrace</p>
<p>by reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">Call Stack</a> you will have a basic understanding of how kernel subroutines get executed</p>
<p>so how is it executed? just read from brace bottom to top</p>
<p>first thing first, the panic report only gives me related kernel extensions, to find out exactly what code is causing the panic, we have to get symbols from the kernel (extensions)</p>
<p>we dont need to download anything to debug such a problem, the kernel is installed on our machine, just copy it, along with all the related extensions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>/System/Library/Kernels/kernel <span># kernel</span>
/System/Library/Kernels/Extensions <span># extensions</span>
</pre></div>
<p>follow <a href="https://www.repleo.nl/wordpress/symbolicate-os-x-kernel-panics-using-lldb/">https://www.repleo.nl/wordpress/symbolicate-os-x-kernel-panics-using-lldb/</a> to locate symbols</p>
<p>the kernel slide bytes, and AppleSMC text base address can be found in the panic report, like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Kernel slide:     0x0000000007400000

com.apple.driver.AppleSMC(3.1.9)[4589419D-7CCC-39A9-9E2F-F73FE42DD902]@0xffffff7f881a9000-&gt;0xffffff7f881c7fff
</pre></div>
<p><img alt="lldb" src="https://jm33.me/img/mac_panic/lldb.webp"></p>
<p>from this screenshot we can see more clearly about what's going on, the backtrace tree is now symbolicated</p>
<h2 id="lets-reverse-some-code">lets reverse some code</h2>
<p>as far as i know AppleSMC kext is proprietary, the only way to know what it does is to reverse it</p>
<p>from lldb, we dont see anything worthy of reversing, its just a watchdog timeout call</p>
<p>anyways, AppleSMC module seems interesting, lets reverse it</p>
<p>after loading the AppleSMC binary, we have to rebase the binary so it matches the address at runtime: Edit, segment, rebase program</p>
<p>press G then paste the address <code>0xffffff7f881b6d9c</code>, we get:</p>

<p>I don't think the <code>while (1)</code> loop is ever going to end. When <code>thread_policy_set</code> fails, it enters the loop and never breaks out.</p>
<p><code>v13</code> represents 1 sec I think. Basically this loop puts a mutex io lock, then feeds watchdog (when the timer pointer plus 248 is null or whatever), finally it sleeps for 1 sec, repeats the loop.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>When it stops feeding the watchdog, watchdog timeouts after about 3 min, hence the panic.</p>
<h2 id="whats-watchdog">whats watchdog</h2>
<p>from <code>man watchdogd</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>watchdogd ensures that the system is healthy and able to make forward progress throughout the system lifecycle.
    If watchdogd or the Watchdog KEXT determine that the system is unhealthy they will attempt to take corrective action and ultimately may panic the system to get it back to a usable state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, in the case of the Linux operating system, a user-space watchdog daemon may simply kick the watchdog periodically without performing any tests. As long as the daemon runs normally, the system will be protected against serious system crashes such as a kernel panic. To detect less severe faults, the daemon[4] can be configured to perform tests that cover resource availability (e.g., sufficient memory and file handles, reasonable CPU time), evidence of expected process activity (e.g., system daemons running, specific files being present or updated), overheating, and network activity, and system-specific test scripts or programs may also be run.[5]</p>
<p>Upon discovery of a failed test, the Linux watchdog daemon may attempt to perform a software-initiated restart, which can be preferable to a hardware reset as the file systems will be safely unmounted and fault information will be logged. However it is essential to have the insurance of the hardware timer as a software restart can fail under a number of fault conditions. In effect, this is a dual-stage watchdog with the software restart comprising the first stage and the hardware reset the second stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from my understanding, <code>SMCWatchDogTimer</code> stopped kicking watchdog somehow (at <code>IOLockUnlock()</code>), then watchdog realizes <code>AppleSMC</code> might be dead, it initiates a panic, reboot and throw the panic report to user</p>

<p>Landfill is an interesting product. The price fluctuates far enough that it can fluctuate from positive to negative and back again. If someone is building a tunnel, you can probably get paid to <i>take</i> landfill. If someone is building an island, you can probably get paid for <i>supplying</i> landfill. There are projects that can only go ahead at certain times: the Hornsby quarry remediation project was only viable because the north connex was being built.</p><p>That's slightly obscure, and there's not much you can do with landfill other than, well, fill land. But we are about to hit a very unusual combination of circumstances which will create some head-scratching economics.</p><p>Solar panels are getting cheaper. The learning rate for solar energy is (probably) the steepest of any energy technology yet deployed. So we can be pretty much assured that within the next decade we'll have enough solar power to power anything we want (as long as it is day time). We'll overprovision our houses and factories (and offices if they still exist) with generation capacity so that in the morning or evening when the sun is hitting at an oblique angle, we still have enough for our needs.</p><p>That means that at peak times, we'll have <i>more</i> than enough solar energy. What do we do with that surplus energy?</p><p>Actually, it's slightly worse than that, because there are some (non-renewable) power plants that can't fully idle. A nuclear reactor can't fully turn off for a few minutes in the middle of the day. Neither can a coal power plant. So they will be running at a time when nobody has a need for power. That may be OK -- if you make a lot of money generating power overnight, you might be prepared to pay some small penalties during the day for overproduction if that's what it takes to keep the system running.</p><p>Which means that someone, somewhere is going to get paid to create a dummy electrical load. We've never (as far as I can tell) seen "grid stability" <i>payments</i> <i>for</i> <i>using</i>&nbsp;electricity before. But it's the inevitable conclusion of where we are the moment: discounted rates for consumers who can change their requirements to help with grid stability exist already; there's no reason that this wouldn't still be necessary when the price of electricity hits zero.</p><p>Therfore, there will be times of the day (in certain weather conditions) when some companies will get <i>paid</i> to use electricity.</p><p>The kinds of consumers that will get paid are likely to be doing something that is energy inefficient (obviously), and not particularly capital intensive (since their equipment will be idle a lot of the time), and making something that can be stored indefinitely (because you definitely can't do just-in-time manufacturing if you are waiting for times when the price for electricity goes negative). But quite a lot of products could be made to fit that.</p><p>A possible product that I think is likely to play out this way is water desalination. Desalinated water is very expensive because of the embedded energy cost: it's often described as "bottled electricity". Currently we tend to use reverse osmosis because it's more energy efficient; but if you don't have to worry about energy costs, you might choose instead to boil water and distil it: since the capital costs are cheaper.</p><p>Now things get even weirder. Let's say you are getting paid 0.5c per kWH (a not unreasonable price) that you use. You might find that you can sell the water for -0.01c per kL. Yes, you can make a profit: not just giving it away, but you could still be profitable while paying someone to consume it.</p><p>If this all plays out, we might have water and electricity (at times) having a negative price. These are common inputs to other processes, so it doesn't end there: there might be a business that requires water and electricity occasionally, but the input costs normally make the business unviable. They in turn might be able to make some money selling the end product at a negative price if their inputs have a negative price.</p><p>If this sounds all a bit unbelievable, remember that up until very recently, many economists thought that it was impossible to have negative interest rates... right up until the moment when they started happening. We already have examples of products that oscillate between positive and negative prices, it's just that they were never fundamental inputs to other processes. My prediction is that by 2030 we will have a small part of the economy ticking away profitably making negative price products.</p><p>(Post scriptum: now for the completely weird: how do negative price products interact with negative interest rates?)</p>

<p><b>Build your Apps in PicoLisp without an Android SDK</b></p><p>
PilBox ("PicoLisp Box") is a generic Android App which allows to write Apps in
pure PicoLisp, without touching Java, and without the need of an Android SDK.</p><p>
You do not need to root your device. And - if you prefer - you do not need a
separate development machine (PC or laptop): All can be done in a terminal on
the device, and even in a Lisp REPL while the App is running.</p><p>
Note: <b>PilBox needs Android &gt;= 5.0!</b></p><p>
It comes with PicoLisp binaries for Arm64 pre-installed. If your device has an
Arm32 CPU, you can - after installing the PilBox App but before starting it -
download and install the emulator version <a href="https://software-lab.de/arm32.zip">https://software-lab.de/arm32.zip</a>.
If this was done by mistake, you can revert to Arm64 binaries with
<a href="https://software-lab.de/arm64.zip">https://software-lab.de/arm64.zip</a>.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>
The PilBox App itself (called the "PilBox kernel") is written in Java, the
normal Android way. It displays a WebView GUI, and starts a PicoLisp <b>binary</b>
compiled for Arm64 CPUs. This binary may now run any PicoLisp program, by
setting up a local web server where the WebView component connects to, possibly
opening a database, and doing whatever is desired.</p><p>
The PilBox kernel provides an interface to the Android Java runtime environment.
To the PicoLisp code it looks like a remote database, where Java objects are
mapped to PicoLisp DB objects, and Java functions and methods are executed via
remote procedure calls.</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/457.d" alt="PilBox.png"></p><p>
If a ZIP file is passed to the PilBox kernel upon start-up, it is unpacked, and
may override or extend whatever is installed already. This is done typically by
clicking on a downloaded ZIP, or by "sharing" it from some other App.</p><p>
Then it looks for a file "App.l" in the App's working directory, <span>load</span>s it,
and listens at the port number found in a file "Port". Out of the box, "Port" is
8081, and "App.l" is a meta-App which provides a convenient runtime environment
for managing Apps installed via the ZIP mechanism.</p><h3>Getting started</h3><p>
You can download the PilBox App from Google Play store, or get it directly from
<a href="https://software-lab.de/pilBox.apk">https://software-lab.de/pilBox.apk</a>. In the latter case, you may need to
enable "Unknown Sources" in your settings.</p><p>
To try the examples in this article, download these files:
</p><ul>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/hello.zip">https://software-lab.de/hello.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/calc.zip">https://software-lab.de/calc.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/demo.zip">https://software-lab.de/demo.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/crash.zip">https://software-lab.de/crash.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/radio.zip">https://software-lab.de/radio.zip</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://software-lab.de/browser.zip">https://software-lab.de/browser.zip</a></li>
</ul><p>
<span>pilBox.apk</span> contains the PilBox kernel App as an APK ("Android Package"), and
the ZIP files are small demo applications.</p><p>
Then go to Apps -&gt; PilBox -&gt; Permissions and enable "Location" and "Storage".</p><h3>The pre-installed generic App</h3><p>
Initially, when started without any ZIP file, the PilBox kernel shows an empty
white screen with a PicoLisp logo on the top-left and a settings icon on the
top-right (the screenshots were taken on a tablet, so on a phone the proportions
may differ):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/426.d" alt="emptyPilBox.png"></p><h4>The REPL</h4><p>
If you tap on the PicoLisp logo on the left, it opens a REPL (Read-Eval-Print
Loop) - a kind of terminal window into the App:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/430.d" alt="repl1.png"></p><p>
The REPL gives you control over many aspects of the App. It has a large text
field for displaying results and editing text, a single-line text field at the
bottom for command input, and the three buttons "Eval", "Edit" and "Clear
Cache".</p><p>
The main purpose is to enter commands, and look at their results in the text
area. As the "Eval" button is the first on the page, it is implicitly activated
if you hit <span>Enter</span> when typing a command.</p><p>
As a special case, if a command starts with a dollar-sign:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/431.d" alt="repl2.png"></p><p>
it is taken as a Shell command, here <span>ls -l</span>, and shows the listing in the text
area:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/432.d" alt="repl3.png"></p><p>
Otherwise (not starting with a dollar-sign), the command line is evaluated as a
Lisp expression. For example, after typing <span>(pp 'gps)</span>, we get:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/433.d" alt="repl4.png"></p><p>
If you type a file or path name like <span>App.l</span> in the command line,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/434.d" alt="repl5.png"></p><p>
and press the "Edit" button, the file is opened in the text area and may be
edited:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/435.d" alt="repl6.png"></p><p>
Press the "Done" button to close the file again.</p><p>
The "Clear Cache" button invalidates the <span>WebView</span> cache, and is useful after
changing an App's CSS file.</p><p>
Tapping on the PicoLisp logo takes you back to the start screen.</p><p>
Normally, you won't edit your App's sources in the REPL, but instead edit them
in a terminal program like <span>Termux</span> with <span>vim</span> or <span>emacs</span>, and pass them as a
ZIP file to PilBox as described below.</p><h4>Settings</h4><p>
If you tap on the settings icon on the right of the start screen, it opens a
default settings page. Initially it shows two tabs, one with all standard
PicoLisp localizations</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/436.d" alt="settings1.png"></p><p>
and one listing the installed PILs (PicoLisp Apps):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/437.d" alt="settings2.png"></p><p>
Initially the list is empty.</p><p>
The REPL behavior and the default settings page are normally overridden by
installed Apps, and are available only on the start screen.</p><h3>Installing your own App(s)</h3><p>
The empty PilBox kernel is not very useful, except for perhaps exploring the App
environment in the REPL.</p><p>
To install your own App, prepare a ZIP file with a directory containing
</p><ul>
   <li>One or more <span>*.l</span> Lisp files, where one of them must be named <span>App.l</span></li>
   <li>Optionally a CSS file named <span>lib.css</span></li>
   <li>Optionally an icon in a file named <span>logo.png</span></li>
   <li>Optionally a directory called <span>loc/</span> with localizations</li>
</ul><p>
The file <span>App.l</span> is mandatory, and is <span>load</span>ed to start the App. If one of the
<span>*.l</span> files is named <span>settings.l</span>, then it overrides the behavior of the
settings icon while this App is active.</p><p>
The first Lisp expression in <span>App.l</span> is <span>read</span> in, and should be a string
giving the App's name.</p><p>
You pass your ZIP file to the PilBox kernel by "sharing" it from another App
(e.g. the "Downloads" App). As I use the <span>Termux</span> App for local development, I
usually generate the ZIP file directly on the device, pass it to the
<span>termux-share</span> utility, using the world-readable <span>storage</span> area:
</p><pre>   $ zip -rFS ~/storage/downloads/myApp.zip myApp/
   $ termux-share ~/storage/downloads/myApp.zip
</pre><p>

When the PilBox kernel starts, it scans all top-level directories for other
files named "App.l". Each of those directories is taken as a PIL App. If only a
single one is found, it is started immediately, otherwise a list of buttons with
the App names is displayed.</p><h3>Hello World</h3><p>
For a minimal example for a PIL App, look at
<a href="https://software-lab.de/hello.zip">https://software-lab.de/hello.zip</a>. It consists of a directory <span>hello/</span> with
a single file <span>App.l</span>. This file contains:
</p><pre>   "Hello World"

   (menu "Hello World!"
      (&lt;h1&gt; "center blue" "Hello World!") )
</pre><p>

The first line gives the App's name, and the <span>menu</span> expression displays a
header line in blue with "Hello World!".</p><p>
If you pass this ZIP to the PilBox kernel, it immediately shows this screen
(because it is the first and only App installed so far):</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/440.d" alt="helloApp.png"></p><p>
A tap on the PicoLisp icon has no effect now (we are no longer on the PilBox
kernel start screen), but the settings page is still the default one. If we open
the "PILs" tab, we see that there is a single package "PIL-hello" installed:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/441.d" alt="helloSettings.png"></p><h3>Calculator</h3><p>
Let's move on to something more interesting than the obligatory "Hello World".
The package </p><li><a href="https://software-lab.de/calc.zip">https://software-lab.de/calc.zip</a></li><p> contains a calculator App.</p><p>
After we pass it to the PilBox, the start screen now shows <i>two</i> Apps:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/443.d" alt="calcPilBox.png"></p><p>
The calculator can be started by hitting the topmost button:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/445.d" alt="calculator.png"></p><p>
Play with it around a little. It employs PicoLisp's big numbers, so it can only
handle integers (of unlimited size though).</p><p>
If we go to the "PILs" tab in the settings, we see that now there are two
packages,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/447.d" alt="settings3.png"></p><p>
and clicking on the "PIL-calc" link lists the package's contents:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/450.d" alt="pil-calc.png"></p><p>
The back-arrow brings you back to the "PILs" tab.</p><p>
Enabling the checkboxes in the "PILs" tab allows for the removal of the selected
packages. It removes <i>all</i> files in the package, so it must be handled with
care!</p><p>
The PilBox kernel start screen can be reached by clicking on the PicoLisp icon.
There we can also get to the REPL again.</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/451.d" alt="repl7.png"></p><h3>The Demo App</h3><p>
Finally, there is <a href="https://software-lab.de/demo.zip">https://software-lab.de/demo.zip</a>, an extensive but rather
silly Demo App. It contains examples for conventional GUI components, as they
are needed in database applications,</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/452.d" alt="demoFields.png"></p><p>
but also or accessing the Android toolbox, like taking pictures or scanning
QR-Codes, reading GPS coordinates, and posting notifications:</p><p>
<img src="https://picolisp.com/wiki/db/wiki/blob/A/454.d" alt="demoNotify.png"></p><p>
Feel free to install it, play around, and study the code.</p><h3>Using the Android API</h3><p>
PilBox is only useful if it can communicate with the Android API on the device.
Therefore, it loads the Android library "lib/android.l" in the PicoLisp
distribution (which in turn is built upon the Java reflection API).</p><p>
The central function in "lib/android.l" is <span>java</span>. It maps Lisp function calls
to the Java virtual machine, supporting eight types of calls:
</p><pre>   (java "cls" 'T ['any ..]) -&gt; obj       New object
   (java 'obj 'msg ['any ..]) -&gt; any      Send message to object
   (java 'obj "fld" ["fld" ..]) -&gt; any    Value of object field
   (java "cls" 'msg ['any ..]) -&gt; any     Call method in class
   (java "cls" "fld" ["fld" ..]) -&gt; any   Value of class field
   (java T "cls" ["cls" ..]) -&gt; obj       Define interface
   (java 'obj) -&gt; [lst ..]                Reflect object
   (java "cls") -&gt; cls                    Get class
</pre><p>

Depending on the type of the first one or two arguments (transient symbol,
internal symbol, or <span>T</span>) it behaves differently.</p><p>
This is not trivial, and requires some understanding of the Java side. For
example, to aquire a <span>WakeLock</span>, Java code samples do
</p><pre>   PowerManager powerManager = (PowerManager)getSystemService(POWER_SERVICE);
   WakeLock wakeLock = powerManager.newWakeLock(PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK, "MyWakelockTag");
   wakeLock.acquire();
</pre><p>

To implement the same in PicoLisp, we must first look up the constant values
<span>POWER_SERVICE</span> and <span>PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</span>. They are found in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#POWER_SERVICE">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#POWER_SERVICE</a>
as "power" and in
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</a>
as 1. With that, the corresponding Lisp code is:
</p><pre>   (java
      (java (java CONTEXT 'getSystemService "power") 'newWakeLock 1 "MyWakelockTag")
      'acquire )
</pre><p>

The gobal constant <span>CONTEXT</span> is defined in …</p></div></div>

      <p>If you like circles, spheres and shapes that fit nicely together, you’ll probably like spherical circle packings. In this post, I’ll describe how I turned one into a lamp.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A circle packing is an arrangement of circles that fit tightly together, so that no circle can be enlarged without causing overlaps. Circle packing is a nice mathematical rabbit hole<sup id="fnref:circle_packing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:circle_packing">1</a></sup>, but this post focuses on Steiner chains, which is the type of packing I used for building the lamp (more pictures of which can be found <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/circle-lamp">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="steiner-chains">Steiner chains</h2>

<p>A Steiner chain<sup id="fnref:steiner_chain" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:steiner_chain">2</a></sup> is constructed by surrounding a circle with a ring of additional circles that are all also tangent to a larger circle. In other words, a Steiner chain consists of circles packed in a circle (a concept I’ve previously explored in <a href="https://stuffmatic.com/projects/copper-circles">this project</a>).</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/steiner.png" alt="A simple Steiner chain.">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>A simple Steiner chain with a center circle surrounded by a ring of 9 smaller circles, all tangent to the bounding circle (dashed).</p>
  
</div>

<p>The fact that a Steiner chain fits tightly in a circle can be used to construct nested packings by repeatedly replacing the center circle with a smaller Steiner chain. Here’s an animation illustrating the idea.</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/steiner.gif" alt="Nesting Steiner chains">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>Nesting Steiner chains.</p>
  
</div>

<p>The lamp is built from a total of 13 circles, forming a nested Steiner chain with two rings, each containing 6 circles.</p>

<h2 id="deforming-a-circle-packing">Deforming a circle packing</h2>

<p>It’s intuitively clear that a circle packing can’t be arbitrarily deformed without “ruining” it. For example, stretching a packing in one direction turns the circles into ellipses. Luckily, there is a class of circle preserving planar deformations, so called Möbius transformations<sup id="fnref:mobius_transformation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mobius_transformation">3</a></sup>, that can be used to parametrically control the shape of a circle packing. This is really useful for parametric design purposes.</p>

<div>
  
    <p><img src="https://stuffmatic.com/assets/posts/circle_packing_lamp/mobius.gif" alt="Möbius transformations applied to a circle packing.">
    </p>
    
  
  <p>Möbius transformations applied to a circle packing.</p>
  
</div>

<h2 id="going-spherical">Going spherical</h2>

<p>The Möbius transformations described in the previous section turn out to be the only options for transforming a circle packing in the plane. However, if we venture into three dimensional space, there is another option: <em>inverse stereographic projection</em><sup id="fnref:stereographic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stereographic">4</a></sup>. Loosely speaking, this transformation can be used to wrap a circle packing around a sphere.</p>

<p>For this project, I put together a parametric design tool to explore interesting spherical circle packings. This tool generates packings in three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a nested Steiner chain</li>
  <li>Apply a Möbius transformation</li>
  <li>Wrap the packing around a sphere using inverse stereographic projection</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s an animation showing the tool in action.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="generating-the-blueprint">Generating the blueprint</h2>

<p>The previous sections outline a method for creating nice spherical circle packings. In order to create physical objects from these packings, I wrote some code for procedural generation of laser cutter blueprints. One cruical thing to keep in mind when making a pendant lamp is the center of mass. To ensure the lamp is hanging properly, the center of mass and the wire hole need to lie on the same vertical line. The center of mass calculation is simplified by the fact that it only has to deal with circles (the contribution from the joints is negligible).</p>

<p>Once I had generated a blueprint and manufactured the parts, assembling the lamp went pretty smoothly. All circles, joints and joint holes were numbered so I would not have to think too much during assembly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Google is the biggest internet company in the world today.&nbsp; And it seems that this giant, successful company is going to have a birthday. As a present, we came up with a few interesting facts in honor of the birthday <b>big boy</b> company.</p>
<h2>1. People do not seem to know Google’s exact birth date.</h2>
<p>Yes, it is true. People do not know the exact date of Google’s birthday. It has been reported that Google has been given six different dates for their official birthday. Eventually they decided they need a fixed date, so that people know when to celebrate. Google later determined that <b>September 27th</b> will be the day.</p>
<h2>2. Google may even happen to be 25 years old.</h2>
<p>There are some indications that the real birth date might come even earlier than ’98. Google could be in fact, over the age needed to purchase alcohol in the US, legally. Although Google already has encoded their official starting date with the cryptic “98 9 27” doodle, it all must have started even earlier. In 1995, in the dormitory of Standford, the two main Google guys initiated the miracle power behind the most popular search engine in the world. Some say that during the infant years of Google development, the two founding men were frequently in disagreement with each other. However, we have the search engine today as proof they eventually shook hands and decided to put aside their differences and get to work.</p>
<h2>3. Google has a T-rex dinosaur on-site as a special reminder.</h2>
<div><p>Indeed, there is a T-rex on-site at Google’s headquarters. The dyno structure features a bone from a real Tyrannosaurus. When an amateur paleontologist initially discovered the bone by accident, they thought it comes from a different type of dinosaur. Stan, the name of the bone construction, is a vivid reminder that adaptation is key to survival.</p><p>Apart from being a preferred gathering <a href="https://www.demilked.com/google-campus-dinosaur-stan-flamingos/" target="_blank">spot for flamingos meeting</a>, Stan is there to remind Google employees they need to give their best all the time. Or risk having their company become extinct, just like a dinosaur.</p></div>
<h2>4. A T-rex game likes to hide in Google Chrome.</h2>
<div><p>Google is fond of dinosaurs, we noticed. Apart from the giant structure at their HQ, they also made a digital dyno version. When you browse the net on Google Chrome, a warning will appear about Google not being able to connect.</p><p>When the dinosaur is visible, if you push the space bar on your keyboard, a game will begin where you are a running dinosaur jumping over obstacles. The game length is theoretically infinite and has been an arena for peculiar competition for the highest score.</p></div>
<h2>5. Many things are hiding in Google’s products.</h2>
<p>You can find many Google easter eggs by doing a simple search. These hidden gems become quite apparent once you begin to understand what they are.&nbsp; For example, searching with the word “askew” will return search results in a tilted view. You can also try “zerg rush,” “blink HTML” or the classic “Google in the 1998”.</p>
<h2>6. Google was not at all pleased that the name of the company became a generic search term.</h2>
<p>“Google” and “just Google it” are common words, but the company thought that could undermine all their efforts. There is, however, no way to stop such a trend. We have little control over how language use evolves. Marketing departments would say they want the brand name should circulate as much as possible. Still, Google has reached a level where the term becomes forever embedded in our culture. At this point, the process of “genericization” becomes unstoppable and out of control, even Google’s.</p>
<h2>7. Google devours more businesses than people genuinely think.</h2>
<p>Some estimate that Google purchases more than one company per week. Most of the companies tend to be small, but some can be rather large. Most of the acquired products get blended in with others that are already part of an applied marketing strategy.&nbsp; However, Android resides firmly within Google’s realm on its own accord and is very well known.<br>Google does not usually sell the companies that it buys. </p>
<h2>8. The “I’m Feeling Lucky” Google button cost more than tens of millions of dollars per year.</h2>
<p>This button is really fun. But for Google, it is an expensive add-on. The simple task of taking a person directly to the top result page without the advertising makes Google miss a lot of potential revenue. That lost income estimates put it at around $110 million. When addressed directly, Google officials responded that without the feeling lucky button Google will look like a corporate beast with an exclusive focus on money. The fact that the button remains on the main google page is a true testament that Google understands the search engine is for the real people out there.</p>
<h2>9. The first Google storage building blocks come from Lego.</h2>
<p>Google, one of the largest companies in the world today, has many demands, most of them understandably also pretty big. For example, all the countless public photos, videos and emails needs a place to stay, and there are building-size structures that come to the rescue. But back in 1996, things were different for the Google founders, when they had to find a solution for their first storage device need. The hard drives they found were too bulky, so they produced unique server boxes made out of Lego parts.</p>
<h2>10. Google proves to be very generous to the spouses of employees who die while working for the company.</h2>
<p>Losing a loved one on the job is always tough. Dying while working in a comfortable, air-conditioned office is not the same as, say, a coal mine accident. However, one thing is sure: death comes unexpectedly, and it is a hard stone to all sides involved. Google understands that and pays the husband or wife of the decreased fifty percent of their salary for the next ten years! Even the children of those unfortunate enough to perish on the job have benefits too – they are set with compensatory payments till they reach adulthood.</p>
<h2>11. One search on Google requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts of Apollo 11 to the moon. </h2>
<div><p>Isn’t that a funny statistic? Searching with Google is made so simple now. Most people don’t believe when they hear the actual computing and networking power behind every simple search querry.</p><p>Searching the internet today takes more resources than were necessary to put people on the moon. Even your smartphone has better capabilities than the equipment NASA had when they attempted the first moonwalk. </p></div>
<h2>12. One time Google experienced a crash for five minutes, and almost half of the whole internet went down too.</h2>
<div><p>What if you can’t use your computer for five minutes? No bid deal, right? You can take a walk and come back again. Five minutes for Google is too much.</p><p>It was on August 19, 2013, when the famed Google stopped operating for a total of five minutes. This short interruption sufficed for Google to take down around 40% of all internet traffic.</p><p>While it is true that many companies have risen to the occasion and provide search opportunities for people, Google still dominates the more substantial part of the internet. Google has grown to the point where it almost became a synonym for the internet itself. When Google has a problem, the chances are that so does most of the world wide web.</p></div>
<h2>13. Google employs goats.</h2>
<div><p>There is a lot of beautiful green space around Google offices. And that could require a lot of mowing for sure. So they come up with the ingenious idea to have some goats to take care of the grass for them.</p><p>According to Google employees, they love goats because for a score of reasons. Goats are not as noisy, don’t cause any pollution, and, most of all, are more cure and cuddly than lawnmowers.</p></div>
<h2>14. Google has lots of dogs on site.</h2>
<div><p>Speaking of goats, Google also loves all kinds of animals and lets people bring their pets to work. Having your best friend around you is a huge booster for morale and productivity.</p><p>Note that cats are not banned from Google. It’s just that cats don’t usually get along with dogs, so there are fewer of them on-site. But there are still quite a few.</p></div>
<h2>15. Google has given a dog the title of Top Dog.</h2>
<p>According to Google’s official history, the dog of the owner of Google, whose name is Yoshka, is the first and only dog to be given the name Top Dog back in 1999. A post appeared on Google by Yoshka, stating that all dogs are welcome to come to Google. Yoshka is not the only dog in the company, but it was the first. The dog owner was non-other than Urs Hölzle. He was the person responsible for reducing the power needed for Google data centers by half!</p>
<h2>16. Google centered their logo on the main search page in 2001.</h2>
<div><p>Google’s homepage is simple, a much-needed requirement when millions around the world visit it on a daily. Any changes to that page, even the tiniest ones, will be indeed significantly noticed.</p><p>In the early days of the search engine, the Google logo resided to the left side of the page. But in 2001, they moved it to the center and has been there ever since. This seemingly slight change is pretty significant. It changed how the main page is perceived forever.</p></div>
<h2>17. Google continues to make small changes.</h2>
<div><p>There have been some rather small adjustments to the Google logo, in time. Those changes include the layout of the letters of the word “Google.”</p><p>Small changes are the general approach, but Google also goes big. They came up with different ways to arrange the words, which included a new font too.</p></div>
<h2>18. Changes include the name.</h2>
<p>In recent years, the most significant and notable change occurred when the company changed its name from Google to Alphabet. That change was prompted by the fact the company was dominating most of the search, information, internet and other aspects of the business.</p>
<h2>19. Google Instant.</h2>
<p>Google Instant means that you will see results immediately as soon as you start typing if your connection allows it.&nbsp; Google can then collect ample information on you about your browsing patterns to get you where you want to go even faster. Google Instant changes the autocomplete options, and the suggested search results in an …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Using SPF on HELO/EHLO hostnames is repurposing SPF to validate a different thing</h2>

	<p><small>September 26, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Back in June I discovered that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SPFForHELOs">in theory we should have SPF records
for EHLO hostnames too</a>. The conventional explanation
for this (apart from 'big email providers say so', the usual reason
to do anything in modern SMTP) comes from, for example, <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2020/07/small-mailserver-bcp/">this
writeup of small mailserver best current practices</a>,
and goes like this (I'm paraphrasing):</p>

<p>People use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">SPF</a>
to validate the envelope sender domain (the SMTP MAIL FROM). However,
when you send a bounce, it has a null sender and thus no sender
domain to use for SPF checks. So the sender domain is taken from
the EHLO hostname, for lack of a better place to get it from (since
there is no SMTP level 'the bounce claims to have been sent by X
domain' information to be had, although this is commonly in the
message headers).</p>

<p>This is of course kind of bogus. What is really happening here is that
receiving mail servers are attempting to validate that the EHLO/HELO
hostname itself is not forged and are using SPF for this purpose. This
is a complete repurposing of SPF, which we can see since 'Sender' is
right in the name 'Sender Policy Framework' and there's no 'sender' of
the bounce that is visible at the SMTP level (and no entirely standard
way that it's visible in the mail headers, either).</p>

<p>There are some lessons here for email related 'standards' and in general
any Internet standards, which I can summarize this way: if there's a
hole that people think needs filling, any nearby peg will get hammered
into it regardless of what the peg was originally designed for.</p>

<p>PS: This elaborates on <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1307064512302940161">a recent tweet of mine</a> that was
sparked by adding SPF DNS records for our EHLO hostnames (and writing
the official explanation of the change for our records).</p>

<h3>Sidebar: This explanation and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208">RFC 7208</a></h3>

<p>RFC 7208 says two things in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-2.3">section 2.3, <em>The "HELO" Identity</em></a>:</p>

<ul><li>it's RECOMMENDED that you check the HELO identity (but carefully)
all the time, and do so before checking MAIL FROM.</li>
<li>if the envelope sender is the null sender, the message is presumed
to come from 'postmaster@&lt;HELO name&gt;' and this is used as the
MAIL FROM to check (even if you already checked the HELO identity).</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't gone through RFC 7208's section on doing SPF checks to see
if it treats HELO and MAIL FROM checks somewhat differently in its
algorithm, because frankly I'm not interested enough.</p>

<p>This means that RFC 7208 itself is a superset of the conventional
explanation I summarized above. In RFC 7208, you have SPF records
for your EHLO hostnames both because of bounces and because receivers
are recommended to check them all the time. This implies that all
of your mail sending machines should have SPF records, not just the
ones that can send bounces.</p>

<p>(Now that I've looked that up, I may need to update some of our
DNS records. Again.)</p>

<p>I use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a> module to read and write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.
The method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer.sniff">csv.Sniffer.sniff</a> analyzes a sample of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a> and guesses the "dialect" (delimiter, quoting, etc.).
I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader">csv.DictReader</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter">csv.DictWriter</a> instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader">csv.reader</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer">csv.writer</a> because I want to expose the rows as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">dictionaries</a> instead</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile">compile</a> to prepare text to be executed as code by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec</a>.
To determine the new columns to add to the output, I examine how
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict">collections.OrderedDict</a> <code>env_local</code> changes after processing a row.
I ignore local variables that start with <code>_</code> because I wanted an easy way to
create "temporary variables" that won't show up in the output.</p>
<p>When I process each row of the input <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a>, I create a <code>RowProxy</code> object
that allows accessing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict">dictionary</a> entries as attributes. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rp = RowProxy({"cat": 3})
rp["cat"]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>rp.cat
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>

<p>In this week's post you learned how to a command line tool that manipulates
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>.
You learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a> module to read and write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>, as well as how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer">csv.Sniffer</a> to automatically deduce the
"dialect" of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a>.
You also learned how to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile">compile</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec">exec</a> to run text as Python code.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a tool like <code>csv-proc</code> that allows you to filter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a>
based on some criteria.
For example, if you only want to view prediabetic patients from <strong>data.csv</strong>,
you could call your program like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ csv-filter data.csv '100 &lt;= float(row.glucose_mgdL) &lt; 126'
</code></pre>

<h2><span>Work in Progress</span></h2>
<p>
<i>
Generating random Pac-Man mazes is a deceptively difficult problem that I spent some months working on.  It is not easy to describe clearly.  I hope you are patient.  This page is an effort to begin communicating how the algorithm works.  It will slowly be refined (your feedback appreciated) until it is all stated as clearly as possible.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Contraints</h2>
<p>
The mazes are built carefully to closely match design patterns deduced from the original maps found in Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Map is 28x31 tiles.</li>
<li>Paths are only 1 tile thick</li>
<li>No sharp turns (i.e. intersections are separated by atleast 2 tiles).</li>
<li>There are 1 or 2 tunnels</li>
<li>No dead-ends.</li>
<li>Only I, L, T, or + wall shapes are allowed, including the occasional rectangular wall.</li>
<li>Any non-rectangular wall pieces must only be 2 tiles thick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>It's like Tetris</h2>

<p>
We start by stacking tetris pieces on a 5x9 grid. Gravity pulls the pieces in the left direction rather than down.  The edges of the resulting tetris pieces correspond to walkable paths in the maze.  This grid is then mirrored across the left vertical axis to create a symmetric map, then scaled by 3 to form an original-size 28x31 map.
</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>
For clarity, I call the squares in the initial 5x9 grid, <b>cells</b>, and the squares in the final 28x31 grid, <b>tiles</b>.  So, this algorithm first creates the <b>cells</b> and transforms them into <b>tiles</b>
</p>

<h2>Simple Model</h2>

<p>
Shown in the above diagram titled "Simple Model" is the 5x9 grid of tetris pieces.  The pieces are created one cell at a time using some algorithm to limit the type of pieces at certain locations (they are numbered to show the order of creation).
</p>

<p>
The ghost pen and the edge between rows 7 and 8 at column 1 are present in every map, since the starting location of Pac-Man and the ghost pen location are constant.
</p>

<h2>Height and Width Adjustments</h2>

<p>
Cells are directly transformed into a 3x3 group of tiles. Unfortunately, this creates a resulting map that is too short by 1 tile and too wide by 1 tile.  So, we increase the height of one cell for every column, and decrease the width of one cell for every row, allowing the generated map to fit in the exact dimensions of the original game.
</p>

<p>
Shown in the above diagrams titled "Height Adjustments" and "Width Adjustments", the highlighted cells are the candidate cells whose size can be changed without creating ugly walls (i.e. walls that have non-uniform thickness).
</p>

<p>
Arrows occupy cells which have been chosen for size adjustment.  Care is taken to prevent discontinuities in the edges as a result of the shifting of cells from the size change.
</p>

<h2>Border Cells and Tunnels</h2>

<p>
I won't explain too much about this right now.  But the above diagram titled "Border Cells and Tunnels" has arrows to indicate the tunnel candidates.  The highlighted cells show the type of tunnel candidates by color.  Some cell edges are erased to create some variation in how walls connect with the boundary of the map (shown in green).  The tunnel creation algorithm is sophisticated in how it chooses different types of tunnels.
</p>

<h2>Final Paths</h2>

<p>
When the cells are finally transformed into tiles, what you are left with is shown in the diagram above titled "Final Paths".  Here you can directly map a cell to a 3x3 group of tiles.  You can even pick out the cells whose height are width have been adjusted by 1 tile in this map.
</p>

<h2>Final Tiles</h2>

<p>
See how the above diagram titled "Final Tiles" differs from "Final Paths".  The paths are shifted from the tile <em>edges</em> toward the tile <em>centers</em>.  Each tile with a path going through its center is turned into a path tile.  Finally, any tile that touches a path tile becomes a wall tile.  The map structure is now complete.
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I admit it: I haven’t taken notes in a while. Back in university I was generally using OneNote and drawing quick illustrations on the touch screen of my Lenovo. But that was a while ago, and I just recently found a reason to take notes again.</p>
<p>I began the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coursera machine learning</a> course and ended up looking into note-taking solutions, trying to figure out which would suit my style and the content of the course best. After bouncing between a few different tools, my final “stack” is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Notion</a> for taking notes (you can see the notes <a href="https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-Notes-fe3bb4e0fab84020a151739f6033e785" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://excalidraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Excalidraw</a> for illustrations (I won’t discuss this further, but it is a great way to generate quick and easy graphics for notes without getting caught up on perfectionism — for an example see the graphics on <a href="https://www.notion.so/Linear-Regression-with-One-Variable-c6742a27450f41118b8eb953c99275cf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this page</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a> for running Python code (not actually required for the course, but I do it anyways so I can learn Python as I work through the course — you can view the notebooks <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/liamross/machine-learning-notes/tree/master/notes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose these because they ended up working best for me personally, but they may not be the best fit for everyone. However, I’ll discuss more why I made the choices I did, and you can decide for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>First, some requirements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The tool should allow me to take notes easily and quickly</li>
<li>It should have good support for code snippets and math</li>
<li>Notes should look good with minimal intervention</li>
</ol>
<p>There have been an abundance of note-taking apps released recently (or not so recently), and many of them overlap in terms of functionality. I’m going to go through the ones I considered and explain why I ended up choosing Notion.</p>

<p>Now for the options that I immediately ruled out:</p>
<h3 id="onenote"><a href="#onenote" aria-label="onenote permalink"></a><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/onenote/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OneNote</a></h3>
<p>Even though it served me well in university, I decided not to use OneNote for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>No native code snippet support (although it can be added with a plugin)</li>
<li>I wasn’t really a fan of the infinite canvas approach, I like some more structure</li>
<li>It feels pretty geared towards touch screens, and I’m not drawing my illustrations any more</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="evernote"><a href="#evernote" aria-label="evernote permalink"></a><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a></h3>
<p>The old reliable option. Definitely the most well-known out of all the options. Also probably the worst. I almost immediately ruled it out because:</p>
<ol>
<li>No syntax highlighting</li>
<li>No latex support (necessary for a course like machine learning with lots of math)</li>
<li>Limited formatting options (or at least obvious easy-to-use ones from my quick check)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="roam"><a href="#roam" aria-label="roam permalink"></a><a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Roam</a></h3>
<p>The hyped new note-taking tool / early cult formation. People have been going wild for it on twitter, so I figured I’d look into it. At the end of the day I ruled it out for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It costs money ($165 USD a year for “Professional”, or $500 USD for 5 years if you choose the “Believer” package… Hmmm)</li>
<li>Notes taken with it don’t actually look that good (but that’s just personal preference, they don’t look terrible)</li>
<li>It doesn’t offer me anything that other free options don’t have (or at least anything that I’d find useful for the kind of notes I’m taking)</li>
</ol>

<p>And now the options that actually worked. One common pro for all of these options is they are free, or at least offer a free tier which I fall under.</p>
<h3 id="obsidian"><a href="#obsidian" aria-label="obsidian permalink"></a><a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a></h3>
<p>I actually started taking notes with Obsidian, since it had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">backlinks</a> which I thought would be useful, especially if I wanted to organize my notes by topic rather than by lecture. However, I ended up switching to <a href="#Jupyter">Jupyter</a> in order to be able to have the notes be public, and in order to run Python code.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-obsidian"><a href="#pros-of-obsidian" aria-label="pros of obsidian permalink"></a>Pros of Obsidian</h4>
<ol>
<li>Super easy to link between pages using the <code>[[Some other page]]</code> syntax. Can also use that syntax for images which is nice</li>
<li>Since Obsidian is just a file editor, you own the Markdown files it produces</li>
<li>Full latex math support</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-obsidian"><a href="#cons-of-obsidian" aria-label="cons of obsidian permalink"></a>Cons of Obsidian</h4>
<ol>
<li>Limited by the fact it’s a Markdown editor in terms of formatting and syntax (also no way to format attached images so they aren’t full width)</li>
<li>Since it is a local application that uses a unique syntax for Markdown, you can’t easily share the notes</li>
<li>Even though I’m very proficient with Markdown (this blog is written in it!), it sucks to take bad Markdown-looking notes and have the actual nice notes in a different view</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="jupyter"><a href="#jupyter" aria-label="jupyter permalink"></a><a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a></h3>
<p>I switched to Jupyter to share the notes publicly and to run Python algorithms in-line. However, it suffered from the same Markdown weaknesses as Obsidian, and was an even worse tool for actual note-taking. I ended up switching to <a href="#Notion">Notion</a>, but continue to use Jupyter for supplementary Python examples related to my notes. All in all this isn’t really Jupyter’s fault, since it was never really designed for heavy-duty multi-notebook note-taking. However in my dreams there will one day be a tool with the features of Notion but with the ability for running in-line code.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-jupyter"><a href="#pros-of-jupyter" aria-label="pros of jupyter permalink"></a>Pros of Jupyter</h4>
<ol>
<li>Being able to run Python code in-line is by far the largest benefit of using Jupyter</li>
<li>You own the files</li>
<li>Full latex math support</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-jupyter"><a href="#cons-of-jupyter" aria-label="cons of jupyter permalink"></a>Cons of Jupyter</h4>
<ol>
<li>Absolutely terrible for linking between files. Have to basically do <code>[Other page](./other_page.ipynd)</code> each time, and obviously that’s even worse if the path isn’t that simple. Jupyter definitely wasn’t made for that kind of note-taking. Same for images</li>
<li>Same cons as Obsidian with relation to being a Markdown editor, although Jupyter has a edit mode for blocks rather than persistent Markdown, so the experience is a bit better. Nonetheless, I still found myself constantly editing then “running” blocks which was slightly inconvenient</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notion"><a href="#notion" aria-label="notion permalink"></a><a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Notion</a></h3>
<p>Finally, I ended up trying out Notion and it stuck.</p>
<h4 id="pros-of-notion"><a href="#pros-of-notion" aria-label="pros of notion permalink"></a>Pros of Notion</h4>
<ol>
<li>Notes look immediately good, and there are more formatting options </li>
<li>Decent latex support. Slightly worse than Obsidian and Jupyter since it only has Katex support, but still good enough for my use cases so far</li>
<li>They just recently introduced backlinks which I’ve found to be quite nice</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cons-of-notion"><a href="#cons-of-notion" aria-label="cons of notion permalink"></a>Cons of Notion</h4>
<ol>
<li>Takes a while to index new pages so linking to them can be slow for the first bit</li>
<li>A con that is specific to moving to Notion from Jupyter is I can no longer run in-line Python. However I still have Jupyter notebooks containing live Python code, and I link to them from the Notion notes so I still get the benefits of Notion and Jupyter</li>
<li>No support for tables that aren’t databases. A bit of a bummer if you just want to make a simple Markdown table to display some information (like a training set which comes up a lot in the machine learning course)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m very happy with Notion so far. It allows me to take notes quickly, and hits all the requirement checkboxes. Additionally, it’s easy to share as a public site for my notes, which is an added benefit.

<article>
  <p>Nearly a century ago, Alonzo Church invented the simple, elegant, and yet elusive lambda calculus. Along with Alan Turing, he then proved the Church-Turing thesis: that anything computable with a Turing machine can also be computed in the lambda calculus. However, nearly as soon as we had digital computers, we started inventing programming languages, and with them a vast treasure of features, beautiful and terrible, many of which seem very hard to relate to the fundamental nature of computability, let alone the lambda calculus specifically.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While it’s true that anything which can be computed, period, can be computed in the lambda calculus, you might not want to: it’s austere, to say the least, and was not designed with modern sensibilities regarding readability in mind. We developed all those languages and features for a reason! Still, Church demonstrated not just that it was possible to compute anything computable with the lambda calculus, but also <em>how</em> one might do so.</p>
<p>In this series, we’ll examine some ways to express common programming language features using the minimalistic tools of the lambda calculus. We begin with perhaps the most ubiquitous type: booleans.</p>
<h2 id="λ-is-blind">λ is blind</h2>
<p>The lambda calculus’s austerity is extreme: you don’t even have booleans. All you have are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lambda abstractions;</p></li>
<li><p>Applications; and</p></li>
<li><p>Variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll now review these in some detail; feel free to skip this section if you’re already familiar with the lambda calculus.</p>
<h3 id="lambda-abstractions">Lambda abstractions</h3>
<p>Lambda abstractions (“lambdas,” “abstractions,” and “functions” will also be used interchangeably) introduce a function of a single variable.</p>
<p>Abstractions are written <code>λ x . y</code>, for variable <code>x</code> and expression <code>y</code>, where <code>x</code> is now available as a bound variable in the body, and any enclosing definition of <code>x</code> is shadowed (i.e.&nbsp;<code>λ x . λ x . x</code> = <code>λ x . λ y . y</code> ≠ <code>λ x . λ y . x</code>). (We shall assume strictly lexical scoping for the time being.)</p>
<p>In Haskell, we would write <code>\ x -&gt; y</code> instead; in JavaScript, <code>function (x) { return y }</code> or <code>(x) =&gt; y</code>.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>Applications (“function application” and “function call” will be used interchangeably) apply the result of the expression on the left to the expression on the right.</p>
<p>Applications are written as <code>x y</code>, for expressions x and y, and left-associated, i.e.&nbsp;<code>a b c</code> = <code>(a b) c</code> ≠ <code>a (b c)</code>. Function application binds tighter than lambda abstraction, i.e.&nbsp;<code>λ x . λ y . y x</code> = <code>λ x . λ y . (y x)</code> ≠ <code>λ x . (λ y . y) x</code>.</p>
<p>The syntax is the same in Haskell; in JavaScript, we would write <code>x(y)</code> or <code>a(b, c)</code>. Note however that since lambda calculus functions are all single-argument functions, a more direct (though less idiomatic) equivalent for the latter would be <code>a(b)(c)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
<p>Variables introduced by enclosing lambdas.</p>
<p>Variable are written as more or less arbitrary names, typically alphanumeric (e.g.&nbsp;<code>x</code> or <code>y0</code> or <code>thing</code>); however, we will feel free to include non-alphanumeric characters in names as we see fit, since the paucity of syntax means there’s little risk of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Since the only available variables are those bound by enclosing lambdas, we can also infer that there are no <code>let</code> bindings for local variables, and no globals of any sort; the lambda calculus doesn’t come with a standard library.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>In quasi-BNF, the grammar for the lambda calculus is extremely minimal:</p>
<figure>
<p><em>e</em> <strong>:=</strong> <code>λ</code> <em>x</em> <code>.</code> <em>e</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>e</em> <em>e</em> <strong>|</strong> <em>x</em> <strong>|</strong> (<em>e</em>)</p>
</figure>
<p>And finally, this table gives a side-by-side comparison of the syntax of the lambda calculus with the corresponding syntax in Haskell &amp; JavaScript:</p>

<h2 id="unconditional-λ">Unconditional λ</h2>
<p>Lambdas are the only way to introduce values—they’re the only “literal” syntax in the language. We can therefore infer that the only kinds of runtime values must be closures. In an interpreter for the lambda calculus, closures might consist of the name of the introduced variable, the body of the lambda, &amp; a map relating the names and values of any variables it closed over when constructed (again, we assume strict lexical scoping). There are no bits, bytes, words, pointers, or objects in the language’s semantics; only this runtime representation of lambdas.</p>
<p>Likewise, lambdas are also the only way to introduce variables—there’s no standard library, built-ins, primitives, prelude, or global environment to provide common definitions. We’re truly baking the apple pie from scratch.</p>
<p>All of this raises the question: how do you <em>do</em> anything when you don’t even have <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>? Lambdas and variables don’t <em>do</em>, they merely <em>are</em>, so that leaves application. When all you have is application, everything looks like a lambda abstraction, so we’ll represent booleans using lambdas.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not <em>just</em> booleans we’re after; <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> aren’t much use without <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>if</code>, and all the rest. To be useful, our representation of booleans should therefore suffice to define these, as well. But how do you define <code>if</code> without using <code>if</code>? In a lazy language like Haskell, we might define <code>if</code> as a function something like so:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>if_ ::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-2">if_ cond then_ else_ <span>=</span> <span>if</span> cond <span>then</span> then_ <span>else</span> else_</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a strict language like JavaScript, we’d instead take functions for the alternatives:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>function</span> <span>if_</span>(cond<span>,</span> then_<span>,</span> else_) {</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  <span>if</span> (cond) {</span>
<span id="cb2-3">    <span>then_</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span id="cb2-5">    <span>else_</span>()<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">  }</span>
<span id="cb2-7">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Both these definitions use the language’s native booleans and <code>if</code> syntax (a tactic for implementing embedded DSLs known as “meta-circularity”), and thus aren’t viable in the lambda calculus. However, they do give us a hint: in both cases we have a function taking a condition, consequence, and alternative, and using the first to select one of the latter two. In the lambda calculus, we might start by writing:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . ?</code></pre>
<p>(Note: there aren’t any keywords in the lambda calculus, so there’s nothing stopping me from naming variables things like <code>if</code>, a fact which I will take free advantage of.)</p>
<p>We’ve introduced a definition for <code>if</code>, as a function of three parameters; now what do we do with them? The lambda calculus’s stark palette makes it easy to enumerate <em>all</em> the things we can do with some variable <code>a</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ignore it, whether by simply not mentioning it at all (as in <code>λ a . λ b . b</code>), or by shadowing it with another lambda which binds the same name (as in <code>λ a . λ a . a</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Mention it, whether on its own in the body of a lambda (as in <code>λ a . a</code> or <code>λ a . λ b . a</code>), somewhere within either side of an application (as in <code>λ a . λ b . a b</code> or <code>λ a . λ b . b a</code>), or some combination of both (as in <code>λ a . (λ b . a) a</code>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We could for example simply return <code>then</code> or <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . then
if = λ cond then else . else</code></pre>
<p>But in that case the conditional isn’t conditional at all—the value in no way depends on <code>cond</code>. Clearly the body must make use of all three variables if we want it to behave like the <code>if</code>s we know and love from other languages.</p>
<p>Taking a step back for a moment, let’s examine the roles of <code>if</code>’s arguments. <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> are passive; we only want to use or evaluate one or the other depending on the value of <code>cond</code>. <code>cond</code>, then, is the key: it takes the active role.</p>
<p>Thus, in the same way that our <code>if_</code> functions in Haskell &amp; JavaScript employed those language’s features to implement, we’re going to define <code>if cond then else</code> as the application of the condition to the other two parameters:</p>
<pre><code>if = λ cond then else . cond then else</code></pre>

<p>This feels strangely like cheating: surely we’ve only moved the problem around. Now instead of <code>if</code> making the decision about which argument to return, we’ve deferred it to <code>cond</code>. But <code>if</code> and <code>cond</code> aren’t the same, semantically; <code>if</code> takes a boolean and two other arguments and returns one of the latter, while <code>cond</code> <em>is</em> a boolean—albeit evidently a boolean represented as a function. Let’s make that precise by writing down <code>if</code>’s type:</p>
<pre><code>if : Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>Notwithstanding our use of the yet-to-be-defined name <code>Bool</code> for the type of the condition, this is the same type as we gave <code>if_</code> in Haskell; that’s a good sign that we’re on the right track! It takes a <code>Bool</code> and two arguments of type <code>a</code>, and it must return one of those because that’s the only way for it to come up with the <code>a</code> that it returns. But what <em>is</em> <code>Bool</code>?</p>
<p>Working backwards from the type and definition of <code>if</code>, we see that <code>cond</code> is applied to two arguments, and therefore must be a function of two parameters. Further, these are both of type <code>a</code>, and the value it returns must also be of type <code>a</code> for <code>if</code>’s type to hold. Thus, we can define the type <code>Bool</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code>Bool = ∀ a . a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code></pre>

<p>If a given <code>Bool</code> is a function of two arguments of arbitrary type, returning the same type, it must therefore select one of its arguments to return. There are only two distinguishable inhabitants of <code>Bool</code>, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, so we can therefore deduce that since <code>if</code> defers the selection of the result to the <code>Bool</code>, for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> to actually differ they must make opposite selections. In other words, <code>true</code> must return the <code>then</code> parameter, while <code>false</code> must return the <code>else</code> one:</p>
<pre><code>true, false : Bool
true  = λ then else . then
false = λ then else . else</code></pre>
<p>We didn’t move the problem around after all; we solved it. What we noticed was a deeper insight: this encoding of booleans makes <code>if</code> redundant, since if we can apply <code>if</code> to a <code>Bool</code> and two arguments, we could equally apply the <code>Bool</code> to those arguments directly.</p>

<p>It’s frequently convenient to conflate booleans with bits, their minimal representation, but in truth they’re not the same at all. Practically, some programming languages define booleans as a byte in memory, perhaps clamping its values to 0 and 1; others define them as instances of some boolean class, or constructors of an algebraic datatype.

<p>Pikchr (pronounced "picture") is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pic_language">PIC</a>-like markup
language for diagrams in technical documentation.  Pikchr is
designed to be embedded in <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#fenced-code-blocks">fenced code blocks</a> of
Markdown or similar mechanisms of other documentation markup languages.</p>

<p>For example, the diagram:</p>

<p>Pikchr diagrams can appear in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Wiki pages</li>
<li>Tickets and bug reports</li>
<li>Forum posts</li>
<li>Check-in comments</li>
<li>Anywhere else that Markdown or similar markup languages are used</li>
</ul>

<p>Pikchr diagrams are easy to generate.  The language is simple.
There is lots of documentation and examples on-line (links below).
Anyone who is comfortable using Markdown should be able to pick up Pikchr
with minimal extra effort.</p>

<p>Pikchr is safe for use in internet-facing applications.  Hostile
Pikchr scripts cause no harm (apart from generating ugly diagrams).</p>

<h2>Demos</h2>

<li><a href="https://pikchr.org/home/pikchrshow">/pikchrshow</a> ← Enter Pikchr text and see the result on-line</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation Is A Work In Progress</h2>
<p>As of 2020-09-16, the Pikchr code is stable and is in active use.
However, documentation is still under development.
We are using Pikchr to write the Pikchr documentation (in Markdown),
hence it was necessary to deploy Pikchr into a working content
management system (<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil">Fossil</a> in this case) prior to having
complete documentation available.  Volunteer assistance is welcomed!</p>

    <section>
<p>Printers are cool because they are, but I have friends that remind me at least weekly that hacking a printer is not useful. Every time it’s mostly the same thing all over again, find a 1990 type bug, write a stupid script, done.
Some months ago, I started a new project, a wild ride inside Google’s humongous codebase. While most of Google code, especially Android, is open source, some parts are not.
I’ll try to talk about one such case, the bootloader of a Pixel 3 phone.</p>

<p>What you are about to read mostly applies to Android 10 and later versions. Much has changed, but the exciting part for us is that now fastboot can run in userspace mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://source.android.com/devices/bootloader/fastbootd">Here</a> you can find the nitty-gritty details, the TL;DR is something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recovery and Fastboot partitions are now the same thing. One less partition, more code reuse. Nice.</li>
<li>The mechanisms to start Recovery or Fastboot is now slightly different, but this is taken care of by the bootloader.</li>
<li>Userspace Fastboot can’t issue some types of commands, namely OEM.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because Userspace fastboot can’t issue OEM commands, we will have to dig into the bootloader code.</p>

<p>Ok, we got a binary, let’s see what’s inside.</p>
<pre><code>➜  strings -n 12 bootloader-sargo-b4s4-0.2-6066691.img | head

</code></pre><p>As soon as I saw that, I started wondering when phones started using UEFI. UEFI and EDK2 are cool, but when did they end up being used in phones?</p>
<p><a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/qcomxbl/">Here</a> there are some notes on the history of why QC uses UEFI. If I understand it correctly, it’s because they want to support Windows on ARM.</p>
<p>Now that we know it’s UEFI, and we satisfied our curiosity on why it’s UEFI, we can start working on it.</p>

<p>Binwalk on the bootloader image will yield precisely zero. UEFI images are very structured, support compression, and allow for nested volumes. Ether, you know what you are looking at, or you are not going to get far.</p>
<p>Get uefi-firmware-parser from pip with</p>
<p><code>python -m pip install --user uefi-firmware-parser</code></p>
<p>uefi-firmware-parser it’s more of a framework and can be used in scripts. Fortunately, they provide a super nice and handy wrapper. The script can brute force <code>-b</code> any unknown image type, searching for known UEFI magic numbers.</p>
<pre><code>➜  uefi-firmware-parser -b bootloader-sargo-b4s4-0.2-6066691.img

        <section>
            <p>Mr. Jobs had a fascinating desire to make the internals of his Macintosh computer as aesthetically pleasing as the outside. There is something uniquely meaningful to us about this aim that at first thought one cannot describe. The affect of his aim lies in something we call "artisanship". That is: a perception of additional value that is orthogonal to the perceivable value that could have otherwise have been excavated if the producer had chosen to invest time in it.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.robsdomain.com/content/images/2020/05/Artboard-1.jpg"></figure><p>Perhaps because we realize time is finite and intrinsically meaningful we perceive the time invested into the intrinsic beauty of the totality of the object as aesthetic and are more willing to ascribe it a higher value. </p><p>Software is different from hardware in that a physical product is, in a way, an authoritative truth: it is materially in front of you as a "thing" that isn't easily transformed into something else. Software, on the other hand, &nbsp;suffers (and benefits) from the attribute of being an "iterable truth". It has little to no material cost besides time and due to its non-material anchoring is infinitely malleable. Unlike a physical good, software does not trigger the instinctive quality heuristic to "measure twice cut once". An incorrect cut may be metaphorically "undone" by throwing away the wood because the wood costs little to nothing. There is no penalty for the failure to prepare and measure it seems.</p><p>In the continued search for universal principles of application I often wonder whether the artisanal dimension of a product is applicable to the digital world. While that would be my hope – as there is little more satisfying than the comfort of a universal principle to justify your stubborn investment in perfection – evidence continues to suggest the contrary. </p><p>Perhaps the phenomenon of artisanal beauty is unique only to products that exist in material domains; however, at times I wonder if the contemporary technology myth of "moving quickly and allowing things to break" has become too saturated in the collective compass to see other approaches. Does real world artisanal software exist? Would the end customer even care?</p><p>Maybe artisanal software is produced for the joy in craft of the creator rather than the consumer. Comically a lot like life in a way.</p><hr><p>Kind thanks to <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/statue-inside-room-2661943/">Alex Y</a> of Pexels for the cover image</p>

  <p>Plastic is really bad for the environment. It takes 450 to 1000 years to degrade[1]. It affects marine life and litters our streets. Only around 9% of plastic is being recycled every year in the US. We are in Chicago. Everywhere we look, there's a piece of plastic stuck somewhere. We started an experiment to go plastic free grocery shopping for 1 month. These are our findings.</p>

<h4>1 - Our cost of food has gone down 70%.</h4>

<p>We are surprised. We thought we would have to pay more for our grocery. Here is a comparison of food prices with and without plastic packaging. The prices are from 5 popular grocery stores in Chicago.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EixtvIGXgAEs5cY?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Average food prices in Chicago (September 2020) Corn, red onion, potato and carrot."><br>
</p><p>Average food prices in Chicago (September 2020) </p>

<p>Interesting, right?</p>

<p>Another reason behind this result is that plastic wrap food usually comes in bulk. We end up buying more food than we need. Buying food per pound helps us think about how much we will eat. For a family of 2, we usually buy about 1-2 pounds of each produce. Here are the price differences.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EixtUosXsAU8LjX?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Food prices per pound vs per package in Chicago. September 2020 Corn, red onion, potato and carrot."><br>
</p><p>Food prices per pound vs per package (September 2020, Chicago)</p>

<p>We save so much if we go for zero packaging food. After all, people are paying a premium for the plastic package without thinking. We also don't waste as much of food. It's win-win!</p>

<h4>2 - We eat healthier</h4>

<p>We can't order food delivery anymore. It used to be a big chunk of our monthly bill. Most of the time we cook at home. We make homemade french fries instead of buying chips. It tastes better! We bring our own containers to restaurants when we order takeout.</p>

<h4>3 - Opt out a lot of options for shopping</h4>

<p>I don't know if it's only us feeling this way, but a lot of products have too many options.<br>
Opting out of plastic leaves only a handful of brands. Saves a ton of time for shopping.</p>

<h4>4 - We create a lot less trash</h4>

<p>Less packaging. Less trash.</p>

<p>Here are the cons.</p>

<h4>1 - It was difficult to find meat and bread that don't use plastic or styrofoam.</h4>

<p>Only 1-2 stores of the 5 have paper packaging for meat. For bread, we have to look for a local bakery for zero plastic options.</p>

<h4>2 - Food delivery is no longer an option.</h4>

<p>I put it as a pro and con in this section. Pro is that we saved a lot of money.<br>
Con is that we can only do takeout and bring our own food containers, which is not convenient.</p>

<p>Overall it has more pros than cons. <br>

                    <p>In a <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/06/10/playing-codenames-with-rust/">previous post</a> I implemented the game of Codenames in Rust, allowing a human player to interact with the computer playing randomly. Now let's implement a smarter computer agent, using word vectors. </p><p>Word vectors (or word embeddings) are a way of converting words into a high dimensional vector of numbers. This means that each word will have a long list of numbers associated with it and those numbers aren't completely random. Words that are related usually have values closer to each other in the vector space as well. Getting those numbers from raw data takes a long time, but there are many pretrained embeddings on the internet you can just use and there are also libraries that help you find other words that are close to a target word. </p><h2 id="word-vectors-in-rust">Word vectors in Rust</h2><p>Machine learning has embraced the Python programming language, so most ML tools, libraries and frameworks are in Python, but some are starting to show up in Rust as well. Rust's performance focus attracts people, because ML is usually computationally intensive. </p><p>There is one library in Rust that does exactly what we want: <a href="https://github.com/finalfusion/finalfusion-rust">FinalFusion</a>. It has a set of pretrained word vectors (quite fancy ones, with subword embeddings) and it has a library to load them and to make efficient nearest neighbor queries. </p><p>The pretrained embeddings come in a 5 GB file, because they pretty much literally have everything, including the kitchen sink, so the download will take a while. Let's start using the library (after adding it to our <code>Cargo.toml</code> file) to get the nearest neighboring words for "cat":</p><pre><code>use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;
use finalfusion::prelude::*;
use finalfusion::similarity::WordSimilarity;

fn main() {
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(File::open("resources/ff.fifu").unwrap());

    // Read the embeddings.
    let embeddings: Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt; =

    <p>Loading a 5GB file from disk will take some time. If you have enough RAM, it should be in the OS's file cache after the first run, so it will load faster. Also, compiling this program with --release (turning on optimizations and removing debug information) will speed it up significantly. 
    </p>
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>One of the rules of Codenames is that hints can't be any of the words on the board or direct derivatives of them (such as plural forms). The <code>finalfusion</code> library has support for masking some words out, but to get plural forms I resorted to another library called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/Inflector"><code>inflector</code> </a>which has a method called <code><a href="https://docs.rs/Inflector/0.11.4/inflector/string/pluralize/index.html">to_plural</a></code>, which does exactly what's written on the box. </p><pre><code>use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;
use finalfusion::prelude::*;
use finalfusion::similarity::EmbeddingSimilarity;
use std::collections::HashSet;
use inflector::string::pluralize::to_plural;

fn main() {
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(File::open("resources/ff.fifu").unwrap());

    // Read the embeddings.
    let embeddings: Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt; =
        Embeddings::read_embeddings(&amp;mut reader)
            .unwrap();
    let word = "cat";
    let embed = embeddings.embedding(word).unwrap();
    let mut skip: HashSet&lt;&amp;str&gt; = HashSet::new();
    skip.insert(&amp;word);
    let pluralized = to_plural(word);
    skip.insert(&amp;pluralized);
    let words = embeddings.embedding_similarity_masked(embed.view(), 5, &amp;skip).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", words);
}</code></pre><p>This is a slightly lower level interface, where we first have to obtain the embedding of the word, we build the set of words to skip and then we search for the most similar words to the vector that we give it. The output is:</p><pre><code>[WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.812261), word: "kitten" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7768222), word: "feline" },
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7760824), word: "kitty" }, 
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7667354), word: "dog" }, 
WordSimilarityResult { similarity: NotNan(0.7471396), word: "kittens" }]</code></pre><p>It's better. Ideally, we could also somehow remove all composite words based on words from the table, but that's a bit more complicated.</p><p>This can be wrapped in a function, because it's a common use case:</p><pre><code>fn find_similar_words&lt;'a&gt;(word: &amp;str, embeddings: &amp;'a Embedding, limit: usize) -&gt; Vec&lt;WordSimilarityResult&lt;'a&gt;&gt; {
    let embed = embeddings.embedding(&amp;word).unwrap();
    let mut skip: HashSet&lt;&amp;str&gt; = HashSet::new();
    skip.insert(&amp;word);
    let pluralized = to_plural(&amp;word);
    skip.insert(&amp;pluralized);
    embeddings.embedding_similarity_masked(embed.view(), limit, &amp;skip).unwrap()
}
</code></pre><h2 id="implementing-the-first-spymaster">Implementing the first spymaster</h2><p>Let's implement our first spymaster which uses word vectors! First, let's define a type alias for the embedding type, because it's long and we'll use it many times.</p><pre><code>type Embedding = Embeddings&lt;VocabWrap, StorageViewWrap&gt;;</code></pre><p>Our spymaster will have two fields: the embeddings and the color of the player. The <code>Spymaster</code> trait requires only the <code>give_hint</code> function to be implemented.</p><pre><code>pub struct BestWordVectorSpymaster&lt;'a&gt; {

    }
}</code></pre><p>This spymaster uses a simple greedy algorithm. It takes each word that has to be guessed and find's the most similar word to it, while keeping track of the similarity. It returns as hint the word that had the highest similarity to any of the words that belong to the opposite team. </p><p>How does it do? I drew some random boards with a fixed seed and ran this spymaster on them. If you hover over the hint, it shows what are the words it's based on. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

My Father Built these Planes During WWII, and He Always Loved Them.</p></div>
<p><span>The year is 1943 and America is deep in the desperate struggle to save the world from tyranny. The United States had entered World War II a little more than a year earlier following the December 7, 1941 attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor.</span></p>
<p><span>As the United States ramped up the war effort the government decided that to win this fight, in addition to brave soldiers and superior equipment, they would also need help from the brightest minds in the world. This lead to the founding of the Statistical Research Group (SRG). The SRG was located in Manhattan, just a block away from Columbia University, and before long many of the best mathematicians in the world were working there.</span></p>
<p><span>How smart were the people working at the SRG? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milton Friedman</a>, a future winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, worked at the SRG and it was later joked that while he was there he was often only the fourth smartest person in the room.</span></p>
<p><span>And who was the smartest? That was widely recognized to be the brilliant mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Wald" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abraham Wald</a>, a Jew who had fled Europe prior to the start of the war.</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force came to Wald with a problem. Too many of their planes were being shot down so they wanted to add extra armor to the vulnerable parts of the planes. Too much armor would make the planes too heavy to fly properly, so they couldn’t add extra armor over the entire plane. They asked Wald to tell them how much extra armor to add to the parts of the planes that were being hit most often.</span></p>
<p><span>To help Wald they had collected statistics on the bullet holes in planes returning from combat. They presented him the following statistics:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<span><strong><span>Section of Plane</span></strong></span></td>
<td><span><strong><span>Bullet Holes Per Sq. Ft.&nbsp;</span></strong></span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Engine</span></td>
<td><span>1.11</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Fuselage</span></td>
<td><span>1.73</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Fuel System</span></td>
<td><span>1.55</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Rest of Plan</span></td>
<td><span>1.80</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span>Given these statistics, what would you tell the Air Force?</span></p>
<p><span>The answer Wald came up with&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;them. He instructed the Air Force to put the extra armor not where the bullet holes were, but were they weren’t – on the engines! And how did Wald come up with this answer. Simple. He considered the missing bullet holes. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force had presented him with statistics on planes that had returned safely from combat. Wald recognized this as biased sample that told a distorted and incomplete story. There were also a lot of planes at the bottom of the ocean, and Wald correctly guessed that these planes were full of bullet holes in the engines.</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force followed his advice and the results were stunning. Immediately more planes started returning safely from combat saving the lives of countless pilots and crew members.</span></p>
<p><span>Wald correctly identified this as not so much a math problem but as a problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survivorship bias</a>, and once you understand this concept you start seeing it everywhere. Survivorship bias tells a lot of distorted and incomplete stories and looking for the missing bullet holes, as Wald had done, can save you from making bad decisions based on inaccurate and incomplete information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fortune Cookie Lottery Winners</strong></h2>
<p><span>On March 30, 2005 the Powerball lottery drawing produced 110 2<sup>nd</sup> prize winners who had picked 5 of the 6 numbers correctly. This entitled each of them to winnings of over $100,000. Lottery officials found this strange since, based on the number of tickets sold, there should have only been about 5 2<sup>nd</sup> prize winners.</span></p>
<p><span>Searching for an explanation the officials asked winners how they had picked their numbers. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/12/world/americas/as-the-cookie-crumbles-winners-galore-in-lottery.html?mcubz=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An article</a> in The New York Times described what happened next:</span></p>
<p><span><em>“Our first winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie,” said Rebecca Paul, chief executive of the Tennessee Lottery. “The second winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie. The third winner came in and said it was a fortune cookie.” </em></span></p>
<p><span>The fortune cookie with the lucky numbers was eventually traced to a factory in Long Island City, owned by Wonton Food, which produces four million fortune cookies a day.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“That’s ours,” said Derrick Wong, of Wonton Food, when shown a picture of a winner’s cookie slip. “That’s very nice, 110 people won the lottery from the numbers.”</em></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2017/10/taking-financial-advice-from-a-lottery-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reporting</a> on the incident <a href="http://awealthofcommonsense.com/about-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Carlson</a> wrote cynically, but more truthfully than we care to admit, “If any of these 110 people worked in the investment business they probably would have started their own newsletter – </span><em><span>My Secret Formula for Winning the Lottery.”</span> </em></p>
<p><span>And they could have made the newsletter sound very convincing. After all, the author could have pointed to109 other people who also followed this formula and won big. But you wouldn’t fall for it, because you would look for the missing bullet holes, and you understand that there are thousands of planes piloted by fortune-cookie-lottery-number-picking pilots laying at the bottom of the ocean.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Other Examples of Survivorship Bias</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>Many investing companies start new mutual funds in what are known as “fund incubators.” These funds, employing various strategies, are kept small and are not available for public investing. After several years in the incubator the most successful ones are rolled out to the public touting their stellar investment records. The underperformers are discontinued in an attempt to keep the missing bullet holes hidden forever.</span></li>
<li><span>In the classic book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Thomas-Stanley-Ph-D-ebook/dp/B00CLT31D6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509685860&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+millionaire+next+door" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Millionaire Next Door </em></a>authors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Stanley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas J. Stanley</a> and William D. Danko state that business owners make up the largest group of millionaires next door. But this is not the same as saying that most business owners are millionaires. Most businesses fail and the ocean floor is littered with planes piloted by brave but ultimately unsuccessful entrepreneurs. So before jumping in and starting your own business, consider the missing bullet holes.</span></li>
<li><span>My wife and daughter love the real estate shows on HGTV. These shows make flipping houses look effortless and exciting. And there is no shortage of books and infomercials telling you how easy it is to make money buying real estate with little or no money down. While it is certainly possible to make money in real estate, it is not easy. Don’t forget to look for the missing bullet holes. They are not difficult to find. Lots of would-be real estate tycoons, including personal finance radio guru Dave Ramsey, have crashed in spectacular fiery fashion. Before you start flipping houses, consider the missing bullet holes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>My purpose in discussing survivorship bias is not to talk you out of taking risks. Indeed, I believe that anything worth doing involves risk. I just don’t think you should take risks based on the distorted and incomplete picture that survivorship bias presents.</span></p>
<p><span>Speaking of this Ben Carlson said, “Every inspirational speech by someone successful should have to start with a disclaimer about survivorship bias.”</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, clear up the picture first by searching out the missing bullet holes and seeing what you can learn from them. They often tell the most interesting and useful part of the story. This won’t guarantee you success but it will increase your chances for a safe return by allowing you to put some extra armor on the vulnerable areas of your plane. After doing that, buckle your seat belt and prepare for takeoff!</span></p>
<p>Note: I read the story of the missing bullet holes in the excellent book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical-ebook/dp/B00G3L6JQ4/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509686186&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+not+to+be+wrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking</a>, </em>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Ellenberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jordan Ellenberg</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust is a strange language.</p><p>It has modern and promising design idea, and good performance compared to C++. It's proved to be an alternative system language that can use for writing OS, although there's no product level rust OS yet, there're several implementations as the potential players. It's the highest expected, trying the whole bag of tricks to grow, gaining popularity in the young crowds...all these are very good to a novel and health community.</p><p>On the other hand, this language seems no idea where to go. No, I'm not talking about its dreaming goal, of course I know its goal is explicitly expressed: safety, speed, and concurrency. What I'm confusing is the way it choose towards its goal. Rust community choose an iterative model rather than waterfall model to develop Rust language. That is to say, the code and interfaces keeps changing while the design is still not confirmed. Although it's the popular development model in today's internet industry on business software, I doubt if it's the best way for a foundational foresight programming language. However, it's too early to say whether the development model is bad in nowadays' industry. We can see many companies are trying to use Rust even its design is still unstable. In the past, such kind of activity is insane to take risks in a serious product. But today's industry is in a rapid iterating, maybe our understand is too old for it, and maybe Rust's model is the brand new way to improve the industry. People can adapt the fast changing things even it's their fundamental langugage, and there could be stronger auto tools to rely on. Who knows, let's give it a try, warriors, the boss pays for it.</p><p>This article is about the Rust frontend on GCC. It's reasonable for me (or any potential contributors) to blame Rust's development model, since it's interfering the efforts of its own GCC frontend.</p><p>So far, the only reliable implementation is the officially supported LLVM front-end. I don't know if there're more, but I will not choose if it's not based on a mainstream compiler infrastructure. After all, it's system level language, once you choose, it's not expected to be changed in a decade. To my experiences to lead the software development in past decade, it's not so simple to change fundamental things, from libs to compilers to languages. It's not impossible, but why waste time to do it when you have lots of other workloads to deal with?</p><p>Stop, it's not a criticism article against Rust. So I'm not going to blame it more.</p><p>OK, that's enough, now that we're trying to work for the Rust front-end on GCC, it's reasonable to say we're interested in this language. And we hope to promote it better. As a perennial GNU hacker, it's natual for me to think about Rust on GCC. I have several experiences on writing language front-ends, the architecture is similar, and the theory is similar too. However, gcc-rust is a very hard project that couldn't be done successfully by one-man effort. In this article, I'll introduce the ideas and efforts around FOSS community. I hope all these information can help people to understand the situation, and help potential contributors to take part in.</p><p>Of course, Rust on LLVM has gone so far away, but what would I say?</p><p><img

Hydra Cave</h2><p>Rust on GCC is a Hydra. Why? Because there're at least 3 possible ways to go. Oh well, three heads of a dragon.</p><p>These 3 ways are originally mentioned by @redbrain who is one of the enthusiasts of Rust on GCC (<a href="https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365" target="_blank">https://github.com/redbrain/gccrs/issues/2#issuecomment-563255365</a>). Unfortunately, he has dropped his efforts, but his work of Rust on GCC is still inspiring.</p><p>The first way is the most lightweight way. The original Rust compiler provides a IR (Intermediate Representation) named MIR, so the idea is really simple, we can take advantage of the front-end of Rust on LLVM then convert MIR to GENERIC which is the general IR in GCC. The pros is that we don't have to deal with the occasionally changing of Rust's grammar. This idea is achievable, since the original Rust compiler is in the similar architecture to convert MIR to LLVM-IR. The only problem is that this Rust on GCC frontend has to require the original rustc, and this may bring the LLVM dependencies chain. Then people may wonder why we still bother to implement Rust on GCC, it doesn't reduce the dependencies in the development environment nor likely to be widely accepted by GCC folks. No mention the license issue.</p><p>The second way is to use GCC JIT interface on top of the original Rust compiler. This architecture implies to add a new backend (libgccgit <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html" target="_blank">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/cp/index.html</a>) to the original Rust compiler. So it's not the Rust on GCC as most people expected, it's a new feature request to Rust developer to support yet another compiler backend and maintain the code by Rust community. This is the perfect approach only if Rust developers accept it. However, the hard part would be license issue, and it all depends on the willing of Rust community.</p><p>The third way is the traditional way, full C++ implementation of Rust on GCC. There's an existing good example, gccgo, which is the Go language front-end on GCC. It's the hardest way to build a Rust compiler from scratch. The pros is that the developers can expect to do everything they like to build an efficient Rust compiler to challenge the orginal one, and it doesn't require LLVM as the prerequisite. Finally, no any license issue, we can make it GPLv3+. However, there must be a strong group to maintain this front-end. Gccgo has a strong team hired by Google. No mention you have to keep updating the volatile Rust grammar periodically.</p><p>All these approaches are independent from each other, so it's impossible to combine all these 3 forces. The MIR way is working by @sapir <a href="https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust" target="_blank">https://github.com/sapir/gcc-rust/tree/rust</a>, and it's still in progress; The libgccjit way requires the connection to Rust community that is out of my reach, and I don't know who is working on it; as a GNU hacker, I think my prefered way is the third one. The third way was dropped by @redbrain, but there's some inspiring code left.</p><h2>What we've got so far?</h2><p>My plan is not to secretly working on it then throw a release suddenly to shock people. I have too many projects in my TODO, I do want to have gcc-rust, and I do want to have more friends on it. Let me emphersize it again, it's impossible to do it by one-man effort.</p><p>Fortunately, @SimplyTheOther have done fully-operational and working lexer, parser of a recent Rust syntax. It's great work. I have enough experiences to write parsers for practical languages, it's time consuming work. That's why I appreciate @SimplyTheOther's work so much. Of course, I agree with @SimplyTheOther that the most time consuming work would be the type checking part, at least for Rust, I'm afraid that it could be true.</p><p>After I helped to fix tiny bugs to make it work smoothly, I started to write an enhanced AST dumper. It's reasonable for us, first, I need to get familiar with @SimplyTheOther's AST design; second, we need to output a human-readable AST for debugging.</p><p>Let me show you a silly example:</p><pre spellcheck="false"><span><span>fn</span> <span>abc</span></span>(x:<span>u32</span>, y:<span>u32</span>) -&gt; <span>u32</span> {
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>return</span> x+y;
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>1</span>+<span>1</span>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>);
}
</pre><p>Alright, it's silly meaningless code, let's see how the AST dump looks like.</p><p>Assuming you stored the source code to test.rs, then run AST dump:</p><pre spellcheck="false">rust1 -frust-<span>dump</span>-parse test.rs
</pre><p>The output could be:</p><pre spellcheck="false">Crate:
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;items:

<span>u32</span> abc(x : <span>u32</span>, y : <span>u32</span>)
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>return</span> ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: x + y
&nbsp;final expression: none
}

void main()
BlockExpr:
{
&nbsp;outer attributes: none
&nbsp;inner attributes: none
&nbsp;statements:
&nbsp; ExprStmtWithBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp; BlockExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statements:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ArithmeticOrLogicalExpr: <span>1</span> + <span>1</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; final expression: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>)
&nbsp;ExprStmtWithoutBlock:
&nbsp; outer attributes: none
&nbsp;&nbsp; StructExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PathInExpr:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abc(<span>1</span>, <span>1</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inner attributes:none
&nbsp;final expression: none
}
</pre><p>It's good for us to debug or extend the parser. After all, if we can't make sure the parser is correct, how can we move forward to type checking and IR transformation?</p><p>The project repo is here, patches are welcome: <a href="https://github.com/philberty/gccrs" target="_blank">https://github.com/philberty/gccrs</a></p><h2>What's next?</h2><p>Before answer this question, I guess you may wonder why I used `rust1` rather than a traditional name `gccrust` or something else.</p><p>`rust1` is the Rust compiler, while `gccrust` is a collection that calling compiler, assembler, and linker like a chain. We haven't done the IR transformation yet, so there won't be anything can be assembled and linked except for the AST. Oh my poor Rust compiler!</p><p>It's not so hard to transform AST to GENERIC which is the current toplevel IR of gcc. However, it's meaningless to rush if we haven't made sure the parser work correctly for the Rust grammar. No mention the critical feature of Rust, the linear type system.</p><p>If you understand what I've said so far, then I can answer the question "what could be the next".</p><p>1. The type system, too big to talk about it here.</p><p>2. The static analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the advantages of llvm-rust was that it used the static analysis of LLVM. Fortunately, David Malcolm finished his GCC static analysis framework recently <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/" target="_blank">https://lwn.net/Articles/806099/</a>. I'm not sure if there could be any hook for front-end to interact with, or maybe we can't touch it once we pass the authority to the next level IR. Anyway, it's an exciting feature of GCC to research.</p><p>3. The new middle-IR for Rust specific pre-optimizing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is largely inspired by gccgo because they've inserted a specifically designed IR for Go language before transforming it to GENERIC. This IR was named GOGO. Gccgo will do some pre-optimizing with GOGO. From the compiler design perspective, it's reasonable to do so, since some information may lose after …</p></div></div>

      <p>Every developer needs access to some servers for example to check the application logs.</p>
<p>Usually, this is done using public-private key encryption where each developer generates their own public-private key pair.
The public keys of each developer are added to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file on each server they should have access to.</p>
<h2 id="painful-manual-changes">Painful manual changes</h2>
<p>So far so good. However, what happens when one developer leaves the company?</p>
<p>In that case, the public keys of that developer should be removed from all servers. This could be quite a bit of work depending on how many servers they had access to.
And even worse, if it’s done manually, there is quite some risk that the key is still forgotten on some server, so the access remains open.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-solutions">Alternative solutions</h2>
<p>There are some commercial and open source solutions out there which want to help out with this problem. The basic idea is that you add and maintain the keys and the access lists on that service and when you remove a key, they will remove it from all your servers.</p>
<p>Sounds good, but it has one very big disadvantage: it’s a potential single source of failure. If someone captures access to that service, they can gain access to all your servers. And if you lose access to that service, you also lose access to all your servers in the worst case.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-signing-keys">The solution: signing keys</h2>
<p>When I was facing this problem, I asked on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24157180">HackerNews</a> how others are tackling this problem.</p>
<p>There were some great suggestions and insights from the community and the best solution to the problem seems to be the signing of keys which I will present to you here in detail.</p>
<h3 id="the-rough-idea">The rough idea</h3>
<p>The rough idea is this: You still generate a public-private key pair for each developer. However, you don’t upload the public keys to your servers.</p>
<p>Instead, you sign the public keys with a so-called certificate authority (CA) key which you generate before. This signing simply generates a third certificate file which you give back to the developer and they put it inside of their <code>.ssh/</code> folder next to the private and public key.</p>
<p>On the servers, you simply tell the server the public key of your CA and the server can detect if a user has a properly signed certificate and only allows access to the developers who have such a signed certificate.</p>
<h3 id="the-advantages">The advantages</h3>
<p>When you sign a certificate, you can determine how long that signing is valid. So if you sign it with a validity of 3 months and the developer leaves the company, then after 3 months they won’t have access to any of the servers for sure.</p>
<p>Now you say: well, but I don’t want to sign keys of everyone every 3 months which is a fair point.</p>
<p>One possibility is to automate the process for example by building a service where a user can automatically get a signed certificate when they authorize with their company e-mail and password, but that is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>The simple alternative is that you issue certificates that are valid longer and then if someone leaves the company, you can revoke the certificate, i.e. invalidate it. You can put a list of invalid certificates on your servers and they will not accept the user any more.
This could for example be done by having this list on AWS S3 or some other storage and a cronjob on each server that regularly pulls this.</p>
<h3 id="show-me-how-to-do-this">Show me how to do this</h3>
<p>Glad that you asked!</p>
<p>It’s actually super simple once you know the drill.</p>
<p>First, you generate a certificate authority public-private key pair of which you should keep the private key very secure:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">umask <span>77</span>                        <span># you want it to be private</span>
mkdir ~/my-ca <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cd ~/my-ca
ssh-keygen -C CA -f ca -b <span>4096</span>  <span># be sure to use a passphrase and store it securely</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then on your server you specify that all users signed by your CA are allowed to access the server:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload the public key of your CA on your server, e.g. at <code>/etc/ssh/ca.pub</code></li>
<li>Tell the server to allow access to users signed by it by adding a line to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub <span># Trust all with a certificate signed by ca.pub</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To make the changes effective, you should reload the ssh service: <code>sudo service ssh reload</code>.</p>
<p>Now if a developer generated their public-private key pair (e.g. <code>ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521</code>), they simply send you their public key (note that you never need to send any private keys around!).
Then you sign their public key to generate their certificate:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># Inside your ~/my-ca folder, sign their public key (here: id_ecdsa.pub)</span>
ssh-keygen -s ca -I USER_ID -V +12w -z <span>1</span> id_ecdsa.pub
</code></pre></div><p>Quick explanation for the different parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-s ca</code> - you want to use your CA to sign</li>
<li><code>-I USER_ID</code> - the id of your user / the username</li>
<li><code>-V +12w</code> - how long before the certificate expires - here valid for 12 weeks</li>
<li><code>-z 1</code> - the serial number of this certificate - can be used to make this particular certificate invalid later, should be unique</li>
<li><code>id_ecdsa.pub</code>: the public key of the developer which you want to sign</li>
</ul>
<p>It will generate the certificate <code>id_ecdsa-cert.pub</code> which you can send to the developer and they put it into their <code>~/.ssh</code> folder next to their public-private key pair.</p>
<h3 id="it-gets-even-better">It gets even better</h3>
<p>Sounds cool, right? But you can do even better!</p>
<p>You probably have developers with different experience and different teams and roles and not everyone accessing the same servers.</p>
<p>So let’s add roles into the signing process!</p>
<p>That way, on the server you specify which roles are allowed to access the server and during the signing process you specify the roles of the developer you are signing.</p>
<p>Then, that developer can access all servers matching to their roles.</p>
<p>When you on board a new developer, you only need to generate that one certificate and boom they have access to all relevant servers without adding anything on those servers.</p>
<p>Here is how this looks like schematically:</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/how-to-properly-manage-ssh-keys-for-server-access/ssh-keys-with-roles.png" alt="ssh certificate signing with roles">
    
      <figcaption>ssh certificate signing with roles</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>This is how you configure roles on a server:</p>
<p>First, create the folder to configure access: <code>sudo mkdir /etc/ssh/auth_principals</code>
Inside that folder, you can create files with the name of the server user that someone could login as. For example to grant root access to some roles, add the file <code>/etc/ssh/auth_principals/root</code>.</p>
<p>Inside <code>/etc/ssh/auth_principals/root</code> you simply list all roles which should be able to login as root with one role per line:</p>
<p>Finally, configure on the server to use roles by again adding a line to <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">AuthorizedPrincipalsFile /etc/ssh/auth_principals/%u
</code></pre></div><p>To make the changes effective, you should reload the ssh service: <code>sudo service ssh reload</code>.</p>
<p>This is how you sign a key with roles (they are added to the certificate):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh-keygen -s ca -I USER_ID -n ROLE1,ROLE2 -V +12w -z <span>2</span> id_ecdsa.pub
</code></pre></div><p>It’s the same as before, but with the <code>-n ROLE1,ROLE2</code> flag. Important: there can’t be spaces between the comma for different roles!</p>
<p>Now, that developer could log onto any server where <code>ROLE1</code> or <code>ROLE2</code> are in an auth_principals file for a user name they try to login as.</p>
<h3 id="revoking-keys">Revoking keys</h3>
<p>Finally, if you want to invalidate a certificate, you can do that by the user name or the serial number of the certicate (<code>-z</code> flag). It’s recommended to make a list of generated certificates in an Excel spreadsheet or have a database depending on the number of your peeps.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh-keygen -k -f revoked-keys -u -s ca list-to-revoke
</code></pre></div><p>This is when you already have a <code>revoked-keys</code> list and want to update it (<code>-u</code> flag). For the initial generation, use it without the update flag.</p>
<p>The <code>list-to-revoke</code> needs to consist of usernames (ids) or serial numbers (<code>-z</code> flag during generation) like this:</p>
<pre><code>serial: 1
id: test.user
</code></pre><p>This would revoke access to the certificate with serial 1 and all certificates with id <code>test.user</code>.</p>
<p>To make the server respect revoked keys, you need to add the generated / updated <code>revoked keys</code> file to <code>/etc/ssh/revoked-keys</code> and configure it again in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>
<p>Warning: make sure that the <code>revoked-keys</code> file is accessable and readable, otherwise you might lose access to your server</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">RevokedKeys /etc/ssh/revoked-keys
</code></pre></div><h2 id="summary-good-ssh-key-management">Summary: good ssh key management</h2>
<p>In my opinion, this solution is as good as it gets. You have the option to manage the access to your servers via ssh based on roles. You only need to configure your servers once (which roles are allowed to access it). For each new developer, you only need to generate a signed certificate and they immediately have access to all relevant machines matching their role / experience.
And when they leave the company, you can revoke their access also in a simple way.</p>
<p>And even if a mishap occurs and a developer leaves without having their access revoked, their certificate will expire after some time, so they also lose access automatically.</p>
<p>For small teams, you can do these steps manually as they are very fast to do; then as you grow, you can automate the certificate signing with a login service based on company authentication details.</p>
<p>Happy ssh-ing!</p>

<p>AWS Lightsail doesn’t usually show up in a list of AWS’ most popular services. However, Lightsail can be a great service to use especially if you are looking for a service that is easy to set up and has low maintenance. In this article, we will take a deeper look into Lightsail, when to use it and compare it to some of its competitors.</p>
<p>AWS Lightsail is a collection of building blocks that make it easy to get a web application up and running pretty quickly. These building blocks are:</p>

<h2 id="lightsail-instances">Lightsail Instances</h2>
<p>These instances are analogous to Virtual Private Servers (VPS) which are backed by EC2 instances (most likely the t2/t3 family) under the hood. AWS provides a lot of flexibility when it comes to choosing what kind of instance you want to run.</p>
<p>AWS Lightsail can be created in the following AWS Regions (as of September, 2020):</p>
<ul>
<li>US East (Ohio) (us-east-2)</li>
<li>US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)</li>
<li>US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Mumbai) (ap-south-1)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Seoul) (ap-northeast-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Singapore) (ap-southeast-1)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)</li>
<li>Asia Pacific (Tokyo) (ap-northeast-1)</li>
<li>Canada (Central) (ca-central-1)</li>
<li>EU (Frankfurt) (eu-central-1)</li>
<li>EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)</li>
<li>EU (London) (eu-west-2)</li>
<li>EU (Paris) (eu-west-3)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lightsail also provides several options for the base image that you use for instance. You can choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS Only</strong>: You can choose from various Linux/Unix-based or a Windows-based OS</li>
<li><strong>Apps + OS</strong>: If you are planning to run a CMS like Wordpress or application on top of Django or Node, you can choose an image that installs these applications by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details about Lightsail instance images can be found <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/compare-options-choose-lightsail-instance-image">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-1.png" alt="instance-1" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-2.png" alt="instance-2" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<p>One of the best features of Lightsail is its clear and transparent pricing. You can create an instance that best fits your needs and you can be confident of how much it will cost you at the end of the month. AWS is notorious for complex billing and this can put off a lot of new customers.</p>
<p>Lightsail instances come with generous data transfer limits which is definitely a big improvement.</p>
<p>AWS recently added <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-alarms">support for alarms in Lightsail</a>. This is a big improvement since previously there was no way to set up an alert for Lightsail system metrics such as CPU utilization.</p>
<p>You also have the flexibility of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/features/upgrade-to-ec2/">upgrading your instance</a> to EC2 in the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/instance-3.png" alt="instance-3" title="AWS Lightsail Instances"></p>
<h3 id="loadbalancers">Loadbalancers</h3>
<p>Lightsail provides the option of adding a loadbalancer to your stack if you need to distribute traffic across your instances. Lightsail also lets you generate free SSL certificates from the UI itself and they work seamlessly with the loadbalancers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/loadbalancer-1.png" alt="loadbalancer-1" title="AWS Lightsail Loadbalancer"></p>
<h3 id="managed-database">Managed Database</h3>
<p>Lightsail lets you create a managed MySQL or PostgreSQL database easily. Lightsail makes certain database administration tasks much simpler:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated database snapshots</li>
<li>Resize your database from a snapshot</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/database-1.png" alt="database-1" title="AWS Lightsail Database"></p>
<h3 id="dns-management">DNS Management</h3>
<p>Lightsail makes it easy to direct traffic from your custom domain to your instances. This can be done by either creating a static IP or a DNS zone for your domain.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.learnaws.org/assets/img/lightsail/dns-1.png" alt="dns-1" title="AWS Lightsail DNS"></p>
<h3 id="lightsail-pros--cons">Lightsail: Pros &amp; Cons</h3>
<p>Like with any cloud service, Lightsail has its pros and cons. Some of the more obvious ones are:</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear &amp; transparent pricing</strong>: Pricing is clear and you have a good idea of what your monthly expenses would be.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of use</strong>: Lightsail’s UI is straightforward and easy to use especially when compared to the AWS console.</li>
<li><strong>Low maintenance:</strong> Most of the lightsail services (DNS, Loadbalancers, Database) are managed and thus the operational burden of running your application in Lightsail is pretty low.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lightsail is missing some advanced features such as:
<ul>
<li>Security groups: there is no support for security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. You need to use firewalls to achieve the same.</li>
<li>If the rest of your infrastructure is on Terraform, it might be hard to fully provision all Lightsail services using Terraform since some of the services <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+lightsail">aren’t yet supported</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currently, it is not possible to upgrade your Lightsail database to RDS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lightsail-alternative-lightsail-vs-digitalocean">Lightsail Alternative: Lightsail vs DigitalOcean</h2>
<p>DigitalOcean is LightSail’s main competitor. The target audience for both of these services are developers who want to be able to spin up their web services easily. We will try to compare these two offerings to get a better idea of how these services stack up against each other.</p>
<p>They’ve taken the relatively complex process of deploying servers to the cloud and simplified the entire process. Their UI is beautifully designed and cloud servers can be deployed within minutes. Pricing has always been transparent and you know what you’ll be paying each month upfront.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>Lightsail and DigitalOcean are pretty comparable when it comes to the features they both offer. They both provide an easy-to-use interface for setting up as well as APIs for any programmatic setup. When it comes to choosing a server, they both provide a lot of choices. One can go with a The table below compares the two across various dimensions:</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://joshtronic.com/2020/09/06/vps-showdown-digitalocean-lightsail-linode-upcloud-vultr/">The blog post</a> does a comprehensive performance comparion between various VPS providers. Lightsail and DigitalOcean performed comparably in these tests.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use-lightsail">When to use Lightsail</h3>
<p>When it comes to choosing between Lightsail and DigitalOcean, there are a few factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are already using AWS, it makes sense to use Lightsail.</li>
<li>If you are planning to use other AWS services or you might upgrade from Lightsail to EC2, it makes sense to use LightSail.</li>
<li>If you haven’t used either of these services before, you are probably better off starting with DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean is simple and straightforward to use and this is their main business.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Lightsail is a service targeted towards developers who probably haven’t used AWS before or want a service that is easy to use with minimal maintenance overhead.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good reasons to use Lightsail:</p>
<ul>
<li>No need for prior AWS knowledge</li>
<li>Get a complete web service up &amp; running in less than an hour</li>
<li>Clear &amp; transparent pricing</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/09/vscode-remote-ssh/">rediscovered</a> the ability of Visual Studio Code to develop on remote machines. Just connect to a server via SSH and develop there.</p><p>Even though I’m using Git, I don’t have to commit everything immediately to continue development on another machine, I don’t have to take care to keep all my development tools up to date on all my machines, and I can continue working from my Surface Go with Windows exactly where I left off with my Ubuntu desktop. And I can, for example, start drafting a blog post on one computer, but finish it on another.</p><p>All I need is a cheap rented virtual private server and Visual Studio Code on every machine I want to code from.</p><hr><p>But first of all the reason why I got the idea in the first place:</p><p>To program in Go, I mainly used <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEA Ultimate</a> from JetBrains in the past. The best IDE a developer can wish for. Excellent for Java, Kotlin, Go and a lot of other programming languages. And pretty cool: As a student you can get the full IDE for free.</p><p>However, since I won’t be a student forever and IDEA Ultimate or as an alternative just <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoLand</a> from JetBrains <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/store/#personal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t very cheap</a> (at least for hobby projects), I thought I might get used to a different workflow now that will cost me less money later.</p><p>The second best option for developing Go is probably <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Studio Code</a>. The Go team took over the development of <a href="https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Go extension</a> not too long ago, which will hopefully make it more and more pleasant to develop Go programs with VS Code in the future.</p><p>VS Code is free, partly even <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open source</a> and I already use it for quite a lot of things anyway, be it for writing longer blog articles or if I need to write some JavaScript. In itself it is just a text editor, but there are quite a few extensions that add all kinds of functionality. And VS Code is fast and available for all three major computer operating systems.</p><p>For VS Code there is an extension called “Remote - SSH” (documentation is available <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) with which it is possible to connect to another computer or server via SSH. On the remote computer VS Code installs a remote server to provide almost all functionality that is possible locally. It’s like running VS Code directly on the remote computer and developing from there.</p><p>As a server I use the cheapest option from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hetzner Cloud</a>. With just a few clicks I created a VPS with Ubuntu 20.04, two Gigabytes of RAM and 20 GB SSD storage. I also use Ubuntu 20.04 on my desktop computer and laptop, the environment I am used to. And if the server should be too weak for certain tasks, I can scale it up with a few clicks, even temporarily. The costs are 2,89 € per month. If I don’t need the server for a longer period of time, I could also create an image of the hard drive, delete the server and create a new one later based on the image. That would cost only a few cents per month.</p><p>This way I only have to install all the tools I need on the server. Like Go for the programming of various private projects or Hugo for this blog and my website. But I don’t have to install these tools on all my devices anymore, namely my desktop computer, my Ubuntu-ThinkPad and my Surface Go. There I only need Visual Studio Code with the “Remote - SSH” extension.</p><p>It definitely takes some getting used to in order to adapt to the less comfort you might be used to through the JetBrains IDE. But once you have found the right settings of the Go extension (for example that the Go language server <code>gopls</code> is used), then programming with this setup works quite well.</p><p>My favorite feature is definitely the ability to forward ports from the server to the local machine.</p><p>The only possible negative point is that I need an internet connection to develop so that I can connect to the server. But so often I am not without internet and even in Germany the mobile network should be sufficient for SSH. And when I am offline, I will just have to do something else.</p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6682ce0e9be9292fb093d16e4b89a6cbec481554/1fe8d/images/uploads/sign-up-buttons.png" alt="SaaS Startups Using Sign Up Buttons"></p>

<p>The fate of many&nbsp;startups depends almost entirely on one&nbsp;conversion point: When a visitor becomes a user.</p>

<p>All too often, this pivotal role&nbsp;falls on the shoulders of a pitifully generic “sign up” button that’s lucky to get even a minute of consideration during development.</p>

<p>If you take a moment to consider the wording of your signup button, you can drastically increase how many of your visitors turn into users.</p>

<p><em>(What happens after the conversion is important, too, but things get significantly easier once you have someone’s email and opt-in.)</em></p>
<h2>Why "Sign Up" buttons don't work.</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>They're&nbsp;ignored.&nbsp;</strong>When visitors see common elements repeated on many sites, they begin unconsciously ignoring those elements (aka "habituation").&nbsp;Doesn't matter if they're blue or green or hell-fire-orange.</li>
  <li><strong>You're asking for blind commitment.</strong>&nbsp;Don't&nbsp;assume visitors&nbsp;know what you're asking them to sign up for. People don't read pages, they skim. They could've easily missed the part where you mention a&nbsp;free trial or key benefits.</li>
  <li><strong>You're not offering any value.</strong> Asking someone to "sign up" offers no help in changing the visitor's thinking from "Why should I?" to "I want this!"</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to get more signups&nbsp;from your signup button:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tie it to your product.</strong> If you have a SaaS for trading bitcoins: "Start Trading Bitcoins." If&nbsp;you have a marketplace for artists: "Start Selling Art." This helps prevent the button from being overlooked.</li>
  <li><strong>Give, don't take.</strong> "Get Access" and "Sign Up" both lead to the same thing, but one makes the visitor feel they're getting something, while the other doesn't.</li>
  <li><strong>Compel people to act.</strong> Use action verbs such as <em>get</em>, <em>start</em>, and <em>try</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples from startups that get it right:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a5e786dc725cdf0d2cc7d265cf2130fd5e785f5e/09f83/images/uploads/sign-up-buttons-2.png" alt="Startups with Good Signup Buttons"></p>

<p>(I especially like gliffy’s “Start Drawing,” which implies how quickly you can get started, and directly relates to&nbsp;their product: <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/">an app for easily drawing diagrams</a>.)</p>
<h2>Case study: Getting 3x more clicks by changing two words.</h2>
<p>Take this example from one of my clients. Like many software companies, Scalyr—a <a href="https://www.scalyr.com/">log aggregation and monitoring tool</a>—asked its visitors to “sign up.” I suggested that we test a version of the button that <em>gives</em> and <em>compels</em>: “Try it Free”. Here’s what happened:</p>

<p><strong>Asking visitors to <em>Try it Free</em> <span>increased clicks by 212%</span>.</strong></p>

<p>Complete obliteration of the old “Sign Up” button, and a&nbsp;huge win for a test that took two minutes to set up.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7562f9ce9e08b024e6c838126e1d6f54e24e07ed/7465d/images/uploads/scalyr-test-result.png" alt="A/B test on Scalyr resulted in 212% increase in clicks."></p>
<h2>Now try it yourself...</h2>
<p>Test a variation of your “sign up” button with something that <em>gives</em>,&nbsp;<em>compels</em>, and is <em>tied to your product</em>. It’s one of the easiest things to test, and could have a huge effect on your conversion rates. If you follow my advice then you’re almost certain to do better than asking visitors to “sign up.”</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is a followup to my post about a year ago, <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/ui/druid/2019/11/22/reactive-ui.html">Towards a unified theory of reactive UI</a>. It is a deeper exploration of the question: “what is the best way to express reactive UI in Rust?”</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>There is an astonishing diversity of “literature” on reactive UI systems. I put “literature” in quotes here, because, with some exceptions, the best primary sources are the code of open source projects. Some of the diversity comes from differences in goals, but some of it is accidental. In many cases, it’s simply because the designers didn’t have insight at the time about better solutions. My post last year attempted to put some order to this diversity, by discovering common patterns.</p>

<p>I believe it’s likely that the answer to “the best way to express reactive UI in Rust” is to be found in the existing literature, at least by combining major themes, if not in a single existing system to copy. It seems unlikely we’ll have to invent something completely new. But sorting through it is not easy. It is not the intent of this post to provide a comprehensive review of the literature (though I think such a thing would be interesting), it is to guide inquiry into the most promising avenues. I want to do mining, not stamp collecting. Where is the richest vein of ore?</p>

<p>To focus the inquiry, I will start by listing some goals. While in general these goals all seem like good things, it’s important to understand them as tradeoffs. Prioritizing different goals will lead you to different places, and not everyone has the same needs. Take overall system complexity, for example. If you’re a trillion dollar corporation, then a complex system is merely a question of allocating resources, and may even be strategically useful as a moat to discourage competition. But if you’re an indie game developer trying to integrate basic UI, you have a very different perspective.</p>

<p>Each goal will be presented primarily as a way to introduce design decisions made by existing reactive systems, and filter the ones that seem most promising as sources and inspiration.</p>

<p>Then I will go into deeper into three principles, which I feel are critically important in any reactive UI framework: whether to use “observable objects,” how to express the mutation of the render object tree (or trees in general), and the notion of stable identity of nodes in that tree.</p>

<p>Finally, I will introduce <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/crochet">Crochet</a>, a research prototype built for the purpose of exploring these ideas.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<h3 id="concise-expression-of-application-logic">Concise expression of application logic</h3>

<p>The main point of a reactive UI architecture is so that the app can express its logic clearly and concisely, and the results can drive the rest of the UI stack in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>A central feature of reactive UI is for the app to declaratively express the current state of the view tree. In traditional object-oriented UI, it’s more common to specify the initial state (often as a static document, not even code), plus additional logic for state changes. I think the debate is now essentially over, the reactive approach is winning.</p>

<p>SwiftUI has gained considerable attention due to its excellent ergonomics in this regard. But other approaches are also worth studying. In particular, immediate mode GUI (<a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">imgui</a>) is nearly as declarative, it just achieves it in a very different way (about which more below). And React and its many derivatives are also “good enough.” <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> is another example from the JS world that deserves praise, though considerably more difficult to adapt to Rust because of its reliance on a sophisticated compiler.</p>

<p>It’s very popular in Rust GUI land to adapt <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">Elm</a> patterns; we see clear influence in <a href="https://github.com/antoyo/relm">relm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hecrj/iced">Iced</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bodil/vgtk">vgtk</a>, and others. But I think much of the conciseness and friendliness of Elm comes from the language itself, particularly its facility with higher-order composition. When adapting to a more pragmatic language such as Rust, I consider each subtask of view building and dispatching messages to components as each a half-lens, requiring the writing out of two pieces of logic to integrate a component. For this reason, I find Rust UI code adapted from Elm to be not as clear and concise as possible.</p>

<p>A great resource for comparing the concision of different toolkits is <a href="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/">7GUIs</a>. We don’t have these ported to Crochet yet, except for counter, but plan to. For reference, here’s the <code>run</code> method for that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>fn</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>cx</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Cx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Label</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"current count: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>.count</span><span>))</span><span>.build</span><span>(</span><span>cx</span><span>);</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>Button</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"Increment"</span><span>)</span><span>.build</span><span>(</span><span>cx</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>self</span><span>.count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="actually-being-incremental">Actually being incremental</h3>

<p>While imgui can express UI concisely, it cheats somewhat by not being incremental. Generally, it makes up for this by being able to repaint the world very quickly (using GPU acceleration), but there are downsides, including power consumption. In the context of a game which is actively using the GPU anyway, it’s fine, but is a good reason not to choose imgui outside that context.</p>

<p>The documentation of <a href="https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/conrod">Conrod</a> expresses a goal fairly well: “Conrod aims to adopt the best of both worlds by providing an immediate mode API over a hidden, retained widget state graph.” And once you have that, doing efficient incremental updates in the retained widget graph is a solved problem, though the details can be intricate. Unfortunately, I do not believe Conrod delivers on this promise, because app logic does an awful lot of explicit graph construction and juggling of node id’s, neither of which you would find in an actual immediate mode API.</p>

<p>On the other side, <a href="https://github.com/hecrj/iced">Iced</a>, while having many desirable properties, does not satisfy the “actually incremental” goal: while there is caching in the renderer, it builds a full view tree every 16ms (actually twice when there are incoming events). This is fine when the view tree is relatively small, but is a serious problem at scale.</p>

<p>The popularity of “virtual DOM” approaches requires a discussion of diffing, which I feel is (modulo escape hatches for lower level direct tree mutation) a form of half-incrementality. The idea is that it should be cheap to produce a full view tree, then a reconciliation engine computes a minimal diff between that and the old tree, which is then be applied, through DOM mutation or some other means. Because DOM is slow, it’s certainly faster than ham-handed direct DOM mutation (which is difficult to make truly minimal), but still creates performance problems as the view tree grows. React programmers should be well familiar with this issue.</p>

<p>When escape hatches are provided, are they a reasonably principled way to achieve lower level access to tree mutation, simply shifting some tracking of state to the component (often a list view or similar collection), or are they a dirty hack to work around fundamental architectural decisions that limit performance? Both are represented in the literature.</p>

<h3 id="tab-focusing">Tab focusing</h3>

<p>It seems like a relatively simple feature, but proper implementation of tab focusing requires fairly deep architectural support (or, in the case of Web-based UI, it is punted to the browser). Basically, it requires the toolkit to maintain state of which widget is focused, and to query enough of the entire view tree to determine which is the next in tab focus order. Proponents of imgui have suggested a very hacky partial solution (see <a href="http://www.johno.se/book/imgui.html">johno on IMGUI</a>), but I find such things unsatisfying.</p>

<p>Again, Iced is an example of an existing Rust GUI toolkit that is lacking this feature, and I think would require nontrivial architectural work to address, at least in a systematic way that would satisfy similar future needs. Down the line, those needs include accessibility, a serious Achilles heel for imgui-flavored designs in particular.</p>

<p>I believe a proper approach to this problem involves stable identity of widgets, about which much more below.</p>

<h3 id="simple-types">Simple types</h3>

<p>Now we get into more controversial goals. One that I personally am finding increasingly important is expressing the interface between app logic and UI toolkit using simple types.</p>

<p>Rust in particular invites the use of complex types, largely because it has a rich type system that is capable of expressing many concepts as types. By contrast, it’s traditional in object oriented UI to have very loosely coupled dynamic typing; a lot of the values being passed around have a type which is some variant of “any.”</p>

<p>A great example of complex types is SwiftUI, in which a component returns a statically-known type implementing the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view"><code>View</code></a> protocol. As a consequence, the concrete return type of a component generally encodes its entire view hierarchy, including special conditional and looping combinators; this is explained well in the <a href="https://www.objc.io/blog/2019/11/05/static-types-in-swiftui/">Static Types in SwiftUI</a> blog.</p>

<p>There are advantages to such a scheme, but also serious downsides. Error messages from the compiler get… interesting. And it also has a serious impact on compile times, as (at least in Rust) the compiler has to monomorphize the types before even starting to generate code.</p>

<p>To me, one of the most serious drawbacks to the complex type approach is that scripting languages can’t easily play, as the types must be known at compile time.</p>

<p>Again, imgui is an example of an architecture that avoids complex types, by drawing the UI directly rather than constructing an intermediate tree of view objects. But imgui is not the only such; another compelling example to learn from is <a href="https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/under-the-hood-of-jetpack-compose-part-2-of-2-37b2c20c6cdd">Jetpack Compose</a>.</p>

<h3 id="simple-control-flow">Simple control flow</h3>

<p>It is very tempting to use complex control flow patterns: putting significant logic in callbacks, using higher order composition techniques, or using a compiler to significantly transform the code. Yet, such techniques have downsides.</p>

<p>The first is simply that this complexity leaks out into the app. In current Druid, we use some higher order composition techniques such as lenses. While fairly simple by Haskell standards, and our users with Haskell background tend to like them, a lot of people coming to Druid find them confusing.</p>

<p>The simplest mechanism for …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>We turned a coffee maker into a dangerous machine asking for ransom by modifying the maker’s firmware. While we could, could someone else do it too? As you might expect, the answer is: Yes. Follow us on a journey where we show you that firmware is the new software.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Some research is so fun that it confirms why I do this work. I was asked to prove a myth, call it a suspicion, that the threat to IoT devices is not just to access them via a weak router or exposure to the internet, but that an IoT device itself is vulnerable and can be easily owned without owning the network or the router. I also bet that I could make that threat persist and present a true danger to any user. We often say that your home network, thought of as a chain of trust, is only as strong as its weakest link, but what if the same were true at the device level? What would that mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say you have an IoT device that is well protected with functions that can be accessed through a well-defined API; even if you can control the device through the API, you probably can’t do too much harm. Firmware, the programming inside the device has logical constraints that don’t allow you, for example, to close garage doors while someone is in the way of them or overheat a device so that it combusts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used to trust that hardware, such as a common kitchen appliance, could be trusted and could not be easily altered without physically dismounting the device. But with today’s “smart” appliances, this is no longer the case.</p>



<p>My colleagues often hear me say that&nbsp; “firmware is a new software.” And that software is very often flawed. We see it everywhere. CPU flaws, and cryptographic chips generating weak keys that can be easily broken. The weakened state of IoT security is due in large part to the fact that, nowadays, it is more convenient and cheap to place a processor inside a device which controls and orchestrates all hardware parts, motors, sensors, heating elements, etc. based on a short program called firmware. This solution is not only cheap, but has also one important property – it can be updated</p>



<p><br>Back in the day, if there was a so-called design flaw in a piece of hardware, the rigid design (often hardwired) meant the vendor would need to replace the whole component or logic board or even replace the entire device. Manufacturers would have to change the manufacturing process and at potentially great financial losses. In the era of firmware, this can be easily mitigated just by issuing a firmware update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process of updating firmware can vary greatly, from connecting to the special device using a special tool (which still requires the vendor’s physical interaction) to the more and more popular way of OTA (over the air) updates. In this case, a vendor doesn’t have to be physically present and the whole process is done either automatically over the internet or semi-automatically after a user’s notification and approval of the update.&nbsp;</p>







<div><p>So let’s see what we have. We have a coffee maker that allows you to make coffee the old fashioned way by pressing a few buttons or via a mobile phone or tablet using an app. The maker operates with Wi-Fi and when unboxed you have to connect it to your network through a companion app on your mobile phone. When turned on for the first time, the coffee maker works in a local mode and it creates its own Wi-Fi network that the hopeful coffee drinker first connects to in order to set up the device.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth to mention that this coffee maker is no longer supported by the vendor as they moved to a more secure platform in 2017 and technology because of all the flaws illustrated in this research. But this also shows a general problem we have with abandoned IoT devices.</p><p>When we downloaded the companion app, we saw that it allows you to create a network of any&nbsp; devices of this particular vendor and connects these devices to the&nbsp; home network and then allows you to control all the functions of your coffee maker or smart kettle. It also allows you to check the firmware version of the device and update it if needed.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>The protocol that this device speaks has already been documented on the internet by <a href="#references">several other researchers</a>. As expected, it’s a simple binary protocol with hardly any encryption, authorization or authentication. Communication with machines takes place on <code>TCP</code> port <code>2081</code>. The format of the command is very simple:</p>

<p>In response (if there is a response) the coffee maker sends back:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="593" height="111" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-10.png 593w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-10-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></figure></div>



<p><code>response_type</code> differs based on the command, but the general rule is: If the response contains data <code>response_type = command + 1</code>, if it’s just a status then <code>response_type=3</code> and then there is only one <code>data</code> byte which contains resulting status, where <code>1</code> means success. The complete list of commands is in the  <a href="https://github.com/avast/ioc/tree/master/SmarterCoffee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repository</a>.<br></p>



<p>&nbsp;So just for illustration, by issuing this command:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="396" height="78" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8.png 396w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-8-300x59.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"><figcaption><em>making a nice cup of coffee with “default” settings</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>You’ll make yourself a nice cup/cups of coffee based on the default settings of the coffee maker. As you can see, there is no security, so anyone who has access to the network and is able to reach the IP address of the coffee maker can control it. What is more interesting, is that all these commands are also available through that default opened Wi-Fi network when the device is not joined to a home network yet.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Let’s return to our main goal of hijacking the coffee maker for nefarious purposes. How secure is the updating process? Can we break into it? Can we even change the firmware to do something else than was originally intended? Can we turn the device into a physically dangerous device? Can we do it remotely? As I said in the beginning, the weakest link always compromises the whole system. Either it’s a network or a device. The goal is answering all the above questions and prove that IoT devices could be also compromised at the firmware level.</p>



<p>To start, we wanted to learn how the update process works. We have several options to do this, but we already have a recipe for this based on similar past research we have done. The general rule is to make it as simple as possible; here is our to-do list when trying to reverse the update process of a piece of firmware.</p>



<ol><li>Get it (the file with the firmware)</li><li>Unpack it (if it is packed/encrypted)</li><li>Reverse engineer it (translate those zeroes and ones into meaningful code)</li><li>Modify it (add the malicious content)</li><li>Upload it (and push it back to the device)</li></ol>



<p>It’s simple right?</p>







<p>First, we need to get the firmware somehow, and again there are several options. Let’s stick to the rule, the simplest option first:</p>



<ol><li>Google it – as obvious as it seems,&nbsp; sometimes security researchers omit this step which could save them a lot of work.

It’s time to dismount the device, trace the board to identify all the components, get datasheets to find debugging ports, and possibly dump the firmware directly from the chip. This is really an adventure in hardware and not for everyone.</li></ol>



<p>Life is not so simple, and neither is reverse engineering IoT devices. It turned out that we had to use a combination of all the aforementioned techniques. First, we googled it, and as the commands have already been documented, we found a command that says <code>“update the firmware.”</code> But the command itself (its parameters and format) had not been documented. So by issuing:</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9.png" alt="" width="396" height="78" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9.png 396w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-9-300x59.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px"><figcaption>t<em>his simple (two bytes) command switches coffee maker into update mode</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>the coffee maker goes into an update mode (on the newer firmware you have to push a button to actually start the update, but this is not the case with older versions !)</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zt-eEhReRyN8xe20y_NoBwNR_TCZ02Y87hyXVZDDiU6WtGGW2s4bmTBy37tdaIS9TBm5hLoBKwqcc1iE0tHjhC4HzVqqhSX_DB1bRUvGy9QTeuwGiYuSRVXTuoWxnkGFwOn57tVX" alt=""></figure></div>







<p>Hmm nice, but nothing happens. By analyzing network traffic, we concluded that there is nothing to analyze, as there is no traffic coming out of the coffee maker at this stage. So we tried the Android companion app.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-08-02-at-9.30.47-AM.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Screen-Shot-2019-08-02-at-9.30.47-AM.png"><figcaption><em>Android application for smart coffee maker, right picture shows an update screen</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>You can see the update button is grayed out, so obviously, the firmware is up-to-date and there is no easy option to push the firmware update to be able to see what’s in the network traffic. What’s interesting here is what’s missing. There was no communication to the internet neither from the coffee maker nor from the app. So how is it possible that the app knows that the coffee maker has the latest firmware? The only packets of data that went through were those between the machine and app when the app had been asking the machine for the version of the firmware.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="677" height="177" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4.png 677w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-4-300x78.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px"><figcaption>Typical traffic analysis of IoT with companion app: we are interested in traffic between app and internet and app and device.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>This is strange, and it seemed to tell us that the firmware is probably not on the internet and must be part of the app. So we opened the .apk file as easy as a .zip file. What we found there, proved our assumption.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/reUvllV7KNcZW0e9A4E_XljR0jknTZL-CLUbS3vJx0uiyArpgKdEVSpK1vEUUG0Q6Tu00I0wUlZMdQ8nG1w_Mdxz611TUCxA2DozEy0wftaC0qynZhhx8_pKNc6VeST1djzBgVti" alt=""><figcaption><em>Files inside the apk: You can see firmware for both products are contained in the two files with suffix .bin&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div>







<p>The firmware is part of the Android app and it also means that new versions of the firmware always come with new versions of the app. This makes perfect sense if you think about it for a second. The new firmware usually adds new …</p></div></article></div>

<p>We turned a coffee maker into a dangerous machine asking for ransom by modifying the maker’s firmware. While we could, could someone else do it too? As you might expect, the answer is: Yes. Follow us on a journey where we show you that firmware is the new software.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Some research is so fun that it confirms why I do this work. I was asked to prove a myth, call it a suspicion, that the threat to IoT devices is not just to access them via a weak router or exposure to the internet, but that an IoT device itself is vulnerable and can be easily owned without owning the network or the router. I also bet that I could make that threat persist and present a true danger to any user. We often say that your home network, thought of as a chain of trust, is only as strong as its weakest link, but what if the same were true at the device level? What would that mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say you have an IoT device that is well protected with functions that can be accessed through a well-defined API; even if you can control the device through the API, you probably can’t do too much harm. Firmware, the programming inside the device has logical constraints that don’t allow you, for example, to close garage doors while someone is in the way of them or overheat a device so that it combusts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We used to trust that hardware, such as a common kitchen appliance, could be trusted and could not be easily altered without physically dismounting the device. But with today’s “smart” appliances, this is no longer the case.</p>



<p>My colleagues often hear me say that&nbsp; “firmware is a new software.” And that software is very often flawed. We see it everywhere. CPU flaws, and cryptographic chips generating weak keys that can be easily broken. The weakened state of IoT security is due in large part to the fact that, nowadays, it is more convenient and cheap to place a processor inside a device which controls and orchestrates all hardware parts, motors, sensors, heating elements, etc. based on a short program called firmware. This solution is not only cheap, but has also one important property – it can be updated</p>



<p><br>Back in the day, if there was a so-called design flaw in a piece of hardware, the rigid design (often hardwired) meant the vendor would need to replace the whole component or logic board or even replace the entire device. Manufacturers would have to change the manufacturing process and at potentially great financial losses. In the era of firmware, this can be easily mitigated just by issuing a firmware update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process of updating firmware can vary greatly, from connecting to the special device using a special tool (which still requires the vendor’s physical interaction) to the more and more popular way of OTA (over the air) updates. In this case, a vendor doesn’t have to be physically present and the whole process is done either automatically over the internet or semi-automatically after a user’s notification and approval of the update.&nbsp;</p>







<div><p>So let’s see what we have. We have a coffee maker that allows you to make coffee the old fashioned way by pressing a few buttons or via a mobile phone or tablet using an app. The maker operates with Wi-Fi and when unboxed you have to connect it to your network through a companion app on your mobile phone. When turned on for the first time, the coffee maker works in a local mode and it creates its own Wi-Fi network that the hopeful coffee drinker first connects to in order to set up the device.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth to mention that this coffee maker is no longer supported by the vendor as they moved to a more secure platform in 2017 and technology because of all the flaws illustrated in this research. But this also shows a general problem we have with abandoned IoT devices.</p><p>When we downloaded the companion app, we saw that it allows you to create a network of any&nbsp; devices of this particular vendor and connects these devices to the&nbsp; home network and then allows you to control all the functions of your coffee maker or smart kettle. It also allows you to check the firmware version of the device and update it if needed.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>The protocol that this device speaks has already been documented on the internet by <a href="#references">several other researchers</a>. As expected, it’s a simple binary protocol with hardly any encryption, authorization or authentication. Communication with machines takes place on <code>TCP</code> port <code>2081</code>. The format of the command is very simple:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="593" height="111" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6.png 593w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/image-6-300x56.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></figure></div>







<p>In response (if there is a response) the coffee maker sends back:</p>

<p><code>response_type</code> differs based on the command, but the general rule is: If the response contains data <code>response_type = command + 1</code>, if it’s just a status then <code>response_type=3</code> and then there is only one <code>data</code> byte which contains resulting status, where <code>1</code> means success.

<p>You’ll make yourself a nice cup/cups of coffee based on the default settings of the coffee maker.

What is more interesting, is that all these commands are also available through that default opened Wi-Fi network when the device is not joined to a home network yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is strange, and it seemed to tell us that the firmware is probably not on the internet and must be part of the app. So we opened the .apk file as easy as a .zip file. What we found there, proved our assumption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>God...dammit</p>


<p>It's hard to see a child outside today without some kind of iDevice pumping high fidelity 192kbps stereo lossless audio into their shiny white headphones, but <em>BACK IN MY</em> <em>DAY, </em>the iPod hadn't been invented yet. &nbsp;Pickings were slim. &nbsp;Walkmen were outdated, CD players were pricey and would skip if bumped around despite their ESP features, MiniDisk was another stillborn Sony format, and MP3 players were still ugly and ridiculously expensive (at least Apple fixed the ugly part).</p>
<p>Thus, Tiger Electronics, pioneers in the high tech market of McDonald's Happy Meal toys, invented "Hit Clips"</p>
<p><iframe width="584" height="438" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9pgMmDmd8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hit Clips were small cheap digital audio players that could play music off of little plastic cartridges. &nbsp;The audio was mono, sounded terrible, and only included a 60 second sample of a song.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5621" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5621-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Better hold on to that patent Tiger...</p>
<p>Still, the songs were officially licensed and included bands like The Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter, Sugar Ray, and ...Dreamstreet</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="Dream_street_blue_house" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="456" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house.jpg 635w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house-300x215.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dream_street_blue_house-417x300.jpg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px"></a></p>
<p>The 00s were a very strange time for all of us...</p>
<p>Anywho, while helping my 17 year old cousin move some furniture, we came across a large collection of hit clip cartridges, but no player. &nbsp;Struck with a wave of nostalgia, I asked if I could take one to do a tear down.</p>
<p>Thus this post.</p>

<p>The hit clip cartridge has 8 metal contacts on the back:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5620" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-300x199.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5620-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Taking it apart, I was hoping to find some identifiable piece of hardware, but instead found the chip-on-board construction that is so popular with super-low-cost low-power electronics along with a few discrete components.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5625" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5625-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>Under this blob of epoxy is a wire-bonded chip of silicon. &nbsp;The song is likely hard coded directly into the silicon wafer rather than being programmed there after the fact using flash or OTP memory. &nbsp;It's cheaper that way if you make enough units.</p>
<p>This didn't give me a whole lot to work from, but assuming the capacitor is a bypass capacitor (decent assumption), I at least had some idea of how to power the thing. &nbsp;Poking around for a bit gave me this schematic:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="hitclipschem" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-300x225.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hitclipschem-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I'm not sure what the two No Connect pins do, but apparently there was a version of the Hit Clip that allowed music to be recorded to special cartridges, so I'm guessing they have something to do with that.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how much voltage the part needed, but a quick search on Ebay gave me some idea:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png"><img loading="lazy" title="ebay" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png" alt="" width="720" height="475" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay.png 720w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-300x197.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ebay-454x300.png 454w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a></p>
<p>3 AAAs means 4.5V. &nbsp;Also, can you believe people are bidding $40+ for these things?</p>
<p>Before I could get serious about debugging, I needed some way to connect traces to the board easily. &nbsp;I ended up soldering on some header pins and plugging it into a breadboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="IMG_5629" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IMG_5629-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>My original assumption was that the bottom-left pin was ground as it connected to the mystery chip more times than the other power-pin. &nbsp;You'll note the scratch-outs indicate that I was wrong. &nbsp;In that configuration, the chip drew 200+mA during the half-second that I left it connected. &nbsp;Presumably there's a reverse bias protection diode that I was blowing up.</p>
<p>Swapping the power pins around, the current started at around 280<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A before dropping to zero.</p>
<p>Convinced that I had it right, I moved to the other pins. &nbsp;There were four pins to chose from and a voltage measurement showed me that two of them were at the 4.5V rail while the other two were settled close to 0V.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Since I had already identified my two power pins, I had to assume that these four pins were used for data somehow and that the two high pins had internal pull up resistors.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin1 to ground sinks about 12mA from that pin. &nbsp;12mA is much to high to be from a simple pull-up resistor. &nbsp;My guess is that it's some kind of output pin to tell the player that the cartridge is inserted all the way. I decided to leave it alone and move on to Pin 3.</p>
<p>Connecting Pin 3 to ground caused the circuit's current draw to rise from zero up to 300<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>A. Removing this short did nothing to change the current increase although it did settle down after about 60 seconds.</p>

<p>This is when I knew I was on to something. &nbsp;60 seconds of current draw meant that this part was outputting its music sample! &nbsp;I was expecting the player to need to do something more complicated like pull bytes of music off the cartridge over a SPI bus or at least provide a clock source, but it turns out that the cartridge can handle that all by itself. &nbsp;I'm guessing that the two on-board series resistors are used for fine-tuning its internal clock source after the chip has been printed.</p>
<p>I quickly whipped out my oscilloscope and took a trace of Pin 2:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png"><img loading="lazy" title="scopetrace" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png" alt="" width="1191" height="816" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace.png 1191w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-300x205.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-1024x701.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scopetrace-437x300.png 437w" sizes="(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px"></a></p>
<p>Data!</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p><em>While doing a similar job on a different Hit Clip (Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baha Men), I discovered different behavior. &nbsp;Connecting Pin 3 to ground did nothing while commenting pin 1 to&nbsp;ground toggled between data and no data. &nbsp;I'm not sure if there was a change in the Hit Clip design through generations, or if I took imprecise notes. &nbsp;The PCB layouts of the two clips is clearly different, and it looks like pin 3 is NC on the second clip.</em></p>
<p>I noticed an intermittent square wave with a period of almost exactly 24kHz and a duty cycle that varied with time. &nbsp;Pin 4 had similar data.</p>
<p>So there was definitely something going on here, and it was definitely digital somehow, but I needed some way to capture loads of digital data to later analyze. &nbsp;Fortunately, Santa gave me an 8 bit Saleae logic analyzer for Christmas:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae.jpg 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-300x200.jpg 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-449x300.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>I actually picked up the Hit Clip while looking for a good project to test this thing out. &nbsp;It's a really nice device, and the Windows/Mac/Linux compatible software is really slick.</p>
<p>Anywho, with the Saleae connected to Pin 2 and Pin 4, I reactivated the circuit and took a trace at a 24MHz sample rate. &nbsp;I came up with this:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae trace" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png" alt="" width="1647" height="986" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace.png 1647w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-300x179.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-1024x613.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-trace-500x300.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1647px) 100vw, 1647px"></a></p>
<p>It was strange at first to see how the two data lines appeared to take turns, but once I remembered that Hit Clips only output in mono, it made a lot more sense. &nbsp;These two lines are encoding the same mono stream of audio.</p>
<p>Looking closer at the low-going blips, I noticed that they were quantized. &nbsp;The length of each blip was always near some integer multiple of 0.3333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s.</p>
<p>Knowing what I know about audio amplifiers, I theorized that these two outputs are meant to directly drive the push and pull FETs of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier">class D amplifier</a> in real time. &nbsp;In other words, a blip on one line pulls the waveform output voltage up while a blip on the other pulls it down. &nbsp;The width of the blip indicates how hard (or for how long) it pulls.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Redditor urquan points out that this kind of modulation is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation">Sigma-Delta Modulation</a>.</p>
<p>While it's technically a digital output, it's encoded in such a way that it can be fed directly into an analog circuit.</p>
<p>I figured that if I could give myself a stream of this data, I could probably simulate the output digitally. &nbsp;To cut down on the number of samples, I exported the trace to a CSV file that only records timestamps when something changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png"><img loading="lazy" title="saleae output" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png" alt="" width="534" height="810" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output.png 534w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/saleae-output-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"></a></p>
<p>In order to make use of this data, I just needed to record how much time passed between a signal dropping low and rising up again, and I should have such data points arriving at almost exactly 24kHz. &nbsp;All of the data from one pin was given a positive value while the data from the other pin was given a negative value.</p>
<p>I also tried quantizing the data by dividing the time delays by 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s, and while this worked for small numbers, I noticed that some of the larger numbers fell pretty far from a solid integer.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>It looked like 0.33333<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s was a bad estimate of the actual quantization time. &nbsp;Thinking a little more critically, I noticed that a 24kHz wave has a period of 41.67<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s. &nbsp;When divided by my quantization time, this comes out to almost exactly 125 which is pretty darn close to 128, a power of two.</p>
<p>Changing my quantization time to 0.3255<span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_c9faf6ead2cd2c2187bd943488de1d0a.gif" alt=""></span>s or <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_d7efcee3110178fb773e908bd2b03eda.gif" alt=""></span> yielded much better results:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png"><img loading="lazy" title="divby3255" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png" alt="" width="603" height="555" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255.png 603w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-300x276.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/divby3255-325x300.png 325w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"></a></p>
<p>Now the question is what to do with these numbers.</p>
<p>My first attempt involved just pumping them into a WAV file and taking a listen. &nbsp;With this setup, all of the negative numbers were negative points on the waveform. &nbsp;Here's the first 400 samples:</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png"><img loading="lazy" title="straightwav" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png" alt="" width="937" height="523" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.png 937w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-300x167.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav-500x279.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px"></a></p>
<p>I took these values, gained them up to fill a 16 bit WAV file and took a listen:</p>
<p><audio controls="controls"><source src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/straightwav.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element</audio></p>
<p>Firstly, I was shocked to get anything even closely resembling audio. &nbsp;Especially something so recognizable. &nbsp;That being said, the audio quality isn't the best. &nbsp;The raw values out of the cartridge only extend from around -60 to +60 which leads me to believe that it's encoded as a 7-bit signed integer (-64 to +63). &nbsp;7-bit audio isn't exactly lossless, but I wasn't convinced that this was the best I could do.</p>
<p>I found two problems with the way I was decoding the audio:</p>
<h3>Empty samples</h3>
<p>I noticed looking at the Saleae trace that there were many periods in the 24kHz digital data stream where neither trace showed a blip.</p>
<p><a href="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png"><img loading="lazy" title="noblip" src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png" alt="" width="1055" height="905" srcset="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip.png 1055w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-300x257.png 300w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-1024x878.png 1024w, https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/noblip-349x300.png 349w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"></a></p>
<p>Because my script was only looking at the blips, I simply skipped passed these data points. &nbsp;The end result was that the music played slightly faster than it should have. &nbsp;This was obvious when my output WAV file was shorter than my original trace.</p>
<p>I modified the script to detect when more than <span><img src="https://ch00ftech.com/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_e8eaa034768987e29c645972e4862a53.gif" alt=""></span> passed between consecutive blips and interpolate blips at the proper places by just repeating the previous value.</p>
<h3>Push Pull simulation</h3>
<p>I noticed later on that I wasn't really simulating the push-pull driver that the Hit Clip likely used. &nbsp;The digital encoding is actually more of a derivative of the output waveform rather than the waveform itself. &nbsp;In other words, a positive value doesn't guarantee that the output will be positive, but rather that it will have a positive slope. &nbsp;A larger value specifies a larger slope.</p>
<p>I modified my script to keep a running value starting from zero where the incoming value from the cartridge is added to the previous value to generate the next one. &nbsp;There was a problem of DC drift because the values don't all add up to zero. &nbsp;My first time through, I found that the largest value was 1 while the smallest value was somewhere around -50,000 which overflowed my signed 16 bit WAV output.</p>
<p>I solved this by …</p></div></div>

<p>I have been on both sides, the contributing side and the reviewing side. I've made mistakes on both. The mistakes I
regret the most are the ones I've made on the reviewing side. Some are obvious, some are not. All of them could have
made the contributor's life, whether a developer on the team, or a contributor in an open source project, much easier.</p>
<p>A critical point to make, and something that I personally do not accept as a manager or as a developer, are actions
taken on either side which are made with bad intent. So while innocent mistakes are fine, we all make them, knowingly or
not, doing bad by intent is not acceptable behavior at all. Following up on the previous point,
by making intentional mistakes, I mean following imperfect guidelines, or having a
false perception of what's important or how to convey it, in contrast with having malicious intentions with your
actions.</p>
<h2 id="insignificant-factors"><a href="#insignificant-factors" aria-label="insignificant factors permalink"></a>Insignificant factors</h2>
<p>There is a big waste of time and energy in trivial, non-significant feedback. This complies perfectly with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Parkinson's Law of Triviality</a>. People spend a disproportional amount
of time bothering with trivial details that have almost nothing to do with code semantics. From arguing about style,
function names, property names, names in general, spaces (or tabs), indentation (or lack of), braces, splitting code to
modules (or joining separate modules), extracting constants (almost religiously).</p>
<p>People also love premature optimizations (Which are known to be the
<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">root of all evil</a>). They do or suggest using LRU, sets instead of lists and
so many other factors, without any proven significant performance benefits, or that those are even needed. In general,
the program complexity seems to matter less than program correctness (or assumed correctness).</p>
<p>Why do we bother with such things?</p>
<ol>
<li>We underwent similar scrutiny when we were less experienced, and think it's great, or the correct path to becoming
better. Maybe it's simply something new trainees have to do.</li>
<li>People tend to spend less time thinking about the global effects of a change, and spend more time on the micro level.
This means reading and writing comments on a review as they process it. This prevents the reader from "Seeing the big
picture". Instead, we focus on tiny improvements, as if they were the important factor. "Improve this function's
name", "Extract this number as a constant.", all things we write that have almost no significant semantic code
impact. Why do we do them? They're easier to come up with, and they're also sometimes more obvious.</li>
<li>We didn't take the time removing any manual decisions about style from the review. Both the contributor and the
reviewer need to spend effort on reviewing style and this both wears them down, and simultaneously prevents them from
focusing on what matters. This is a key point I'll discuss later in <a href="#removing-obstacles">Removing obstacles</a>.</li>
<li>We find it hard to believe that
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/code-reviews-not-primarily-finding-bugs#code-reviews-rarely-find-functional-bugs">code reviews rarely catch bugs</a>.
Yes, it's kind of shocking, we were all taught that code reviews are an effective tool for this kind of things.
They're not. They are effective for other things, discussed later in <a href="#the-important-stuff">The important stuff</a>. The
overall theme of thinking too highly about code reviews is basically science fiction. We should be spending our
energy elsewhere.</li>
<li>It's a form of control. This is a bit sad to say, and I've been there myself. Teams tend to be overly defensive about
their code and apply harsh review to external (to the team) contributors. They also sometimes apply this to more
junior developers, partly as a training tool and partly a control tool. Software code control is mostly a virtual
dance around a code repository. The alleged last defense (besides code quality tooling and deployment) is the code
review. Teams really believe it is their job to "protect the code", whatever that means, and their belief is
reinforced when they have to wake up at night due to changes done by external team members. One can say they should
have built better protective measures, or that they also wake up at night to their own changes, but it's very easy to
fall into this "guardian" trap after the n-th time they get a pager from an external person's change.</li>
<li>A form of control, but the bad kind. A person or persons are either taking care of their job security, or making sure
you know who is the owner (boss). This is a form of territorial battle, where someone who has the last word wins and
thus receives virtual fame and confidence, at least on paper. This happens a lot more than one would think it
happens, but in the end, code is written (at least in present day) by humans, who are a talking animal, but still an
animal, with a social ladder and animal-like behavior. I've been there, it's ugly. If you're in a company that has
this kind of stuff going on a lot, I suggest you run away.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-important-stuff"><a href="#the-important-stuff" aria-label="the important stuff permalink"></a>The important stuff</h2>
<p>What should we use code-reviews for? To be perfectly honest, I'm not a big believer in pre-merge code-reviews (To be
explained later in <a href="#the-road-less-traveled">The road less traveled</a>). I've seen them weigh down development speed so
much, the added benefits might not be worth it. That said a code-review can be important when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The developer is new. Either entirely to the code-base or to coding. That developer is going to need feedback on both
how to code, how "we" code, and what's important to the team. In these regards, the code-review is being used as a
training class, and less than a device to add features. In a way, this is the asynchronous alternative to pair
programming or coding together.</li>
<li>Someone wanting to familiarize themselves with the code-base or changes made to it. That someone can be another
developer that you want to be aware of your new feature or changes, your tech lead or a senior engineer in the team.
A code-review helps them learn the inner-details of your new feature, that specific part of code that they don't
know, or just get better acquainted with the code-base. This means the code review is meant as an FYI to them, and in
most cases it shouldn't be blocking.</li>
<li>Reviewing system critical changes. Sometimes you do need or want an extra eye-ball on system critical changes.
Anything that can have a drastic effect on the system, from changing the way you run tests, to changing service
infrastructure, to super-hot code which is very performance oriented, to sensitive billing code. Those areas might be
worth the added blocking review, but I also assume those areas are less frequently edited.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a side, a lesser known point is that sometimes code-review are required as part of regulation policy the company is
complying with, such as SOC2. This makes code-reviewing changes required, though it doesn't make the insignificant
factors significant all of a sudden, so don't let that get in the way.</p>
<h2 id="removing-obstacles"><a href="#removing-obstacles" aria-label="removing obstacles permalink"></a>Removing obstacles</h2>
<p>As obvious as it may sound, you should be investing as much as you can in automating anything that can be automated in
code-reviews. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code formatting should be done automatically when developing and checked automatically on code-reviews. Not by a
human.</li>
<li>Automatic code linting (and any static analysis applied) should represent most of your style guide. In fact, I would
go further and say that if you can't build an automatic rule to at least warn about a style violation, you shouldn't
bring it up in code-reviews, ever. It's just not worth it. (This lesson I learned from a very smart friend who
enlightened me on this).</li>
<li>Testing, and quality assurance should both ease the pains for contributors, and increase confidence for maintainers.
If they don't - you should either delete or fix them. I've worked on code-bases where the tests would just slow down
the developer, never actually giving valid input. What are they useful besides wasting our time (or making it harder
to contribute)? Adding useful tests improves development speed and confidence, not slow it down. It also lowers the
blast radius, making errors less deadly in production (By allowing less brutal errors to pass through,
unintentionally).</li>
<li>Extending the previous points, I would go further and argue that any non-semantic review comments should be kept to a
minimum, preferably non-existent. Contributors should feel safe contributing, and know that even if they poorly named
their variable, everything is going to be ok, assuming their code still works. This can also be fixed in retrospect
(supporting post-merge workflows), as it has no semantic difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite all the above, it is in my experience that developers find it very hard to let go of old practices. I know I
did. Once you understand the enormous negative side-benefits of focusing on the trivial stuff, you understand they are
waste of time and energy. To all sides.</p>
<p>A question I get asked sometimes is why should you allow bad code practices to slip through to your code, especially if
you're the owner of it, and a contributor is just passing through. My answer is simple.
You want the code review to be effective and focus <strong>only on what's important</strong>. Critical stuff you
might have missed. Everything else is a distraction meant to make the code prettier, but probably not better.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about code style add a linter. Add static rules that prevent adding this bad change. Better yet,
prefer automatic fixing of code style (when possible). Style should be a solved problem,
and I don't care what style it is - as long as I don't have to actively think about it
when contributing (or reviewing).</p>
<p>A thought that I always try to propagate is to treat others (contributors) as a reviewer the same as you would like to
be treated when contributing.</p>
<h2 id="harmful-stuff"><a href="#harmful-stuff" aria-label="harmful stuff permalink"></a>Harmful stuff</h2>
<p>Review comments have a style of their own. A lot has been written on reviewer hostility, and I'd like to assume you
understand how comments should be styled.</p>

The following are benefits I've identified so far.</p><h3 id="heading-it-lessens-the-need-for-a-client-to-process-the-response">It lessens the need for a client to process the response<a href="#heading-it-lessens-the-need-for-a-client-to-process-the-response"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>In most situations, we have a client to request the data from the GraphQL server and transform it into the required format.</p><p>For instance, a website on the client-side can process the data with JavaScript, as to transform fields <code>title</code> and <code>date</code> into a description:</p><pre><code><span><span>const</span> desc <span>=</span> <span><span>`Post </span><span><span>${</span> response<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>title <span>}</span></span><span> was published on </span><span><span>${</span> response<span>.</span>data<span>.</span>date <span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span></span></code></pre><p>However, in some situations we may need to retrieve the data for a service that we do not control, and which does not offer tools to process the results.</p><p>For instance, a newsletter service (such as Mailchimp) may accept to define an endpoint from which to retrieve the data for the newsletter. Whatever data is returned by the endpoint is final; it can't be manipulated before being injected into the newsletter.</p><p>In these situtations, the query could use embeddable fields to manipulate the response into the required format. This could be particularly useful when accessing <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http">GraphQL over HTTP</a>.</p><h3 id="heading-it-can-help-declutter-the-schema">It can help declutter the schema<a href="#heading-it-can-help-declutter-the-schema"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>The use case above could also be satisfied by adding an extra field <code>Post.descriptionForNewsletter</code> to the schema. But this solution clutters the schema, and embeddable fields could be considered a more elegant solution.</p><h3 id="heading-it-improves-the-development-experience">It improves the development experience<a href="#heading-it-improves-the-development-experience"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Embeddable fields could be compared to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_arrow_function.asp">arrow functions</a> in JavaScript, which is syntactic sugar over a feature already available in the language.</p><p>Arrow functions are not really needed, but they provide benefits:</p><ul><li>they shorten the amount of code needed to achieve something</li><li>they simplify the syntax</li></ul><p>As such, the feature becomes a welcome-to-have in the language, producing a better development experience.</p><h3 id="heading-the-if-condition-in-@skip-and-@include-can-become-dynamic">The <code>if</code> condition in <code>@skip</code> and <code>@include</code> can become dynamic<a href="#heading-the-if-condition-in-@skip-and-@include-can-become-dynamic"><span> permalink</span></a></h3><p>Currently, argument <code>"if"</code> for the <code>@skip</code> and <code>@include</code> directives can only be an actual boolean value (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) or a variable with the boolean value. This behavior is pretty static.</p><p>Embeddable fields would enable to make this behavior more dynamic, by evaluating the condition on some property from the object itself.</p><p>There is an issue to address: <code>if</code> is a <code>Boolean</code>, not a <code>String</code>, so to avoid type conflicts the GraphQL syntax may also need to accept the embedded field on its own, not wrapping it between string quotes:</p><pre><code><span><span>query</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  posts <span>{</span></span><br><span>	  id</span><br><span>    title

<span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Removing the need to wrap <code>{{ }}</code> between quotes <code>" "</code> would solve this issue for every scalar type other than <code>String</code>, not just <code>Boolean</code> (check the example below with <code>droid</code>, using embeddable fields to resolve an <code>ID</code>).</p><h3

combined with the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/174">flat chain syntax</a> and <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/252">nested mutations</a> (two other

      <article role="main">
        <p>This is going to be a painfully cliched, but imagine that the American science and technology system is an engine. It’s just not performing as well as it used to. It’s making a lot of noise and when we push the accelerator it’s sluggish. This bill assumes the solution is STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR HARDER. That is, it wants to slam more money through a system shot through with friction and bad incentives. Slamming on the accelerator when your engine has problems doesn’t often fix the problem. I’ve tried it, and it ended up with my car ‘<a href="https://www.cartalk.com/content/what-does-it-mean-throw-rod#:~:text=The%20motion%20of%20that%20piston,one%20of%20two%20things%20occurs.">throwing a rod</a>.’</p>

<p>Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.), Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Congressman Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), and Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) introduced “The Endless Frontier Act” a bipartisan bill to spend $100B to super-charge the National Science Foundation at the end of May. You can read an official announcement <a href="https://www.young.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/young-schumer-unveil-endless-frontier-act-to-bolster-us-tech-leadership-and-combat-china">here</a> and Noah Smith’s summary on Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-01/the-u-s-gets-serious-about-catching-up-to-china-in-r-d">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some thoughts after reading through the actual text of the bill. (My eyes will bleed so yours don’t need to.)</p>

<p>This bill is proposing to give money with risk-averse restrictions to a risk-averse organization (the NSF) to be dispersed among other risk-averse organizations (Universities) into a system with increasingly risk-averse incentives.  Note that I’m not saying “it’s all fubar’d lets burn it to the ground!” but I am suggesting that instead of slamming on the accelerator, we should be asking “what would a tune-up and an oil change look like instead? “</p>

<h3 id="the-bill">The Bill</h3>
<p>The bill comes back to its  <code>Key Technology Focus Areas</code> throughout the document:</p>

<p>(i) artificial intelligence and machine learning;
(ii) high performance computing, semiconductors, and advanced computer hardware
(iii) quantum computing and information systems
(iv) robotics, automation, and advanced manufacturing
(v) natural or anthropogenic disaster prevention
(vi) advanced communications technology
(vii) biotechnology, genomics, and synthetic biology
(viii) cybersecurity, data storage, and data management technologies;
(ix) advanced energy
(x) materials science, engineering, and exploration relevant to the other key technology focus areas described in this subparagraph.</p>

<p>That list is pretty uncontroversial.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> And that should raise a flag. In other words, this is a list of “what are the top 10 hot technologies right now?” What if there is suddenly a huge opportunity in airship technology? Or underground construction? Or wormholes? It wouldn’t be too much of a problem but this list can only be changed <em>every four years</em>.  You could make the argument that these definitions are so broad that anything could fit in them - ok, then what’s the point of having the list in the first place?</p>

<p>The bill is heavy on bureaucratic requirements and light on science or organizational structure (“we’ll figure that out later.”)  Which reports need to be given to whom and when, how money can and can’t be spent, etc. I agree that this is the job of lawmakers, but it doesn’t feel like opening up an endless frontier, it feels like “here are the walls of your sandbox.”</p>

<p>We are very clear that the grant awards are going to happen on a competitive basis. The bill is shot through with the term <code>award grants, on a competitive basis</code> . This is code for “to get this money, amazing scientist, are going to need to spend a good chunk of your life writing grants” and interacting with websites that look like <a href="https://www.research.gov/research-web/">this.</a> or <a href="https://www.grants.gov/">this</a>.  Competition is good <em>when the output is valuable no matter who wins.</em> Failed grants are basically worthless except as the basis for other grant applications. Economist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=XwBP_pqkGJA">Mike Munger does a great job explaining how grants can often end up burning more value than they create</a>.  Months of grant writing is one of the things that makes people think twice about academia.</p>

<p>The bill specifies exactly what the money can be used for <code>may be used for the purchase of equipment, the support of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and the salaries of staff. </code> Like the key areas, this sounds eminently reasonable. However, it means that grant money, unlike normal money, is not fully fungible. You need to track all of it and where it goes in case you are audited. It also means that if the project runs into an expense that doesn’t fall into one of these buckets - say you need a specialized service from a company to do an experiment - you’re stuck. Chilling effects are hard to measure, but my research experience has been shot through with being forced to pay more for an inferior product through a web portal that made your eyes bleed because we had to prioritize “approved vendors” for accounting reasons tied to restrictions like these.</p>

<p>I don’t think it matters for this discussion but <code>$20B/year</code> is misleading - the actual bill specifies that the $100B will be backloaded: $2B in 2021, $8B in 2022, $20B in 2023, and $35B in 2024 and 2025.</p>

<h3 id="nstf">NS(T?)F</h3>
<p><code>“I share your feeling about this point,” I said with the fervor of conviction, “but then why not do something about the retardation of scientific progress?”</code></p>

<p><code>“That I would very much like to do,” Mark Gable said, “but how do I go about it?”</code></p>

<p><code>“Well,” I said, “I think that shouldn’t be very difficult. As a matter of fact, I think it would be quite easy. You could set up a foundation, with an annual endowment of thirty million dollars. Research workers in need of funds could apply for grants, if they could make out a convincing case. Have ten committees, each composed of twelve scientists, appointed to pass on these applications. Take the most active scientists out of the laboratory and make them members of these committees. And the very best men in the field should be appointed as chairmen at salaries of fifty thousand dollars each. Also have about twenty prizes of one hundred thousand dollars each for the best scientific papers of the year. This is just about all you would have to do. Your lawyers could easily prepare a charter for the foundation. As a matter of fact, any of the National Science Foundation bills which were introduced in the Seventy-ninth and Eightieth Congresses could perfectly well serve as a model.”</code></p>

<p><code>“I think you had better explain to Mr. Gable why this foundation would in fact retard the progress of science,” said a bespectacled young man sitting at the far end of the table, whose name I didn’t get at the time of introduction. It should be obvious,” I said. “First of all, the best scientists would be removed from their laboratories and kept busy on committees passing on applications for funds. Secondly, the scientific workers in need of funds would concentrate on problems which were considered promising and were pretty certain to lead to publishable results. For a few years there might be a great increase in scientific output; but by going after the obvious, pretty soon science would dry out. Science would become something like a parlor game. Some things would be considered interesting, others not. There would be fashions. Those who followed the fashion would get grants. Those who wouldn’t would not, and pretty soon they would learn to follow the fashion, too.”</code>
From <a href="https://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/619829573132107776/a-short-story-by-martian-physicist-le%C3%B3-szil%C3%A1rd">The Marla Gable Foundation</a> by Nobel Prize winning Physicist Leo Szilard, published in 1948.</p>

<p>The core idea of the bill is to increase the National Science Foundation’s funding and expand its mandate to include technology development as well as science.</p>

<p>Roughly, the National Science Foundation - NSF (and the NIH) decide what to work on by getting some of the ‘top people’ in a field together in a room and asking them “what programs should we pursue?” This process depends first on being able to identify the top people in a field and convincing them to stay in a shitty hotel in Washington. So the agenda is being set by ‘the top people in a field who are willing to come to Washington and stay in a shitty hotel.’ Additionally, who entails the ‘top people’ is up to the program officers and since professors have long term relationships with their NSF program officers, chances are that the professors who have put the work into those relationships are going to be the most salient.</p>

<p>All the incentives are set up so people probably push for their lines of research. Even if they are being completely intellectually honest, researchers probably think that their area of research is the most important thing to fund. If they are slightly less intellectually honest, they realize that they’re more likely to be funded if their priorities line up with the NSF’s.</p>

<p>The process is inherently conservative because if you’re consulting the top people in a field on what to fund, the chances they’ll suggest the weird new thing are low.</p>

<h4 id="but-will-be-like-darpa">But will be like DARPA!</h4>

<p>DARPA has a great track record of enabling paradigm shifting technology - it had its fingers in the creation of personal computing, the internet, modern robotics, gps, and autonomous cars, to name a few. Riffing on DARPA’s model to emulate its success is a worthy goal. However, there is only one section in the entire bill that gives a head nod to the DARPA model:</p>

<p><code>The Director shall have the authority to carry out a program of personnel management authority for the Directorate in the same manner, and subject to the same requirements, as the program of personnel management authority authorized for the Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under section 1599h of title 10, United States Code, for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</code>
<code>(B) PROGRAM MANAGERS.—The employees of the Directorate may include program managers for the key technology focus areas, who shall perform a role similar to programs managers employed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for the oversight and selection of programs supported by the Directorate. </code></p>

<p>DARPA’s program managers work because they are embedded in an organizational structure and culture that is tuned to empower them to explore high-risk opportunities. DARPA has ~125 staff and three layers of hierarchy while the NSF …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

After 10 months of effort within the open-source community, Chaos Mesh is now ready in terms of functionality, scalability, and ease of use. Here are some highlights.</p><h2>Powerful chaos support</h2><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> originated in the testing framework of <a href="https://pingcap.com/products/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, a distributed database, so it takes into account the possible faults of a distributed system. Chaos Mesh provides comprehensive and fine-grained fault types, covering the Pod, the network, system I/O, and the kernel. Chaos experiments are defined in YAML, which is fast and easy to use.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 supports the following fault types:</p><ul><li>clock-skew: Simulates clock skew</li><li>container-kill: Simulates the container being killed</li><li>cpu-burn: Simulates CPU pressure</li><li>io-attribution-override: Simulates file exceptions</li><li>io-fault: Simulates file system I/O errors</li><li>io-latency: Simulates file system I/O latency</li><li>kernel-injection: Simulates kernel failures</li><li>memory-burn: Simulates memory pressure</li><li>network-corrupt: Simulates network packet corruption</li><li>network-duplication: Simulates network packet duplication</li><li>network-latency: Simulate network latency</li><li>network-loss: Simulates network loss</li><li>network-partition: Simulates network partition</li><li>pod-failure: Simulates continuous unavailability of Kubernetes Pods</li><li>pod-kill: Simulates the Kubernetes Pod being killed</li></ul><h2>Visual chaos orchestration</h2><p>The Chaos Dashboard component is a one-stop web interface for Chaos Mesh users to orchestrate chaos experiments. Previously, Chaos Dashboard was only available for testing TiDB. With Chaos Mesh 1.0, it is available to everyone. Chaos Dashboard greatly simplifies the complexity of chaos experiments. With only a few mouse clicks, you can define the scope of the chaos experiment, specify the type of chaos injection, define scheduling rules, and observe the results of the chaos experiment—all in the same web interface.</p><p><img alt="Chaos Dashboard" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-0a1e48c54968d276f174801a1364ce21.gif"></p><h2>Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability</h2><p>To further improve the observability of chaos experiments, Chaos Mesh 1.0 includes a Grafana plug-in to allow you to directly display real-time chaos experiment information on your application monitoring panel. Currently, the chaos experiment information is displayed as annotations. This way, you can simultaneously observe the running status of the application and the current chaos experiment information.</p><p><img alt="Chaos status and application status on Grafana" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-status-460b054f3e2ee0898d2236a5137bc30e.png"></p><h2>Safe and controllable chaos</h2><p>When we conduct chaos experiments, it is vital that we keep strict control over the chaos scope or “blast radius.” Chaos Mesh 1.0 not only provides a wealth of selectors to accurately control the scope of the experiment, but it also enables you to set protected Namespaces to protect important applications. You can also use Namespace permissions to limit the scope of Chaos Mesh to a specific Namespace. Together, these features make chaos experiments with Chaos Mesh safe and controllable.</p><h2>Try it out now</h2><p>You can quickly deploy Chaos Mesh in your Kubernetes environment through the <code>install.sh</code> script or the Helm tool. For specific installation steps, please refer to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/installation/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh Getting Started</a> document. In addition, thanks to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/interactiveTutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katakoda interactive tutorial</a>, you can also quickly get your hands on Chaos Mesh without having to deploy it.</p><p>If you haven’t upgraded to 1.0 GA, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0 Release Notes</a> for the changes and upgrade guidelines.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thanks to all our Chaos Mesh <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributors</a>!</p><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh, you’re welcome to join us by submitting issues, or contributing code, documentation, or articles. We look forward to your participation and feedback!</p></section></div>]]>

      <p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/rIQHws2_lQg">recent lang team meeting</a> we discussed
the upcoming
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-core/0.3.5/futures_core/stream/trait.Stream.html"><code>Stream</code></a>
RFC. We covered both the steps required to land it, and the steps we'd want
to take after that. One of the things we'd want eventually for streams is:
"async iteration syntax". Just like <code>for x in y</code> works for <code>Iterator</code>, we'd
want something similar to work for <code>Stream</code>. For example JavaScript support
both
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of">sync</a>
and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of">async</a>
iteration through <code>for..of</code> loops:</p>
<pre><span>// sync
</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>num </span><span>of </span><span>iter</span><span>) {
  console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>);
}

</span><span>// async
</span><span>for await </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>event </span><span>of </span><span>emitter</span><span>) {
    console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>);
}
</span></pre>
<p>However when talking about async iteration syntax in Rust one question has
come up repeatedly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should async iteration be parallel or sequential by default?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post I'd like to cover the challenges I see with parallel async
iteration, and make the case for, spoilers, defaulting to sequential
iteration semantics.</p>
<hr>
<p>However before we continue, the usual disclaimers: <strong>I'm not on the lang
team. I do not hold any direct decision making power about the Rust language.
I am a member of the Async Foundations WG, but I do not speak for anyone on
the team other than myself.</strong> This post is from my perspective only.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-space">The problem space</h2>
<p>So the core question we're trying to answer is: "should async iteration
default to sequential or parallel?" Putting this into code, it's a question
of what some hypothetical future "async iteration" syntax should compile down
to, and which semantics are provided:</p>
<pre><span>// This code...
</span><span>for</span><span> event.await in channel {
    dbg!(event);
}

</span><span>// ... should it lower into this? (sequential)
</span><span>while let </span><span>Some(event) = channel.</span><span>next</span><span>().await {
    dbg!(event);
}

</span><span>// ... or should it lower into this? (parallel)
</span><span>channel.</span><span>into_par_stream</span><span>().</span><span>for_each</span><span>(async |event| dbg!(event));
</span></pre>
<p>The "lowering" we're describing here is not the <em>precise</em> code we'd expect
the compiler to output. But hopefully it gets the point across. In the
"sequential" case we'd expect async iteration loops to behave much the same
as async <code>while let Some()</code> loops do today. And in the parallel case, we'd
expect something to work with semantics similar to those of
<a href="https://docs.rs/parallel-stream/2.1.1/parallel_stream/">parallel-stream</a>.</p>
<p>The main argument I've heard in favor of parallel async iteration semantics
is that in most cases it's what people want anyway. For example take the
following code:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>async_std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::prelude::*;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> stream.await? in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>() {
    io::copy(&amp;stream, &amp;stream).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Under sequential iteration semantics this loop would process at most 1 TCP
connection at the time, irregardless of system resources available. But under
parallel iteration semantics, this will have access to all resources
available. The idea is that parallel iteration semantics provide a language
level solution to this problem.</p>
<h2 id="control-flow-operators">Control flow operators</h2>
<p>The first issue that arises with parallel async iteration is that the <code>break</code>
and <code>continue</code> control flow operators will have different semantics, or need
to be disallowed altogether. Take the following code:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>async_std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>async_std::prelude::*;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>// Let's pretend this is valid syntax..
</span><span>for </span><span>(i, stream?).await in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>().</span><span>enumerate</span><span>() {
    </span><span>if</span><span> i === </span><span>1000 </span><span>{
        </span><span>break</span><span>;
    }
    io::copy(&amp;stream, &amp;stream).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Say we have a few dozen parallel requests open when we hit <code>break</code>. We should
probably stop accepting new requests. What should happen to the still open
connections?</p>
<p>There is no right answer. We may want to drop them. We may want to keep them
running. More likely the desired behavior may depend on what you're doing.
But the semantics will <em>always</em> be different than in regular for loops
<em>because</em> of parallelism.</p>
<p>Adding new semantics to a well-established concept is tricky, and may
actually lead to subtle translation issues when converting existing
algorithms to async Rust. The safest option will be to disallow these
keywords in this context altogether.</p>
<h2 id="consistency-with-non-async-rust">Consistency with non-async Rust</h2>
<p>We may want to think of "parallel iteration semantics" as something unique to
async Rust, but in fact non-async Rust faces very similar challenges. To
give a very literal example, the TCP example we used earlier would not be
parallelized in non-async Rust as well:</p>
<pre><span>use </span><span>std::io;
</span><span>use </span><span>std::net::TcpListener;

</span><span>let</span><span> listener = TcpListener::bind("</span><span>127.0.0.1:8080</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> stream in listener.</span><span>incoming</span><span>() {
    </span><span>let</span><span> stream = stream?;
    </span><span>let </span><span>(reader, writer) = &amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>(&amp;stream, &amp;stream);
    io::copy(reader, writer)?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>Networking in non-async Rust is not the best match, but for example a data
processing pipeline would be. And if we forget to parallelize at the right
points there, we'll face very similar issues.</p>
<p>The point being: I don't think "parallelism" is a problem unique to async
Rust. And because of that I don't think we should look for a solution that's
specific to async Rust, but instead look for a solution that can be applied
across domains. I think <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2930">RFC
2930 (<code>buf_read</code>)</a> is a great example of an
issue that was found in async Rust, but was determined to apply to non-async
Rust as well, and for which a solution was found that can be applied to both
domains.</p>
<h2 id="how-would-tasks-be-spawned">How would tasks be spawned?</h2>
<p>In order for tasks to be parallelized, they would need to be spawned on a
thread pool somehow. Which means a crucial step in enabling parallel
iteration at the language level is to have a notion of an executor as part of
the language.</p>
<p>C++ is <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0761r2.pdf">in the process of
adding</a>
to the language (estimate is C++23), so it's not unthinkable for Rust to do
the same. In fact Boats <a href="https://without.boats/blog/global-executors/">has written about adding a <code>#[global_executor]</code>
before</a>.</p>
<pre><span>// The lowered code from the previous example...
</span><span>channel.</span><span>into_par_stream</span><span>().</span><span>for_each</span><span>(async |event| dbg!(event));

</span><span>// ... would in turn lower into this
</span><span>while let </span><span>Some(event) = channel.</span><span>next</span><span>() {
    task::spawn(async </span><span>move </span><span>{
        dbg!(event);
    });
}
</span></pre>
<p>As you can see we're calling <code>task::spawn</code> for each event. That functionality
would need to come from somewhere, and because async iteration is a language
level concern this would mean that functionality would need to become part of
the language.</p>
<p>I think having a way to perform parallel iteration at the language level is a
<em>great</em> idea. And having a <code>#[global_executor]</code> hook with a default
implementation would solve a lot of issues the ecosystem currently has.</p>
<p>But if history is any indicator this would all take quite a while to shake
out. And I think making async iteration syntax depend on this landing (even
if unstable) would mean it might take a lot longer.</p>
<h2 id="parallelizing-send-streams">Parallelizing !Send streams</h2>
<p>Not all streams are <code>Send</code>, and async iteration should be able to work with
this as well. We can't <em>quite</em> propagate <code>!Send</code> the way we do for async
blocks; the global executor would need to support spawning <code>!Send</code> futures as
well. This is not a major hurdle as for example async-stc provides
<a href="https://docs.rs/async-std/1.6.3/async_std/task/fn.spawn_local.html"><code>spawn_local</code></a>
function. But it's part of the design space to consider.</p>
<h2 id="backpressure-concurency-control">Backpressure &amp; concurency control</h2>
<p>For all its warts something that Node.js streams got right was
<em>backpressure</em>. If for example writing to a file is slower than reading from
a file, the pipeline won't keep reading data if the writer isn't available.
This ensures your RAM doesn't fill up with bytes that are waiting to be written.</p>
<pre><span>const </span><span>fs = </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>fs</span><span>');

</span><span>const </span><span>reader </span><span>= fs.</span><span>createReadStream</span><span>('</span><span>file.txt</span><span>');
</span><span>const </span><span>compress </span><span>= zlib.</span><span>createGzip</span><span>();
</span><span>const </span><span>writer </span><span>= fs.</span><span>createWriteStream</span><span>('</span><span>file.txt.gz</span><span>');

</span><span>reader</span><span>.</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>compress</span><span>).</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>writer</span><span>);
</span></pre>
<p>In Rust sequential async iteration applies backpressure by default. A
translation of the above Node.js code would be somewhat like this:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> reader = fs::open("</span><span>file.txt</span><span>").await?;
</span><span>let</span><span> writer = fs::open("</span><span>file.txt.gz</span><span>").await?;

</span><span>for</span><span> buf in GzipEncoder::new(reader) {
    writer.</span><span>write</span><span>(buf).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/async-compression/0.3.5/async_compression/stream/struct.GzipEncoder.html#impl-Stream"><code>async-compression</code>'s <code>Stream</code>
types</a>
already work somewhat like this. Because we're performing sequential async
iteration here, reading data from the stream is constrained by the speed at
which we can write. But also vice-versa: the stream is paused if no new data
is available to be read.</p>
<p>If async iteration syntax was parallel by default we would lose backpressure
by default. Which means if no constraints are specified, <strong>by default
parallel async iteration will keep reading data even if there is no consumer
ready to process the data</strong>. Instead limits will always need to be manually
set:</p>
<pre><span>for</span><span> buf in GzipEncoder::new(reader).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>) {
    writer.</span><span>write</span><span>(buf).await?;
}
</span></pre>
<p>There is a third solution to backpressure we haven't discussed yet: set
<em>some</em> limit by default. Instead of async iteration having unbounded
parallelism by default, we could say, enable <code>1000</code> items by default. This
limit will however almost always be wrong, and really should be set with
knowledge of the workload.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>max throughput</th><th>backpressure?</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>sequential</td><td>1</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>bounded</td><td>n</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>unbounded</td><td>unlimited</td><td>no</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2 id="how-common-is-parallel-iteration">How common is parallel iteration?</h2>
<p>A large part of the argument in favor of parallel semantics by default for
async iteration is that it is the most commonly desired semantics. Perhaps
that may be true today within certain domains; but how true do we expect that
to be in the future for across all domains async Rust will cover?</p>
<p>If we want to get a sense of where async Rust might be headed we can take a
look at Node.js streams: they've been around for a decade longer than Rust
streams have. A common kind of stream in the Node.js ecosystem is the
<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_transform">transform
stream</a>: a
stream that takes an input stream and produces an output stream. Take for
example the <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/csv-parser">csv-parser package</a>: it
takes a stream of CSV text, and produces an output stream of parsed elements:</p>
<pre><span>NAME,AGE
Daffy Duck,24
Bugs Bunny,22
</span></pre><pre><span>const </span><span>csv </span><span>= </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>csv-parser</span><span>')
</span><span>const </span><span>fs = </span><span>require</span><span>('</span><span>fs</span><span>')
</span><span>const </span><span>results </span><span>= [];

fs.</span><span>createReadStream</span><span>('</span><span>data.csv</span><span>')
  .</span><span>pipe</span><span>(</span><span>csv</span><span>())
  .</span><span>on</span><span>('</span><span>data</span><span>', (data) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>))
  .</span><span>on</span><span>('</span><span>end</span><span>', () </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>{
    console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>);
    </span><span>// [
    //   { NAME: 'Daffy Duck', AGE: '24' },
    //   { NAME: 'Bugs Bunny', AGE: '22' }
    // ]
  </span><span>});

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!

In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond

The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

September 26, 2020 | https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-26-arch-linux-setup-with-disk-encryption.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-26-arch-linux-setup-with-disk-encryption.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been using Arch Linux since 2016. I got to understand the system better
since then, and installing Arch nowadays is rather a strain on my fingers than
on my brain. I automated my personal setup procedure to some extent with a
couple of shell scripts, which I'm adjusting as time goes and hardware changes.
I collect those scripts and setup instructions in a <a href="https://github.com/patrickbucher/docs/tree/master/arch-setup">GitHub
repo</a>.</p>
<p>Even though I've often taken my laptop with me, especially for
university, I never made the effort to encrypt my disk or a single partition
thereon. Sensitive data, such as passwords, are stored encrypted using GPG. And
my GPG private key is protected with a strong passphrase; so strong, that I
mistype it once in a while.</p>
<p>Having stored SSH keys on my laptop, however, is a risk in terms of data
protection. I do not protect most of my SSH keys with passwords. (<em>Not</em> having
to use passwords is one of the conveniences SSH gives you, after all.) But some
of those SSH keys are gateways to quite some important data, and therefore I
need to re-consider my security practices.</p>
<p>Protecting SSH keys with a passphrase is very inconvenient, especially if you do
a lot of <code>git push</code> operations via SSH. It's possible to use a password
protected SSH key for <code>git</code> only, but having to deal with multiple SSH keys is
inconvenient, too. (My rule is to use one SSH key per client machine.) So
encrypting the hard disk or at least some partitions of it might be the better
solution, because it only requires me to enter an additional password once
during startup, which is once or twice a day.</p>

<p>The Arch wiki provides an article on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system">how to encrypt an entire
system</a>.
Such a setup is based on LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup), a disk encryption
specification, and dm-crypt, the Linux kernel's device mapper for encrypted
devices.</p>
<p>The wiki mentions different
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Overview">scenarios</a>
for disk encryption. The first option, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LUKS_on_a_partition">LUKS on a
partition</a>,
is very simple, but not ideal for me, because I'm not just using one giant root
partition, but separate partitions for <code>/var</code>, <code>/tmp</code> and <code>/home</code>. With this
setup, a process filling up my <code>/var/log</code> directory won't prevent me from
writing to <code>/home</code> or the root partition, which might be necessary to deal with
the issue.</p>
<p>One could argue that it's sufficient to just encrypt the <code>/home</code> partition,
which contains the most sensitive data, after all. However, it's possible that
some program logs sensitive data to <code>/var/log</code> or stores it under <code>/opt</code>, so
that an encrypted <code>/home</code> partition won't prevent sensitive data from being
leaked. An unencrypted root partition also makes it possible to tamper
programs, so that data is leaked later.</p>
<p>It's also possible to encrypt the partitions mentioned seperately, which would
require me to enter my password upon booting for every single partition. This is
highly impractical, and therefore I won't do it that way.</p>
<p>The second option, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS">LVM on
LUKS</a>,
is a better fit for my purpose. Here, LUKS provides one single block device, on
top of which the encrypted partitions are created. The other, arguably more
sophisticated scenarios, are mostly useful when dealing with multiple disks, or
if an encrypted boot partition is required. So let's stick to scenario two: LVM
on LUKS.</p>

<p>My Lenovo Thinkpad X1 has a SSD with roughly 475 GB and 16 GB memory. This is
important when considering partition sizes. I usually create my partitions as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 256 MB <code>/boot</code> partition for the bootloader (FAT 32).</li>
<li>A 16 GB (the size of my memory) swap partition.</li>
<li>A 128 GB <code>/</code> (root) partition (ext4).</li>
<li>A 64 GB <code>/var</code> partition (ext4).</li>
<li>A 8 GB <code>/tmp</code> partition (ext4).</li>
<li>And a <code>/home</code> partition with the remainder of the space, i.e. roughly 260 GB
   in my case (ext4).</li>
</ol>
<p>The choice of partition sizes is subject to debate. Some prefer to have a swap
partition with twice the size of the physical memory. Some prefer to make the
root, <code>/var/</code>, and <code>/tmp</code> partitions smaller or bigger. But the above
partitioning scheme was never the cause of any trouble for me, so far.</p>
<p>With those decisions taken, let's proceed to the setup.</p>

<p>So let's go through the setup step by step.</p>
<h2>Prepare the Installation Medium</h2>
<p>First, I download the latest Arch amd64 image via BitTorrent <a href="magnet:?xt=urn:btih:db56a13a6555179990837759ca27274d0be49aca&amp;dn=archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso">Magnet
link</a>
from the <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/">download</a> page and verify its
checksum against the one on the website:</p>
<pre><code>$ sha1sum archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso
95ebacd83098b190e8f30cc28d8c57af0d0088a0
</code></pre>
<p>Then I copy the image on a USB dongle with a capacity of at least 700 MB:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dd if=archlinux-2020.09.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M
$ sync
</code></pre>
<p>Then I unplug my USB dongle and plug it into the Thinkpad X1 I'd like to setup,
and boot from it (UEFI boot). Once the installation environment is loaded, let's
continue with the setup.</p>
<p>My Thinkpad X1 has a US keyboard, which I <a href="https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2020-09-16-compose-key-on-x.html">prefer to
use</a> nowadays.
However, it's possible to change the keyboard layout as follows (for Swiss
German), if wanted:</p>
<pre><code># loadkeys de_CH-latin1
</code></pre>
<p>Next, I establish a WiFi connection with <code>frzbxpdb5</code> being my network SSID, 
<code>wlan0</code> being my WiFi device, and <code>[topsecret]</code> being my password:</p>
<pre><code># iwctl --passphrase '[topsecret]' station wlan0 connect frzbxpdb5
</code></pre>
<p>Let's continue with the partitioning of the disk.</p>
<h2>Partitioning</h2>
<p>In order to partition the hard disk, one first needs to know the device name,
which can be found using <code>lsblk</code>:</p>
<pre><code># lsblk
</code></pre>
<p>This lists <code>sda</code>, the USB dongle, and <code>nvme0n1</code>, the 475 GB solid state drive
aforementioned.</p>
<h3>Filling the Disk with Junk Data</h3>
<p>As a first step, the disk shall be overwritten with random data.  Even though I
haven't used this laptop productively yet, and so there's no sensitive data
stored on it, it is still a good practice to fill it up once with random data.
This makes it harder for an attacker to distinguish between encrypted data and
random junk.</p>
<pre><code># shred --random-source=/dev/urandom --iterations=1 /dev/nvme0n1
</code></pre>
<p>In my case, using only one single iteration is sufficient. If there was actual
data stored on the disk, multiple iterations should be considered.</p>
<h3>Creating a Boot Partition</h3>
<p>Next, I create a new GPT partition scheme on that disk:</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mklabel gpt
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not going to encrypt my boot partition, so I create it as I do for a regular
setup without encryption (as a FAT 32 boot partition, that is):</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart boot fat32 1MiB 257MiB
# parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 set 1 esp on
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
</code></pre>
<p>I leave a gap of 1 MB at the beginning, so no matter what block size my SSD
uses, the boot partition will always be properly aligned. The <code>esp</code> flag
identifies the partition as a UEFI system partition.</p>
<h3>Creating a Partition for Encryption</h3>
<p>Now comes the crucial part. All the encrypted data is put into a single big
partition (<code>nvmen1p2</code>), taking up all of the remaining disk space, which is then
partitioned using a volume manager:</p>
<pre><code># parted -s /dev/nvme0n1 mkpart cryptlvm 257MiB '100%'
</code></pre>
<p>The encryption is set up on this partition:</p>
<pre><code># cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p2
</code></pre>
<p>Enter "YES" if asked for confirmation, and pick a strong passphrase to be
entered twice. (At this point, remember exactly which keyboard layout you're
on!).</p>
<p>To further work with the encrypted partition, let's open it, which requires to
enter the password chosen before:</p>
<pre><code># cryptsestup open /dev/nvme0n1p2 cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>Now a physical volume for the volume mapping needs to be created:</p>
<pre><code># pvcreate /dev/mapper/cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>The partitions are going to be managed in a volume group, which I simply call
<code>volgrp</code> for the sake of brevity:</p>
<pre><code># vgcreate volgrp /dev/mapper/cryptlvm
</code></pre>
<p>Now everything is set up to create the remaining, i.e. the encrypted partitions.</p>
<h3>Creating the Remaining Partitions</h3>
<p>Those are created using <code>lvcreate</code> by setting a size (<code>-L</code>/<code>-l</code> parameter) and a
name (<code>-n</code> parameter):</p>
<pre><code># lvcreate -L 16G volgrp -n swap
# lvcreate -L 128G volgrp -n root
# lvcreate -L 64G volgrp -n var
# lvcreate -L 8G volgrp -n tmp
# lvcreate -l '100%FREE' volgrp -n home
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As the user <em>fra-san</em> <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/611421/arch-linux-setup-with-encryption-lvm-on-luks">pointed
out</a>
in a comment on StackExchange, leaving some space open rather than using <code>-l
'100%FREE'</code> for the <code>/home</code> partition is useful when partition sizes should be
increased later.  Shrinking partitions requires to unmount them, whereas growing
them can happen with the affected partition still being mounted. (Check out
<code>lvresize</code> for details.)</p>
<p>The partitions are going to be formatted using the <code>swap</code> and <code>ext4</code> format,
respectively:</p>
<pre><code># mkswap /dev/volgrp/swap
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/root
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/var
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/tmp
# mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/volgrp/home
</code></pre>
<p>For the actual setup, those partitions (and the <code>/boot</code> partition created
before) need to be mounted to <code>/mnt</code>:</p>
<pre><code># mount /dev/volgrp/root /mnt

# mkdir /mnt/boot
# mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot

# swapon /dev/volgrp/swap

# mkdir /mnt/var
# mount /dev/volgrp/var /mnt/var

# mkdir /mnt/tmp
# mount /dev/volgrp/tmp /mnt/tmp

# mkdir /mnt/home
# mount /dev/volgrp/home /mnt/home
</code></pre>
<p>Now the partitions are ready for a regular bootstrap installation. (Setting up
the boot loader will require some more specific instructions to disk encryption
later on.)</p>
<h2>Bootstrap Installation</h2>
<p>Now let's install the base system, together with the <code>lvm2</code> package:</p>
<pre><code># pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware lvm2
</code></pre>
<p>In order to get the mounting done automatically upon restart, let's save it in
the <code>fstab</code> file:</p>
<pre><code># genfstab -U /mnt &gt;&gt; /mnt/etc/fstab
</code></pre>
<p>When this is done, let's switch into the installed environment:</p>
<pre><code># arch-chroot /mnt
</code></pre>
<p>A password needs to be set for the <code>root</code> user:</p>
<pre><code># passwd
</code></pre>
<p>In order to have a WiFi connection after rebooting, let's install a couple of
networking packages (some of those specific to my Intel hardware):</p>
<pre><code># pacman -S iw wpa_supplicant dialog intel-ucode netctl dhcpcd
</code></pre>
<p>I set the time zone to Zurich (Europe), update and save the system time:</p>
<pre><code># ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Zurich /etc/localtime
# timedatectl set-ntp true
# hwclock --systohc
</code></pre>
<p>For language and locale, I simply use <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> and <code>en_US-UTF-8 UTF-8</code>,
respectively:</p>
<pre><code># echo 'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8' &gt;&gt; /etc/locale.gen
# locale-gen
# echo 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' &gt; /etc/locale.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the lack of imagination, I call my laptop simply <em>carbon</em>:</p>
<pre><code># echo carbon &gt; …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via AP</p></div><div data-component="BodyComponentRenderer"><p><span data-component="TextBlock"></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>CORK, Ireland â€” Facebook has threatened to pack up its toys and go home if European regulators donâ€™t back down and let the social network get its own way.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>In a court filing in Dublin, Facebook said that a decision by Irelandâ€™s Data Protection Commission (DPC) would force the company to pull up stakes and leave the 410 million people who use Facebook and photo-sharing service Instagram in the lurch.</p>
</span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>If the decision is upheld, â€œit is not clear to [Facebook] how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU,â€� Yvonne Cunnane, who is Facebook Irelandâ€™s head of data protection and associate general counsel, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yngcdv99irbm5sr/Facebook%20DPC%20filing%20Sept%202020-rotated.pdf?dl=0">wrote in a sworn affidavit</a>.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The decision Facebookâ€™s referring to is <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/v7gkgy/europe-ordered-facebook-to-stop-sending-user-data-to-the-united-states">a preliminary order handed down last month</a> to stop the transfer of data about European customers to servers in the U.S., over concerns about U.S. government surveillance of the data.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Facebook hit back by filing a lawsuit challenging the Irish DPCâ€™s ban, and in a sworn affidavit filed this week, the company leveled some very serious accusations about the Irish data-protection commissioner, including a lack of fairness and apparent bias in singling out Facebook.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Cunnane points out that Facebook was given only three weeks to respond to the decision, a period that is â€œmanifestly inadequate,â€� adding that Facebook wasnâ€™t contacted about the inquiry prior to judgment being handed down.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>She also raises concerns about the decision being made â€œsolelyâ€� by Helen Dixon, Irelandâ€™s data protection commissioner.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œThe fact one person is responsible for the entire process is relevant to [Facebookâ€™s] concerns, in respect of the inadequacy of the investigative process engaged in and independence of the ultimate decision-making process,â€� Cunnane wrote.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Cunnane also complains that Facebook is being singled out, noting no other big tech company using similar methods to transfer data to the U.S. from the EU is under the same scrutiny.</p>
</span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œThis gives rise to an apprehension that [Facebook] is not being treated equally,â€� Cullinane wrote. â€œIf [Facebook] alone is being investigated and subject to a suspension of data transfers to the U.S., this would be liable to create a serious distortion of competition.â€�</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The Irish DPC declined to comment to VICE News. Facebook denies that it is trying to force the regulator to change its decision with a threat with withdraw its services.</p>
</span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>â€œFacebook is not threatening to withdraw from Europe,â€� a Facebook spokesperson said, adding that the court filing simply lays out how â€œFacebook, and many other businesses, organisations and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate their services.â€�</p>

You'd like to have time to code, but nobody else is onboarding the junior engineers, updating the roadmap, talking to the users, noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and making sure that everyone's going roughly in the same direction. If you stop doing those things, the team won't be as successful. But now someone's suggesting that you might be happier in a less technical role. If this describes you, congratulations: you're the glue.

September 25, 2020 | https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/on-not-choosing-wordpress/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/on-not-choosing-wordpress/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0"> <div>  <div class="page"> <div id="main-content" role="main">  <p> <span>Updates</span> <span>CMS</span> </p>  <hr> <p>The W3C redesign project is an incredibly exciting one for us at Studio 24, it’s an honour to be working with an organisation we have looked up to for our whole career. But it’s also challenging, with many aspects coming under more scrutiny than we’re normally used to. It’s also made harder in this time of pandemic, with increased anxiety and challenges working effectively during this “new normal” we’re all living in.</p> <p>We’re happy to rise to this challenge. Yesterday a well written article was published by WordPress Tavern on <a href="https://wptavern.com/w3c-drops-wordpress-from-consideration-for-redesign-narrows-cms-shortlist-to-statamic-and-craft">W3C dropping WordPress from consideration</a> which I’d like to respond to.</p> <h2 id="in-context-of-the-project"> <a href="#in-context-of-the-project"></a> In context of the project </h2> <p>We’ve tackled a huge variety of work so far from initial Discovery, User Research, Information Architecture, Content Design and UX Design that has helped move the project forward.</p> <p>The CMS platform decision is just part of this and for the end website is one of the less visible aspects. As you can read from <a href="https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/cms-selection-report/">Marie’s report on the work we did to choose Craft CMS</a> you can see the steps we went through to help shortlist and choose a CMS.</p> <p>For us, and the requirements from W3C, the delivery of accessible HTML/CSS pages that meet user needs is the most important part of this project - and where we are focussing our time. All in, we spent around 15 days on the CMS platform choice. Enough to help evaluate a limited number of options, but not enough to do a thorough review of the state of accessibility in a wide range of CMSs.</p> <p>We were surprised by the accessibility issues that cropped up in CMS platforms after our <a href="https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/w3c-cms-selection-process-update/">initial CMS review</a>. This prompted us to prioritise accessibility above other requirements due to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission#principles">principles and values of W3C</a>.</p> <h2 id="challenges-of-gutenberg-for-now"> <a href="#challenges-of-gutenberg-for-now"></a> Challenges of Gutenberg (for now) </h2> <p><a href="https://www.studio24.net/">Studio 24</a> is a firm supporter of open source software and we use <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> extensively for our client work. For this project we had committed to not selecting a CMS until we’d had the chance to better understand client requirements.</p> <p>An important consideration for WordPress was accessibility concerns with the new Gutenberg editor. Many have written about the <a href="https://www.marcozehe.de/my-thoughts-on-gutenberg-accessibility/">accessibility issues</a> the project has had as well as the positive <a href="https://www.marcozehe.de/whats-new-for-accessibility-in-gutenberg-7-2/">steps to improve accessibility in Gutenberg</a>.</p> <p>Gutenberg is an exciting and really interesting development. Many CMS vendors are looking at ways to allow editors to create more flexible content from compontents or blocks. However, this comes with huge challenges on how to make innovative user interfaces accessible. WordPress decided to use the JavaScript framework <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> to meet these needs.</p> <p>We <a href="https://medium.com/studio24/we-tried-converting-a-bespoke-website-design-in-wordpress-with-gutenberg-42e11986b05a">tested Gutenberg</a> six months before it was released in WordPress 5. Recently we worked on a project for the University of Cambridge creating a site for their <a href="https://magazine.alumni.cam.ac.uk/">Alumni magazine</a>. This launched in April 2020 and uses Gutenberg to manage content. This gave us a good idea of how Gutenberg works. In June, we reviewed the current accessibility issue backlog (<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Accessibility%20%28a11y%29">issues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/25">a11y project</a>) and had some feedback from users with accessibility needs who had difficulties using the current user interface. This was a contributing factor in our decision that WordPress was not a good fit for this project.</p> <p>Given the importance the WordPress project has put on Gutenberg as the future of WordPress we did not feel it was reasonable to recommend using the Classic Editor if there is a good chance this will not be supported in the future. At present <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/">Classic Editor is slated for end of life in Dec 2021</a>.</p> <p>We look forward to the continued development of Gutenberg and applaud efforts to make it more accessible. We appreciate improvements have been made since our review and we’re very glad to see the <a href="https://wpaccessibilityday.org/">WordPress Accessibility Day</a> on 2nd October.</p> <h2 id="front-end-complexity"> <a href="#front-end-complexity"></a> Front-end complexity </h2> <p>From a business perspective I also believe Gutenberg creates a complexity issue that makes it challenging for use by many agencies who create custom websites for clients; where we have a need to create lots of bespoke blocks and page elements for individual client projects.</p> <p>The use of React complicates front-end build. We have very talented front-end developers, however, they are not React experts - nor should they need to be. I believe front-end should be built as standards-compliant HTML/CSS with JavaScript used to enrich functionality where necessary and appropriate.</p> <p>As of yet, we have not found a satisfactory (and profitable) way to build custom Gutenberg blocks for commercial projects. We won’t stop trying though and plan to do more R&amp;D with Gutenberg in the future. The W3C project, however, did not feel like the right place to do this. On a project as wide-ranging as this one, development time does become a factor.</p> <p>Drupal also has this complexity issue which makes developing sites harder than it needs to be, and is why we didn’t consider that platform either. I’ve talked to <a href="https://torchbox.com/blog/torchbox-has-dropped-drupal/">other agencies who have decided to drop Drupal</a> due to its complexity.</p> <h2 id="the-question-of-open-source"> <a href="#the-question-of-open-source"></a> The question of open source </h2> <p>The W3C embraces and supports the open web. However, as an agency we also have to be practical when it comes to the tools we use to build sites. From our review, which was focussed on PHP-based CMSs, Craft and Statamic came out as meeting all the key requirements and are both very developer-friendly platforms. An important consideration for a tool that we need to hand over to W3C to maintain in the future.</p> <p>While their <a href="https://github.com/craftcms/cms">source code</a> is open, they do have commercial licenses and cost money (though a modest sum). Charging money enables small teams to develop good software, so we’re not ideologically against this business model. Both platforms are well respected in the community and well-used by professionals, running sites such as <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/">Big Commerce</a> in Craft, <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/plus/">Spiegel Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/">FreshBooks</a> in Statamic.</p> <p>We are using open source technology in the majority of this project (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Symfony). While Craft is a proprietary CMS, this has given us the advantage of direct access to the team developing the CMS which has helped improve accessibility in these CMSs. We hope this helps move accessibility forward in the CMS industry.</p> <p>Open tools will continue to be used to publish the standards of the web. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">Technical Reports</a> page is powered by <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> and specifications will continue to be published to <a href="https://github.com/w3c">GitHub</a> to facilitate open discussion. Nothing’s changing with how the W3C work in the open.</p> <h2 id="a-note-on-front-end-delivery"> <a href="#a-note-on-front-end-delivery"></a> A note on front-end delivery </h2> <p>One final note. We are currently considering a <a href="https://www.studio24.net/blog/what-is-a-headless-cms/">Headless CMS</a> option for front-end page delivery. This means using the CMS in a decoupled way to manage content but use a separate system to deliver front-end pages. Please note this solution would not be reliant on JavaScript (e.g. a single page app which is common with headless). Under this option we’d use Symfony to deliver front-end pages which is an established technology W3C already use across a lot of the site.</p> <p>This may give W3C better flexibility for the future, though comes at a cost of added complexity. The W3C site is already made up of a lot of different systems, the CMS is just one part of the what makes up the varied content on <a href="https://www.w3.org/">w3.org</a>.</p> <p>I hope this helps explain the thought process behind our decision a little more and addresses some of the valid concerns highlighted in the WordPress Tavern post.</p> <hr>  </div> </div> </div> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Is the C runtime and library a legitimate part of the Unix API?</h2>

	<p><small>December 31, 2017</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the knocks against Go is, to quote from <a href="https://marcan.st/2017/12/debugging-an-evil-go-runtime-bug/">Debugging an evil
Go runtime bug</a> (partly
<a href="https://zaitcev.livejournal.com/240821.html">via</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>Go also happens to have a (rather insane, in my opinion) policy of
reinventing its own standard library, so it does not use any of the
standard Linux glibc code to call vDSO, but rather rolls its own calls
(and syscalls too).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ordinary non-C languages on Unixes generally implement a great many
low level operations by calling into the standard C library. This
starts with things like making system calls, but also includes
operations such as <code>getaddrinfo(3)</code>. Go doesn't do this; it implements
as much as possible itself, going straight down to direct system
calls in assembly language. Occasionally there are problems that
ensue.</p>

<p>A few Unixes explicitly say that the standard C library is the
stable API and point of interface with the system; one example is
Solaris (and now Illumos). Although they don't casually change the
low level system call implementation, as far as I know Illumos
officially reserves the right to change all of their actual system
calls around, breaking any user space code that isn't dynamically
linked to <code>libc</code>. If your code breaks, it's your fault; Illumos
told you that dynamic linking to <code>libc</code> is the official API.</p>

<p>Other Unixes simply do this tacitly and by accretion. For example,
on any Unix using <code>nsswitch.conf</code>, it's very difficult to always
get the same results for operations like <code>getaddrinfo()</code> without
going through the standard C library, because these may use arbitrary
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/SystemdResolvedNotes">strange</a> dynamically loaded
modules that are accessed through <code>libc</code> and require various random
<code>libc</code> APIs to work. This points out one of the problems here; once
you start (indirectly) calling random bits of the <code>libc</code> API, they
may quite reasonably make assumptions about the runtime environment
that they're operating in. How to set up a limited standard C library
runtime environment is generally not documented; instead the official
view is generally 'let the standard C library runtime code start
your <code>main()</code> function'.</p>

<p>I'm not at all sure that all of this requirement and entanglement
with the standard C library and its implicit runtime environment
is a good thing. The standard C library's runtime environment is
designed for C, and it generally contains a tangled skein of
assumptions about how things work. Forcing all other languages to
fit themselves into these undocumented constraints is clearly
confining, and the standard C library generally isn't designed to
be a transparent API; in fact, at least GNU libc deliberately
manipulates what it does under the hood to be more useful to C
programs. Whether these manipulations are useful or desired for
your non-C language is an open question, but the GNU libc people
aren't necessarily going to even document them.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://marcan.st/2017/12/debugging-an-evil-go-runtime-bug/">Marcan's story</a> shows
that the standard C library behavior would have been a problem for
any language environment that attempted to use minimal stacks while
calling into 'libc', here in the form of a kernel vDSO that's
designed to be called through libc. This also shows another aspect
of the problem, in that as far as I know how much stack space you
must provide when calling the standard C library is generally not
documented. It's just assumed that you will have 'enough', whatever
that is. C code will; people who are trying to roll their own
coroutines and thread environment, maybe not.)</p>

<p>This implicit assumption has a long history in Unix. Many Unixes
have only really documented their system calls in the form of the
standard C library interface to them, quietly eliding the distinction
between the kernel API to user space and the standard C library API
to C programs. If you're lucky, you can dig up some documentation
on how to make raw system calls and what things those raw system
calls return in unusual cases like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/SocketReturnAPIDesign"><code>pipe(2)</code></a>.
I don't think very many Unixes have ever tried to explicitly and
fully document the kernel API separately from the standard C library
API, especially once you get into cases like <code>ioctl()</code> (where there
are often C macros and <code>#define</code>s that are used to form some of the
arguments, which are of course only 'documented' in the C header
files).</p>

    <p>The Maersk Triple-E Class container ship is 1,300 feet long, carries over 18,000 containers across 11,000 miles between Europe and Asia, and… Its entire crew can fit inside a passenger van.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e84e2eff3c5307ee69a77b3313684a5a90aa0981/d7909/images/uploads/maersk-container-ship.jpg" alt="Maersk container ship"></p>

<p>As a former naval architect and a current <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/">marketing consultant to startups</a>, I found that the same principle that lets a 13-person crew navigate the world’s largest container ship to a port halfway around the world without breaking down also applies to startups working towards aggressive growth goals:</p>

<p><strong>Simple systems have less downtime.</strong></p>

<p>Ships contain simple systems that are easy to operate and easy to understand, which makes them easy to fix, which means they have less downtime. An important quality, considering that “downtime” for a ship could mean being stranded thousands of miles from help.</p>

<p>Take the ship’s steering system, for instance. The rudder is pushed left or right by metal rods. Those rods are moved by hydraulic pressure. That pressure is controlled by a hydraulic pump. That pump is controlled by an electronic signal from the wheelhouse. That signal is controlled by the autopilot. It doesn’t require a rocket scientist or a naval architect to find the cause of and solution to any problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the autopilot fails, steer the ship manually from the wheelhouse.</li>
  <li>If the electronic signals fail, go to the rudder control room to control the pump by hand, while talking with the bridge through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound-powered_telephone">simple sound-powered phone</a>.</li>
  <li>If the hydraulics fail, use the mechanically linked emergency steering wheel.</li>
  <li>If the mechanical linkage fails, hook a chain to both sides of the rudder and pull in the direction you want!</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4676c41bcb0133d35827e62d044f82c9511ffd21/bb56a/images/uploads/174.jpg" alt="Cartoon about redundancy"></p>

<p>Startups, like ships, can’t afford to stall from system downtimes. Extended downtime in sales, marketing, web, customer support, hiring, product, and other systems may cause irreparable damage to the growth rate.</p>

<p>(Although automation is prevalent on modern ships, it only affects the time it takes to do things and the attention required to monitor everything. The propulsion and auxiliary systems are more simple than ever, thanks to modern diesel and electric propulsion systems that replaced pipe-laden steam plants.)</p>

<h2 id="why-simplicity-leads-to-less-downtime">Why Simplicity Leads to Less Downtime</h2>

<h3 id="1-proficiency-takes-less-time">1. Proficiency takes less time.</h3>

<p>If the person responsible for the system leaves, falls overboard, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">gets hit by a bus</a>, or gets pulled into another project, another person can take over without much learning or training. That means more people are able to step in to troubleshoot and fix issues.</p>

<p>For example, an analytics dashboard built with Tableau is likely to have more qualified people to fix it than one built with a patchwork of custom scripts and APIs. Nobody should have to pull data scientists or product developers away from their work to fix a bar chart.</p>

<h3 id="2-troubleshooting-takes-less-time">2. Troubleshooting takes less time.</h3>

<p>In a system where the behavior of each component and its relationship to other comments is easily understood, ruling out issues and finding the broken component—the root cause—is more intuitive.</p>

<p>For example, if a company has many downloadable whitepapers on their website, and they’re all gated behind a single form—as opposed to a custom form for each one—then they need only troubleshoot one form and one automation workflow if the whitepaper downloads stop working.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/495bdd177c0618760025c9d94dcfc8129aa117f5/ec606/images/uploads/91.jpg" alt="Cartoon about a ship being stuck in Nebraska"></p>

<h3 id="3-more-alternative-solutions">3. More alternative solutions.</h3>

<p>When each part of the system has a clear function, alternatives are easier to find.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a Salesforce process that uses a mishmash of automation and third-party tools to score, filter, classify, and assign new sales leads. If that fails then there is no obvious replacement. Everything will be put on hold until the process is fixed or replaced with a similarly complex solution.</p>

<p>Now imagine a sales process in which the sales team is simply notified of each new sales lead along with pertinent details, letting them decide whether or not to follow up with the lead. If the Salesforce notification step fails, it’s easy to come up with a hundred other ways of getting that information to the sales team: Reports, Slack notifications, list exports, manual observation, or using Zapier to send an alert through virtually any medium. The downtime would last a few minutes, at most.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/26ba2a1619df8df60c6a56e3ec07a7b81478f644/75961/images/uploads/77.jpg" alt="Cartoon about boats grounding because of a broken lighthouse"></p>

<h2 id="startup-story">Startup Story</h2>

<p>One of my clients was using a legacy enterprise marketing automation platform (Marketo) with 629 automated processes built up over several years. When something broke or needed tweaking, there was only one person among the 150+ employees who could do it. Each issue took several days or even weeks to fix, all the while marketing campaigns stalled. And with each patch, the overall system only grew more complex.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/c25f453aa08d83e439b8d4ad5240ea4842ff286f/421d6/images/uploads/127.jpg" alt="Cartoon about a sailor coming home drunk"></p>

<p>When that person left the company, there was nobody left to operate the system. With every passing week a new issue would come up, faster than we could find and fix them.</p>

<p>To keep the marketing operation from coming to a standstill, I rushed to migrate the company from Marketo to HubSpot, a more simple platform that would be easier to operate and troubleshoot.</p>

<p>The migration took just one week. Along the way, however, another complex system reared its head: Salesforce. There were 10 automated processes in Salesforce with over 100 combined operations, all dependent on various delicately timed automations in Marketo. It took two weeks—twice as long as the migration—to understand and integrate those processes with the new marketing platform.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/169a7904b8e2c26fd693968dbb2250d75eba25f3/7e08a/images/uploads/193.jpg" alt="Cartoon about being stranded on an island"></p>

<p>Overall, these two complex systems (in Marketo and in Salesforce) resulted in six weeks of downtime for the marketing team and three weeks of downtime for the sales team. That’s not counting the many weeks of downtime they experienced throughout the past few years, nor the many weeks of downtime they would experience in the future if we did not overhaul the underlying systems.</p>

<p>In the end, the system I put in place had 97% fewer processes (from 629 to 20) while providing all the same capabilities. A bug that was found a few days later got resolved in four minutes.</p>

<p>This experience made me wonder what principles startups can adopt to avoid the pitfalls of complex systems.</p>

<h2 id="principles-for-simple-systems">Principles for Simple Systems</h2>

<p>Rip-and-replace projects are painful and disruptive, even when the long-term benefits are worth it. Many startups—as with ships—don’t have the luxury of time and resources to perform overhauls once they’re underway.</p>

<p>Here are my three principles to follow when evaluating or implementing new systems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Features don’t justify complexity.</strong> What good is a complicated flight control system if it grounds an entire fleet of aircraft, or an enterprise marketing platform like Marketo if nobody can run a marketing campaign? Choose tools that are simple to operate over those that promise the most features. A frequent recommendation I give to startups is to choose HubSpot for their marketing platform instead of an enterprise platform like Marketo, Eloqua, or Pardot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Complex ideas lead to complex implementations.</strong> If it takes too long to explain or grasp an idea, then its implementation will be complex, and it will take too long to fix when something inevitably breaks. For example, a proposed sales process that requires an hour-long presentation will be a nightmare to maintain, regardless of how clever it seems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Modifications before additions.</strong> When new requirements come up, the tendency is to add layers on top of the existing system—by way of additional steps or integrations. Instead, see if the system’s core can be modified to meet the new requirements. The change may cause (planned) downtime upfront, as with my Marketo-to-HubSpot migration example, but less (unplanned) downtime over the long term.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="smooth-sailing">Smooth Sailing</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“… the more simple any thing is, the less liable it is to be disordered, and the easier repaired when disordered.” — Thomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s no question things will break along the startup journey, just as surely as they do on a ship crossing the globe. However, if the onboard systems are simple, those issues won’t leave the startup drifting helplessly in the middle of the ocean.</p>

			<p><strong>Libreture is a direct response to the dodgy, monopolistic practices of the large e-book retailers, publishers and distributors.</strong></p>
		</div>
		

		
		<p><strong>Launched in 2017, Libreture is an alternative e-book &amp; comic storage service for readers who want the benefits of an online platform, without the dodgy practices of the large retailers.</strong></p>
		<p>Owned and run by <strong>Kevin Beynon</strong>, its goal is to balance the monopolistic platforms of Amazon, Google, and Apple, with a service that is designed NOT to be tied to its own bookshop or e-reader (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration" target="_blank">vertically-integrated</a>). In effect, supporting independent bookshops, publishers, and self-publishing authors, by providing readers with the same book management tools they would normally only get from big companies.</p>
		
		<h2>Why I built Libreture</h2>
		<p><strong>I'm an avid e-book reader and was once a Kindle-owner. After news of Amazon's UK tax-avoidance broke I decided to boycott them and look for alternative e-bookshops.</strong></p>

		<p>I concentrated on finding bookshops that sold DRM-free e-books, to ensure I could read them on any device. I also wanted to support small and independent publishers and bookshops. With this in mind, I compiled a list of <a href="https://www.libreture.com/bookshops">DRM-free bookshops</a>. The list is still growing and is now a key component of Libreture - readers record where they bought their DRM-free books, helping others discover new bookshops.</p>

		<p>A big part of Amazon's service is its book storage and management tools. To avoid these, I began using <em>Shelfari</em>, a library management website. Shelfari was a great tool, but in 2008, the owners <a href="http://shelfari.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/08/shelfari-joins-the-amazoncom-family.html" target="_blank">sold Shelfari to Amazon</a>. So I moved to <em>Goodreads</em>.</p>

		<p>When the owners of Goodreads also <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family" target="_blank">sold their business to Amazon</a> in 2013, I had finally had enough. Many others felt the same way.</p>

		<blockquote>"What terrible news. Loss of an independent reader community, now another channel for the faceless machine to leech reader data to withhold from suffering publishers &amp; booksellers. If through this account Amazon has a record of my reading habits I will be deleting the account. Very sad."<br>
		<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family#comment_70824525" target="_blank">Laura - 28/03/2013</a>
		</blockquote>

		<p>At that point I began building my own stable platform to store e-books, record reading activity, and promote DRM-free bookshops and publishers.</p>
		<p>I built the first version myself, and for myself. It soon became clear that others may find it useful too. Working with an external development company, we re-built Libreture from scratch.</p> 
		<p><strong><a href="https://www.libreture.com/blog/libreture-open-business/" target="_blank">Libreture launched to the public in March, 2017</a></strong></p>
		<p><strong>So far, readers are storing 8,069 e-books with Libreture.</strong></p>
		
		


		<h2>Price</h2>
		<p><strong>You can use Libreture absolutely free to store a limited amount of e-books, and you can upgrade to a paid plan to store much, much more.</strong></p>
		<p>Libreture doesn't offer a discounted annual rate that only saves money for those that can afford to pay up front. The fee is set for each plan and covers the cost of development, infrastructure, storage for your books, as well as a small profit margin. I believe each plan is as reasonable as possible while keeping Libreture sustainable (which means keeping me in tea and biscuits).</p>
		<p>Free and Paid plans ensure that costs are covered as soon as they happen, such as when readers upload large book collections. It also gives you the flexibility to switch plans to whatever suits you, or cancel whenever you want and only pay for the remainder of the month.</p>

<h2 id="toc-2020-09-29-new-codec-driver-in-my-5-9-kernel">2020–09–29: New
codec driver in my 5.9&nbsp;kernel</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/smaeul">Samuel</a> updated his <a href="https://github.com/smaeul/linux/commits/pine64-5.9">codec patches</a> a
few days ago, noting in the dev&nbsp;chat:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>I&nbsp;have a branch ready for anyone wanting to test the new audio patches: <a href="https://github.com/smaeul/linux/commits/pine64-5.9">https://github.com/smaeul/linux/commits/pine64-5.9</a>
	three&nbsp;notes:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Set PulseAudio to use a 48&nbsp;kHz sample rate and an 8&nbsp;kHz alternate rate.
		Both must be multiples of 8&nbsp;kHz or modem/BT audio won't&nbsp;work.</li>

		<li>You must use a QDAI config with the codec as master (modem as slave) and an
		8&nbsp;kHz sample rate. Use AT+QDAI=1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1&nbsp;unless you have a very good
		reason not&nbsp;to.</li>

		<li>You must use a BT config with the codec as master (BT as slave) and 2&nbsp;PCM
		slots. Use len=2 offset=00f6 { 85 10&nbsp;}.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>This does include jack detection and headset mic button detection. I&nbsp;don't
	have any three-button headsets, so I&nbsp;can't test the volume up/down
	functionality. it has the „80% solution“ to call audio quality&nbsp;– it will
	sound fine unless something tries to play/record audio from/to the CPU at a
	sample rate &gt;8 kHz during a&nbsp;call</p>

	<p>To clarify note 1&nbsp;above: you can use both 44.1&nbsp;kHz streams (music) and
	8&nbsp;kHz streams (modem), but not at the same time. so unless you have some way to
	kill all 44.1&nbsp;kHz streams before starting a call (can UCM do that?), the sample
	rates have to be compatible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And some time later:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>I&nbsp;pushed some more changes, including a fix for the high-pitched whine from
	the speaker it was a harmonic from the audio PLL, and I&nbsp;believe it's&nbsp;leaking
	from VCC-PLL → AVCC, since the noise is the same on the headphones and
	speaker.</p>

	<p>So I&nbsp;made two changes:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>triple the frequency of PLL_AUDIO, which needed to be done anyway for using
		the sample rate converter. now the harmonic at 44100 (previously the whine) is
		inaudible, and the harmonic at 48000&nbsp;is lower frequency, so less annoying</li>

		<li>decreased the PLL bias current, which drastically decreases the volume of
		both the harmonics and the white noise if you want to try out a different series
		of frequencies (1×, 4×, 6×), adjust the last two hunks in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/smaeul/linux/commit/7b51d5b09136">https://github.com/smaeul/linux/commit/7b51d5b09136</a></li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So I&nbsp;spent some time pulling the new codec patches to my kernel and rebasing
my patches for <a href="http://www.x-powers.com/en.php/Info/product_detail/article_id/39">X-Powers
AC100</a> codec support on top of them, so that I&nbsp;can merge them into my
kernel.</p>

<p>This went fine, and the results are as described by Samuel. Modem audio is
nice and smooth, as long as you don't use alsa PCM interfaces during a call with
any other sample rate than 8kHz. And the new jack detection works&nbsp;too.</p>

<p>One issue that people may hit with the new codec support is that some ALSA
controls were renamed. I&nbsp;made the list of changes from the code&nbsp;diffs:</p>

<p>You can run the above script to patch up your UCM profile or whatever. I've
updated my <a href="https://xnux.eu/devices/feature/audio-pp.html">call audio
setup script</a>, for the new controls&nbsp;too.</p>

<h3 id="toc-modem-reset">Modem reset</h3>

<p>It turns out that Quectel managed to break modem reset via
<code>AT+CFUN=1,1</code>, while adding support for fast poweroff. This manifests
itself by modem powering off instead of rebooting when fast poweroff is
enabled.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;had to patch my modem driver to disable fast poweroff during a reset after
QDAI update, so that QDAI updates work smoothly with the new QDAI necessary for
the above mentioned codec changes.</p>

Downsizing the multi-boot image</h2>

<p>If the multi-boot image doesn't fit your 8GiB uSD card, because it's&nbsp;a tad
too big, you can downsize it a bit by using this script:</p>

<pre><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>set -e -x</span>

<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> m
L<span>=</span><span>`losetup -P --show -f multi.img`</span>
mount <span>-o</span> <span>compress</span><span>-force</span><span>=</span>zstd <span>${L}</span>p2 m
btrfs filesystem resize <span>7000</span>M m
<span>echo</span> <span>",7000M"</span> <span>|</span> sfdisk <span>-N</span> <span>2</span> <span>${L}</span>
umount m
losetup <span>-d</span> <span>"</span><span>$L</span><span>"</span>

truncate <span>-s</span> <span>$((128+7000)</span><span>)</span>M multi.img
</pre>

<p>If something fails in the middle, you may need to recover by calling
<code>umount</code> and <code>losetup -d</code> yourself.
<code>losetup -l</code> can tell you if the image is still exported as a loop
device, and which&nbsp;one.</p>

<p>The image will have the size of 7128&nbsp;MiB after resize and this should fit
more „8“ giga something uSD cards, as there are obviously some other giga
units than gigabyte and gigibyte used by some manufacturers.</p>

<h2 id="toc-2020-09-20-some-ways-to-improve-pinephone-safety">2020–09–20:
Some ways to improve Pinephone safety</h2>

<p>This is a follow up on some issues from the previous article. On surface,
solutions to some of the previously presented issues can seem simple. Toggle a
few registers in PMIC, and we're mostly done. Trouble is that safety mechanisms
are barely ever triggered, by definition. Safety events occur rarely. That means
that the mechanisms are not regularly tested, and it is not known that
they&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>Also it's&nbsp;not clear which code's&nbsp;responsibility fixing the issues should
be. Bootloader, or kernel, or userspace? Finally, there are a bunch of devils in
the details, that complicate the upstreamability of any solution. And having
fixes upstream is necessary to make sure they reach the most&nbsp;users.</p>

<h3 id="toc-necessary-minimum">Necessary minimum</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, at least enabling some pre-existing PMIC functionality blindly
is better than nothing, so that's&nbsp;precisely what I&nbsp;decided to do <a href="https://megous.com/git/p-boot/commit/?id=db73ff85c60944207b7f7368e554003494148a05">in
p-boot</a>. It's&nbsp;the easiest place to start resolving these issues for me
personally, and for other p-boot&nbsp;users.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;fixed two issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I&nbsp;enabled the battery temperature monitoring and charging regulation based
	on temperature thresholds defined in the Pinephone battery specification.</li>

	<li>I&nbsp;enabled emergency shutdown when crossing the critical temperature
	of&nbsp;PMIC.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&nbsp;didn't measure the 3kOhm NTC used in Pinephone battery and third party
batteries I&nbsp;bought. I&nbsp;just used a table from some random 3kOhm NTC spec on The
Internet, that seemed like it could match. Hopefully it's&nbsp;close enough.</p>

<p>Trouble with the second fix is that it's&nbsp;a hard power cut-off, so data loss
may occur when PMIC overheats. There are three fixed temperature levels in
AXP803. On level 1&nbsp;the charging is limited, on level 2&nbsp;the interrupt is sent
to SoC, on level 3&nbsp;the PMIC shuts down if configured to do so (by default it
keeps running, and this is what my p-boot fix changes). Ideally, the crossing of
level 2&nbsp;would be handled by Linux to make it safely shut down the system, and
level 3&nbsp;forced power cut-off would never happen. Arguably, if charging was
source of the heating, crossing level 1&nbsp;will lead to resolving the issue, so
the next level will not be reached.</p>

<h3 id="toc-suggested-fixes-elsewhere">Suggested fixes elsewhere</h3>

<p>These fixes will reach a very limited audience. It would be nice to have
these fixes in U-Boot too, but that's&nbsp;not possible at the moment, because
U-Boot doesn't have access to&nbsp;PMIC.</p>

<p>Other places to put the fix is to ATF or Linux kernel. That can reach more
people faster, but there would have to be some generic mechanism to make …</p></article></div>

		<p>KansasFest 2019 presentation, “Ready Player Two”</p>
<p><span><iframe type="text/html" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T3Qj0vnZx7Y?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>One of the first games I ever played on my family’s Apple IIe was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karateka_(video_game)">Jordan Mechner master work, Karateka</a>. Fight the bad guys, save the princess – it’s a simple but classic formula. My brother and I would take turns making our way through Akuma’s fortress. Even then, we wanted a two player version.</p>
<p>Fast forward more than 30 years, and I’ve taught myself 6502 assembly after getting back into the Apple II, through the thriving community online. The idea of a two player version of Karateka came back to me while at <a href="http://kansasfest.org/">KansasFest</a> a couple of years ago. I noodled a little on it back then, getting distracted by finding the code that created the <a href="https://github.com/option8/ksynth">unique music</a> in the game.</p>
<p>Long story short: I finally found the places in the game code that needed patching to allow a second player to control the enemies in the game, and create a functioning two player version of Karateka. The resulting patch is only 42 bytes long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/karateka-two-player">A DSK image is downloadable and playable online at the Internet Archive.</a></p>
<p><strong>[Update, August 20, 2018]:</strong> Some people seem to think I had access to the Karateka source code to make my edits. As far as I know, that source code is unreleased, still in Jordan Mechner’s archives somewhere. Instead, I fired up the game in my Apple II emulator of choice, <a href="http://virtualii.com/">Virtual ][</a>&nbsp;and froze the game state. Stepping through instructions, I followed the assembly as it built up each frame of animation, triggered events and eventually found where the player and enemy performed their attacks. By comparing memory states from before and after the enemy attacks, I found a handful of zero-page variables that, when I changed them manually, would trigger a punch or kick.</p>
<p>From there, it was a matter of finding the routines that read and wrote to those memory locations, and inserting my own code to listen instead for the keyboard to trigger each action.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, August 23, 2018]:</strong> Robin Harbron has ported the two-player patch over to the Commodore 64 port of Karateka. <a href="http://psw.ca/robin/?p=271">You can read Robin’s write-up here:&nbsp;http://psw.ca/robin/?p=271</a></p>
<p>Digging a little deeper than my original patches, Robin added the ability for the second player to move backward as well as forward. I’ll have to back-port that to my version.</p>

<h3>Player 1 controls:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Q,A,Z to punch</li>
<li>W,S,X to kick</li>
<li>C,V to move/run</li>
<li>SPACE to go from standing to fighting stance and back.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Player 2 controls:</h3>
<ul>
<li>N to kick</li>
<li>M to punch</li>
<li>&lt; to move left</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrnCRkPLoXXzTtWX9dBJsnA">Chris Torrence</a>, for helping spelunk the game’s memory layout; to <a href="https://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/">Antoine Vignau</a> for his clean DSK crack and a patch to skip the intro and get right into fighting; <a href="https://twitter.com/a2_4am">4AM</a>&nbsp;for inspiration and helping test.</p>
<h3>Patch Details:</h3>
<p>Addresses are locations in memory after the game finishes loading.</p>
<p>Before the enemy fighter punches, code loads the Accumulator with D7 then jumps to $6540. A kick is similar, but loads A with C5. I patched those pieces at $6C11 (punch) and $6C20 (kick) instead to read the keyboard buffer and load the appropriate byte into the Accumulator. Otherwise, it goes along to $6540 with 00, which does nothing.</p>
<ul>
<li>$6C11: D0 1C C5 21 D0 18 A9 00 85 29 A9 D7 -&gt; AD 00 C0 C9 CD D0 02 A9 D7 8D 10 C0 (M to punch, clears strobe)</li>
<li>$6C20: 20 95 6C C5 D7 B0 08 20 71 6C A9 C5 -&gt; AD 00 C0 C9 CE D0 02 A9 C5 8D 10 C0&nbsp; (N to kick, clears strobe)</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Code at $6B9B seems to check if the distance between fighters ($33) is too far, trigger the enemy to move closer. This happens with a JMP to 6C52. I read the keyboard ($C000) and check for the comma/less-than.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>$6B9B: A6 33 E0 0C 90 03 4C 52 6C E0 07 B0 02 -&gt; AD 00 C0 EA EA EA C9 AC D0 03 4C 52 6C&nbsp; (&lt;&nbsp; to move player 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>To be able to check the keyboard while the game is usually busy animating the enemy fighter, I had to find where the keyboard strobe ($C010) was cleared, and NOP it. This happens several places in the main loop, but patching at $6EA9 kept the keyboard buffer long enough for me to check it.</p>
<ul>
<li>$6EA9: 8D 10 C0 -&gt; EA EA EA (keep from clearing keyboard strobe)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the second player controls were working, I modified the first player controls so both players could huddle around the keyboard and not cross over each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>$6e8e: 88 -&gt; C3 (C to move left instead of ctrl-H/left arrow)</li>
<li>$6e98: 95 -&gt; D6 (V to move right instead of ctrl-U/right arrow)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus: Now defaults to keyboard controls without having to hit K at the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li>$b9a8: A5 C4 D0 00 -&gt; A9 01 85 C4 (default to keyboard control, ignores joystick)</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601004858557_6995"><p><h3>Why I turned down a million dollar job to code and do Lambda School</h3></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601392656639_7096"><div><p>I have this habit of writing emails to myself to structure my thinking. This is one of those emails with some adjustments for sharing publicly. </p><p>Let me be honest right off the bat; this won’t be one of those “coding rules! anyone who doesn’t code shouldn’t be listened to!” cult pieces. Quite the contrary.</p><p>There is something deeply satisfying about creating things that solve a problem -any problem- in a better way. I mean there’s something deeply satisfying about creating things period. I don’t know exactly what it is -and we can argue forever about the existential anxiety roots of craving problem solving as a form of meaning for life- but it’s definitely there. I personally find building technology that simplifies complex problems or streamlines unnecessarily convoluted processes to be the most satisfying flavor of that.</p><p>That’s why despite not having a lot of savings (long story), spending years building my career on the business side of things, having a 1 Million dollar job at my hands (“you finally get to cash in man!”) and against the advice of everyone I know (well except for my brother) I decided it’s time to build computer science skills. To code.</p><h2>The backstory</h2><p>I started out my career on the “business” side of things on the other side of the world (America being “this side”). Landed a couple of decent -and excruciatingly boring- corporate jobs at Fortune 500 companies’ local offices for a couple of years before I quit without a plan. I had to. If I had stayed one more day I would have walked into the office and started banging my head against a wall screaming “None of us has a real job” on repeat. I kept applying to jobs I thought at the time would be intellectually challenging and that can be a gateway to get me into the “technology space” in America (more on why later). By some whiff of good luck I got into management consulting at its most sought after name; McKinsey. A couple of years later I transferred to their New York office, started a full-time MBA at Columbia and was well on my way to do what I wanted to do. A few years after that I had founded a -failed- startup that I ran for 2.5 years, advised on some very interesting strategy topics (when I went back to McKinsey) and worked at a leadership role at a dream company of mine; Amazon. I was super lucky.</p><p>Until October 2019 I had a great job at Amazon. I led a big team doing product management, marketplace growth &amp; data science for one of the e-commerce businesses. It had been 3 years in that role during which the business grew ~800% into multi-billion dollars of revenue which was super exciting. I loved my team, my boss and the company culture. We built things many people wanted. In short, many real -not vanity- metrics were checked for me. In addition, my Amazon stock compensation had skyrocketed in value so I was making great money.</p><p>Ironically, I started getting the “walk in and bang my head against the wall” urge again. This time I knew what the issue was though so I made a plan. In fact I had known one of the issues for quite a long time but the time to act on it hadn’t come -for many personal reasons- until now.</p><p>While I was finalizing that plan -it involved quitting the large corporate world at least for a while- a headhunter reached out about a very senior role at a Fortune 100. After some back and forth, I agreed to talk because “there’s nothing to lose and it would be good networking anyway”. They quickly made me an offer. Self delusion kicked in.</p><p>The three delusion flavors of that week were: 1. “You can’t pass on landing a C-level job at a Fortune 100 in your damn 30s! Remember where you started!” 2. “You can still build stuff. After all they are a technology company -albeit old school- and you’ll lead a turn-around there” and the world champion of delusions: 3. “I’ll do this for a couple of years then I can do my plan and take all the risk I want”.</p><p>Long story short, I took the offer and put my plan on hold.</p><p>This job was very different from my previous jobs which have all been in either tech (Amazon &amp; the startup I founded and ran for a few years out of New York) or management consulting (McKinsey). It was much more “cushy”, focused a lot more on corporate politics and was not as intellectually challenging. My compensation would have added up to more than $1 Million per year, I was leading a large organization with hundreds of people, etc. It <strong>checked a lot of “vanity metrics”.</strong> <strong>None of that matters and never should. </strong>Misery often comes out of comfort without purpose.</p><p><strong>8 weeks into this new cushy job I quit (most of the comp is in equity that vests over time so I didn’t make much of those big bucks 🤷🏻‍♂️) to go back to what I had originally intended to do.</strong> It sounds crazy because of the opportunity cost but that is actually sort of the point.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600965088871_5937"><div><h3>The why: Florence</h3><p>I immigrated to the US 10 years ago because I wanted to be part of building technology that solves problems and -as naive or cliche as this sounds I don’t care- builds the future. There are many many other reasons to love America but “technology &amp; entrepreneurship paradise” was the main one for me. I moved my entire life for that despite having a flourishing career that would have been even much more financially lucrative -if you think short to medium term- elsewhere (for starters I would have paid literally zero taxes the last 10 years while making very similar money 😂). For someone who did not grow up rich by any stretch of the word this was not an easy string of decisions.</p><p>Here’s how I found myself describing it to a close friend who’s in very similar shoes a while back: “I’m not entirely sure why but I feel like we have a role in Florence during the renaissance. It’s almost impossible to put a price on that”</p><p>Back to that “plan” that this post is all about. As I sat down to think about what I want to do towards the end of my time at Amazon I followed a simple framework:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600968647285_7975"><div><p>I had known for a long time that if I want to truly build things that make a dent in some problems (i.e. #2 on the list above) I need to learn how to code properly. After all <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is -truly- eating the world</a>. But it quickly hit me how interconnected the answers to all 4 questions are. <strong>Layering skills</strong> that help you <strong>become a builder</strong> of things and <strong>taking the risks that come with that</strong> in the process are (or lack thereof) the answer to all 4 questions.</p><p>A couple of years ago I watched Marc Andreessen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8QHeAv4_XE&amp;t=1442s" target="_blank">talk</a> about the best career advice he heard. He heard it from the creator of Dilbert; Scott Adams (who wrote it <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html" target="_blank">here</a>). Layering and combining skills. I can’t overstate how much I think this is spot on. If you’re a business person who knows data science you can accomplish 10x more than any other business person. If you’re an engineer who understands business &amp; customers you can be 10x more effective than any other engineer. Etc.</p><p>I layered quite a bit of “business” skills over the years. Yet all these things fall under what I call the Business Generalist umbrella (I wrote about this <a href="https://rightalot.com/blog/2020519-the-generalist-dilemma" target="_blank">here</a>). I believe that in order to make meaningful contributions to solving hard problems in technology you need some level of participation in computer science (actually it could be participation in any kind of physics and engineering). Being able to build (hence coding) yourself not just manage others to do so vastly expands your ability to experiment, spot good ideas, develop stronger intuition and most importantly it makes you have skin in the game (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075HYVP7C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Nassim Taleb</a>).</p><p>I dabble in coding (although I am far from a professional developer) and when I do -for work or fun- it doesn’t feel like work most of the time. It feels like a hobby. Like you’re actually rolling up your sleeves and <strong>making</strong> the idea in your head. I also never felt like I’m working while I worked on small teams with people I really like that are solving something with a missionary rather than a mercenary mindset. It was definitely the case when I started my own company where a team of 5 survived for 2 years on just $200K of funding because we all were focused on building. But I’ve had this experience in other situations too.</p><p>The things I’d regret the most (work-wise) when I’m 80 are risks I did not take. And as -Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ" target="_blank">puts it</a>- minimizing regret is something I believe many of us should aim for. The only real risk is taking no risks. Failure isn’t the worst outcome. Mediocrity is.</p><h3>What’s next</h3><p>I just got into <a href="http://www.lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> and I haven’t been this excited about something in a long time. I chose Lambda over other programs including a Masters in CS for many reasons but the main one was simply that they have what I believe to be the best approach. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600968647285_11960"><div><p>I’ll be writing a separate post on the quest for how to study CS properly and why I think Lambda is the best option.</p><p>I’m going full in. I’m starting Lambda full-time to build CS skills, I’m talking with a few small teams about ideas and I am starting to put all what I’ve learned about business skills into online courses/newsletter. My first goals are finishing Lambda School with a skillset that enables me to build products and to build a side part-time profitable business that enables me to have the peace of mind to continue experimenting with big ideas.</p><p>I tweet<a href="http://twitter.com/byadham" target="_blank"> @byadham</a>&nbsp;. You can follow me there as I document what I learned from my previous journey and what I’m learning from what I’m doing now. </p><blockquote><p>There’s an Arabic saying attributed to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran">&nbsp;Khalil Gibran</a>; the brilliant author of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prophet_%28book%29">&nbsp;The Prophet</a>&nbsp;that roughly translates to: “For they should learn that the rich man is not who owns more but who needs less”.</p></blockquote><p>Cheers</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img alt="Chaos-Mesh-1.0 - Chaos-Engineering-on-Kubernetes-Made-Easier" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-mesh-1.0-22c3415bc75bde8501087d6c7c154cd5.png"></p><p>Today, we are proud to announce the general availability of Chaos Mesh® 1.0, following its entry into CNCF as a <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/announcing-chaos-mesh-as-a-cncf-sandbox-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sandbox project</a> in July, 2020.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 is a major milestone in the project’s development. After 10 months of effort within the open-source community, Chaos Mesh is now ready in terms of functionality, scalability, and ease of use. Here are some highlights.</p><h2>Powerful chaos support</h2><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> originated in the testing framework of <a href="https://pingcap.com/products/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, a distributed database, so it takes into account the possible faults of a distributed system. Chaos Mesh provides comprehensive and fine-grained fault types, covering the Pod, the network, system I/O, and the kernel. Chaos experiments are defined in YAML, which is fast and easy to use.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 supports the following fault types:</p><ul><li>clock-skew: Simulates clock skew</li><li>container-kill: Simulates the container being killed</li><li>cpu-burn: Simulates CPU pressure</li><li>io-attribution-override: Simulates file exceptions</li><li>io-fault: Simulates file system I/O errors</li><li>io-latency: Simulates file system I/O latency</li><li>kernel-injection: Simulates kernel failures</li><li>memory-burn: Simulates memory pressure</li><li>network-corrupt: Simulates network packet corruption</li><li>network-duplication: Simulates network packet duplication</li><li>network-latency: Simulate network latency</li><li>network-loss: Simulates network loss</li><li>network-partition: Simulates network partition</li><li>pod-failure: Simulates continuous unavailability of Kubernetes Pods</li><li>pod-kill: Simulates the Kubernetes Pod being killed</li></ul><h2>Visual chaos orchestration</h2><p>The Chaos Dashboard component is a one-stop web interface for Chaos Mesh users to orchestrate chaos experiments. Previously, Chaos Dashboard was only available for testing TiDB. With Chaos Mesh 1.0, it is available to everyone. Chaos Dashboard greatly simplifies the complexity of chaos experiments. With only a few mouse clicks, you can define the scope of the chaos experiment, specify the type of chaos injection, define scheduling rules, and observe the results of the chaos experiment—all in the same web interface.</p><p><img alt="Chaos Dashboard" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-0a1e48c54968d276f174801a1364ce21.gif"></p><h2>Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability</h2><p>To further improve the observability of chaos experiments, Chaos Mesh 1.0 includes a Grafana plug-in to allow you to directly display real-time chaos experiment information on your application monitoring panel. Currently, the chaos experiment information is displayed as annotations. This way, you can simultaneously observe the running status of the application and the current chaos experiment information.</p><p><img alt="Chaos status and application status on Grafana" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/chaos-status-460b054f3e2ee0898d2236a5137bc30e.png"></p><h2>Safe and controllable chaos</h2><p>When we conduct chaos experiments, it is vital that we keep strict control over the chaos scope or “blast radius.” Chaos Mesh 1.0 not only provides a wealth of selectors to accurately control the scope of the experiment, but it also enables you to set protected Namespaces to protect important applications. You can also use Namespace permissions to limit the scope of Chaos Mesh to a specific Namespace. Together, these features make chaos experiments with Chaos Mesh safe and controllable.</p><h2>Try it out now</h2><p>You can quickly deploy Chaos Mesh in your Kubernetes environment through the <code>install.sh</code> script or the Helm tool. For specific installation steps, please refer to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/installation/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh Getting Started</a> document. In addition, thanks to the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/interactiveTutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katakoda interactive tutorial</a>, you can also quickly get your hands on Chaos Mesh without having to deploy it.</p><p>If you haven’t upgraded to 1.0 GA, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1.0 Release Notes</a> for the changes and upgrade guidelines.</p><h2>Thanks</h2><p>Thanks to all our Chaos Mesh <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributors</a>!</p><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh, you’re welcome to join us by submitting issues, or contributing code, documentation, or articles. We look forward to your participation and feedback!</p></section></div>]]>

		<p><em>There are many frameworks with which to evaluate unintended consequences. So far in my writing here I’ve looked at examples arranged around a theme (species introduction, food, government policy, human behavior etc) where there is a somewhat clear relationship between cause and effect (even if sometimes only in hindsight). I haven’t yet touched frameworks of complexity and won’t do so until I go deeper into more second-order effects.</em></p>
<p><em>This week I step back and look at basic categories of unintended consequences and call out potential new areas of exposure to second-order effects.</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_499" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-499"><img src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Unintended-Consequences-Categories-1024x742.png" alt="Unintended Consequences Categories" width="525" height="380" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Unintended-Consequences-Categories-1024x742.png 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Unintended-Consequences-Categories-300x217.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Unintended-Consequences-Categories-768x556.png 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Unintended-Consequences-Categories.png 1390w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-499">General categories of unintended consequences</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Unexpected Benefits</strong> are, as the name describes, positive yet unplanned outcomes. I position the starting point (“Event”) differently since there was no related goal in these cases. In the chart above, the actual event (A) has happened and later on positive outcome (B) is found.</p>
<p>My earlier <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/what-are-unexpected-benefits/">post</a> calls into question some common examples of this category, such as no-man’s lands, sunken ships turning into reefs, and drugs producing unexpected benefits. And as we look for them broadly, benefits will always be found. Positive benefits are <strong>impossible to not find</strong> as long as you think broadly and creatively.</p>
<p>But my question is just how applicable the above common examples are as unexpected benefits. If we understand (or eventually understand) a cause and effect relationship, such as the reclamation of nature over a certain time in a new no-man’s land, then the benefit is <strong>predictable and even unavoidable</strong>. That doesn’t strike me as an unexpected. The new drug effect from above (where inter-reactions are not yet fully understood) is closer to a good example of this category. See my earlier <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/what-are-unexpected-benefits/">post</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Unexpected Drawbacks</strong>&nbsp;occur when an intended change in an item or group leads to a worsening in a different item or group.&nbsp;In the chart above, the goal was to improve (A) and later it is learned that (B) has been made worse.</p>
<p>Some of these drawbacks may be to populations smaller than the beneficiaries. For example, relatively larger passenger populations who benefit from rideshare companies do so while traditional taxi companies and taxi medallion owners suffer.</p>
<p>In addition to these examples, I believe a way to identify potential exposure to an unexpected drawback is to be aware of&nbsp;<a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/anything-at-scale/">anything new being done at scale</a>.</p>
<p>An example I have not yet written about is the change in media business models in the last couple decades. In general, in the past, access to national news media was limited and controlled in few popular TV networks and large-scale newspaper syndicates. With online distribution and the scattering of media sources from the above to include blogs, podcasts, social media, and more, the business model now revolves around fomenting arguments and taking sides in order to generate more views and shares, which then fuel ad revenue. Good for the media businesses that can do it, but it seems to be bad for media consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Perverse Results</strong> are often the most frustrating category, yet they are common.&nbsp;In the chart above, the goal was to improve (A) but what actually happens is (A) becomes worse.</p>
<p>We’ve discussed this category in <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/food-from-thought/">deep plow farming and agricultural subsidies</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-self-defeating-prophecy/">self-defeating prophesies</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/importing-risk-and-risky-regulations/">endangered species regulatory protection</a>, the <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-cobra-effect-redesigned/">cobra effect</a>, and more.</p>
<p>I do make the claim that in some situations (the animal examples of the cobra effect, especially) the solution is often built into the problem. In other situations, like in deep plowing, small tests could have prevented widescale adoption, but the issue was political, not scientific (or that science became political).</p>

<p>This is a short list of areas where there is potential for unintended consequences (though these have not yet become big problems and I hope they never will). I’ll cover this list and others in more detail in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/autonomous-vehicles-scaling-risk/"><strong>Autonomous vehicles</strong></a> (AVs). There is an expected class of social changes related to AVs that are linear in nature. That’s the problem with them… Traffic reduction (traffic might actually increase), accident reduction (yet there will then be exposure to systemic risk to hacking or bugs), and more.</p>
<p><strong>Cannabis legalization</strong>. If cannabis replaces alcohol as the intoxicant of choice, there will be different effects on health and behavior.</p>
<p><strong>CRISPR</strong>, the inexpensive gene editing technology was discovered and developed based on the process certain bacteria use. The potential for second-order effects comes from CRISPR’s low cost and availability and that changes made to organisms’ genes could mean that those changes are passed down to progeny.&nbsp;New unpredictable changes in future organisms could appear.</p>
<p><strong>Drones</strong>. As surveillance and military tools, drones change the risks shared between adversaries internationally. What will happen if the same technology is applied domestically in the US or other countries? Will the ease of drone weaponization mean that large outdoor gatherings will not be allowed (at least without anti-drone technology)?</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong>. The new need for endowment-building (I earlier did cover&nbsp;<a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-university-fundraising-arms-race/">university funding</a> as a forward-looking second-order effect) puts universities in a timing trade off (raise money now and potentially deal with more problems later).</p>
<p>Another potential effect: while the increase in STEM education has positive roots, what if the education as delivered actually bores students and turns them off to the sciences? Could STEM education have the reverse effect intended?</p>
<p>Also, the large growth in student loans, now at $1.4 trillion in the US, has the markings of a large potential problem waiting for a spark to set off defaults.</p>
<p><strong>Over-encouragement of startups</strong>. In some markets, startups are oversold as good choices for talent. But statistically, most of the time talent will earn less building a startup than working at a growth-stage or stable business. Then again, part of startup compensation comes from feeling excited about your work and the potential for asymmetric payoffs. In many markets, where startups are the most hyped, it is not the founders (who take more of the risk), but others who more regularly benefit. Groups more likely to benefit include investors who can spread their risk around, community organizers who build their own brand, and “sellers of shovels” to the startups themselves. So here the unintended consequence could be that by encouraging more startups, you actually make life more difficult for the startup founders.</p>
<p><em>OK, we stepped back this week and will be back with a new look at second-order effects next week.</em></p>
