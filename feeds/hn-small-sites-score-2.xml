<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><strong>Content amplification is one of the most underused&nbsp;pieces of the&nbsp;content marketing puzzle.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hands down.</strong></p>
<p><span>So many businesses create great content, but then they only publish that content on their own website, and maybe share it once or twice on social media.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry to break it to you, but with millions of other businesses doing the same thing, that isn't going to help you cut through the noise.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And hoping that someone will just stumble across your content isn’t a good strategy, either.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In reality, you need to <strong>AMPLIFY YOUR CONTENT</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Without content amplification, your hard work and effort will remain essentially “on the shelf collecting dust".</span></p>
<p><span>Creating content is less than half the battle. If you don't have a distribution, or amplification strategy for your content, then you're missing out on more traffic, more awareness, more backlinks, better SEO and a more engaged audience.</span></p>
<p><span>And, of course, all of the above <em>usually</em> lead to additional commercial benefits such as more customers and more sales.</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we’re going to break down content amplification, tell you what it is, how it works, and how you can get the most out of it so your content can start to work harder and more effectively for you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We’re going to answer the most common questions we get that relate to content amplification, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What is content amplification?</span></li>
<li><span>Why is content amplification so important?</span></li>
<li><span>How can I build a content amplification strategy?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>But enough with the preamble. Let’s jump in and get right into the good stuff.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.converge.today/uploads/engage/Content%202019/Mark%20Masters.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="150"></span></p>
<p><em>"The reason we shy away from content distribution or amplification is that it feels far better to be creative and produce, than it is to encourage people to watch/listen/read, as this side takes far more effort. Then again, the reason we are creating is to motivate people and get them to subscribe, enquire, interact and buy.</em></p>
<p><em>What is really important is to have something to say that can be amplified. Distribution channels work really well, once you have something to distribute. So, make sure that your message links to your values and that can strike a chord with others. This is how you find your allies, make sure your work is seen and people want to feel a part of it and prepared to stand with you."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Mark Masters - <a href="https://www.wearethemedia.co.uk/">We Are The Media</a></em></strong></p>
<p>What is content amplification, and why is it so important?</p>
<p><span>Content amplification is the act of promoting and distributing your content across multiple channels (paid, owned and earned) so you can increase the reach and impact of both your content and your brand.</span></p>
<p><span>However, amplifying your content does more than simply provide your brand with additional exposure. It also allows you to position yourself as a thought leader, and build valuable backlinks, as well as build relationships, and increase both engagement and conversion rates with your target audience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are many different ways to amplify content. Paying to promote your content on Facebook or Twitter, leveraging influencers to promote your content, publishing your content on </span><a href="https://promos.converge.today/join-converge"><span>other platforms with an already captivated audience</span></a><span> - they’re all different ways to amplify your content, and we’ll get into them in a bit more detail later on.</span></p>
<p><span>Without amplification, it’ll be much more difficult for you to get the results you want from your content.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Every single day, there are</span><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/blogs/"><span> millions of new blogs published</span></a><span>. Yes, not all of them will be competing with what you’ve created, but that’s a lot of potential noise getting in the way of your message. And organic reach is getting lower and lower all the time.</span></p>
<p><span>Because organic reach across the board is down, way down, when it comes to creating content - and you may be producing the best stuff out there - the likelihood is that without amplifying your content, it’s not going to perform well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.converge.today/uploads/engage/Content%202019/Cathy%20McPhillips.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="150"></span></p>
<p><em>“You’ve written an amazing article – and now what? You can’t expect the results to happen without some distribution work on your end. This includes content amplification – a multi-channel approach to increase your brand’s reach. It’s taking your owned media, and combining it with paid and earned media. It’s really knowing the right places – and people – to help amplify your message to your audience.</em></p>
<p><em>Through content amplification, you’re able to extend your reach into new areas you couldn’t achieve on your own through organic methods. It’s getting out of your echo chamber of your current customers and brand loyalists and finding new and relevant customers who wouldn’t have necessarily heard of you otherwise. Amplification done right brings customers to you who didn’t yet know how much they needed you.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Cathy McPhillips - <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/">Content Marketing Institute</a></em></strong></p>
<p>The problem with organic traffic</p>
<p><span>OK, that’s a little misleading. There is no problem with organic traffic.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem lies with the expectations people have when it comes to organic traffic. And, frankly, the delusion that generating it is both a) easily achievable and, b) that it is the only traffic source worth aiming for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Nope.</span></p>
<p><span>Listen, organic traffic is great. It’s wonderful. If you’re getting huge organic traffic and your website and blogs are appearing right at the top of search results for your most relevant and valuable keywords and phrases, then brilliant! You’ve smashed it already.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Chances are, though, that’s not the case. Because, 1) only a handful of businesses across the entire planet can claim to have achieved the above. And it’s a constant battle for them to remain at the top. And, 2) organic reach is in decline </span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/organic-reach-declining/"><span>across the board</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We’re not saying achieving a first page ranking on Google for your content is impossible, but it may take both time and resources that you currently don’t have to get there. So, before you become a high-ranking Google superstar, you must find another way to get eyeballs on your content.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to amplify content so you can generate the consistent traffic and backlinks you need to get it the awareness and engagement it deserves, and to get it started on the long, arduous climb towards the first page of search results.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.converge.today/uploads/engage/Content%202019/Abby%20Sorensen.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="150"></span></p>
<p><em>“Imagine this scenario at the most important trade show in your industry - Your sales team picks up their badges and heads for the show floor, eager to make connections and meet potential buyers. Your product/service is the exact right fit for these prospects, and your message has been carefully crafted to resonate with them. But your booth is set up at the empty convention center across town. Maybe you were trying to stretch your budget. Or maybe you thought your product/service was so exciting that buyers would go out of their way to find you. Your sales team heads back to the office empty-handed, a complete waste of time and energy spent setting up your booth where your buyers were not.</em></p>
<p><em>This is exactly what happens when you create content with no plan to distribute it.<strong> Only a select few companies can afford to buy their way to the top of Google’s search rankings.</strong> The only way to get the most out of your content is to distribute it where your buyers are likely to be. And while your website might be the most strategized, optimized, digitized, mobilized website in your market, your buyers simply are not likely to spend a great deal of time there (especially if you hit them with gates and form-fills).”</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Abby Sorensen - <a href="https://www.followyourbuyer.com/">Follow Your Buyer</a></em></strong></p>
<p>Creating content is less than half the battle</p>
<p><span>That’s right. All that time you spent researching, planning, creating and publishing content is less than half of what’s required to give your content the best chance of generating the return on investment you want from it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on who you talk to and the articles you read, you may have heard people saying content creation is anywhere from 20-40% of the job.</span></p>
<p><span>The rest of it? You guessed it; amplification/distribution/promotion - whatever you call it. Whatever it takes to get your content in front of everyone you want to read it.</span></p>
<p><span>But let’s not get bogged down in specific percentages. The only thing you need to know is that you need to spend more time promoting your hard work than you do creating it. Because the competition for attention is fierce, and you need to cut through the noise and make sure people are actually engaging with your content. Otherwise why spend the time creating it in the first place?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.converge.today/uploads/engage/Content%202019/Alexandra%20Cote.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="150"></span></p>
<p><em>"Beyond simply creating a really good post, you'll also need really great content amplification methods in place. In fact, everything that happens AFTER you publish a piece of content is much more important than the post itself. This is because sharing content across appropriate channels and talking about your findings and products gets your brand in front of more people.</em></p>
<p><em>This being said, content amplification is the core driver behind reaching your business goals and hitting your KPIs. Whether you want to improve your brand awareness, get more qualified leads, gain new partnerships, or just position yourself as a thought leader in the industry, content amplification can help you hit those targets. Do remember to stay away from vanity metrics though. Just because a lot of people like a post of yours on LinkedIn doesn't mean they read your article and it's a far cry from them actually making a purchase.</em></p>
<p><em>The best advice I have to ensure you're seeing real results from your content amplification techniques is to choose the right networks and websites to promote your content. You'll first need a clear image of your buyer persona. By analyzing potential customers and their behavior, you'll see where they spend most of their time and, above all, what determines them to make a purchase decision. Then, all you have to do is craft the right messaging revolving around the benefits they're looking to get and stay consistent on a couple of networks of choice. Feel free to include the same terms and pain points they use and remember to be responsive so the conversation is bidirectional."</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What are secrets in the software development world?</p><div><p>In the common language, a secret can be any sensitive data that we want to keep private. When discussing secrets in the context of software development, secrets generally refer to digital authentication credentials that grant access to systems or data. These are most commonly API keys, usernames and passwords, or security certificates.</p><p>Secrets exist in the context of applications that are no longer standalone monoliths. Applications nowadays rely on thousands of independent building blocks: cloud infrastructure, databases, SaaS components such as Stripe, Slack, HubSpot…&nbsp;</p><p>Secrets are what tie together these different building blocks of a single application by creating a secure connection between each component.</p></div><p>What is secret sprawl?</p><div><p>Secret sprawl is the unwanted distribution of secrets like API keys and credentials through multiple systems.&nbsp;</p><p>In modern software development, secrets are regularly used by developers and applications. As a result they often get shared through different services like Slack or email and can be stored in multiple locations including different machines, git repositories or inside company wikis. This is a phenomenon we call secret sprawl.</p></div><p>What are some of the best practices to securely manage secrets like API keys?</p><div><p>Storing and managing secrets like API keys and other credentials can be challenging. Even the most careful policies can sometimes be circumvented in exchange for convenience. We have put together a helpful <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management/" target="_blank">cheat sheet</a> and article explaining the <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management/" target="_blank">best practices for managing secrets</a>.</p><p>As a minimum here are some points you should consider:</p></div><div><p>Never store unencrypted secrets in git repositories</p></div><div><p>Avoid git add * commands on git</p></div><div><p>Add sensitive files in .gitignore</p></div><div><p>Don’t rely on code reviews to discover secrets</p></div><div><p>Use automated secrets scanning on repositories</p></div><div><p>Don’t share your secrets unencrypted in messaging systems like Slack</p></div><div><p>Store secrets safely (method to be used depends on every use case)</p></div><div><p>Default to minimal permission scope for APIs</p></div><div><p>Whitelist IP addresses where appropriate</p></div><p>What are the threats associated with secret sprawl?</p><div><p>When secrets are sprawled through multiple systems it increases what is referred to as the ‘attack surface’. This is the amount of points where an unauthorized user could gain access to your systems or data. In the case of secret sprawl, each time a secret enters another system it is another point where an attacker could gain access to your secrets.</p><p>Most internal systems are not an appropriate place to store sensitive information, even if those systems are private. No company wants credit card numbers in plaintext in databases, PII in application logs, bank account credentials in a Google Doc. Secrets benefit from the same kind of protective measures.</p><p>As a general security principle, where feasible, data should remain safe even if it leaves the devices, systems, infrastructure or networks that are under organizations’ control, or if they are compromised. This helps prevent credential stealing, which is a well-known adversary technique described in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework:</p></div><p>“ Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing passwords. These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/ binary files containing embedded passwords. ”<br></p><p>Secrets accessed by malicious threat actors can lead to information leakage and allow lateral movement or privilege escalation, as secrets very often lead to other secrets. Furthermore, once an attacker has the credentials to operate like a valid user, it is extremely difficult to detect the abuse and the threat can become persistent.<br></p><p>What are some of the biggest challenges associated with secret sprawl?</p><div><p>Because secrets tie together each component of an application, developers and ops need access to these secrets to build, connect, test and deploy applications. The result is that secrets need to be both tightly wrapped and also widely distributed. </p><p>Enforcing good security practices at the organization level is hard. Developers today can have large turnovers inside companies, be spread through many different teams and geographies. They have a growing number of technologies they must master and are under hard pressure due to shortened release cycles. This makes secret management very complicated and an ever changing challenge. </p><p>This is further complicated when VCS like git are introduced because secrets can be buried deep inside the history. The actual version of source code might look clean, while the history might present credentials that were added than later removed. Any secret reaching the Version Control System must be considered compromised and the presence of valid secrets in the git history presents a threat!</p></div></div></div>]]>

October 1, 2020 | https://www.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection/how-to-detect-secrets-in-source-code | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection/how-to-detect-secrets-in-source-code">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why is it hard to detect secrets like API keys and other credentials?</p><div><p>Secrets detection is probabilistic—that is to say that it is not always possible to determine what is a true secret (or true positive). Because secrets share very few common, distinctive factors, decisions must be taken by aggregating weak signals to make strong predictions. </p><p>One of the most common factors is that almost all secrets are strings that look random. We call these strings high entropy strings. The issue is that this common factor is not very distinctive: 99% of strings that look random in source code aren’t secrets. They are for example database IDs or other types of false positives. </p><p>Of course, some secrets have fixed patterns: AWS keys often start with AKIA for example. But most secrets do not. The portions of code surrounding them are also very different, depending on what the secrets are used for and how they are used by the developers in the context of specific applications. Usernames and passwords can be used to authenticate in many different ways, and it is really hard to distinguish between real and fake credentials used as placeholders for example. </p><p>All this makes it extremely challenging to accurately capture all true secrets without also capturing false positives. At some point, a line in the sand needs to be drawn that considers the cost of a secret going undetected (a false negative) and compares it to the outcome that too many false positives would create. Different organizations with different people, cultures and workflows will draw different lines!</p></div><p>Why do code reviews fail at finding secrets in source code?</p><p>Code reviews are great overall for detecting logic flaws or maintaining certain good coding practices. But they are not adequate protection for detecting secrets, mostly for two reasons:<br></p><div><p>Reviews generally only consider the net difference between the current and proposed states. Not the entire history of changes. If a commit adds a secret and another one later deletes it, this has a zero net effect that is not of any interest to reviewers. But the vulnerability is there.</p></div><div><p>Reviewers prefer to focus on errors that cannot be automatically detected, like design flaws. As a general principle, security automation should be implemented wherever it can be, so that humans focus on where they bring the most value.</p></div><p>What is a "good" secrets detection algorithm?</p><div><p>Detecting secrets in source code is like finding needles in a haystack: there are a lot more sticks than there are needles, and you don’t know how many needles might be in the haystack. In the case of secrets detection, you don’t even know what all the needles look like!</p><p>Ideally, you want your detection system to achieve at the same time:</p></div><div><p>A low number of false alerts raised. We call this high precision. Precision answers the question: «What is the percentage of the secrets that you detect that are actual secrets?». This question is perfectly legitimate, especially in the context of security teams being overwhelmed with too many alerts.</p></div><div><p>A low number of secrets missed. This is what we call high recall. Considering that a single undetected credential can have a big impact for an organization, some organizations prefer to triage more false alerts but make sure they don’t miss a secret.</p></div><p>Balancing the equation to ensure that the algorithm captures as many secrets as possible without flagging too many false results is an intricate and extremely difficult challenge. Read more on evaluating <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection-accuracy-precision-recall-explained/" target="_blank">secrets detection algorithms</a>.<br></p><p>What is a false positive in secrets detection?</p><div><p>A false positive in secrets detection refers to when a secret candidate is wrongly marked as a true secret when it is in fact a non-sensitive string. </p><p>Typical examples of strings that can be mistaken for true secrets are:</p></div><div><p>UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) that are used for example by databases as unique keys.</p></div><div><p>High entropy URLs or file paths. They often contain random strings that look like keys.</p></div><p>Examples of server-side hooks:<br></p><div><p>Test keys. Service Providers sometimes provide developers with a set of test credentials with a very restricted scope so developers can exercise parts of the API without charging their account</p></div><div><p>Public keys. As surprising as it is, a very small number of keys are really meant to be public (like Firebase keys, see this Stack Overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37482366/is-it-safe-to-expose-firebase-apikey-to-the-public" target="_blank">conversation</a>).</p></div><p>Are secrets detection algorithms language-dependent?</p><p>Secrets detection is, for the most part, not language specific. Of course, there are some subtleties to take into account, like the way variables are assigned in any programming language. But there is no need to support all the different syntaxes in their greatest details. This means that the same algorithms can be applied to any project, in any programming language, without using things like Abstract Syntax Trees.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My source code is private, so why is hardcoding credentials in git considered a bad practice?</p><div><p>While private repositories offer some level of protection for your code they still do not have adequate protection to store information as sensitive as secrets. </p><p>Imagine if there was a plain text file with all your credit card numbers within it, you hopefully wouldn’t put this into the companies git repository.

But this increases complexity and opens up a new set of security problems. With DevOps, existing security vulnerabilities can be magnified and manifest themselves in new ways. The speed of software creation can mean new vulnerabilities are created unseen by developers. The solution is to build security monitoring into the DevOps process from the start.”<br></p><p>Greg Day, RSA Conference Organizer (<a href="https://www.securityroundtable.org/the-biggest-cybersecurity-risks-in-2020/" target="_blank">source</a>)<br></p><p>Security now needs to be part of the SDLC from the start, and part of every incremental change. This concept is called Shifting Left, a development principle which states that security should move from the right (or end) of the SDLC to the left (the beginning). A great deal of automation is needed in order to be able to cope with running security checks at each incremental change. &nbsp;Automation helps streamline the detection, alerting and remediation processes and workflows.<br></p><p>How does secrets detection compare with Static Application Security Testing (SAST)?</p><div><p>Secrets detection is often confused with SAST because both scan through static source code. </p><p>SAST is mostly testing control structure, input validation, error handling, etc. Such vulnerabilities like SQL injection vulnerabilities only express themselves the moment the code is deployed. Exposed secrets are unlike these vulnerabilities, because any secret reaching version control system must be considered compromised and requires immediate attention. This is true even if the code is never deployed. </p><p>Implementing secrets detection is not only about scanning the most actual version of your master branch before deployment. It is also about scanning through every single commit of your git history, covering every branch, even development or test ones.</p><p>To conclude, SAST is concerned only with the current version of a project, the version that is going to be deployed, whereas secrets detection is concerned with the entire history of the project.</p></div><p>What are git hooks?</p><div><p>Git hooks are scripts that are triggered by certain actions in the software development process, like committing or pushing. By automatically pointing out issues in code, they allow reviewers not to waste time on mistakes that can be easily diagnosed by a machine. </p><p>There are client-side hooks, that execute locally on the developers’ workstation, and server-side hooks, that execute on the centralized version control system.</p><p>Examples of client-side hooks:</p></div><p>Examples of server-side hooks:<br></p><p>What is a pre-commit hook?</p><div><p>"The pre-commit hook is run first when committing, before you even type in a commit message. It’s used to inspect the snapshot that’s about to be committed, to see if you’ve forgotten something, to make sure tests run, or to examine whatever you need to inspect in the code. </p><p>Exiting non-zero from this hook aborts the commit, although you can bypass it with <span>git commit --no-verify</span>. You can do things like check for code style (run lint or something equivalent), check for trailing whitespace, or check for appropriate documentation on new methods."</p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks" target="_blank">git-scm</a><br></p><p>What is a pre-receive hook?</p><div><p>A pre-receive hook is a script that runs on the server. It performs checks on the content of the push; if it exits non-zero, the push is rejected. You can use this hook to do things like prevent a PR author from merging their own changes, or require commit messages to follow some specific guidelines. </p><p>Be careful when using pre-receive hooks as they are blocking: if the checks don’t pass, the server is not updated.</p></div><p>What is a post-receive hook?</p><p>"The post-receive hook runs after the entire process of pushing code to the server is completed and can be used to update other services or notify users. Examples include emailing a list, notifying a continuous integration server, or updating a ticket-tracking system – you can even parse the commit messages to see if any tickets need to be opened, modified, or closed. This script can’t stop the push process, but the client doesn’t disconnect until it has completed, so be careful if you try to do anything that may take a long time."<br></p><p>Source: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks" target="_blank">git-scm</a><br></p><p>Unlike the pre-receive hook, post-receive is non-blocking.<br></p><p>Where in the DevOps pipeline to implement automated secrets scanning? Client-side or server-side?</p><div><p>The earlier a security vulnerability is uncovered, the less costly it is to correct. Hardcoded secrets are no exceptions. If the secret is uncovered after the secret reaches centralized version control server-side, it must be considered compromised, which requires rotating (revoking and redistributing) the exposed credential. This operation can be complex and typically involves multiple stakeholders.</p><p>Client-side secrets detection early in the software development process is a nice-to-have as it will prevent secrets entering the VCS earlier. </p><p>Server-side secrets detection is a must have:</p></div><div><p>&nbsp;Server-side is where the ultimate threat lies. From the server, the code can uncontrollably spread in a lot of different places, with the hardcoded secrets in it.</p></div><div><p>Implementing client-side hooks on an organization level is hard. This is something we have heard many application security professionals claim they are not confident to do, due to the difficulty to deploy and update this on every developer’s workstation.</p></div><div><p>Client-side hooks can and must be easy to bypass (remember secret detection is probabilistic). Usage of client side hooks largely comes down to the individual developers’ responsibility. Hence the need to have visibility over the later stages.</p></div><p>Should secrets detection be blocking or non-blocking in the SDLC?</p><div><p>From our experience, when trying to impose rules that are too constraining, people will bend them, often in an effort to collaborate better and do their job. Security must not be a blocker. It should allow flexibility and enable information to flow, yet enable visibility and control. </p><p>On one hand, security measures will be bypassed, sometimes for the worst. But on the other hand, it is also good sometimes that the developer can take the responsibility to bypass them. </p><p>Because even the best algorithms can fail and need human judgement. Secrets detection is probabilistic: algorithms achieve a tradeoff between not raising false alerts and not missing keys.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>A Dutch man who has been unable to move and speak for eight years due to brain damage, can temporarily do so after taking the sleeping drug Zolpidem.  Brain scans show that the sleeping pill removes an obstacle to these actions, scientists from Radboudumc and Amsterdam UMC report Thursday.</p>
<p>In men, the brain activity for moving and talking is drowned out by the brain activity for the transfer of information.</p>
<p>“You could compare the brain, as it were, to a large string orchestra”, explains fellow researcher Hisse Arnts.  “With Richard (the man, ed.) The first violins play so loud that they drown out the other members of the string orchestra and people can no longer hear each other. Zolpidem ensures that these first violins play more ‘pianissimo’, so that everyone back within time. “</p>
<p>The fact that the man does not go to sleep because of Zolpidem is probably due to the way his brain has become confused, Arnts thinks.  The problem, however, is that the man gets used to the sleeping aid, so that the effect becomes shorter and shorter.  Yet he still receives it regularly and the discovery is a promising starting point for further research.</p>
<p>The man is not the first to return to a normal situation briefly with such a means;  there are similar reports from Italy and South Africa.  But how that is possible has now been determined for the first time on the basis of scans, according to the medical centers.</p>

<p>The man, in his late twenties at the time, suffered a severe lack of oxygen eight years ago due to choking.  He ended up in a nursing home with the very rare diagnosis of akinetic mutism.  Because Richard’s situation seemed hopeless, it was decided to give him the remedy.</p>

<p>In his first media interview following his poisoning, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny expresses his "tremendous gratitude to all Germans" in an interview with the newsmagazine DER SPIEGEL. In the interview, he says that although he never had close ties to Germany, it was German politicians and Chancellor Angela Merkel who saved his life. He says the doctors at Berlin's Charité University Hospital saved his life for a second time and nursed him back to health. "I know it sounds a bit over the top, but Germany has become a special country for me," Navalny says. Describing the personal visit paid to him by Merkel last week, he says: "I was impressed by the detail she knows about <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/thema/russia_en/" data-link-flag="english">Russia</a> and my case."</p>



<section data-area="contentbox">

<p>Navalny says he is doing "much better than three weeks ago, and things are getting better each day." The doctors say he could get back to 90 percent of his former self, perhaps even 100 percent, although no one knows for sure. "Basically, I’m a bit of a guinea pig," he says. "There aren’t many people you can observe who are still alive after being poisoned with a nerve agent." Describing the moment in the airplane when the poison started to take effect, Navalny says: "You feel no pain, but you know you’re dying. And I mean, right now. Even though nothing hurts you." You just think: This is the end. "Organophosphorus compounds attack your nervous system like a DDos attack attacks the computer - it's an overload that breaks you," he told DER SPIEGEL.</p>

<div>
<p>"I assert that <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/thema/vladimir_putin_en/" data-link-flag="english">Putin</a> was behind the crime, and I have no other explanation for what happened." Despite the attempt on his life, he says he wants to return to Russia. "And my job now is to remain the guy who isn’t afraid. And I’m not afraid! When my hands shake, it’s not from fear – it’s from this stuff. I would not give Putin the gift of not returning to Russia."</p><p>When asked whether he thinks Germany should stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 Russian gas pipeline project, Navalny didn’t want to answer. "That’s Germany’s business. Decide for yourself!" Any strategy toward Russia must "take into account the level of insanity that Putin has reached."</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Are you an 8-bit or a 32-bit programmer? </p>

<p>At OMZLO, we have been mainly focussing our development efforts on newer 32-bit Arm-Cortex chips (STM32 and SAMD), which typically offer more RAM, more speed, more peripherals, at a similar or lower price-point than older 8-bit MCUs. But 8-bit MCUs are far from dead. Microchip has notably released a new series of chips, collectively branded as the "tinyAVR 0-series", which offer more modern peripherals than the older AVR chips at a very competitive price point. They seem like the perfect candidate for simple products that don't need all the features and fine-tuning capabilities of the newer 32-bit MCUs. 8-bit MCUs are also substantially simpler to program, which translates into faster development time. </p>

<p>Thanks to the success of the Arduino UNO, there are tons of tutorials online that explain how to program 8-bit Atmega328 microcontrollers and their cousins like the Attiny85 using direct register access, without the Arduino language or any vendor IDE such as Atmel Studio. Just google "atmega328 blinky". All you need is an AVR C-compiler, a text editor, <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/">avrdude</a>, and an AVR programmer. Some <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Getting-Started-With-the-ATMega328P/">resources</a> even show how to also build the electronics needed to get a basic atmega328 running on a breadboard. However, it's hard to find the same information for these newer "tinyAVR 0" chips.</p>

<p>Of course, Microchip offers all the tools necessary to program these newer "TinyAVR" MCUs with their windows-only IDE. There are also "Arduino cores" for some of these newer "TinyAVR" MCUs that let you program them with the Arduino IDE. But again, if you like to write code for MCUs in "baremetal" style, with your favorite text editor, a makefile, and a c-compiler, there are few resources available online. </p>

<p>In this blog post, we will describe how to program a <a href="https://www.ladyada.net/learn/proj1/blinky.html">blinky</a> firmware on an <strong>Attiny406</strong>, from the ground up, using the simplest tools. Most of the things described here can be easily transposed to other TinyAVR MCUs. Our approach is generally guided toward macOS or Linux users, but should also be applicable in an MS-Windows environment with a few minor changes.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>We decided to play with the <a href="https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATTINY406">Attiny406</a>, with a view of using it in the future to replace the Attiny45 we currently use on the <a href="https://www.omzlo.com/articles/the-piwatcher">PiWatcher</a>, our Raspberry-Pi watchdog. The Attiny406 has 4K of flash space, 256 bytes of RAM, and can run at 20Mhz without an external clock source.</p>

<p>One of the most important differences between the new TinyAVR MCUs and the older classic AVR MCU like the Attiny85 is that the newer chips use a different programming protocol called UPDI, which requires only 3 pins, as opposed to the 6-pin ISP on the classic AVRs.</p>

<p>A little research shows that programming TinyAVRs with UPDI can be achieved with a simple USB-to-serial cable and a resistor, thanks to a python tool called <a href="https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi">pyupdi</a>, which suggests the following connection diagram for firmware upload:</p>
<pre>                        Vcc                     Vcc

</pre>
<h3 id="shematic">shematic</h3>

<p>We created a minimalistic breakout board for the Attiny406. The board can be powered by 5V through USB or a lower 3.3V through dedicated VCC/GND pins. An LED and a button were also fitted on the board. For testing purposes, we decided to embed the 4.7K resistor needed for the UPDI programming directly in the hardware (i.e. resistor <em>R2</em>). 
This gives us the following schematic:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.omzlo.com/uploads/attiny406-schematic.png" alt="schematic"></p>

<h3 id="board">Board</h3>

<p>The resulting breakout board is tiny and fits conveniently on a small breadboard. The design files are <a href="https://aisler.net/p/SIEGFIYL">shared on aisler.net</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.omzlo.com/uploads/std_attiny-406-breadboard.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Programming the Attiny406 on the board with a USB-serial cable is done by connecting the headers on the board edge:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.omzlo.com/uploads/attiny406-prog.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<h3 id="pyudpi">pyudpi</h3>

<p>We installed <strong>pyupdi</strong> following the instructions provided on <a href="https://github.com/mraardvark/pyupdi">their webpage</a>. </p>

<p>We connected our USB-Serial cable to the board with the 4 dedicated UPDI pins available on the board. Our USB-Serial converter shows up as the file <code>/dev/tty.usbserial-FTF5HUAV</code> on a MacOS system.</p>

<p>To test that the programmer recognizes the Attiny406, you can issue a command similar to the following, adapting the path for the USB-serial converter to your setup:</p>
<pre>pyupdi -d tiny406 -c /dev/tty.usbserial-FTF5HUAV -i
</pre>
<p>This should result in the following output if all goes well:</p>
<pre>Device info: {'family': 'tinyAVR', 'nvm': 'P:0', 'ocd': 'D:0', 'osc': '3', 'device_id': '1E9225', 'device_rev': '0.1'}
</pre>
<h3 id="the-c-compiler">The C compiler</h3>

<p>The typical <strong>avr-gcc</strong> available on macOS with <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> did not seem to recognize the Attiny406 as a compiler target, so we went off to install the avr-gcc compiler provided by Microchip, which is available <a href="https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/avr-and-arm-toolchains-c-compilers">here</a>. Downloading the compiler requires you to create an account on the Microchip website, which is a bit annoying. </p>

<p><img src="https://www.omzlo.com/uploads/avr-toolchain.png" alt="AVR toolchain link"></p>

<p>Once downloaded, we extracted the provided archive in a dedicated directory. The <code>bin</code> directory in the archive should be added to the <code>PATH</code> variable to make your life easier. Assuming the downloaded compiler is stored in the directory <code>$HOME/Src/avr8-gnu-toolchain-darwin_x86_64</code>, the PATH can be altered by adding the following line to your <code>.bash_profile</code> file:</p>
<pre>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Src/avr8-gnu-toolchain-darwin_x86_64/bin/
</pre>
<p>Newer Attiny MCUs are not supported out of the box by the Microchip <strong>avc-gcc</strong> compiler. You need to download a dedicated <em>Attiny Device Pack</em> from <a href="http://packs.download.atmel.com/">their website</a>, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.omzlo.com/uploads/microchip-pack-repository.png" alt="AVR toolchain link"></p>

<p>The resulting downloaded <em>Device Pack</em> is named <code>Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.6.326.atpack</code> (or similar depending on versioning). Though the extension is <code>.atpack</code>, the file is actually a zip archive. We changed the extension to <code>.zip</code> and extracted the package in the directory <code>$HOME/Src/Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.6.326</code> next to the compiler files. </p>

<h3 id="c-program">C program</h3>

<p>We created the following program that blinks the LED on pin PB5 of our Attiny board at a frequency of 1Hz.</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
<p>The code looks very similar to what you would see on a classic AVR "blinky" program. One visible change is the use of structures to access various registers of the MCU: e.g instead of setting bits in <code>PORTB</code>, you access <code>PORTB.DIRSET</code>.</p>

<p>The other visible change is the clock setup code <code>_PROTECTED_WRITE(CLKCTRL.MCLKCTRLB, 0)</code>. Out of the box, at reset, the Attiny406 runs at 3.33Mhz, which corresponds to a base frequency of 20Mhz with a 6x clock divider applied. To enable the full 20Mhz speed, the register <code>CLKCTRL.MCLKCTRLB</code> is cleared. Because this register needs to be protected against accidental changes, the Attiny406 requires a specific programming sequence to modify it. Fortunately, this is natively offered by the macro <code>_PROTECTED_WRITE</code>. More details are available in the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATtiny406-DataSheet-DS40001976B.pdf">Attiny406 datasheet</a>.</p>

<p>In comparison with an STM32 or a SAMD21, the code is blissfully simple. </p>

<h3 id="makefile">Makefile</h3>

<p>We assume the following directory structure where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Src/Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.6.326/</code> is the location of the Microchip <em>Device Pack</em></li>
<li><code>Src/attiny406-test/</code> is the directory where the code above is stored in a file called <code>main.c</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Compiling the code can be done by issuing the following command within <code>attiny406-test/</code> directory,:</p>
<pre>avr-gcc -mmcu=attiny406 -B ../Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.6.326/gcc/dev/attiny406/ -O3 -I ../Atmel.ATtiny_DFP.1.6.326/include/ -DF_CPU=20000000L -o attiny406-test.elf main.c
</pre>
<p>An <code>-O</code> optimization flag is required to make the <code>_delay_ms()</code> function calls work successfully, as well as defining the variable F_CPU to reflect the expected chip clock speed. The rest of the parameters provide the location of the Attiny406 device-specific files we previously extracted from the <em>Device Pack</em>.</p>

<p>Uploading the firmware to the MCU requires a conversion to the intel HEX format and a call to the <strong>pyupdi</strong> tool. To address all these steps, we created a simple Makefile.</p>

<p>To compile the code, we simply type <code>make</code>. Uploading is done with <code>make flash</code>. This Makefile can be further enhanced as needed.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>With the right tools, baremetal programming on the new TinyAVR MCUs is as simple as on its older AVR cousins. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/hacktoberfest.webp" alt="Post cover image"><h2 id="what-is-asyncapi">What is AsyncAPI</h2><p>AsyncAPI is a specification for describing your <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/getting-started/event-driven-architectures/">event-driven architecture</a>. You are probably using already <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/getting-started/coming-from-openapi/">OpenAPI/Swagger specification</a> for describing your synchronous RESTful APIs. AsyncAPI is something that supplements OpenAPI. As an example, you should use AsyncAPI when your services do not talk to each other directly but through a message broker.</p><p>In contrast to the OpenAPI Initiative, AsyncAPI Initiative is focused not only on creating and evolving the AsyncAPI specification but also on its tooling. It is a vendor-neutral space for the community to work together on the spec and its tools. We work on tools like specification parsers or docs and code generators.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pU71J-F7pfI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="what-is-hacktoberfest-and-why-asyncapi-initiative-joins-it">What Is Hacktoberfest And Why AsyncAPI Initiative Joins It</h2><p><a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> is a well-known event that promotes open source contributions. In short, you have the entire October to submit four pull requests to any project you want, and in exchange, you get a super cool t-shirt. Is that it? Is it just for a t-shirt? Nah, the t-shirt is nice but what you also get is easy access to open source world. Maintainers of many projects open up for contributions, and it is a great chance to make your first step to joining this fantastic world.</p><p>AsyncAPI Initiative joins the Hacktoberfest for two main reasons:</p><ul><li>Promote AsyncAPI Initiative as a place where we don't work on the specification only but also build a lot of great tools</li><li>Make it much easier for the community to make the first contribution to one of the AsyncAPI repositories</li></ul><p>In the past, we were also there where you are now, shy and uncertain if we can impact open source community. We want to give you an easy path to take the first baby steps in the world of open source in a welcoming and friendly environment.</p><blockquote><p>Don't forget to <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/login">sign up</a> to the Hacktoberfest</p></blockquote><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_1WRr3Ml9t4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="how-can-you-help">How Can You Help</h2><p>There is always a lot of work waiting out there. For the sake of this special event, we prepared around 75 GitHub issues that you can pick up. They represent different areas (for example, JavaScript or HTML), different difficulty (for example, 50 issues are easy), and different repositories. No matter if they are trivial or demanding, all of them are important for us. Even with trivial ones where you, for example, need to remove a semicolon, we will still be super happy because this will improve the quality of the project (SonarCloud reports). In other words, every single issue from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX4J395apexutfQ0OSqPNltFKDacmemHZwCmOXwHNLo/edit?usp=sharing">this</a> list is important.</p><h3 id="1-pick-the-right-issue">1. Pick The Right Issue</h3><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX4J395apexutfQ0OSqPNltFKDacmemHZwCmOXwHNLo/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> you can find a list of all the issues that you can work on. Most of the issues are about code contribution, but not all of them. There are also issues about documentation or CI/CD configuration (we use GitHub Actions). Just pick the issues you want to work on, one at a time, and let us know in the comments section that you want to work on it.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iqs_2BiNEEo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3 id="2-setup-your-environment-and-create-a-first-pull-request">2. Setup Your Environment And Create A First Pull Request</h3><p>Once you <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">install Git</a> on your machine and get a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a>, you need first to decide if you are here just for Hacktoberfest or longer, and make sure if your issue is easy and maybe you can complete it in the GitHub UI. </p><p>In case you are here just for the Hacktoberfest, and you picked easy issues that involve changes only to a single file, there is no need to install Git and complicate your life. GitHub UI enables you to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository">make changes to a single file online</a>.</p><p>In case you:</p><ul><li>want to stay with us longer,</li><li>you picked up an issue where you need to make changes to more than just one file,</li><li>you also need to run the project locally to check if it works</li></ul><p>Then follow <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/git-workflow.md">this</a> short instruction on how to fork the repository and set it up locally.</p><p>Once you are ready with your changes, submit a pull request. Be nice and follow our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">code of conduct</a> and make sure your pull request is <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#conventional-commits">described properly</a>.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsC5tu4M1rw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h2><p>Do you feel overwhelmed? No need. You can do it. Just take this blog post seriously. </p><p>Trust me when I write that every pull request is crucial for us.
Trust me when I write that we are a welcoming community.
Don't be afraid that you will waste our time. If we would think about it this way, we would not even join the Hacktoberfest.</p><p>Still not sure if you can make it? Don't worry. We want to host office hours throughout the event, 2x a week, 1h long, and different time zones. You can join whenever you want and ask us anything, or do pair programming with us.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><section><div><div><div><div><div><div>
<p>This is a reflection on software development and complexity. Let's start with
some quotes to make me look smart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple
system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and
cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working
simple system -- <em>Gall's law</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I only came across this quote recently, but I think that it summarizes what
I've learned these past seven years. Another idea that I've found in a few books
is that programming in isolation is problem-solving, but software engineering
is all about managing complexity. This distinction between programming and
software engineering makes sense to me, probably because of my mental models.
I'm sure we can all disagree on this, but that's not the topic of today.
Complexity is.</p>
<h2>Complexity</h2>
<p>Almost everyone I know in the software industry wants to build products that
solve real and challenging problems. Change the world! The last thing you want
is to build another CRUD application. They are fine, but it gets boring after
a while.</p>
<p>Most of us will get bored without novelty. That's why the software industry has
a recycling mechanism to keep things fresh and interesting for us: every once
in a while a new, or different, language/framework will rise and light the path
for a brighter future, overthrowing the existing standard, demanding that we
learn it to be on top of the game.</p>
<p>We change our tools, but we keep building the same things over and over. I've
been doing this long enough to see that we are just going in circles. Let's be
honest, most of us aren't building life-changing products that wouldn't have
been possible ten years ago, so let's not jump straight into another shiny
technology that just came out and is going to solve all of our problems.</p>
<h2>Solutions, solutions, solutions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For a while, the solution to every problem I encountered was a Rails app. --
<em>this one is mine</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the years, I've seen companies rewrite their products to change languages,
frameworks, or architectures because they were told that the change would make
their product better, run faster, and scale. By the way, you're only a true
Ruby developer after you've heard the question "but does it scale?" at least
one hundred times (kidding, but it'll happen).</p>
<p>Think about it, how many times were you sold a new programming language,
technology, or a concept like microservices, serverless, event sourcing, clean
architecture, micro frontends. There are many preachers in the software world.</p>
<p>At Subvisual, we started using Elixir a lot these past years, so I've learned
a bit about the history of Erlang. If you don't know, Erlang uses the Actor
Model, and the interesting part is that the designers of Erlang only learned
about the Actor Model after having designed Erlang. This is important because
the designers of Erlang didn't start with the intent of applying the Actor
Model; it came as a solution to fault-tolerant distributed programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail <em>Abraham Maslow</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The designers of Erlang picked the right tool for the job and most of us want
to do the same. Unfortunately, there's usually more than one "tool" that would
be "right," but to know which ones, you need to know what "job" you're solving.
All of us <strong>should</strong> know this, but I keep learning about teams that fail to do
it. There are so many companies, with a handful of experienced developers, that
don't know what they are building, don't have a clear business yet, but their
product is already built on complex architectures and technologies such as
microservices, Kubernetes or event-sourcing.</p>
<h2>Improving</h2>
<p>Every project we start from scratch is an opportunity to do it right. We'll
think to ourselves: <em>This time I won't fall into the same traps! I have learned
my lessons, I've studied the books, and I even met some of my gurus that wrote
them! This time I'll follow "industry standards"!</em></p>
<p><em>I am the "architect"; I will design the perfect system! Without me, none of
this will be possible. Those mindless programmers have no idea what they are
doing. I, and only I, am the true heir of Martin Fowler!</em></p>
<p>This was a bit dramatic, but I needed a break from all of that whining. I know
it's easy to fall into these traps. It's even easier when your company raised
money, and everyone is expecting you to deliver the absolute best product ever
because they are paying you for it! This is why your starting team is so
important; they have to withstand the pressure. They must know that to build
the grand vision, they have to go one step at a time.</p>
<h2>The decision</h2>
<p>I've made many bad decisions, and I've been fortunate enough to suffer the
consequences of those decisions. A lot of developers don't get to experience
consequences, so they never learn.</p>
<p>So what was the worst decision of my career? I don't know. But the title of
this blog post is inspired by something an old colleague said. At the time, we
were working for a product company that reached for event-driven architecture
and event-sourcing too soon. They knew little about their market, and the
choices the software team made were crippling their ability to change. Business
rules were almost set in stone. Migrating data was a pain and the source of
many bugs. And unfortunately, because the team didn't have experience with
event-sourcing, the event store, which kept the state of all services, was also
being used as an event-bus to communicate between services. Because of that, it
was possible to couple one service to the internal state of another, which
happened a lot. This almost invisible coupling made everything worse.</p>
<p>What did we do against such an unpredictable system? We took it apart: merging
services that were too coupled; defining clear boundaries between services;
moving some services away from the event-store into a traditional database;
making some communication channels synchronous; writing integration and
end-to-end tests.</p>
<p>When we were finished it was still an unnecessarily complex system, but it was
one that we could change with some confidence. After that, we defined
a long-term plan for the product's architecture and technology, but we didn't
implement it. We waited for the right moment when something was starting to
slow us down to make a small step in that direction. When the business goals
changed, we changed our long-term plan, and once again made small steps in that
direction when we felt the need for it.</p>
<p>Eventually, complexity found its way again into the codebase, but it was fine
because the codebase was evolving slowing, adding and removing complexity when
necessary.</p>
<h2>Making the right call</h2>
<p>Was that the worst decision of his career? I don't think so. The issue with him
going for event-sourcing and event-driven architecture was that it wasn't the
right moment, but my colleague didn't know that. He thought the goals for the
next years were well defined, but unfortunately, they never are.</p>
<p>Should you use microservices or event-sourcing? Maybe, it depends on the
context and the client. The decisions I make are the best that I can with the
information that I have. For instance, when I'm part of the team that's
starting a product, the technology we pick will depend on how we'll hire: if
you want to build an office in Portugal, we have to make sure we have
developers for that technology available. We have to think things through, and
some things you only learn from experience. This applies to the systems we
design as well. I've seen enough people design around what they believe the
product will become in two years to know that those designs always fail to
accommodate the changes that will come. So we design systems for small,
incremental changes. Do the smallest thing that will get us started and
doesn't compromise our ability to change once we know what the business needs.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper"><div id="container"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Full disclosure: things discussed in this post are, to be frank, quite obvious. My intent is not so much to teach a reader something new, as to remind him what might have been forgotten. After all, anyone who does a single kind of work daily for years inevitably develops habits and mental-shortcuts that are <em>usually</em> useful but can misfire from time to time. After all, software development is too complex and too technical to be guided by subconscious intuition.</p><p>Pilots use pre-flight checks to combat this kind of problem, so why not developers? Here’s a check-list of things I find important to consider <strong>before</strong> writing the first line of code.</p><h3 id="set-your-target-straight">Set your target straight</h3><p>Imagine yourself solving these tasks:</p><ul><li>generating a single-use report for an established company</li><li>writing a feature in proof-of-concept MVP for a startup</li><li>extending at enterprise product that has 20 years of codebase support guarantee in its SLAs</li></ul><p>Clearly, it wouldn’t be smart to blindly apply the same set of software development best-practices for all three cases. You probably don’t need a perfectly polished code for a single-use report. A startup that operates in the “rush to market before we run out of money" mode is much more worried about the feature working than about its performance. Long-support code needs to be first and foremost maintainable. Also, if you’re working on a pet-project for fun, you might gasp skip writing tests (unless you enjoy writing tests, in which case I envy you a little bit). Some developers take so much pride in their craft that they lose sight of the forest behind the trees. Following all best practices and writing state-of-the-art code <em>feels</em> right, but logically it’s not the only option. Sometimes you should consciously generate technical debt. Reality constraints are not something that can be ignored.</p><p>As self-evident as this advice is, we’ve all heard stories where things went wrong because of misaligned goals. “Premature optimization” is a common special case. Refactoring an old codebase that rarely changes, just so it’s pretty, is another one. And to not leave you with the thought that goal misalignment is always linked to perfectionism: writing an unsupportable code to meet a <em>fictional</em> deadline, either self-imposed or forced on to developers by impatient management, is the same kind of error.</p><p>You need to know where to go before you can start thinking about how to get there. Think of the most important criteria your solution needs to fulfill and align your decision-making with those.</p><h3 id="consider-alternatives">Consider alternatives</h3><p>You’ve got the task in front of you, requirements are pretty clear, and you vaguely remember how you did something similar a few years before. Or maybe you don’t know how to solve it at first, but after some googling, you get a general idea. Start coding?</p><p>There are always multiple ways to solve a problem. The first viable solution is unlikely to be an optimal one. By focusing on the first approach discovered you rob yourself of choice. Do a thorough research first, and after you have options in front of you, carefully consider the pros and cons of each. There is no magical number of solutions you need. I often set the minimum bound to three for myself.</p><p>Selecting the right tool for a job is an obvious example of a decision that benefits from upfront research, and even then, in a real-world scenario, a tool that’s familiar often gets selected over the tool that fits. Don’t think this advice only applies to „macro“ decisions, it can be applied just as well for your everyday code design choices.</p><h3 id="consult-the-docs-yes-upfront">Consult the docs. Yes, upfront</h3><p>It’s impossible to keep up with the pace modern tech is moving. Doesn’t matter how many years of experience you have under your belt, when you pick up the project on a modern stack there will be tools and libraries, released recently, that have slipped under your radar. So most developers are in a constant in-flight-learning mode: picking up knowledge as they search answers on immediate questions. It’s an efficient way to learn, but it creates a risk of missing an easy solution because of the inability to form the right question.</p><p>Skimming the docs upfront, without digging deep into any particular topic, doesn’t take much time, but it helps create mental anchors, which your brain will fetch when you encounter the problem. You will have a better starting point for finding the right answer quickly.</p><h3 id="design-your-apis">Design your APIs</h3><p>The hardest part of writing code is to imagine in the minutest details how to handle each workflow, each exceptional situation, and each edge case. Many developers first solve a problem, then write a „wrapper“ to expose their work to the outside world through some kind of API (i don’t mean just REST API, function signatures and interfaces are APIs as well). Often this bottom-up design leads to an API that’s too „technical“, i.e. leaking it’s abstractions to the consumer. It’s hard to make your brain switch from one level of abstraction to another.</p><p>Before starting the work on implementation, put yourself in the shoes of the API user first (even if that user is you). What would be the user’s most common usage pattern? What’s the absolute minimal required set of parameters the API needs to have? Which terminology makes sense for the user? What input format would be most convenient? What defaults to set? It’s up to you how thorough you want this process to be.</p><h3 id="split-up-the-work">Split up the work</h3><p>Each entity in a system exponentially increases the number of possible interactions. Code that’s easy to reason about forms a pyramid of abstraction layers, each one hiding its inner workings from the layer above. Each layer can be reasoned about independently, limiting the amount of „moving parts“ you need to keep track of in your brain. If you succeed in splitting the task into multiple loosely coupled entities upfront, you will simplify your code and work process.</p><p>If the task at hand is large enough, it might make sense to form a tree-like task structure, starting from the highest level of abstraction and moving down the layers until the tasks are small enough. The „small enough“ parameter depends on your particular codebase, mindset, and type of work you do, but after a bit of practice, you’ll find what granularity suits you the best.</p><p>Each task should be fairly self-sufficient and ideally shouldn’t stay in “kinda-finished” state for long (“finished but not deployed”, “finished but not reviewed”, “finished but not tested” or “finished but waiting for authorization from XYZ department”). Finished is when you don’t think about it anymore and it doesn’t drain your mental resources.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/tree.png" alt="Example of a task tree"></p><p>Do you have your own tips and tricks for organizing developer’s work?

        <p>There's a thing that comes up from time to time in the Rust community: people wanting to optimize their code. Make the code run faster. Make it allocate less memory. These are worthy goals, but maybe not necessary for all projects. Just because your program is written in Rust, it doesn't have to be optimized to the moon and back to do it's job. In a lot of cases, you'll be fine using <code>.clone()</code>.</p>
<p>There's a fantastic quote from a discussion on the <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/">Rust user forums</a> which I always think of when these discussions emerge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just because Rust allows you to write super cool non-allocating zero-copy algorithms safely, doesn't mean every algorithm you write should be super cool, zero-copy and non-allocating.<br>
-- <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/feeling-rust-is-so-difficult/29962/15">trentj on The Rust Programming Language Forum</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course there's a time and place for <em>super cool no-allocating zero-copy algorithms</em>, but very often it's not the time, nor the place. You can write fantastically effective code with Rust, but <strong>you don't have to</strong>! A lot of the time it's entirely fine to just write code that works with minimal effort. You don't have to spend 4 days trying to figure out how lifetimes work just to avoid calling <code>.clone()</code> a few times.</p>
<p>Don't spend time trying to make micro optimizations now. Take the easy route. You'll probably come back to that piece of code in a few months time, smile, and change that <code>.clone()</code> to something more efficient.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
<p><small>NB: Watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/rAl-9HwD858">video by Jon Gjengset</a> if you want a good, pragmatic walk through of lifetimes in Rust.</small></p>

        <p>A quick look at how you can configure your GitHub Actions workflows to only run when a certain phrase is present in the commit message.</p>

            <p>I'm going to be honest with you all for a second. I write a lot of <code>wip</code> commits. These commits are normally small changes that I want to push up to GitHub so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't lose things if anything goes wrong and my backup hasn't picked it up.</li>
<li>If I can't describe the change I have just made.</li>
<li>If I'm demonstrating something to somebody on a pull-request.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is, my actions are setup to run on <code>push</code>, so every single <code>wip</code> commit gets run through the CI process, whether it be running tests, linting or formatting.</p>
<p>After doing some research, I found a way of preventing these from running on every single commit.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="yml"><span>jobs:</span>
  <span>format:</span>
    <span>runs-on:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span>if:</span> <span>"! contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'wip')"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now, whenever I push a <code>wip</code> commit or any commit that contains the word <code>wip</code>, it will be marked as skipped inside of GitHub actions.</p>
<p>You could also flip the logic and perhaps do something like:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="yml"><span>jobs:</span>
  <span>format:</span>
    <span>runs-on:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span>if:</span> <span>"contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[build]')"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Any commit that contains <code>[build]</code> will now trigger these jobs, everything else will be skipped.</p>
<p>You can thank me later! 😉</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PRIME">PRIME</a> is a technology used to manage hybrid graphics. It was meant to be a resource saver since you can configure it to use only the Integrated GPU, and render offload to the dedicated GPU whenever is needed. But that is not what happened in my real life situation.</p>

<p>I was not happy with the fact that my laptop was draining a lot of battery. Not only while using render offload by running software with <code>prime-run</code> and delegating gpu stuff to my dGPU(Nvidia MX150), but using the iGPU(i915 Intel) to daily stuff(terminal, browser) was also draining a lot of battery. Overheating was also a problem and then, i started to investigate.</p>
<p>Using <code>powertop -t 3</code> shown that Firefox was draining as much as <code>800 mW</code> per process(tab) on the <code>Power Est.</code> column. Meanwhile, <code>i915</code> module was using about <code>150 mW</code> alone. That got me thinking if, using the dedicated GPU to render stuff would get it better, but it didn’t. Launching Firefox with <code>prime-run</code> reduced a little the power usage per tab (opening the same websites), but the Intel module was still draining almost the same amount of power(<code>145 mW</code>) while the <code>nvidia</code> module was using <code>35mW</code>.</p>
<p>Other thing that bugged me was that my system always started with a lot of RAM already compromissed(<code>900MB</code>) on a simple <code>i3</code> setup. Could be the case where my iGPU was already allocating a lot of that resource to itself?</p>
<p>After that, i’ve decided to try some 3D, and <a href="https://veloren.net/">Veloren</a> was the game i’ve chosen. Those were the metrics captured with my status bar and <code>powertop</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using <code>i915</code> driver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driver drain reached <code>400mW</code>.</li>
<li><code>1,9 GB</code> Ram used</li>
<li>Battery expected duration after full charge was <code>1:28</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using <code>nvidia</code> driver with <code>prime-run</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>i915</code> driver was still draining <code>200 mW</code> approximately, spiking to <code>400</code> sometimes.</li>
<li><code>nvidia</code> driver was using about <code>50mW</code>, spiking to <code>80</code> once in a while.</li>
<li><code>1,7 GB</code> RAM used</li>
<li>About <code>140MB</code> of GDDR used</li>
<li>Battery expected duration after full charge was <code>1:12</code>.</li>
<li>nvidia temperature reached <code>73ºC</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that this doesn’t seems to be a fair test, comparing a dGPU with an iGPU while executing a game. The point I was trying to prove was: Using the render offload didn’t really help on reducing resource consumption at all. On the oposite, it seems that it somehow helped me to have resources wasted by doubling energy consumption due to this binding created between modules with the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PRIME#PRIME_render_offload">render offload</a> feature.</p>

<p>I was decided to try a new approach and use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA_Optimus#Use_NVIDIA_graphics_only">Nvidia graphics only</a>. Setup was pretty straightforward and after rebooting, I’ve launched Firefox with the same sites and <code>Power Est.</code> was about <code>570mW</code> per process. Good news, lets try Veloren again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>nvidia</code> driver only
<ul>
<li><code>nvidia</code> driver was using about <code>120mW</code>.</li>
<li>Battery expected duration after full charge was <code>1:47</code>.</li>
<li><code>1,3 GB</code> RAM used</li>
<li>About <code>140MB</code> of GDDR used</li>
<li>nvidia temperature reached <code>67ºC</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a lot better. I also noticed that my system was using only <code>500MB</code> RAM after a fresh start(a <code>400MB</code> difference).</p>
<p><strong>Lesson learned.</strong> Try things by yourself when it comes to power management.</p>

<p>Other things changed on my system after spending the weekend optimizing energy stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using <a href="https://github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status"><code>bumblebee-status</code></a> anymore. It’s a great bar, full of useful modules, but it was creating some weird spikes on power usage. Migrated to <a href="https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/"><code>i3status-rust</code></a> and now my bar isn’t even listed on the top 20 power usage agressors.
<ul>
<li>All previous tests were done using the same bar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>telegram-desktop</code> is a mess on power and cpu usage and i’m seriously thinking on ditching this software and using it’s web version only. Firefox is a software I already use so, there’s nothing to lose.</li>
<li>Try to get used with some lightweight browser like <a href="https://qutebrowser.org/">qutebrowser</a> while on battery, and stop using my bookmark sync of choice. Have to test since not having video acceleration could be a caveat.</li>
<li>Find out why while using specific softwares <code>pulseaudio</code> gets crazy and it spikes with <code>4W</code> of Power Estimated usage.</li>
</ul>

									<p>This summer, Google has been deploying its AI voice assistant called Duplex to call bars and restaurants in order to update their opening hours on Google Maps listings.<br>
Here’s a call their system had with our virtual assistant for restaurants.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/460586741" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>As far as we’re aware, this is the <strong>first naturally-occurring conversation between AI voice assistants in the wild</strong>. I have never seen anything like this before, and I’m incredibly proud that PolyAI is sharing this moment in computing history with our friends from Google.</p>
<p>After listening to the call, we’d say that it went pretty well! Google could have handled the two-part opening hours a bit better, but overall, the interaction was smooth. I want to share a few thoughts on what this means for the future of conversational technologies.</p>
<h3>Human language is a Universal API</h3>
<p>This interaction did not need to be a conversation in the way that we as humans think of it. The caller’s request was transactional and to the point. An API call or an HTTPS request between two web services would have done the job in 150ms, instead of two minutes of synthesized voice going back and forth across the telephone line. However, such APIs are not always available, or standardised. For instance, there are dozens of reservation APIs for restaurants used in the UK alone, and voice assistants will never integrate with every single one.</p>
<p>This kind of machine-to-machine conversational communication will become more commonplace as AI deployment accelerates. And while it may seem like an overkill from a technical standpoint, there are good reasons for these kinds of interactions to be conversational, rather than API calls.</p>
<p>Imagine you ask your virtual assistant — Siri or Alexa, for example — to book a hotel room. It can phone multiple hotels to check availability and book without having to integrate into each hotel’s individual booking API. And logs of the conversation can inform the user of alternative venues for their next trip.</p>
<h3>Welcome to the Uncanny Valley</h3>
<p>Google introduced <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Duplex in May 2018</a> as an ‘AI system for accomplishing real-world tasks over the phone’. You may have seen this video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM">Sundar Pichai at Google I/O</a> using Duplex to make a restaurant reservation.</p>
<p>I’ll be the first to point out how incredible Google’s TTS (text-to-speech) is in the Duplex/PolyAI call. It sounds like a human, much more so than our assistant does.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">Uncanny Valley theory</a>, the more human-like a robot is, the more likely people are to feel positive towards it. However, at a certain point of human-likeness, the robot becomes a bit creepy, and people are repulsed by it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.polyai.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/uncanny-valley.png" alt="" width="588" height="387" srcset="https://www.polyai.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/uncanny-valley.png 588w, https://www.polyai.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/uncanny-valley-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px"></p>
<p>In the Google/PolyAI call, Duplex really does sound like a human – it does mention that it’s an automated service, but this is not enough. Why? Because crossing the Uncanny Valley means that a person on the call will treat the bot as though they are human.</p>
<p>Around the 1 minute mark, you’ll hear our voice assistant ask the caller when they’d like to come in, and Duplex speaks over it. In reality, these are machines – no-one’s getting offended. But when you listen to the call, the Duplex bot comes across as pretty rude. Because it sounds so human, it’s practically impossible to not attribute human qualities to the bot. And no one wants a rude voice assistant representing their company.</p>
<p><strong>Making customers think that your voice assistant is a real human is a sure-fire way to deliver frustrating customer experiences. At PolyAI, we work hard to make sure our voice assistants sit at the peak right before the Uncanny Valley – but without crossing it. Warm and friendly enough to put callers at ease, but not real enough to cause cognitive dissonance.</strong></p>
<h3>The Future of Voice</h3>
<p>Companies are wising up to the benefits of conversational AI in customer communications, and we’ll see a growing number of instances of machines communicating in human language. While this type of transactional communication may seem better suited to quick API calls, voice assistants can get the job done even when such APIs are not available.</p>
<p>We are super excited about the future of voice assistants. Two highly sophisticated voice assistants have now met in the wild, in a rerun of the legendary “Dr Livingstone, I presume” moment (though neither assistant realised they were speaking to one of their own). This is a sign of great things to come. Stay tuned – and get in touch with us if you want to build a great voice assistant for your brand.</p>

<p>I consider <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/file/c/CDZ20MOZ.ZIP" target="_blank"><i>Computer Dungeon Slash: ZZT 2.0</i></a> my personal best for ZZT games. I've now released two versions, one in September of 2019 and then another with some updates and optimizations in May of 2020. Aside from a couple of smaller errors and special-thanks additions, there's not much more to fix, so this will probably be the final version with any major changes.</p>

<p>Like some of my previous ZZT games, it relies heavily on procedural generation, with apparently such complexity that Dr. Dos called it "basically sorcery" during their <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/article/479/livestream-computer-dungeon-slash-zzt-20">playthrough on Twitch</a>, which I took as a great compliment. He also mentioned that this game, its generators in particular, could use a write-up. So I wrote one!</p>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image24.png"></p>

<p>In case you're reading this and unfamiliar with this game, it concerns a player finding themselves in the town of Habeas Corpus, where almost everyone and everything has been swallowed by the dungeon.</p>

<p>The player's task is to brave the randomly-generated dungeon, rescuing the town and townspeople from its clutches.</p>

<p>There's not much more plot or lore than the above, since I focused mainly on characterization in my worldbuilding and most of the actual plot isn't revealed until the end.</p>

<p>So what about the workings of this game?</p>

<p>I'll start with "sorcery"--there's something to that, for sure. When I work with procedural generation it feels a bit like alchemy. Scientific, but also a little bit mysterious and magical. I hope this article helps you better understand the scientific side of that coin.</p>

<p>For readers not intimately familiar with ZZT, one reason a veteran ZZTer would call my level generation "sorcery"  is its limitations. ZZT is a 1991 DOS game-creation-system, after all, simple enough for 8-year-old me to use. So if you don't know anything about ZZT coming in, I hope this write-up helps you better understand the absurdity and appeal of working in it and pushing its limits.</p>

<p>Further, if you came into this wanting to know how this stuff works so that you can experiment with it or even improve on it, I want you to be empowered to do so.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>With <i>Computer Dungeon Slash: ZZT</i> (called <i>CDZ</i> here for short) I had three goals for generation. I wanted levels to be interesting to look at, fun to play, and fair. What does fair mean?</p>

<p>Most previous ZZT releases with procedural generation would probably not soft-lock players (block them off from finishing the game). In the early 2000s when this fad hit, most ZZTers involved were in high school and "probably not" was enough. But that small chance of soft-locking players with my generators annoyed me even then.</p>

<p>With <i>CDZ</i>, I wanted some certainty that my algorithms absolutely would not soft-lock players.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, let's look at the tools I had to accomplish them.</p>

<h2>Building Blocks for Procedural Level Generation in ZZT</h2>

<p>ZZT is tile-based, so making it create its own levels is kind of like generating dungeons for classic ASCII roguelikes, except with much more restrictive tools and limits than, for example, C++ or Python. There's no way to easily store level layout data outside of "in the level", and ZZT boasts precious few variables and only ten true-or-false flags. In addition, the entire game is made up of "boards" of only 60x25 tiles! Despite being such a limited system, ZZT lets us do a fair amount.</p>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image4.png">
<img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image7.gif"></p>

<p>Almost any element (terrain or other object) that takes up a space on a board is helpful, but a few basic ones are laid out in a reference image on the left. Fake walls prove pretty invaluable because they don't block objects but help the engine easily keep track of where another terrain type <i>will</i> later appear.</p>

<p>While <i>CDZ</i> uses sliders and boulders to some extent, the classic examples of ZZT level generators using sliders and boulders are probably WiL's <i>Run-On</i> and Benco's <i>Lost</i>.</p>

<p>And of course, one of the elements of play is actually <i>called</i> an object, and can run little scripts in ZZT-OOP, the engine's default "language." ZZT-OOP has a number of helpful commands for procedural generation.</p>

<p>The <code>#change</code> command can change almost any ZZT gameplay element into almost any other, which is invaluable both for structuring and theming levels. <code>#put THING DIRECTION</code> and <code>#become THING</code> allow for level builder objects to modify environments directly, and they have a more complex use we'll go into later.</p>

<p>Procedural level generation in <i>CDZ</i> is random. Appropriately, ZZT-OOP's random directions proved immensely useful in making it happen. A number of situations call for a "four-sided" dice-roll, and ZZT does have an <i>rnd</i> direction (randomly north, south, east, or west), but as the reader may know, <i>rnd</i> is twice as likely to give an east-west result as a north-south. So what to do?</p>

<p>Well, there are also <i>rndne</i> (north or east) and <i>rndp DIRECTION</i> (one of two directions perpendicular to <i>DIRECTION</i>). Because <i>rndne</i> is a valid direction in itself, you can use <i>rndp rndne</i> to get a random cardinal direction with equal probability of each. (I'm ashamed that I didn't realize that one until reading Anna Anthropy's <i>ZZT</i> a few years back.)</p>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image14.gif"></p>

<p>In ZZT, <code>#if blocked DIRECTION</code> tells an object whether it is blocked in a given direction. And <code>#send OBJECTNAME:LABEL</code> tells another object, <i>OBJECTNAME</i>, to immediately begin executing code starting with <i>:LABEL</i>.</p>

<p>Slime enemies move erratically and leave breakable walls behind, so you can change their color frequently to fill empty spaces with different colors of breakable walls.</p>

<p>One last limitation and one last "coding" trick deserves mention. ZZT has a limit of about 20 kilobytes per board (including code) before the board misbehaves or gets corrupted at runtime. Objects can use the command <code>#bind OBJECTNAME</code> to work from the same exact instance of the same code as the other object <i>OBJECTNAME</i>, saving valuable code space.</p>

<p>Nowadays, one can "pre-bind" objects with external editors, causing them to share identical labels and behaviors but eliminating the need for the 5+ bytes of space that a <code>#bind</code> command needs.</p>

<h2>Two Big Insights</h2>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image18.png">
<img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image20.png"></p>

<p>In addition to the more concrete "tools" above, two big conceptual insights greatly impacted this project. The first is about level connectedness, and it hit me after reading Rabbitboots's musings on house generation in <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/file/d/dood2018.zip" target="_blank"><i>Doodads 2018</i></a>.</p>

<p>Say I have a house with four rooms, and I block off only one doorway in the house, as on the left. Any room in the house can still visit any other.</p>

<p>Rabbitboots goes on to note that if we make a larger house out of smaller ones, the large house remains fully connected.</p>

<p>If House A connects to House B and B connects to House C, then A connects to C.</p>

<p>This was huge for me. It gave me hope that I could avoid soft-locks while also making more interesting, varied levels.</p>

<p>Shortly after the 2019 release, while looking at TriphEd's maze generation in <a href="https://museumofzzt.com/file/b/BACKTRAX.zip" target="_blank"><i>Backtrax</i></a>, I had another "Aha!" moment.</p>


<p>The algorithm is best explained step-by-step, and you can follow along with the following roughly equivalent method if you have a pencil and paper.</p>

<p>(1) Start with a grid of dots. Any size 3 x 3 or up will do.</p>

<p>(2) Connect all the outer dots along the edge so that they make a rectangle.</p>

<p>(3) For each "middle dot" within the square, draw <i>exactly one line</i> from that dot to any dot directly above, below, left, or right of it. Edge dots can receive lines.</p>

<p>If you used a 3 x 3 grid of dots, the end result will resemble the 2 x 2 house above.</p>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/backtrax-levels.gif"></p>

<p>Any edge tile can access any other edge tile in this algorithm. It can leave some squares inaccessible from the edges, but this is acceptable if nothing essential to player progress is placed in those tiles.</p>

<p>In ZZT, you can accomplish this by having objects use <code>#put rndp rndne ELEMENT</code> on a grid, and that's exactly what <i>Backtrax</i> is doing.</p>

<p>A <i>very</i> small set of soft-lock possibilities does exist in <i>Backtrax</i>. Because there's a blocking linewall diagonally southeast of the lower-right-hand wall generator object, the wrong combinations of walls <i>could</i> block the player, but it is <i>incredibly</i> unlikely and easily remedied.</p>

<p>This is the most elegant level generator in ZZT to date--and also, in case it wasn't already elegant enough, it weighs in at only 10.9 kilobytes and re-uses its "grid" after you reach the exit, using a separate trick (that I won't discuss in detail here) to teleport the player back to the start for a new level.</p>

<p>Recognize TriphEd's genius.</p>

<p>After the initial <i>CDZ</i> release, I experimented a lot with this algorithm. Several generators in version 2.0 benefited from its use. We can now move slowly but surely into the actual inner workings of this game.</p>

<h2>Primary Generators</h2>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image6.png"></p>

<p><i>Computer Dungeon Slash</i> level generators have a "primary generator" object that handles a lot of needed dice-rolls and uses <code>#send</code> to communicate its randomization to different groups of objects. It's usually set up as on the left, or similar.</p>

<p>This particular setup involves fake walls placed north, south, east, and west of the primary generator and water (a blocking terrain) in the four corners. To make a four-direction roll, it uses <code>#put rndp rndne gem</code> and then iterates over some variation of:</p>

<code>#if blocked n #send object:option1
#if blocked e #send object:option2
#if blocked s #send object:option3
#if blocked w #send object:option4</code>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image16.png"></p>

<p>The objects referred to in the <code>#send object:option</code> commands  are pre-bound objects with exactly the same code, and positioned so that only one of them will place a wall, generate an important key, etc. at the time they're called. In this example, the pre-bound group of objects has this code:</p><p>

<code>@object
#cycle 1
#end
:option1
#if blocked n become solid
#die
:option2
#if blocked e become solid
#die
:option3
#if blocked s become solid
#die
:option4
#if blocked w become solid
#die</code></p><p>There is a fake wall in the middle of the house, so that only one object becomes a wall, and the rest die. Then the primary generator turns the fake into a solid wall.</p>

<p><img src="https://museumofzzt.com/static/images/articles/cl/2020/cdslash/image23.gif"></p>

<p>This method also extends to larger houses similar to those in the <i>Doodads 2018</i> example, and can …</p></article></div>

    <p>OTTAWA -- 	Twenty-one Ontario doctors have signed a joint letter to Premier Doug Ford, urging him not to issue a new lockdown this fall because of rising COVID-19 case numbers.</p><p>	Daily numbers of new cases have risen dramatically in recent days, with Ontario recording <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/new-covid-19-cases-in-ontario-reach-highest-mark-ever-1.5122863" target="_blank">700 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday</a> – the highest number of new cases recorded in a single day.</p><p>	However, the 21 doctors who signed the letter to the premier say another provincewide lockdown—similar to what was in place in the spring—would not be helpful.</p><ul>	<li>		<a href="#Full letter"><i>Read the full letter below</i></a></li></ul><p>	"We are writing this letter in support of the governments’ plan to use a tactical localized approach, rather than sweeping new lockdown measures, to deal with the increasing COVID case numbers in Ontario," the letter says.&nbsp;</p><p>	"Lockdowns have been shown not to eliminate the virus. While they slow the spread of the virus, this only lasts as long as the lockdown lasts. This creates a situation where there is no way to end the lockdown, and society cannot move forward in vitally important ways including in the health sector, the economy and other critically important instrumental goods including education, recreation, and healthy human social interactions."</p><p>	Speaking on Newstalk 580 CFRA's "The Morning Rush with Bill Carroll" in Ottawa, CTV's infectious disease specialist Dr. Neil Rau—a signatory of the letter—pointed to two data points to consider when looking at the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>	"We're reacting to increased aggregate case numbers, but the percentage positive is not really as bad as it used to be," he said. "We're testing more people, so we're finding more cases […] We're driving our numbers up, it's worse than it was in the summer, but it's not what it was last winter and life has to go on."</p><ul>	<li>		<a href="https://www.iheartradio.ca/580-cfra/podcasts/the-morning-rush-dr-neil-rau-interview-why-we-don-t-want-another-lockdown-1.13612912?mode=Article" target="_blank"><strong>LISTEN NOW: "The Morning Rush": Dr. Neil Rau - Why we don't want another lockdown</strong></a></li></ul><p>	Monday's 700 cases in Ontario came from 41,111 total tests, for a positive percentage rate of 1.7 per cent. On April 24, <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/highest-number-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-a-single-day-reported-by-ontario-health-officials-1.4910216" target="_blank">the previous watermark of 640 new cases in a single day</a>, the result came from 12,295 tests, for a positive percentage rate of 5.2 per cent.</p><p>	Testing capacity was lower in the spring than it is now, and testing criteria has changed over time; however, Dr. Rau and the other signatories of the letter said the increasing case numbers are not leading to unmanageable levels of hospitalizations.</p><p>	"In Ontario and other parts of the world, such as the European Union, increasing case loads are not necessarily translating into unmanageable levels of hospitalizations and ICU admissions," the letter says.</p><p>	The letter also points to other health impacts linked to the lockdown.</p><p>	"Hard data now exist showing the significant negative health effects shutting down society has caused. Overdoses have risen 40% in some jurisdictions. Extensive morbidity has been experienced by those whose surgery has been cancelled, and the ramifications for cancer patients whose diagnostic testing was delayed has yet to be determined," the letter states.</p><p>	"Economic harms are health harms," Dr. Rau told CFRA. "It sounds horrible to say, but it's true. Health is wealth. We all know this."</p><h2>	<strong>LETTER POINTS TO DISAGREEMENT AMONG HEALTH PROFESSIONALS</strong></h2><p>	Other Ontario health professionals have been arguing for increased restrictions as cases rise.</p><p>	Last week, the Ontario Hospital Association released a letter signed by 38 health professionals which <a href="https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ontario-hospital-association-calls-for-return-to-restrictions-on-non-essential-businesses-1.5119832" target="_blank">called for immediate restrictions to be re-imposed on non-essential businesses</a>, such as gyms, dine-in restaurants and bars, nightclubs, and theatres. It also calls on restrictions on other places where people can gather, such as places of worship.</p><p>	The letter from the OHA said regions where the speed of transmission was underestimated are “now facing the consequence of increased hospitalization rates, including a rise in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and more deaths.”</p><p>	Hospitalizations in Ontario have been increasing, but have not yet reached the same level that was seen in the spring.</p><p>	According to <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data" target="_blank">data from the Ontario government</a>, there were 128 people in hospital in Ontario with COVID-19 complications on Monday—the day 700 new cases were recorded—up from 65 a week before; however, on April 24—when 640 new cases were recorded—government data shows that there were 910 people in hospital. The peak for hospitalizations in Ontario came in May, when there were days when more than 1,000 people were hospitalized. That number steadily decreased from May through the summer before it began going up again in September.</p><p>	Speaking on CTV Morning Live Ottawa, infectious disease specialist Dr. Abdu Sharkawy suggested t<a href="https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=2045684" target="_blank">emporary restrictions on gathering would help curb the spread of COVID-19</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>	"We don't want to see our hospitals overwhelmed," he said. "We're still waiting for flu season and a whole bunch of other respiratory viruses to hit us and our capacity to be challenged. We don't want that to happen. We need everybody to try and simplify their lives and minimize anything that's non-essential."</p><p>	Dr. Sharkawy said regions where cases are rapidly rising may need to impose new restrictions to get the spread of the virus under control.</p><p>	"I think it's abundantly clear that, particularly in hot spots like Ottawa, Toronto and Peel region, the situation is not well controlled," he said. "Sometimes you need blunt instruments, even if they're temporary in nature, to make sure that you curtail the spread of this virus because it gets away from us a lot more quickly than many of us can anticipate sometimes."</p><p>	Dr. Sharkawy suggested hot spots follow the lead of Quebec, which imposed <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/life-in-the-red-zone-here-s-what-you-can-and-can-t-do-1.5125093" target="_blank">harsh restrictions on three areas in the province</a>, including Montreal and Quebec City, banning private gatherings and closing bars and restaurant dining rooms.</p><p>	"I think we should do it now," Dr. Sharkawy said of Ontario. "I think we all need to adopt an attitude and an approach that recognizes that we have to do what's absolutely necessary to keep everybody safe."</p><h2>	<strong>FULL LETTER FROM ONTARIO DOCTORS TO THE PREMIER</strong></h2><p>	Dear Premier Ford,</p><p>	We are writing this letter in support of the governments’ plan to use a tactical localized approach, rather than sweeping new lockdown measures, to deal with the increasing COVID case numbers in Ontario. Lockdowns have been shown not to eliminate the virus. While they slow the spread of the virus, this only lasts as long as the lockdown lasts. This creates a situation where there is no way to end the lockdown, and society cannot move forward in vitally important ways including in the health sector, the economy and other critically important instrumental goods including education, recreation, and healthy human social interactions.</p><p>	In Ontario the increase in cases at this time are in people under 60 years of age who are unlikely to become very ill. At the peak of the pandemic in Ontario in mid-April, 56% of cases were in ≥60 year olds, now in Sept only 14% of cases are in ≥60 year olds. In Ontario and other parts of the world, such as the European Union, increasing case loads are not necessarily translating into unmanageable levels of hospitalizations and ICU admissions. This is not a result of a lag in reporting of severe and fatal cases. While we understand the concerns that these cases could spill into vulnerable communities, we also need to balance the actual risk. As the virus circulates at manageable levels within the community, we need to continue the gains we have made in the protection of the vulnerable in long-term care and retirement institutions, and continue to educate other people about their individual risk, so that they can observe appropriate protective measures.</p><p>	Lockdowns have costs that have, to this point, not been included in the consideration of further measures. A full accounting of the implications on health and well-being must be included in the models, and be brought forward for public debate. Hard data now exist showing the significant negative health effects shutting down society has caused. Overdoses have risen 40% in some jurisdictions. Extensive morbidity has been experienced by those whose surgery has been cancelled, and the ramifications for cancer patients whose diagnostic testing was delayed has yet to be determined. A huge concern is the implication of closure of schools, and the ongoing reluctance we have seen in the large urban centers of sending children back to the classroom due to safety concerns. Global data clearly now show that children have an extremely low risk of serious illness, but they are disproportionately harmed by precautions. Children’s rights to societal care, mental health support and education must be protected. This cannot be achieved with ongoing or rotating lockdown.</p><p>	The invitation and involvement of other health experts to advise the government’s response beside individuals in Public Health and Infectious Diseases in addition to leaders in the business, securities and arts communities is essential. We also call for increased open debate, in the public forum, that hears voices from outside the medical and public health communities, in order to consider all points of view from society. This is a fundamental principle upon which democratic societies are built. All stakeholders should have an equal right to participation in public discourse when it comes to setting such fundamental and sweeping societal interventions.</p><p>	All have the right to feel their voices have been heard, and moreover to ensure factual credible data is openly debated, in contrast to the personal and political slants that have had apparent significant impacts on the management of the virus to date. Our society has borne enormous pain over the past 6 months. It’s time to do something different.</p><p>	Sincerely,</p><p>	Jane Batt MD, PhD, FRCPC.

We gave him a tour of Blokable’s prototype factory in Vancouver, Wash., and shared our R&amp;D work to reimagine how housing is built.

For each participant in the process, the singular goal is to extract a profit from that specific patch of dirt, and their profits are circumscribed by the value of the land, the applicable building regulations, and the prevailing labor and capital costs.&nbsp;</p><p>The result of this one-off approach is soaring project costs that make housing simply unaffordable to most people in many parts of the U.S.. Conventional housing development is like building a snowflake every time. And if the glut of empty luxury condo towers in downtown San Francisco is any indication, many of these snowflake projects are indeed melting as soon as they touch the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>How did this one-off approach to development take shape? Everything from ovens to stereos were all once clunky prototypes built as one-offs in the same location as their eventual use. Over time with innovation, standardization, and market demand, they evolved into products. In the early days of the automobile and aviation industries, prototypes and projects were built at high cost and yielded low quality results that resembled the current market products in their most basic functionality: they could drive and fly. Early automobile and airplane prototypes were unsafe and expensive. But through investment in product design, engineering, prototyping, and manufacturing, these prototypes eventually evolved into products. Increasingly stable designs and specifications enabled greater standardization, repeatability, and mass production resulting in lower costs, higher quality, and broader distribution.&nbsp;</p><p>Coupled with clear market demand, this standardization led to the formation of entire industries to build roads and airports, manufacture tires, test safety under federal guidelines, and so on. If you visit the automotive and aviation manufacturing hubs around Detroit and Seattle you’ll find vibrant supply chains competing for business and investing in innovation to provide better products and services. Continuously improving engines, seats, windshields, and bathrooms. All of this activity creates ever-improving products and fierce competition for performance, quality, and price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If we compare product manufacturing in the automotive and aviation industries to how we build housing — whether it is an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU), single family home, multi-family apartment building, or a high rise — the steps in the process are largely the same. To simplify the housing development process, let’s assume the land is entitled, there are no environmental mitigation issues, financing is secured, and development will not be opposed by regulatory agencies or local city council. What does it take to build a snowflake?</p><figure><img width="1200" height="800" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMjA0OCAxMzY0IiB3aWR0aD0iMjA0OCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMzY0IiBkYXRhLXU9IiUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyMCUyRjA5JTJGQmxvZy0yLWJvZHktaW1hZ2UtMjA0OHgxMzY0LmpwZyIgZGF0YS13PSIyMDQ4IiBkYXRhLWg9IjEzNjQiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+" data-spai="1" alt="Housing creation is an endless series of one-offs" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption><em>Conventional housing development is like building a snowflake every time.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s look at the absolute bare minimum of steps in the process from the perspective of the developer. Broadly speaking, the developer identifies and ties up the site, conducts preliminary site review and discussions with impacted parties, manages entitlements, financing, and the project approval process for the site, oversees all building and owns the project along with any equity investors they have brought in to finance the deal. With respect to the building process itself, the developer will partner with an architect to work up a site massing and design that will satisfy the intended program — the mix of units, floorplans, common spaces, revenue generating and non-revenue generating space — as well as the code requirements for the building and the site. Once the basic architecture is in place, the project heads over to engineers, which are typically separate firms with separate contracts, costs, regulatory oversight, and liability, to specify structural engineering, MEP (mechanical, electrical, plumbing), and site and offsite engineering.&nbsp;</p><p>With the initial design and engineering complete, the developer sends a construction set of drawings to a general contractor (GC) for final pricing. The GC will take the specifications and build out a schedule and budget to determine how much work they intend to do themselves (self-perform) vs. how much work they will contract out to sub-contractors (subs). The GC will oversee all of the work necessary to build this custom-designed and engineered project on-site, including civil, foundation, pulling utilities, framing, rough-in and waterproofing, siding and cladding, roofing, windows and doors, MEP, paint and trim, fixtures and finishes, and ultimately certificate of occupancy.&nbsp; It is important to note that at this stage the GC’s quote is just an estimate. We haven’t built anything yet.</p><p>With approved drawings, financing, budget, and schedule in hand, the developer can start the snowflake build. Every step listed in the paragraph above must be completed by the corresponding specialists, and getting the work done on schedule is much more of an art than a science. Each contractor and subcontractor has their own contractual obligations, risks, and liability. Getting to the certificate of occupancy means the developer has navigated the process and can now bring in buyers or renters to start paying off the decades of debt that were secured to finance the build.&nbsp; When the developer moves on to the next project, all of the steps must be performed again, without exception. The finished project may be beautiful, energy efficient, or last 100 years, but it will still be a one-off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of this work is done for every project every time, regardless of size. A home or apartment is not more complicated than a car or plane, and while the unique attributes of individual sites and real estate do add challenges to repeatability, it is possible to decouple the building from the dirt.</p><p>We can’t be surprised that building costs for new housing continue to escalate. We can’t be surprised that it’s even more expensive to create affordable housing. Yet we continue to shrug our shoulders and say, “That’s just how it is.” We dig around the edges of the problem, foraging for scraps by looking for cost savings in commodities, underpaying labor, cutting corners on quality and performance, and building on cheaper land further and further from work and community.&nbsp;</p><p>Housing development is antiquated and the only group benefitting is the real estate development and building industry, who in fact have every incentive to restrict the supply. We’re making Version 1 of the oven, stereo, car, and plane over and over again, in a housing market that is chronically under-served. The failure to build adequate housing has generational effects on health, education, and opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>There has to be a better way. We have to re-imagine the housing market and build better. More on that to come in our next post.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<li><strong>The&nbsp;Metropolitan Transportation Commission approved a plan that would require Bay Area residents to work from home three days a week&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>The proposal, which was voted on Wednesday, would ensure that sizable, office-based companies keep 60 per cent of their workers home</strong></li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Transportation officials hope it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb climate change in the area</strong></li>
<li><strong>Some residents and workers opposed the plan by noting that working remotely is not ideal for many people</strong></li>
<li><b>Big Tech companies in Bay Area have already transitioned much of their operations online and some have made remote work a permanent feature&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>
<p>A new proposal could require Californians to work remotely three days a week – even after the COVID-19 pandemic – to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to aid in environmental efforts.</p>
<p>A number of Bay Area residents, including employees at large tech firms, were concerned over a new proposal approved by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission on Wednesday.</p>
 <!-- A generated by theme --> 



 <!-- end A --> 


<p>The controversial proposal would effectively ensure that sizable, office-based companies kept 60 per cent of their workers at home on any given workday to curb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Given the changes in travel patterns during the&nbsp;<a id="mol-ecbfd540-000a-11eb-af1a-6fc9d77b8f42" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/coronavirus/index.html">coronavirus</a>&nbsp;pandemic, there was strong support for bolder policies on this front in the Final Blueprint, including a mandate for office-based employers,’ the proposal read.</p>
<p>‘To ensure this strategy achieves equity goals, a complementary strategy to expand internet access in underserved communities was added to the Economy Element as well.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This latest proposal underscores a larger shift towards remote work that became commonplace after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States in January.</p>
<p>By March, entire office buildings shuttered and industries stumbled as employers struggled to transfer in-person operations to out of the workplace.</p>
<p>But now, six months later, city officials and some employers viewed the forced transition as a unrealized benefit that could reshape office culture and transportation.</p>
<p>‘There is an opportunity to do things that could not have been done in the past,’ said&nbsp;Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, a commission member and proposal supporter,</p>
</li>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="https://usatodaysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/b-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="524" height="349" srcset="https://usatodaysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/b-300x200.jpg 300w, https://usatodaysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/b.jpg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px"></li>
<li>
<p>A May 2020 study from the&nbsp;Nature Climate Change Journal&nbsp;noted that daily carbon dioxide emissions plunged by 17 per cent in the United States during April.</p>
<p>‘The estimated decrease in daily fossil CO2&nbsp;emissions from the severe and forced confinement of world populations of –17% (–11 to –25%) at its peak are extreme and probably unseen before,’ the study said.</p>
<p>The commission’s proposal was found inside a larger policy package titled ‘Plan Bay Area 2050 Final Blueprint,’ in which officials theorized what the Bay Area could look like in 30 years and what could be done about reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Members voted 11-1 to approve the overall policy package, including the mandate.</p>
<p>Bay Area is home to Silicon Valley, the central hub of Big Tech firms that have taken different approaches to working from home.</p>
<p>Facebook quickly embraced remote working as a longterm plan&nbsp;and advised its 50,000 staffers to work from home to avoid spreading the coronavirus.</p>
<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg later announced that the company had extended its work-from-home plan until 2021, allowing employees to avoid the Menlo Park office for the next several months.</p>
<p>Similarly, Twitter, which reported 5,100 employees in its most recent earnings report, ordered employees to work from home .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was later revealed by CEO Jack Dorsey that the company will allow most of its employees to work from home permanently.</p>
<p>‘Opening offices will be our decision. When and if our employees come back, will be theirs,’ a spokesperson for the company said.</p>
<p>But companies like Apple, that have invested loads of money on its campuses and facilities, have been less eager to fully welcome remote work.</p>
<p>Tim Cook revealed in a recent interview at The Atlantic Festival that he hoped employees would be back in the office by next year and pointed out that remote work doesn’t allow for certain employee interactions.</p>
<p>When word of the plan reached Bay Area residents, many were concerned and logged onto the virtual commission meeting on Wednesday to object.</p>
<p>‘We do not want to continue this as a lifestyle,’ said&nbsp;Steven Buss, a Google software engineer who lives in San Francisco, according to NBC News.</p>
<p>‘We are all sacrificing now to reduce the spread of the virus, but no one is enjoying working from home.</p>
<p>‘It’s probably fine if you own a big house out in the suburbs and you’re nearing retirement, but for young workers like me who live in crowded conditions, working from home is terrible.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some residents noted that the strategy enforces workplace inequality since some jobs cannot be performed at home, while others worried about the effects it would have on other industries as a result.</p>
<p>Stacey Randecker called into the meeting on Wednesday and questioned why the proposal included all commute alternatives if the main focus was on car emissions.</p>
<p>‘Yes, yes, yes, we want to reduce greenhouse gases, but why aren’t you considering transit? Walking? Biking?’ she said.</p>
<p>Duston Moskovitz, co-founder of Facebook, shared the sentiments on Twitter.</p>
<p>‘We tried nothing, and we’re all out of ideas,’ he wrote on Tuesday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commission member Nick Josefowitz said the work-from-home proposal was a late addition into the policy package.</p>
<p>NBC News reports that&nbsp;Josefowitz attempted to amend the proposal to allow transit and walking from home as alternatives, but critics worried that a delay could result in the commission missing emission reduction targets and an important funding deadline.</p>
<p>‘If we start amending this plan at this late hour, do you have any rabbits in your hat that’s going to get us to the finish line,’ asked commission member&nbsp;Jim Spering.</p>
<p>The proposal added that the work-from-home strategy ‘was not included in the Draft Blueprint and was added based upon public feedback this summer.’</p>
<p>MTC executive director Therese McMillan said there would be opportunities to later go over the strategy’s details and include alternative transportation.</p>
<p>The commission will meet against before the end of the year and then it would need to be implemented over time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-74174200445ef6e30546"><div><p>This blog post is very late. It’s well over a year since<a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/1153727018896244736"> I posted a coding challenge on twitter</a>. The idea was simple, I’ve always felt that code readability is undervalued so I figured I’d put cold hard cash up. I announced a $1,000 pot, divided into $500, $300, and $200 prizes for the most readable implementations of <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2019/06/06/nearly-divisionless-random-integer-generation-on-various-systems/">Daniel Lemire’s nearly divisionless algorithm for selecting a random number from an interval.</a> I now have winners to announce and congratulate, and they’re in this blog post, but there’s more to this story.</p><p>I didn’t know it at the time but I’d end up reviewing the entries with colleagues to see if they could follow what was happening (spoiler: they couldn’t). When people got stuck, we’d whiteboard&nbsp;our way through so that we could better understand why and where people were getting stuck. Oh, to be able to whiteboard in person again!  </p><p>I learned a lot about how people think through problems, and that process led to me writing a seperate implementation of Lemire’s Algorithm, with a twenty-to-one comment to code ratio (that’s a lot of comments), and finding a sort-of security issue with the algorithm in the process. I say “sort of” because you really have a ridiculously enormous struggle to find a case where it’s going to be practical to exploit. But it still surprised me, and you probably can’t use Lemire’s algorithm in Vegas.</p><h4>Why Lemire’s Algorithm?</h4><p>I chose Lemire’s algorithm because it is brilliant. When I read Lemire’s code I get that kind of brain-tingling and gawk at the sheer “How on earth did someone think of this” of it all. Lemire has a mastery of code and how code is executed, and then pairs that with transcendent creativity and concision.  Lemire also writes well, and the papers that accompany his code and algorithms are easily some of the most cogent and approachable you’ll find in academia. They are short and clear and avoid the jargon and obtuseness that plagues the field, while containing just enough formalism to be rigorous.</p><p>Lemire’s algorithm is a solution to the problem “Give me a random number between 0 and N, not including N itself”. For simulating a dice, N would be 6 and you’d get back either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 with equal probability. Computers like to start at zero. We can always add one to the result to get the familiar results you’d get on a real dice. I’ve worked on random number generators and written quite a few. In 20 years of doing that, I’d never come across a solution as cool as Lemire’s.</p><p>Before Lemire, the best-known solutions to this problem required one or two divisions per number generated. You probably learned long division when you were quite young. You may remember that it can be get pretty tedious and cumbersome. It’s the same for computers. Division is actually one of the slowest things we can ask a computer to do. Lemire avoids division by translating numbers into a much larger number “space” and using binary-friendly powers-of-two operations instead. His technique almost always avoids needing a division.</p><p>The second reason I chose Lemire’s algorithm is that it is impenetrable upon first reading. There are lucky few people who are so practiced and conversant in number manipulation that they can see inside of algorithms like Neo in the matrix, but I don’t mean them. To the average reader, myself included, it’s not clear what’s going on and why.</p><p>Lemire’s reference code is fourteen lines long, like a sonnet. Twelve of the lines are simple, and any proficient programmer could tell <em>what</em> they are doing. Two specific lines of the code are pretty hard to decipher.. But the real difficulty is how hard it is to understand <em>why</em> all 14 lines are doing what they are doing, and <em>why</em> it results in a fair and correct algorithm for choosing a random number.</p><div><p>As a case in point, if you read the comments to Lemire’s blog, you’ll find several misunderstandings of the code. That’s within an audience of primed Lemire fans and critics who are familiar with the field. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10941">Lemire’s accompanying paper</a> is great and very readable, but it still takes effort and concentration to follow everything. I work on cryptography and write cryptographic code for a living and I’m not ashamed to tell you it took me about 3 readings to really get it. The algorithm is based on an interaction between two modular spaces, one of which is sized 2 to power of 64, and the other is “N” sized, and if I just totally lost you there, I beg forgiveness and if you bear with me I promise there’s a link to my detailed dissection of how and why everything works. </p><p>All of this makes Lemire’s algorithm a really good challenge for creating a more readable version. Ideally something that an average coder can read in one pass, understand, and agree that it’s correct. </p></div><h4>Why does readability matter?</h4><p>Code readability is the most important pillar of code correctness and maintainability. When code is unreadable, it is harder to spot errors. That’s true when you’re doing a code review and it’s even more true when you’re adding more code to an existing code base. Great testing can compensate for some of the correctness challenges, but it doesn’t do as much for maintainability. </p><p>In s2n, one of our <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/s2n/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md">development principles</a> is to write clear readable code with a light cognitive load. We’re serious about it, and I wasn’t going to try and use Lemire’s algorithm in s2n without a very readable implementation.</p><p>Working in software development I’ve heard the opinion more than once about how programmers and coders should be more familiar with the fundamental mathematics of logic and number theory that underpin their field, and that academic style papers and explanations should be sufficient. I happen to work with teams that are made up of both expert coders and expert mathematicians, and even there I don’t think this is a good idea.</p><p>Software engineering is engineering, which means translating science into solutions that work in the real world.  To wildly generalize, there are better dividends to be found in focusing on deepening ones understanding of the “real world” part of that, the users, the customers, the business models, usability, ergonomics, and so on, than on the “science” part of that. Some science is needed, but there’s a shallow limit. Just as a civil engineer doesn’t need too detailed an understanding of the chemistry of concrete. PHs and setting times, but not quantum numbers.</p><p>Code should be self-documenting. The average programmer, including someone straight out of college, should be able to understand and work on a well put-together codebase. This greatly improves the odds of finding problems, and that’s what matters. </p><h4>The contest</h4><p>One of the reasons I’ve been so tardy about this blog post is that the contest didn’t go as I’d expected. </p><p>Let’s start with the great thing that happened. I got several submissions, more than enough to pick winners from. Many of these submissions are good and do improve upon Lemire’s code. The most common improvement was to use more descriptive names for the variables. Lemire uses variable names such as “s”, “t”, “l” which seemingly don’t correspond to much. In such a short piece of code, this actually isn’t too big an offense. I kept these terms in my own implementation, because I want to be consistent with the paper, but it’s absolutely a valid improvement. Another great improvement is to write and include tests, which is really an essential part of software development. </p><p>The first place <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/98183e47436699f6e5eab200061c46eec342806e/std/rand.zig#L74-L118">winner</a> did both of these, and also cleared up some of the confusing lines of code by making an implicit truncation explicit. According to GitHub the winner had 5 contributors, but twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/komu_wairagu/status/1161643573223317504">komu_wairagu</a> submitted it, so that’s who I’ll be contacting to Venmo $500.</p><p>The second place <a href="https://github.com/nimia/Lemire_RNG">winner</a> comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/NimrodAviram">Nimrod Aviram</a>, who I know professionally as the discoverer of the DROWN vulnerability and fun person to hang out with at RealWorldCrypto. Nimrod’s implementation includes some great testing too.</p><p>The third place winner wants to stay anonymous, and cheated their way to some bonus points by writing a great implementation in LISP. How can you not love that? If they change their minds about anonymity I’ll update this post with a link. The sha256 checksum of their implementation is ae008644b2f0b10eddbbce3a0508b103b19925e4e0c9354c569ff0816acb760c. </p><p>Now on to the not as great, and one of the reasons I’ve taken this long to write. It doesn’t feel right to criticize any of these efforts, made in spare time and as part of a fun challenge I put out there, but none of them actually explained Lemire’s algorithm or broke down how and why it worked. I asked several colleagues to look through these implementations and tell me if they understood what was going on, and the response was a uniform zero. Noone could fully understand even one of the implementations, or Lemire’s original.  When I asked people to also read the paper, things got a bit better, but everyone still seemed to trip on some issues.  These are smart people who absolutely know what they are doing. I’m sure given more time they could fully understand everything, but that wasn’t the goal. The goal was to have understanding after one or two, or at most just a few, readings.</p><h4>What did people find hard to follow?</h4><p>Talking through things with people I found some common problems. Some directly in the code, and others in the paper. The first line of code that threw people was:</p><pre><code>uint64_t l = ( uint64_t ) m;</code></pre><p>This line of code does an unusual operation called truncation. It takes a 128-bit value “m” and truncates that to its least significant 64-bits. All of this is implicit in the code, rather than explicit. Reading the code, you have to recall that m is 128-bits. Then there’s also the question of why are we doing this truncation? I’ll leave that for a minute. </p><p>The next problematic line of code was:</p><pre><code>uint64_t t = -s % s;</code></pre><p>This line of code is using an unusual combination of unary negation, on an unsigned int, and the modulus operator.  Nobody remembers what unary negation does to an unsigned int - and why should they …</p></div></div></div>

	<p>Netflix has finally made its 4K Ultra HD content available to stream on Mac, albeit not everyone will be able to benefit from that. As mentioned on the&nbsp;<a href="https://help.netflix.com/fr-ca/node/55764">Netflix Ultra HD support page</a>, 4K streaming only works on&nbsp;select 2018 or later Mac computers with an Apple T2 Security chip (via <em><a href="https://www.macg.co/mac/2020/09/netflix-en-4k-sur-mac-uniquement-pour-les-machines-avec-puce-t2-116775">MacGeneration</a></em>).</p>

<p>In addition to a T2 chip Mac, you also need the latest version of Safari running on macOS Big Sur, a screen capable of displaying a 4K 60Hz image (compliant with the HDCP 2.2 standard in the case of an external screen), and a subscription plan that supports Ultra HD streaming.</p>
<p>Here’s an interesting take on the T2 chip requirement from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/j2cik9/youll_need_a_mac_with_a_t2_chip_to_be_able_to/">Reddit</a> user:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This makes zero sense to me. The only Macs, that could really benefit from 4k streaming, without an external monitor, are the 4k and 5k iMacs yet only 2 models (the Pro and the new 2020 27″) will be able to stream it. Windows machines don’t have any kind of T2 alternative and are still able to stream 4k via Edge or via the native app, their only requirement is a 7th gen intel cpu or a dedicated graphics card.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is the&nbsp;list of Macs compatible with 4K Netflix streaming:</p>
<ul>
<li>iMac Pro (late 2017)</li>
<li>Mac mini (late 2018)</li>
<li>MacBook Air ( 2018 and up)</li>
<li>MacBook Pro (2018 and up)</li>
<li>Mac Pro (2019)</li>
<li>iMac (2020)</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you guys think of the T2 chip requirement for streaming Netflix in Ultra HD?</p>

September 30, 2020 | https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For the last couple of years, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> has run
<a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>, which purports to “support open source” by giving free
t-shirts to people who send pull requests to open source repositories.</p>

<p>In reality, <strong>Hacktoberfest is a corporate-sponsored distributed denial of service attack against the open source
maintainer community</strong>.</p>

<p>So far today, on <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aspam">a single repository</a>, myself
and fellow maintainers have closed 11 spam pull requests. Each of these generates notifications, often email, to the 485
watchers of the repository. And each of them requires maintainer time to visit the pull request page, evaluate its
spamminess, close it, tag it as spam, lock the thread to prevent further spam comments, and then report the spammer to
GitHub in the hopes of stopping their time-wasting rampage.</p>

<p>The rate of spam pull requests is, at this time, around four per hour. <em>And it’s not even October yet in my timezone.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://blog.domenic.me/images/hacktoberfest-spam-listing.png" alt="A screenshot showing a spam query for the whatwg/html repository, which is at this time up to 14 spam PRs"></p>

<p>Myself and other maintainers of the whatwg/html repository are not alone in suffering this deluge.
<a href="https://twitter.com/gravitystorm/status/1311386082982924289">My tweet</a> got commiseration from
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/gravitystorm/status/1311386082982924289">OpenStreetMap, phpMyAdmin</a>,
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ulmerleben/status/1311378655231332355">PubCSS</a>,
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/JakeDChampion/status/1311389420638138370">GitHub, the Financial Times</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/1311377444188770312">ESLint</a>, a
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/zekjur/status/1311411780162326531">computer club website</a>, and
<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/juliusvolz/status/1311412919196844038">a conference website</a>, just within the first couple
of hours. Since then a dedicated account “<a href="https://twitter.com/shitoberfest">@shitoberfest</a>” has arisen to document the
barrage. Some <a href="https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+%22improve+docs%22+created%3A%3E2020-09-29&amp;type=Issues">cursory</a>
<a href="https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+label%3Ainvalid+created%3A%3E2020-09-29&amp;type=Issues">searches</a> show thousands of
spam pull requests, and rising.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean seems to be aware that they have a spam problem. Their solution, per their
<a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq">FAQ</a>, is to put the burden solely on the shoulders of maintainers. If we go
out of our way to tag a contribution as spam, then… we slightly decrease the chance of the spammer getting their free
t-shirt. In reality, the spammer will just keep going, submitting more pull requests to more repositories, until they
finally find a repository where the maintainer doesn’t bother to tag the PR as spam, or where the maintainer isn’t
available during the seven-day window DigitalOcean uses for spam-tracking.</p>

<p>To be clear, myself and my fellow maintainers did not ask for this. This is not an opt-in situation. If your open source
project is public on GitHub, DigitalOcean will incentivize people to spam you. There is no consent involved. Either we
contribute to DigitalOcean’s marketing project, or,
<a href="https://twitter.com/SudoFox/status/1311431141702819840">they suggest, we should quit open source</a>.</p>

<p>Hacktoberfest does not support open source. Instead, it drives open source maintainers even closer to
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=open+source+burnout">burnout</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.domenic.me/images/hacktoberfest-spam-pr.png" alt="A screenshot of a spam PR which adds the heading &quot;Great Work&quot; to the HTML Standard README"></p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?</h2>

<p>My most fervent hope is that DigitalOcean will see the harm they are doing to the open source community, and put an end
to Hacktoberfest. I hope they can do it as soon as possible, before October becomes another lowpoint in the hell-year
that is 2020. In 2021, they could consider relaunching it as an opt-in project, where maintainers consent on a
per-repository basis to deal with such t-shirt–incentivized contributors.</p>

<p>To protect ourselves, maintainers have a few options. First, you can take the feeble step of ensuring that any spam
against your repositories doesn’t contribute to the spammer’s “t-shirt points”, by tagging pull requests with a “spam”
label, and <a href="https://twitter.com/MattIPv4/status/1311390498888781824">emailing hacktoberfest@digitalocean.com</a>.
DigitalOcean themselves, however, admit that
<a href="https://twitter.com/MattIPv4/status/1311390054334554113">this won’t stop the problem they’ve unleashed on us</a>. But
maybe it will contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/MattIPv4/hacktoberfest-data">metrics</a> they collect, which last year
showed that “only” 3,712 pull requests were labeled as spam by project maintainers.</p>

<p>If you’re comfortable cutting off genuine contributions from new users, you can try enabling GitHub’s
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository">interaction limits</a>.
However, <del>you have to do this every 24 hours, and</del> it has the drawback of also disabling issue creation and
comments. <ins>Update: GitHub has made the limit configurable, and has
<a href="https://twitter.com/github/status/1311772722234560517">a nice cheeky announcement tweet</a> zooming in on the “1 month”
option.</ins></p>

<p>Another promising route would be if GitHub would cut off DigitalOcean’s API access, as
<a href="https://twitter.com/__agwa/status/1311399074814472194">Andrew Ayer has suggested</a>. It’s not clear whether DigitalOcean
is committing a terms of service violation that would support such measures. But they’re certainly making GitHub a
less-pleasant place to be, and I hope GitHub can think seriously about how to discourage such corporate-sponsored
attacks on the open source community.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, we can remember that this is how DigitalOcean treats the open source maintainer
community, and stay away from their products going forward. Although we’ve enjoyed using them for hosting the
<a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a> standards organization, this kind of behavior is not something we want to support, so
we’re starting to investigate alternatives.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A tipping point has been reached in what is legally considered news. Critiquing a news source by  questioning the facts presented, the manner in which they were communicated, the source's validity, the broadcaster's motivations or any inherent biases that may exist, is no longer a fruitful activity.</p>
<p>That line of critique has been swept aside by legally muddying what news is. The presenter is no longer required to convey any truths and the onus of verification has entirely shifted from the news source to the audience.</p>
<p>There are two ways on how this has been achieved.</p>
<p><em>Burden of Verification</em>: A "reasonable" viewer is expected to "arrive with an appropriate amount of skepticism" based on the material presented by the news outlet. Any lies that the news broadcast may convey are not actionable because the viewer is expected to filter out lies from the truth. Even if the news source is spewing lies they're given a pass because the viewer should have known better to believe it in the first place to believe it. That is, any "reasonable" viewer. Adding this word into any court's ruling opens up the door to say anything.</p>
<p><em>False Presupposition</em>: The presenter can state an assumption which is very likely to be false (or known to be false) and then base future arguments on the suspect assumption. As long as what follows traces back to the false assumption, all is good and anything can be said. For example if a host says "We’re going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told the feds is absolutely true", then the presenter has wide latitude on what conclusions they can draw, without ever worrying about whether Cohen was lying.</p>
<p>There are two compounding factors which make this especially harmful.</p>
<p><em>Inability for Skepticism</em>:  The constant bombarding of rhetoric in news shows overwhelms its audience and amplifies the echo in the chamber that the viewer already lives in. There is no pause (or desire to pause) to reflect on whether the information presented should be met with skepticism. The expectation that the consumer has the ability to be skeptical is wrong. The medium has become powerful enough that it overrides a human being's ability to be skeptical, especially one who <em>wants to believe</em> in the lie.</p>
<p><em>Repackaging</em>: Having talk shows disguise as news programs is a laughably easy way of repackaging lies without risking the penalty of being called out. Twenty-four hour news channels can have talk shows with millions of viewers who tune in to get some semblance of valid information. I provide the "some semblance" qualifier only because the audience have been conditioned enough and are polarized enough that they no longer can think on their own, and only tune in to reinforce whatever they already believe. As there is no material differentiation between talk shows and news programs for the audience, the convenient repackaging gives the broadcaster an out to say anything and hide behind the argument, "it's not news, it's a talk show".</p>

              Dear CodeShip users,</p><p>We are reaching out to inform you of additional information we have uncovered as a result of our continuing investigation of the recent GitHub breach. To provide maximum transparency, we are reporting on the results of our investigation, the impact on users, actions you must take to protect yourself/your organization, and actions we will take to strengthen our security processes going forward.</p><p>On Wednesday, September 16, 2020, CloudBees was notified by GitHub of suspicious activities targeting CodeShip business accounts connected to GitHub via the CodeShip GitHub app and now deprecated CodeShip OAuth tokens. CloudBees immediately initiated an investigation conducted by our security and engineering teams, and on September 27, we identified additional evidence of malicious activity against a failover CodeShip database. On September 29, we uncovered evidence to indicate that a malicious actor had access to this failover instance during the period of June 2019 to June 2020. At this time and to the best of our knowledge, we have no evidence of malicious activity or attempts within CodeShip systems since June 2020. </p><p>*What type of data was affected?*</p><p>The impacted accounts are those of CodeShip users. No other products or accounts were affected and CodeShip is in no way integrated with other CloudBees products or systems.</p><p>*For all CodeShip users:*</p><p>CodeShip users hashed account passwords, one-time password (OTP) recovery codes, and the OTP secret keys used to seed two-factor authentication all may have been exposed.</p><p>Business contact information for invoicing purposes such as company contact name, company name, VAT number, postal address, phone number also may have been exposed. No payment information, such as bank account numbers or credit card numbers, was exposed. No other CloudBees product other than CodeShip was impacted. Also, the logging system was not accessed for any customers.</p><p>*For CodeShip Basic users:*</p><p>Any information contained in CodeShip users’ pipelines may have been exposed.

<![CDATA[Defer Reference Implementation for C]]>

September 30, 2020 | https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/defer/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/defer/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-1-1">
<p>
In the following code snippet we
have one <i>guarded block</i> and three <i>deferred statements</i>.
</p>

<div>
<pre>guard {
  <span>void</span> * <span>const</span> <span>p</span> = malloc(25);
  <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>p) <span>break</span>;
  <span>defer</span> <span>free</span>(p);

  <span>void</span> * <span>const</span> <span>q</span> = malloc(25);
  <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>q) <span>break</span>;
  <span>defer</span> <span>free</span>(q);

  <span>if</span> (mtx_lock(&amp;mut)==thrd_error) <span>break</span>;
  <span>defer</span> <span>mtx_unlock</span>(&amp;mut);

  <span>// </span><span>all resources acquired</span>
}

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The idea is that we indicate with a <b><code>defer</code></b> keyword that the
statement, e.g a call to <b><code>free</code></b>, is only to be executed at the end of
the guarded block, and, that we want this action to happen
unconditionally in which way ever the guarded block is left.  For the
three deferred statements together it says that they should be
executed in the inverse order than they were encountered. So the
control flow for this code example can be visualized as follows:
</p>



<p><img src="https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/defer/defer-image.png" alt="defer-image.png">
</p>

<p>
Here, the dashed lines represent circumstancial control flow that
might arise when some resources are not available or when the
execution is interrupted by a signal.
</p>

<p>
This new technique has at least two advantages to commonly used <code>C</code> or
<code>C++</code> techniques:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>proximity</dt><dd>The cleanup code (<code>free</code> or <code>mtx_unlock</code>) is coded
close to the place where its need arises.</dd>

<dt>visibility</dt><dd>The cleanup code is not hidden in some previously
defined function (such as for <code>atexit</code> handlers) or
constructor/destructor pairs (<code>C++</code>)</dd>
</dl>


<p>
For normal control flow (without intermediate <b><code>return</code></b>, <code>exit</code>, …)
code with similar properties can be coded with existing tools. The
above is equivalent to something like the following
</p>

<div>
<pre>{
   <span>void</span> * <span>const</span> <span>p</span> = malloc(25);
   <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>p) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER0</span>;
   <span>if</span> (<span>false</span>) {
     <span>DEFER1</span>:
       free(p);
       <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER0</span>;
   }

   <span>void</span> * <span>const</span> <span>q</span> = malloc(25);
   <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>q) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER1</span>;

   <span>if</span> (<span>false</span>) {
     <span>DEFER2</span>:
       free(q);
       <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER1</span>;
   }

   <span>if</span> (mtx_lock(&amp;mut)==thrd_error) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER2</span>;

   <span>if</span> (<span>false</span>) {
     <span>DEFER3</span>:
       mtx_unlock(&amp;mut);
       <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER2</span>;
   }

   <span>// </span><span>all resources acquired</span>

   <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER3</span>;
   <span>DEFER0</span>:;
}

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here, the <b><code>if(false)</code></b> clauses guarantee that the deferred statements
are jumped over when they are first met, and the labels and <b><code>goto</code></b>
statements implement the hops from back to front to execute the
deferred statements eventually.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, most <code>C</code> programmers would not code like this but they
would prefer to write down a <i>linearization</i> of the above, which is a
quite common idiom for cleanup handling in <code>C</code>:
</p>

<div>
<pre>{
   <span>void</span> * <span>const</span> <span>p</span> = malloc(25);
   <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>p) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER0</span>;

   <span>void</span>*<span>const</span> <span>q</span> = malloc(25);
   <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>q) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER1</span>;

   <span>if</span> (mtx_lock(&amp;mut)==thrd_error) <span>goto</span> <span>DEFER2</span>;

   <span>// </span><span>all resources acquired</span>

   mtx_unlock(&amp;mut);

 <span>DEFER2</span>:
   free(q);
 <span>DEFER1</span>:
   free(p);
 <span>DEFER0</span>:;
}

</pre>
</div>

<p>
This has the advantage of only making the circumstantial control flow
explicit (with three *=goto=) but it does that for the price of
proximity; the cleanup code is far from the place where its need
arises.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, even this linearization needs some form of naming
convention for the labels. For more complicated code the maintenance
of these jumps can be tricky and prone to errors.  This shows another
advantage of the <a href="#org63e5a5c"><code>defer</code></a> approach:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>maintainability</dt><dd>The cleanup specification is not dependent on
arbitrary naming such as labels (<code>C</code>) or RAII classes
(<code>C++</code>) and does not change when <a href="#org63e5a5c"><code>defer</code></a> or <b><code>break</code></b>
statements are added or removed.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Another important property that is much more difficult to implement in
<code>C</code> (and that needs <b><code>try/catch</code></b> blocks in <code>C++</code>) is that <b>all</b> exits
from the guarded block are detected and acted upon: <b><code>break</code></b>, <b><code>return</code></b>,
<a href="#org18b8cc4"><code>thrd_exit</code></a>, <a href="#org9db677d"><code>exit</code></a>, <a href="#org7f6c106"><code>panic</code></a>, or
an interruption by a signal. That is, unless there are nasal deamons
flying around, we have a forth important property
</p>


<dl>
<dt>robustness</dt><dd>Any deferred statement is guaranteed to be executed
eventually.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This is different from <code>C++</code>'s handling of destructors, which are only
guaranteed to be executed if there is a <b><code>try/catch</code></b> block underneath.
</p>

<p>
This principle of deferred execution extends to nested
guarded blocks in a natural way, even if they are stacked in
different function calls.

<p>Qiskit hosted a course this past summer, which saw over 4000 students from more than 100 countries registering to attend the same quantum computing courses taught to IBM Quantum interns. Now, Qiskit is planning to offer the same course to anyone who wants to get their feet wet in the world of quantum computing and quantum hardware.</p>



<p>One of the core beliefs the Qiskit team holds to is that anyone trained right can program a quantum computer. Because of this belief, the team wrote an open-source textbook that teaches readers how to use Qiskit in quantum computing. The training is both effective and thorough. A survey revealed that 92 percent of QGSS participants felt that the Qiskit Global Summer School exceeded or was equivalent to other quantum computing courses available.</p>

The lectures will teach students the basics of programming a quantum computer, introduce famous algorithms such as Shor’s and Grover’s algorithm, and give an overview of how they built quantum bits and use them to represent data. There will even be an introduction to quantum chemistry included. Two prerequisites are a basic understanding of the Python language and linear algebra.</p>



<p>Qiskit believes that quantum computing should be accessible by all, and access to this knowledge should not be limited.

<h2 id="000004">00:00:04</h2>

<p>Welcome to Signals &amp; Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. So, it’s my pleasure today to have a conversation with Greta Yorsh. Greta is a compiler engineer in our compilers team in the London office, and she also has a rich and interesting background in compilers and programming languages and program analysis and verification, and we’re going to talk about all that. She’s also had a lot of experience in both industry and academia, and since 2018, Great has worked with us working on the OCaml compiler. So, Greta, to start with, can you talk about how you got interested in compiler optimization?</p>

<h2 id="000044">00:00:44</h2>

<div><p>I studied in Israel. I did my undergraduate studies in computer science and economics. I found that I don’t cope well with uncertainty, so the interesting mathematical bits of economics were not the right choice for me. So, I decided to do a PhD in computer science in the area of software verification where a lot of the concerns are about ensuring things, so that fits well with my approach to certain things. And after my PhD, I worked for a few years at IBM Watson Research Center in New York working on program analysis and verification problems.
</p><p> After that, I moved to Cambridge in England, and I joined an amazing company, ARM, that makes processors, and I worked there in the compilers team working on the GCC compiler backend for ARM, and after that, I worked at Queen Mary University of London as an assistant professor, or lecturer it’s called in England, where I did research in teaching in the area of compilers, and then recently, a year and a half ago, I joined Jane Street. At Jane Street, I work on the compilers team on the OCaml compiler.</p></div>

<h2 id="000209">00:02:09</h2>

<p>Tell us a little bit more about how that fits into the arc of your research.</p>

<h2 id="000214">00:02:14</h2>

<div><p>I started my research working on the problem of software verification or certain aspects of this problem, proving that software satisfies certain good properties, correctness properties that users expect from it, and that research involved a lot of reasoning about the source code of the program rather than executing it and then using certain formal methods and logical reasoning techniques, decision procedures, in order to prove properties of the program.
</p><p> I worked on that for a while, and there’s this ultimate goal of proving that the software behaves just the way it should be so that real-world executions of their program don’t cause terrible failures, and I was very excited about it for a while, but it is an undecidable problem, a problem that is very hard to solve in general, and that becomes a bit frustrating after a while, and I was interested in what is it that real programmers and users of software want to prove about their programs, and how I can help them using the techniques that I know and the logic that I know.
</p><p> So I worked on that, and in the process of that, I’ve discovered that it’s really fun to work with real users and have people who care about certain things. I don’t know what they care about, but if I talk to them, maybe I’ll find out, and maybe one of the tools I have in my toolbox will help me to give users a tool, and I found it very exciting. I think the first time it happened, it was at IBM, and I was really excited about it, but what I also realized is that not everyone really cares about correctness, that sometimes it’s okay to have bugs in their programs.
</p><p> There are other important aspects of software, like performance. That made a big change to my understanding, because I could now put these very formal techniques together with something practical and try to combine the two. And then when I had the chance to work at ARM on the GCC compiler backend for ARM, I’ve discovered how important it is, the performance and how exciting it is to work on this micro-optimization, CPU-specific, machine-specific optimization, how much difference they make to the behavior of the program, to the performance behavior from these characteristics of the program, and at the same time, working on the compiler, you just can’t have bugs. An important property of the compiler is that so much else in our system is built on top of it. That was a tool that combines correctness and performance. It’s an optimization function that is very clear and measurable, as opposed to what properties do users want to have for their programs, and that’s how I came to work in compilers.</p></div>

<h2 id="000458">00:04:58</h2>

<div><p>Yeah, it’s interesting, you’re starting off by focusing on verification, because I think verification is this very shiny and attractive goal, because there’s this basic fact about programming, which is that we’re all terrible at it. Humans are bad at writing programs. Program languages are things that, at their best, do, infuriatingly, only the very specific things you ask them to do and not what you intended, and so trying to close that gap between the thing you tried to do and the terrible thing that you actually wrote down is an attractive goal.
</p><p> You were talking about one of the problems of verification, and just to be clear, by verification, formal methods (lots of terms here), we basically mean coming up with the moral equivalent of a proof that a program matches some specification. So you write in some precise, higher-level way what the program is supposed to do, and then there’s the actual program that you’ve written, and some kind of proof of the program does what it’s intended to do. You mentioned undecidability – an undecidable problem is one where you can show that there is no general technique that solves it all the time, and you mention that as a sign of how difficult the problem is. But, it’s a funny thing, in some sense almost everything that we do is undecidable, right? You can’t answer almost any interesting question about a program in full generality, the classic result being the halting program: You can’t even tell whether a given problem is going to ever finish executing in a general way. But that normally doesn’t stop us. The way we deal with this is we tend to provide people not with fully automated systems that solve all of their problems, but instead, tools that they can use while they write programs. They can maybe do some extra work along the side to help ensure the correctness of those programs, and those tools might be in the form of testing systems, and they might be in the forms of something that looks more like formal methods, things that, essentially, along with the program, develop some aspect of the proof of correctness of the program. So, I’m curious what you think about the kind of practicality and ergonomics of formal methods as a thing that can be layered into the programming process to make it easier for people to write programs that do the right thing.</p></div>

<h2 id="000702">00:07:02</h2>

<div><p>The kind of verification, proving properties of programs, that I think of when I say software verification (traditional methods) involve writing a program in one language and then providing specification of its behavior, telling what properties should hold about the program in a different language, in logic of some kind that describes it, and then proving that the specification and the implementation are conformed. That is very different from the type system approach that OCaml takes where the types are the specification of the program, and that is something I’m learning as I become better at programming in OCaml. But the kind of verification I’m talking about, the idea of specifying these properties on the side somewhere or even in the program, but in a different syntax, I think is a big problem for adopting this kind of technology. It’s possible to specify something about the library, but keeping it up to date as the code evolves is very hard. Same problem with documentation, but as you try to reason about it, and you have a tool that runs together with the specification and the code and checks them against each other as you do the development, there is some hope to keep the code and the spec aligned, but still, the programmer needs to write both of them. So, there is opportunity for automation to save some work for the programmer and keep the two aligned.
</p><p> I also wanted to mention, when you were talking about verification, so different people think of verification as different things. To me, it is what you said. It’s the more formal proof about the source code of the program and its properties, but for most of the development process, it is testing. It’s running the program on some inputs and checking that the outputs behave as we expect. So, after working a bit and trying to find the right logics that are expressive enough to describe the properties we want and at the same time, allow us to prove automatically that the program conforms to these properties, you find, “oh, this is very restrictive.” Then you look, but testing is so much better. “I’ve been working on this for two years, but I could’ve found this bug with a simple test.” So how do we find tests that are good tests, or do we have good tests? So, this problem has been worked on by many people, and what I find exciting is that taking the testing approach, finding test cases, and the formal proof approach, and combining them helps us build better tools. So, there are many ways in which each side can help the other, and I worked on exploring some of these ways, and I found it very interesting. And I think this shows up in the verification, but there are also similar combinations of static and dynamic information or execution time and compile time information that are useful for compilers during compilations.</p></div>

<h2 id="000949">00:09:49</h2>

<p>It’s interesting for you to say this thing about the way in which tests and formal proofs mix together. I feel like this is a thing that I’ve noticed informally on my own in programming, which is the OCaml type system, and in general type systems, are a kind of lightweight formal method. Types only capture some fairly limited properties of …</p></div></div>

The following article contains examples of artificial intelligence in healthcare and companies doing a great job at it.</h2></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600557578492_4166"><div><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine learning, NLP, Robotics, and Automation are increasingly prevalent in all aspects and are being applied to healthcare as well. These technologies have the potential to transform all aspects of health care from patient care to the development and production of new experimental drugs that can have a faster roll-out date than traditional methods.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous research studies suggesting that AI can outperform humans at key healthcare tasks, such as diagnosing ailments. Here is a great example, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50857759#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20is%20more%20accurate,images%20from%20nearly%2029%2C000%20women." target="_blank">AI ‘outperforms’ doctors diagnosing breast cancer¹.</a></p><p>Artificial intelligence is a collection of technologies that come together form artificial intelligence. AI’s diverse range of technologies impacts a wide spectrum of healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p>Tech firms and startups are also working assiduously on the same issues. Google, for example, is collaborating with health delivery networks to build prediction models from big data to warn clinicians of high-risk conditions, such as sepsis and heart failure. Google, Enlitic, and a variety of other startups are developing AI-derived image interpretation algorithms. Jvion offers a ‘clinical success machine’ that identifies the patients most at risk as well as those most likely to respond to treatment protocols. Each of these could provide decision support to clinicians seeking to find the best diagnosis and treatment for patients.</p><p>You will find below some technologies that improve a specific area in healthcare with examples sourced from the internet with citations.&nbsp;</p><h3>Machine learning</h3><p>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI)<em> </em>that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves².</p><p>There are majorly three types of Machine learning — </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Supervised Learning</p></li><li><p>Unsupervised Learning</p></li><li><p>Reinforcement Learning&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>In healthcare, the most common application of machine learning is predictive medicine  —  predicting what treatment alternatives are likely to work best on a patient based on various patient traits, history, the treatment situation, and protocols. The supervised learning model for predictive medicine applications requires a training dataset, like all supervised learning models. the difference here is that there may be a lot of variables.&nbsp;</p><p>Using neural networks it is now possible to also predict whether a patient will acquire a particular ailment or not based on a set of variables and conditions that can be fed into algorithms in the form of data.</p><p>One common application of deep learning and neural networks is the ability to detect ailments/issues in the radiology images. I think deep learning should be increasingly applied wherever clinically possible. This will allow doctors and radiologists to just supervise results and focus on other important aspects of their job. This combination promises better accuracy of finding ailments with limited human intervention or supervision.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some organizations that are doing groundbreaking work in this area.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Organization:</strong> <a href="https://www.pathai.com/">PathAI</a><br><strong>Location: </strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts<br><strong>How it’s using AI in healthcare:</strong> PathAI is developing machine learning technology to assist pathologists in making more accurate diagnoses.

The company’s deep learning platform analyzes unstructured medical data (radiology images, blood tests, EKGs, genomics, patient medical history) to give doctors better insight into a patient’s real-time needs³.</p></blockquote><h3>Natural language processing</h3><p>In healthcare, most applications of NLP involve the creation, understanding, parsing, and classification of clinical documentation and published research. NLP can also be used to analyze clinical notes, prescriptions, help prepare reports, and possibly conversational AI. Few good examples of how NLP is currently being used.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Parsing data realtime from coronavirus research that is being published globally. You can find more information about this in my article <a href="https://medium.com/@sanksshep/how-can-ai-help-with-the-covid-19-vaccine-search-a68d40fc0cb0" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Project Meena by Google. More information can be found <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/towards-conversational-agent-that-can.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Decision Tree&nbsp;</h3><p>Decision trees require doctors and engineers to come up with an if-then-else decision flow chart that can help train machines to make decisions by building complex algorithms based on the finalized decision tree. This is critical and processes heavy software design, this enables the machines to take accurate decisions with human intervention. This will help save a ton of time for doctors and patients alike. This will enhance the capabilities of doctors to predict, analyze, and come up with a treatment plan for patient care.&nbsp;</p><p>This can also be used extensively in vaccine and treatment research provided the known variable is the ailment we are making the vaccine for and its pre-set conditions and protocols. This is an effective mechanism for pre-morbidity patients as well.&nbsp;</p><h3>Robotics</h3><p>Robots are becoming more intelligent, as other AI capabilities are being embedded in their OS. Other areas of improvements in AI have exponentially improved the capabilities of the robots and their ability to perform complex operations.</p><p>One such area of operation is robotic surgery. This enables surgeons to perform complex procedures with much greater precision and create precise, minimized, invasive incisions, and stitches. This is a game-changer in performing surgery, as long as human supervision exists. &nbsp;</p><p>Here are some examples of organizations using AI and Robotics&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Organization: </strong><a href="https://www.vicarioussurgical.com/" target="_blank">Vicarious Surgical</a><br><strong>Location: </strong>Charlestown, Massachusetts<br><strong>How it’s using AI in healthcare: </strong>Vicarious Surgical combines virtual reality with AI-enabled robots so surgeons can perform minimally invasive operations.

It relies on a combination of workflow, business rules, and ‘presentation layer’ integration with information systems to act like a semi-intelligent user of the systems. In healthcare, they are used for repetitive tasks like prior authorization, updating patient records, or billing. When combined with other technologies like image recognition, they can be used to extract data from, for example, faxed images in order to input it into transactional systems.</p><h3>Mass personalization</h3><p>Artificial Intelligence can help in mass personalization of patient care, treatments, procedures, vaccine research, and production.

			<p>Living is great and I'd prefer to do more of it. Unfortunately, progress towards immortality has been rather slow — for all of our technological progress in the last century we've only picked up a few extra years of life. An incorrect framing of the problem has led to slow progress, but with a little bit of mind shift we can choose much better strategies for learning about and manipulating biology.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-the-status-quo-">What's the status quo?</h3>
<p>There's been a subset of humans over the last 100 years who also would like to live longer and healthier lives and have invested considerable time and energy into this problem. They've mostly failed as is evidence by the fact if you make it out of childhood, keep a good BMI, stop smoking, and exercise, you'll make it, at best, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">a decade longer than someone in the 1700s</a> (provided you escaped the trough of death that was childhood). In that same 100 years we took our first flight on Earth and then landed on the moon. In that same 100 years we went from 0 transistors per chip to 50,000,000,000. In that same 100 years we invented the Cool Ranch Dorito. So why did we succeed in so many other places but have failed in the most important? Why don't we live extremely long, healthy, and happy lives?</p>
<h3 id="why-has-this-approach-worked-in-other-areas-">Why has this approach worked in other areas?</h3>
<p>Some problems are, in retrospect, clearly easier than others. But if you had surveyed the leading minds in 1900 which would be easier: splitting the atom, sending a probe outside the solar system, or living to 90, it's hard to imagine it would be the last option they would have chosen. Yet here we are.</p>
<p>There are problems that on the face of it seem of similar difficulty to an outsider but are magnitudes (and magnitudes and magnitudes) harder to solve. What leads to this difference can be summarized as <em>computational reducibility</em>. As way of example, take the planet. Think of every atom on Earth- the rocks, the trees, that one ex who still drifts in and out of memory. If I want to know where this sphere will be in the universe tomorrow or 1,000 years from now and I don't have a notion of basic physics I may think this intractable. There's so much going on! How could one possibly think to describe how all these atoms would move through space and time? But it turns out to be fairly trivial - all those atoms can be reduced to a single point, a center of mass, and then calculations of momentum can be easily computed and trajectory projected forward. There are many systems that allow for these "shortcuts" where the dimensionality can be collapsed and the useful information is still present. A bridge builder doesn't need to think of each atom in a brick, or even really the brick; it's enough to think of the collection of bricks and how they are arranged.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-takes-place-in-reducible-places">Engineering takes place in reducible places</h3>
<p>Engineering, generally, is the practice of working on problems that are tractable. Given constraints on energy and time, only hard problems that have been sufficiently reduced are tractable and as such are the ones that are worked on. Oftentimes science leads us to new ways of reducing the complexity of problems (think Newton and his equations in the previous example). This isn't a law, just a result of how resources are allocated. </p>
<h3 id="is-biology-reducible-">Is Biology Reducible?</h3>
<p>We haven't seen progress in biology because it is stubborn to attempts to reduce it. Darwin was one of the last great reducers - able to collapse the high dimensional problem of evolution into a few axioms. But even with natural selection in hand, the resolution of claims is not particularly specific. Hypotheses are hard to prove or disprove given the near impossibility of running a counterfactual and it mostly serves as a post-hoc description (large proboscis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthopan">moths</a> notwithstanding). Perhaps if we were luckier we could  have lived in a universe that allowed us to use natural selection to know the structure of cells and animals without having to go look (this is a little true - something I'll explore in a future post), similar to knowing the position of the planets a millennia in advance.</p>
<p>What is it about biology that makes it irreducible but splitting the atom was something we accomplished 80 years ago? Spitting in the face of entropy is hard and the number of problems that need to be solved by a biological system are vast. The components of that system are not elegant fundamental laws of the universe but artisanal components created by random search through a loosely constrained fitness space. Even highly conserved pathways still exist in a unique context of the whole organism. </p>
<h3 id="biology-s-drunken-walk">Biology's Drunken Walk</h3>
<p>Biology is constantly transitioning from current state to a future state where some future branch of the evolutionary tree has higher fitness but the potential branch space is massive and the "choice" of which branch is picked is a random process. For example, in a scenario where the environment is slowly acidifying, any given bacteria has many solutions to survive. While aesthetically they could be vastly different (off the top of my head: changes to cell membranes, additional transmembrane proton pumps, neutralizing organelles, heat shock proteins, etc), which one ends up being dominant for a given bacteria is a random mutation. Given enough bacteria "searching" the solution space, you'll likely see many solutions.</p>
<p>Crucially, because in any scenario there is a one-to-many relationship between a problem and solutions, you can't extrapolate which solutions an organism possesses based on reasoning. You can’t postdict, you have to go look.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-do-we-do-">So, what do we do?</h3>
<p>So biology suffers from low reducibility - we aren’t able to summarize systems allowing us to make inferences cheaply. In the instance of disease this prevents both easy understanding of the disease state, i.e. what is going wrong, and prevents easy drug design, i.e. which node in the system do I push on in order to reverse the disease state. Right now, drug discovery is a lot of serendipity and a lot of pretending we know enough to pick targets. Unsurprisingly, this mostly fails.</p>
<p>There is another way. Currently, we brute force biology via Grad student search and it’s remarkably slow. A small number of underpowered, poorly done experiments makes up the bulk of what is produced. A model organism is chosen, an intervention is proposed, a measurement is done, and a paper is written: repeat ad nauseam. </p>
<p>But if an infinite number of monkeys can write Shakespeare, an infinite number of mice can allow us a way forward.</p>
<p>If we care about blood pressure, for example, why have we not given every drug, at every dosage, every regiment, and in every combination to a mouse and actually seen what happens?
We <em>do</em> have high throughput screening, mostly in individual cells or enzymes, but this is mostly garbage owing to the information decay from cell to whole organism (something I will expound on in a future post). Is my proposed solution expensive? Yes! Combinatorial explosions are the opposite of computational reducibility. But my point is that we can't just hope to have cheaper solutions in the future – that is the ostrich approach to progress. And we spent $288,100,000,000 to get to the moon.</p>
<p>The problem is also not as intractable as it may first seem. How do we test a large number of drugs on a large number of mice? Drive the cost down on any marginal mouse. Recent advances in machine learning allow automation of those pesky variable costs. Image recognition and classification are now good enough to track a mouse and its movements automatically - there is no need to babysit mice and manually classify behavior. With the state of every mouse known, simple robotics, e.g. food/medication administration and outcome measurements, become possible. The simplest experiments are possible today, and with a concerted effort, the realm of possible can grow. </p>
<p>There will always be innovations in new measurement techniques, new ways of peering into the system. Biologists generally fail in scaling these new techniques at a detriment to our ability to control biology. By adding scalability as an important aspect of innovation we can unlock so much more with what we already have today. </p>
<p>Importantly, this isn't just limited to a causal inference between a drug and a disease. We're getting very good at measuring the state of systems, just pick your favorite "–ome". It's not hard to squint and see that large numbers of interventions, on large numbers of model organisms, with large readouts of state will approach full 4D models of organic systems.  </p>
<p>There are not going to be any shortcuts with biology. The sooner we recognize this, the sooner we can start building systems that operate at the scale needed to bring useful inference, drug discovery, and network topology into the 21st century. </p>
<p>Thank you to Aubree for her feedback on commas, words, and ideas.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two weeks ago, Snowflake had the largest IPO ever for a software company. On the first day of trading, the stock price doubled, giving Snowflake a market cap of over $60 billion. Snowflake became all that everyone was talking about. There was so much hype, my mom, who doesn't even know what Snowflake is, decided to invest in Snowflake.</p><p>At first glance, the valuation of $60 billion seems absurd. Not only is Snowflake not profitable, having a net loss of $349 million in 2019, but their revenue is also small relative to their valuation. Their revenue over the last 12 months was $403 million. Based on that, their market cap is around 150x their revenue. So why exactly is their market cap so high? Besides revenue and profitability, there are a number of other metrics that investors look at. Compared to similar software businesses, Snowflake has god-like metrics. In this post, I'm going to go through a number of metrics from Snowflake's S-1, explain what the metrics mean, and give context on just how exceptional Snowflake's metrics are.</p><p>The first metric that stands out is Snowflakes 121% year over year growth. To give you a sense of how fantastic it is, you can compare it to the growth rates of other companies at IPO. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/24/how-fast-should-you-be-growing/">Institutional Venture Partners looked at how quickly Internet and software companies were growing at IPO</a>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dad2b1e508f04886d0245c3/5f74c44d240d4de932d463c4_growth1.jpeg" alt="growth1"></p></figure><p>Based on their numbers, only 25% of companies that are between $75M-$500M in annual revenue are growing at just over 60% year over year. Snowflake's growth rate is nearly twice that! Snowflake's revenue was also $403M for the last 12 months, which would put them at the high end of that range. Not only are they growing significantly faster than other companies, but they are already significantly larger!</p><p>For companies that sell software to businesses an important number to look at is their retention rate. For Snowflake, their net retention rate is 158%. You may be asking, how do they have a retention rate over 100%? That's because companies that use Snowflake pay more for Snowflake over time. For every $1 of revenue Snowflake received from their customers a year ago, that same pool of customers are now paying $1.58. That means Snowflake could acquire no new customers, and they would still be doubling revenue every 18 months.</p><p>To compare that to other companies, <a href="https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/p/what-is-good-retention-issue-29">Lenny Rachitsky surveyed a number of industry experts on what they thought good and great net retention would be</a>. On average, for enterprise subscription software, the category Snowflake would fall under, the experts surveyed said 110% net retention would be good and 130% net retention would be great. He also pulled the net retention rates for a number of public companies:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Alteryx</strong>: 135% (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ogELPtct2s6jj9wRBpOgqGUE5k4cO73XXcvqmEZE89M/edit#gid=0">source</a>)</li><li><strong>Fastly</strong>: 130% (<a href="https://www.saastr.com/5-interesting-learnings-from-fastly-as-it-gets-ready-to-ipo/">source</a>)</li><li><strong>Okta</strong>: 124% (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ogELPtct2s6jj9wRBpOgqGUE5k4cO73XXcvqmEZE89M/edit#gid=0">source</a>)</li><li><strong>Anaplan</strong>: 124% (<a href="https://www.key.com/kco/images/Public_SaaS_Company_Retention_Metrics_2019.pdf">source</a>)</li><li><strong>Workday</strong>: 100%+ (<a href="https://www.workday.com/content/dam/web/en-us/documents/investor/workday-financial-analyst-day-2018.pdf">source</a>)</li><li><strong>ServiceNow</strong>: 97% (<a href="https://www.publiccomps.com/tickers/NOW">source</a>)</li></ul><p>You will notice that Snowflake's net retention rate of 158% is significantly higher than all of these!</p><p>Net promoter score (NPS) is a way of measuring customer satisfaction. It's convenient because it's easy to calculate and boils down customer satisfaction to a single number, making it easy to compare NPS between different companies. To compute NPS, a company performs a survey of their customers. The company asks "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this company’s product or service to a friend or a colleague?". Anyone that answers 9 or 10 is deemed a "promoter" of the product, while anyone that answers 6 or less is considered to be a "detractor". To compute the NPS, you take the percentage of users that are promoters and subtract the percentage of users that are detractors. This results in a number between -100 and 100 which is the NPS.</p><p>To give some examples, an NPS of 0 means your company has just as many promoters as detractors, whereas an NPS of 100 means everyone loves your product. Here are the NPS's for a few well known companies according to <a href="https://www.satmetrix.com/infographic/2020-us-consumer-benchmarks/">satmetrix</a>:</p><ul role="list"><li>Apple - 62</li><li>AirBnB - 43</li><li>AT&amp;T - 20</li></ul><p>What is Snowflake's NPS score? It's 71. According to NPS, Snowflake's customers like Snowflake more than Apple's customers like Apple.</p><p>The average Snowflake customer pays Snowflake $165k a year. Average contract value (ACV) is a useful metric to look at because it gives you a rough sense of how efficient a sales team is. To elaborate, there's a similar amount of work needed for a sales person to sell a $50k deal as there is for a sales person to sell a $100k deal. This is because most of the work a sales person does such as giving a demo, dealing with the paper process, and negotiating, have to happen regardless of how much the contract actually winds up being. Closing a $100k deal brings in twice as much revenue as a $50k deal does, but it's not usually twice as much work.</p><p>For this reason, higher average contract values are usually better. According to <a href="https://dskok-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-KBCM-SaaS-Survey.pdf">KBCM Technology Group</a>, 29% of software businesses have an ACV between $50k-$250k, and only 9% have an ACV greater than $250k. That gives Snowflake a relatively healthy ACV.</p><p>Not only does Snowflake have a high ACV, but their high end contract values are also really high. Snowflake has 56 customers that pay them over $1M a year. They also have Capital One, their largest customer, account for 11% of their 2019 revenue with approximately $29M.</p><p>Snowflake's net loss of $349M during 2019 does not sound good, but it does not tell the full story. There are two issues with using profit as a metric when looking at a subscription software business:</p><ul role="list"><li>Due to the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), a customer can give Snowflake money, but Snowflake can't count that money as revenue until a later date, even though that money is in Snowflake's bank account.</li><li>A net loss doesn't tell you where the money is coming in and where the money is going to.</li></ul><p>Addressing each of these points:</p><h3>Revenue under GAAP</h3><p>Under GAAP, Snowflake doesn't count revenue when a customer pays them, but instead when a customer uses the Snowflake product. To be more specific when a company pays Snowflake, they are purchasing a number of "Snowflake credits". When you are using the Snowflake product you exchange your credits for Snowflake compute time.</p><p>As an example, let's say a customer purchases one year of Snowflake credits for $100k. That money winds up in Snowflake's bank account, but Snowflake cannot count that $100k as revenue until Snowflake delivers the service, which is when the customer uses their credits for compute time. If the customer uses a quarter of the Snowflake credits within three months after purchases them, under GAAP, Snowflake would count that as $25k in revenue over those three months.</p><p>You can see the impact this has by looking at the $688M Snowflake has in "remaining performance obligations". This $688M is money that Snowflake's customers have either already given to Snowflake or have contractually committed to giving to Snowflake, but it won't show up as revenue until the customers use the credits they purchased.</p><h3>Where's the money going?</h3><p>The other thing to look at is what they are spending the money on. Snowflake is making money on every sale. They have a gross profit of 62% so they have no problem running the product. The thing is they are spending A LOT on sales and marketing. Their total net loss for the last six months was $171M while during the same time period they spent $191M on sales and marketing. If they wanted to, they could stop investing in growth, lay off their entire sales and marketing team, and they would become profitable. In other words, Snowflake could be profitable if they wanted to, but they are intentionally choosing not to, and are instead focusing on growing the customer base.</p><p>Not that they should. If we assume the $191M they spent in sales and marketing over the last six months was responsible for the $81M increase in revenue in the last six months compared to the prior six months, every $1 Snowflake invests in sales and marketing results in $.42 of revenue. With Snowflake's 158% net retention rate, that customer will pay back the initial investment in sales and marketing after around two years and then return many times the investment in the years following that.</p><p>In practice, Snowflake probably sees a return on investment much sooner. A company pays for Snowflake well before Snowflake is able to count that money as revenue.</p><p>So does it make sense for Snowflake's market cap to be 150x their revenue. I definitely think it's high, but I it's certainly plausible. They're growing faster, have higher customer satisfaction, and just have phenomenal metrics across the board when compared to similar businesses.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) is some of the most tax-advantaged stock you can hold, yet few people know about it. If you’re a founder, early employee, or investor, you can potentially save millions of dollars by understanding the implications of QSBS.</p>



<p>In this article I will discuss the following:</p>



<ol><li>History of QSBS</li><li>QSBS Tax Savings</li><li>Requirements for QSBS</li><li>Section 1045 Rollover (applicable if you don’t meet the five year holding period, explained below)</li></ol>



<p>I recently sold shares in a company I co-founded and spoke to more than two dozen accountants in the process. I’m summarizing my findings and experiences in the article below. As such, the information in this article is not formal tax advice. I recommend you speak with your accountant prior to making any decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>History of QSBS</h2>



<p>Section 1202 is the section of the tax code that outlines the QSBS tax exclusion. It was added to the tax code in 1993 to encourage individuals to invest in new ventures, far before the creation of Silicon Valley as we know it today. The act, however, failed to provide the intended incentive of spurring investments in new ventures.</p>



<p>Over the past three decades, a number of tailwinds have propelled QSBS back into the limelight. Congress reduced the tax on long-term capital gains in 1997, increased the tax savings of QSBS incrementally until 2010, and finally reduced corporate taxes from 35% to a flat 21% in 2017. These three forces have made QSBS far more relevant today than in the past.</p>



<h2>QSBS Tax Savings</h2>



<p><strong>Under Section 1202, your gains from selling QSBS may be eligible for up to 100% exclusion from federal and state taxes. This exclusion is limited to the </strong><strong><em>greater</em></strong><strong> of $10 million or 10 times your cost basis during a liquidity event.</strong></p>



<p>For instance, the excludable amount for a founder may be on $10 million of gain, while the exclusion for a VC may be much greater. If, for instance, a VC invests $20 million, the VC may obtain an exclusion for $200 million of gain. See the “Scenario Table” in the Appendix for more examples. Please also note that if you end up selling your shares in multiple tranches over multiple years, the excludable amount might vary. Reference<a href="https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2018/nov/qualified-small-business-stock-more-attractive.html"> this</a> article for further details.</p>



<p><strong>If you qualify for a QSBS tax exclusion, you are 100% exempt from federal taxes. The current federal tax rate is 23.8% (20% federal + 3.8% medicare). This means you can save 23.8% in long-term capital gains that you would have been subject to otherwise. Depending on which state you live in (</strong><strong><em>not</em></strong><strong> which state the company is incorporated), you may qualify for state-level exclusion as well.</strong> States typically fall into one of four buckets:</p>



<ol><li>States with no individual income tax or no capital gains tax. These states are QSBS compliant by default.</li><li>States that follow the federal tax code and waive state taxes if an individual meets the federal-level QSBS requirements. These states are also QSBS compliant.&nbsp;</li><li>States that have their own QSBS exclusion statues.</li><li>States that do not recognize QSBS in any way, shape, or form (California notably falls in this bucket).&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>I’ve provided a chart of applicable QSBS treatment in each of the 50 states and District of Columbia in the Appendix.</p>



<h2>Requirements for QSBS</h2>



<p><strong>For your stock to qualify as QSBS, you must meet certain requirements at the time of your stock issuance, and others during your entire holding period of the stock. If you sell QSBS, you must report the entire gain as a long-term gain on your Schedule D, and enter the allowable exclusion as a loss below the entry for the gain.</strong></p>



<h3>Requirements that must be met on the date of issuance:</h3>



<ul><li>Corporation issuing the stock must be a domestic C-Corp (and the stock must be issued after August 9, 1993)</li><li>You must acquire your stock directly from the company for money, property, or services. The only exception is if you acquire the stock by gift or inheritance. In this case, you are treated as having acquired the stock in the same manner as the original owner.<ul><li>Note: do not contribute the stock to a family LLC, limited partnership/trust, or to an LLC organized to manage the sale of your stock. This will disqualify the stock as QSBS.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Corporation must have assets of $50M or less at the time you receive your shares (or exercise your options).</strong><ul><li>Note: this is a continuous requirement and if at any point the assets of a corporation exceed $50M, the corporation can never again issue QSBS (even if the assets are below $50M on the date of the subsequent issuance).</li><li>Note: the assets of the corporation must not exceed $50M even after taking into account amounts the corporation received in the current issuance. If, for instance, a company has $40M in the bank and is raising a $20M Series B, none of the newly issued Series B stock will be QSBS.</li></ul></li><li>You must determine your stock issuance date. This is critical for three reasons:<ul><li><strong>Starts the clock for purposes of the five-year holding period requirement. In order to be eligible for the tax exemption outlined above, you must have held on to your stock for a minimum of five years.</strong> If you do not meet this minimum requirement, you can employ a Section 1045 rollover (described below) to extend your holding period.<ul><li><strong>Note: this requirement is yet another reason why you should early exercise your options and file an 83(b). Early exercise allows you to 1) start the one year holding period for long-term capital gains treatment, and 2) start the five year holding period for Section 1202. If you don’t file an 83(b) election, the clock on long-term capital gain only begins when your shares vest – so if there are multiple vesting dates, you will have multiple clocks to monitor for long-term capital gain – and, if eligible, QSBS. An unexercised option or warrant is not considered QSBS, even if the underlying stock would meet the definition of QSBS.</strong></li><li><strong>Note: for stock acquired through the exercise of an option, the company must pass the “$50M asset test” on the date of your exercise, not on the date of your grant.</strong> Similarly, for stock acquired through the vesting of RSUs, the company must pass the “$50M asset test” on vesting, and your five year holding period begins on vesting, not on grant.</li><li>Note: if the stock was received as a gift, inheritance, or as a distribution from a partnership, the acquisition date is the date on which the transferor acquired the stock.</li></ul></li><li>Determines whether gain from the sale of the QSB stock is eligible for a 50%, 75%, or 100% federal tax exclusion.<ul><li>50% federal tax exclusion for stock issued before February 18, 2009</li><li>75% federal tax exclusion for stock issued between February 18, 2009 and September 27, 2010</li><li>100% federal tax exclusion for stock issued after September 27, 2010</li></ul></li><li>Marks the date on which the company must have $50M or less in assets.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>Requirements that must be met during the shareholder’s holding period:</h3>



<ul><li>Corporation must be a C-corp for the entire holding period.</li><li><strong>The corporation must be an “active business” during the entire period you held your stock. This means that at least 80% (by value) of the assets in your corporation must be used to pursue business in industries </strong><strong><em>other</em></strong><strong> than the industries below. Note that if your business provides a service, then it most likely does not qualify as a qualified small business.&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Health, law, non-software engineering (civil, electrical, etc), architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, or brokerage.</li><li>Banking, insurance, financing, leasing, investing, or similar business.</li><li>Farming.</li><li>Mining or natural resource production or extraction.</li><li>Operating a hotel, restaurant, or similar business.</li></ul></li><li>Cash held for burn requirements generally qualify under this “active business” requirement. However, after two years, technically no more than 50% of the corporation’s assets can qualify under this exemption. While startups usually satisfy this requirement, it isn’t always clear how to apply the rule, especially if the startup retains significant cash following an investment (in other words, overfunded startups sitting on cash). If you’re like most startups and you’re burning cash to fund business operations you will most likely pass this check.</li><li>If the corporation bought back 5% or more of its stock in the year before or after your stock issuance, your stock will not qualify as QSBS.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Section 1045 Rollover</h2>



<p><strong>In order to be eligible for preferential tax treatment under Section 1202, you must satisfy the requirements above and have held onto your stock for at least five years. If you have not met the five year minimum, however, you can employ a Section 1045 rollover to extend your holding period.</strong></p>



<p><strong>If you have held onto your QSBS for at least six months, you can sell your QSBS and roll the proceeds of the sale into another QSBS issuer without recognizing a gain under Section 1045.</strong> This is a similar concept to a Section 1031 exchange in real estate. <strong>Per Section 1045, you have 60 days from the date of the sale of your original QSBS to roll the sale proceeds into new QSBS.</strong> In general, you should roll all of the proceeds from your sale of original QSBS into the new QSBS. If you take any cash off the table after the initial sale, that amount would be subject to capital gains tax. <strong>The cost basis of the new QSBS is the same as the cost basis of the original QSBS, and the holding period from the original QSBS is counted towards the holding period of the new QSBS.</strong></p>



<p>Consider the following scenario: you acquire 5M shares of QSBS from “Company A” on January 1st, 2010 for $0.00001 per share. Your original cost basis is $50 (5M * $0.00001). Assume you then sell these shares in Company A for $4M on January 1st, 2012, and then reinvest this $4M to purchase 2,000 shares of QSBS in “Company B”. Your holding period will pick up from where it left off and the cost basis for your new shares in Company B will be the same as the original cost basis for your shares in Company A ($50). If you then sell your QSBS in Company B at any point after January 1, …</p></div></div>

  <p>“It’s an old-fashioned thing to say, but I think that occasions of fear are invitations for freedom and for courage.”<br>
<em>—John O’Donohue</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was just before Thanksgiving in 2017 and I was scared. The enormity of the decision I had just made – to leave behind 5 years worth of memories, friendships, and professional networks on the opposite side of the country to move home and run for office – was finally hitting home. I was lonely and afraid. So I decided to drive down to Durham to meet up with a close high school friend I hadn’t seen in a long, long time. After a couple of beers, I confessed my anxiousness. She recommended <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RpKTUDIhXlfXdoZXqt3gBlY0Zvy4_EZY">a lecture by an Irish thinker named John O’Donohue, specifically “Love is the Only Antidote to Fear”</a>. The words hit me like a thunderbolt. Ever since then, whenever I am weighing the pros and cons of a big decision, I make sure to re-listen to this talk.</p>

<p>These are confusing, chaotic, and uncertain times. It is natural to be afraid. I hope this lecture provides some level of comfort to you, just as it has for me throughout the years.</p>

<p>NB: I highly, highly recommend <em>listening</em> to this talk. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RpKTUDIhXlfXdoZXqt3gBlY0Zvy4_EZY">You can find the link here</a>. O’Donohue is a noted lecturer for a reason, and it’s clear when you hear his highly conversational style in a Celtic lilt that those skills were honed at a lecturn during his years as a parish priest. However, if you prefer to read the text, I have transcribed it below.</p>

<p>Something that everyone has in common is the experience of fear, and the power of the presence of fear. There is no one that could say that they’re not afraid of something. Fear is present in every heart, and science and cultural studies show us that we’re right to be afraid to a level of about 10% in our experience that that corresponds with what’s actually the situation, but that 90% of the fear that we have is unreal. And that’s the haunting loneliness and incredible wastage of what fear does to the human heart.</p>

<p>Fear is the greatest trickster of all. It makes what is real seem unreal and it makes the unreal, real. I always think from nature that the most telling image to correspond to fear is fog. If you’ve ever been out in the mountains and you’ve got caught in fog, you’ll know what I’m talking about. Several years ago, in the mountains at home in the west of Ireland that I know very well, I brought a friend from Manchester for a day on the mountains. And about two hours up in the mountains, the fog came down. I know these mountains really well and we kept going because I told her that I knew where I was going. And about four hours later, we found ourselves exactly back in the place where we were on the fog came down, not knowing where we were. Eventually we got down off the mountains because I was able to hear the ocean and we went in that direction. But that’s what fear does. And your normal experience is that it inflates things and makes something that’s fairly small very, very huge.</p>

<p>Some years ago, I was talking to a friend of mine who is into psychology and psychotherapy about fear. He said that something that he found very helpful when he was afraid was to hold on to one question and stick with it. And the question is to ask yourself, “What is it, exactly, that I’m afraid of?” If you hold to this question, gradually what seems huge and amorphous and beyond your control begins to shrink right down to one moment, one thing that you can actually deal with and handle.</p>

<p>Part of the reason that fear has such power over us is we are vulnerable, and fear draws great strength from time. If you wake up one Monday morning and you realize that on the next Friday that you have something horrible waiting for you, the chances are that your days on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday will be totally shadowed by the threat of Friday, and you waste four lovely days because the fear of what’s waiting for you robs you of the beauty of the days that you have.
Something that I try to do myself when I’m afraid is to sit myself down, and on an empty chair opposite me I’d imagine the thing (or person or situation or whatever) that I was afraid of. Then I’d say to myself, “Let’s do it now. Instead of being miserable about it, let’s have a blast at it.” And then I would imagine, I’d say to myself, “What’s the worst thing that could happen in this situation?” And I’d think about it until I realize what the worst thing was and then I would force myself to imagine all the elements of the worst aspect of it. And then by the time the situation actually arrives, it isn’t too bad at all. You’ll be incredibly relieved cause it’s never as bad as you thought!</p>

<p>One of the questions that’s always haunted me is what is the origin of fear? Why are humans afraid? One of the reasons is that the place we live in the world is in this clay tent of the human body. And it’s a very vulnerable old tent. Because once you’re in a body, you’re always somewhere. You can never successfully hide and you can always be gotten to. You know, like in some of these mafia films, when they go off for a while but somebody always turns up nearly and gets to them? It’s the same thing, but in a human life.</p>

<p>The other thing is that the way that we interpret the world is an incredibly painful and broken and tender way through birth, which was separation. And I always think that humans are really able for anything after successfully coming through the trauma of being born. Because it was loss, separation, alienation. I mean, I often think that’s an image I often use for myself in relation to death. Maybe we have death all wrong because we always think of it as an ending, as closure. A quenching.
But say you turn it the other way around. Say you conducted an interview with the baby in the womb before it was born. And say was a real “with it” baby, the kind that wanted to know what’s going down and you said:</p>

<p>“Okay, baby, you asked for it. You’re going to get it. Here’s the story. In a half an hour you will be expelled from the shelter of the womb where you have emerged and been formed. Secondly, you will come out along a passage (and we all did this) where you will feel that every moment you’re being smothered. Thirdly, you will arrive out into a huge vacancy, probably with merciless light in it. Fourthly, the cord that connects you to the mother heart will be cut. Fifthly, regardless of how close you ever come to anyone in your life afterwards, you will always be on your own. Sixthly, you’re going on a journey for which there is no map. And seventhly, you can’t turn back and eighth, anything can happen to you on the journey.”
Now, if the baby was still breathing at that stage, it would have to conclude, “Jesus, things were really nice and good here and now it looks like I’m going to die,” when in actual fact what’s happening is that has been born. And my suspicion in relation to death is that we only see all the destructive side of it, and that possibly, (I’ll address this bit tomorrow and my talk on beauty), that what’s happening actually in death is that we’re being born again. This time, in a way that the loneliness of space and time no longer has a hold over us.</p>

<p>But I think that if you were to ask, “What is the root of all fear?” the root of all fear is in the fear of death. And I have an old suspicion that if you sort out your fear of death as the worst thing – not something that just might happen to you but that IS going to happen to you – then you remove the soil and the nutrient that nourishes your normal fears.</p>

<p>I used to be very afraid of dying for a long time in my life. And then I became a Roman Catholic priest. And in my years as a priest, one of the immense privileges was to help people to die. And early on in my priesthood there was this woman that I knew. She was a lovely woman, 27 years old. She was a traveler, one of the gypsy people, and she had two children and she was pregnant with a third child when she got leukemia. She was being treated for it though, and it seemed to be working. I was visiting her once a week, and one evening I went in to see her and I was going to give her a hug and she said, “Don’t hug me, I’m bleeding.” And it turned out that the treatment wasn’t working. About four nights later, in the middle of the night, there was a knock at the door of my house. Her family was there and they said, “We’ve got news from the hospital that she’s really bad and we need to go in.” So I talked to the father and mother, and then they all came with their vans and we all went into the hospital. And as soon as I came in the hospital door, I saw the young woman on all these machines and tubes and everything. And she looked up at me, the poor pet, and she said, “Am I going to die?” And I said, “I don’t know whether you’re going to die or not. But when I do, I will tell you.” She said, “Okay.” So then everybody arrived and all the rest of it, and about 4:15 in the morning, she said to me, “Will you open the window?” And something told me that she was going to die. So I went out and I met the house doctor who was on duty and I said, “What’s the story here?” He said, “At 7:30, we are going to bring our downstairs and try one more procedure. But, in actual fact, we expect her to be dead by 10.” So I went back into the room and I said that I wanted some time on my own with her. All the family left and I sat down. I took her hand.</p>

<p>“You’re going to die,” is one of the most awful sentences any human being can ever hear, no matter how sick you are. Sometimes we think when people are sick that they know what’s coming, but they don’t. Because language is an incredible presence. There are some words that are said that are like …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Deep Learning waves have lapped at the shores of computational linguistics for several years now, but 2015 seems like the year when the full force of the tsunami hit the major Natural Language Processing (NLP) conferences.” -<a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00239">Dr. Christopher D. Manning, Dec 2015</a> <sup id="fnref:part1_1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may sound hyperbolic - to say the established methods of an entire field of research are quickly being superseded by a new discovery, as if hit by a research ‘tsunami’. But, this catastrophic language is appropriate for describing the meteoric rise of Deep Learning over the last several years - a rise characterized by drastic improvements over reigning approaches towards the hardest problems in AI, massive investments from industry giants such as Google, and exponential growth in research publications (and Machine Learning graduate students). Having taken several classes on Machine Learning, and even used it in undergraduate research, I could not help but wonder if this new ‘Deep Learning’ was anything fancy or just a scaled up version of the ‘artificial neural nets’ that were already developed by the late 80s. And let me tell you, the answer is quite a story - the story of not just neural nets, not just of a sequence of research breakthroughs that make Deep Learning somewhat more interesting than ‘big neural nets’  (that I will attempt to explain in a way that just about anyone can understand), but most of all of how several unyielding researchers made it through dark decades of banishment to finally redeem neural nets and achieve the dream of Deep Learning.</p>

I am certainly not a foremost expert on this topic. In depth technical overviews with long lists of references written by those who actually made the field what it is include Yoshua Bengio's <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/TR1312.pdf">"Learning Deep Architectures for AI"</a>, Jürgen Schmidhuber's <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.7828v4.pdf">"Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview"</a> and LeCun et al.s' <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/NatureDeepReview.pdf">"Deep learning"</a>. In particular, this is mostly a history of research in the US/Canada AI community, and even there will not mention many researchers; a particularly in depth history of the field that covers these omissions is Jürgen Schmidhuber's <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-overview.html">"Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview"</a>. I am also most certainly not a professional writer, and will cop to there being shorter and much less technical overviews written by professional writers such as Paul Voosen's <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Believers/190147">"The Believers"</a>, John Markoff's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/science/scientists-see-advances-in-deep-learning-a-part-of-artificial-intelligence.html">"Scientists See Promise in Deep-Learning Programs"</a> and Gary Marcus's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-deep-learning-a-revolution-in-artificial-intelligence">"Is “Deep Learning” a Revolution in Artificial Intelligence?"</a>. I also will stay away from getting too technical here, but there is a plethora of tutorials on the internet on all the major topics covered in brief by me.
<br>
Any corrections would be appreciated, though I will note some ommisions are intentional since I want to try and keep this 'brief' and a good mix of simple technical explanations and storytelling.

<p>The beginning of a story spanning half a century, about how we learned to make computers learn. In this part, we shall cover the birth of neural nets with the Perceptron in 1958, the AI Winter of the 70s, and neural nets’ return to popularity with backpropagation in 1986.</p>

</figure>

<p>Let’s start with a brief primer on what Machine Learning is. Take some points on a 2D graph, and draw a line that fits them as well as possible. What you have just done is generalized from a few example of pairs of input values (x) and output values (y) to a general function that can map any input value to an output value. This is known as linear regression, and it is a wonderful little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#cite_note-4">200 year old</a> technique for extrapolating a general function from some set of input-output pairs. And here’s why having such a technique is wonderful: there is an incalculable number of functions that are hard to develop equations for directly, but are easy to collect examples of input and output pairs for in the real world - for instance, the function mapping an input of recorded audio of a spoken word to an output of what that spoken word is.</p>

<p>Linear regression is a bit too wimpy a technique to solve the problem of speech recognition, but what it does is essentially what <strong>supervised Machine Learning</strong> is all about: ‘learning’ a function given a <strong>training set</strong> of <strong>examples</strong>, where each example is a pair of an input and output from the function (we shall touch on the unsupervised flavor in a little while). In particular, machine learning methods should derive a function that can generalize well to inputs not in the training set, since then we can actually apply it to inputs for which we do not have an output. For instance, Google’s current speech recognition technology is powered by Machine Learning with a massive training set, but not nearly as big a training set as all the possible speech inputs you might task your phone with understanding.</p>

<p>This generalization principle is so important that there is almost always a <strong>test set</strong> of data (more examples of inputs and outputs) that is not part of the training set. The separate set can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning technique by seeing how many of the examples the method correctly computes outputs for given the inputs. The nemesis of generalization is <strong>overfitting</strong> - learning a function that works really well for the training set but badly on the test set. Since machine learning researchers needed means to compare the effectiveness of their methods, over time there appeared standard <strong>datasets</strong> of training and testing sets that could be used to evaluate machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Okay okay, enough definitions. Point is - our line drawing exercise is a very simple example of supervised machine learning: the points are the training set (X is input and Y is output), the line is the approximated function, and we can use the line to find Y values for X values that don’t match any of the points we started with. Don’t worry, the rest of this history will not be nearly so dry as all this. Here we go.</p>

<p>Why have all this prologue with linear regression, since the topic here is ostensibly neural nets? Well, in fact linear regression bears some resemblance to the first idea conceived specifically as a method to make machines learn: <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1959-09865-001">Frank Rosenblatt’s <strong>Perceptron</strong></a><sup id="fnref:part1_2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_2">2</a></sup>.</p>

</figure>

<p>A psychologist, Rosenblatt conceived of the Percetron as a simplified mathematical model of how the neurons in our brains operate: it takes a set of binary inputs (nearby neurons), multiplies each input by a continuous valued weight (the synapse strength to each nearby neuron), and thresholds the sum of these weighted inputs to output a 1 if the sum is big enough and otherwise a 0 (in the same way neurons either fire or do not). Most of the inputs to a Perceptron are either some data or the output of another Perceptron, but an extra detail is that Perceptrons also have one special ‘bias’ input, which just has a value of 1 and basically ensures that more functions are computable with the same input by being able to offset the summed value. This model of the neuron built on the work of Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts <a href="http://www.minicomplexity.org/pubs/1943-mcculloch-pitts-bmb.pdf">Mcculoch-Pitts</a><sup id="fnref:part1_3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_3">3</a></sup>, who showed that a neuron model that sums binary inputs and outputs a 1 if the sum exceeds a certain threshold value, and otherwise outputs a 0, can model the basic OR/AND/NOT functions. This, in the early days of AI, was a big deal - the predominant thought at the time was that making computers able to perform formal logical reasoning would essentially solve AI.</p>

    <figcaption>Another diagram, showing the biological inspiration. The <b>activation function</b> is what people now call the non-linear function applied to the weighted input sum to produce the output of the artificial neuron - in the case of Rosenblatt's Perceptron, the function just a thresholding operation.  <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/">(Source)</a> </figcaption>    
</figure>

<p>However, the Mcculoch-Pitts model lacked a mechanism for learning, which was crucial for it to be usable for AI. This is where the Perceptron excelled - Rosenblatt came up with a way to make such artificial neurons learn, inspired by the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.900930310/abstract">foundational work</a><sup id="fnref:part1_4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:part1_4">4</a></sup> of Donald Hebb. Hebb put forth the unexpected and hugely influential idea that knowledge and learning occurs in the brain primarily through the formation and change of synapses between neurons - concisely stated as Hebb’s Rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Perceptron did not follow this idea exactly, but having weights on the inputs allowed for a very simple and intuitive learning scheme: given a <strong>training set</strong> of input-output examples the Perceptron should ‘learn’ a function from, for each example increase the weights if the Perceptron output for that example’s input is too low compared to the example, and otherwise decrease the weights if the output is too high. Stated ever so slightly more formally, the algorithm is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start off with a Perceptron having random weights and a training set</li>
  <li>For the inputs of an example in the …</li></ol></div></div>

      <p>As I was writing an article for the first edition of <a href="https://pagedout.institute/">Paged Out</a>,
I had an interesting (albeit too short) conversation regarding
its <a href="https://pagedout.institute/download/PagedOut_001_wallpaper_30.png">cover</a>
with <a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=50">Gynvael Coldwind</a>.
Drawn by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/refiend">ReFiend</a>, it
features two people on the foreground, wielding what looks like guns.
This lead to a discussion on the omnipresence of military jargon, and thus violence,
in the world of computer security. I told him that I'll publish a blogpost 
to correctly articulate my thoughts on the topic, instead of the incoherent
rambling that I served him.</p>
<p>At every single security conference, there is someone with a direct quote of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War">Art of War</a> on their slide
deck, and there is a metric fuckton of assorted military-inspired bullshit

<p>I understand that it's tempting to compare computer security to war: It takes our daily toil and
raises the stakes, makes us feel that victory is glorious; a battle of the
minds, that our work really matters and is important; and we are united against a common enemy.</p>
<p>But when you think about it, it's absurd: War is something terrible that should be avoided at
almost any cost, a <em>solution</em> of last resort. The worse outcome of
computer-related drama/problems probably doesn't imply entire populations
dying, being tortured, millions of refugees, camps, … Odds are that you won't
save actual lives by deploying a firewall: don't call it a "cyber bulletproof vest deployment".</p>
<p>War justifies terrible behaviours: who cares about you being screamed at when
you're <em>at war</em>? Who cares about your family life, your dinners plans, your hollidays, … when you're <em>at war</em>? What
are broken principles and despicable means, when you're <em>at war</em> ? …
which is a disastrous way to govern and organise a workspace.</p>
<p>Moreover, war maps poorly over computer security. What is a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">penetration
test</a>"
combat-wise? How do you map "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_">full disclosure</a>" to war? What is a
"prisoner's camp" or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpet_bombing">carpet bombing</a>" with a computer (apparently <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/proof-of-concept-carpet-bombing-exploit-released-in-the-wild/">zdnet</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/carpet-bombing-ddos-attack-takes-down-south-african-isp-for-an-entire-day/">can</a> )? Rigidly mapping
one onto the other can and will create huge distortions.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody says that computer security stuff actually <em>is</em> war, but
as said in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By">Metaphors We Live By </a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff">George Lakoff</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Johnson_(professor)">Mark
Johnson</a>, "Conceptual metaphors shape not just our communication, but also shape
the way we think and act.". Leading to nonsensical bullshit posts like <a href="https://twoscenarios.typepad.com/maneuver_marketing_commun/2005/05/military_metaph.html">this one</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeslifestyle/2012/05/07/plea-for-a-cease-fire-in-business-as-warfare-advice/#f77cce37aa79">entire laughingly stupid books</a>,
and to despicable and hostile work climate.</p>
<p>An other perverse effect is that since military and violent imagery are traditionally, culturally and stereotypically associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_masculinity">toxic masculinity</a>,
this doesn't help with increasing the <a href="https://www.isc2.org/research/women-in-cybersecurity">dramatically low</a> diversity in the computer security sector.</p>
<p>When we think about it, we have way better metaphors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer security as gardening: defending against bugs, growing programs,
     harvesting money, …</li>
<li>Computer security as building a house: everyone wants cosy stuff, yet you
    still need a solid door, maybe a couple of windows as well, definitely solid
    walls, …</li>
<li>Computer security as playing cards: there are adversaries, winning moves,
    gambles, influences, …</li>
<li>Computer security as guarding a museum: priceless artefacts, sneaky attackers
    à la Arsène Lupin, …</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of computer security is to make safer systems, not about waging wars,
and thus shouldn't be envisioned as such. </p>
<p>Of course, if you're working in the military and in infosec, there are overlaps,
but I would argue that this is more about military than it is about computer security.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roybahat">Rob Bahat</a> said in 2016 in his <a href="https://shift.newco.co/2016/11/15/business-is-not-war-lets-stop-talking-like-it-is/">Business Is Not War. Let’s Stop Talking Like It Is.</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business, at its best, is creation — and war,
always, is destruction. They are opposites, and if we want industry to be a
positive force in our personal lives, environment, society, and future, we
should divorce our language about business from the tragic (if sometimes
necessary) conflicts that bring devastation. There are so many good businesses;
but it is hard to find a good war.</p>

<p>Web Components had so much potential to empower HTML to do more, and make web development more accessible to non-programmers and easier for programmers. Remember how exciting it was every time we got new shiny HTML elements that actually <em>do stuff</em>? Remember how exciting it was to be able to do sliders, color pickers, dialogs, disclosure widgets straight in the HTML, without having to include any widget libraries?</p>



<p>The promise of Web Components was that we’d get this convenience, but for a much wider range of HTML elements, developed much faster, as nobody needs to wait for the full spec + implementation process. We’d just include a script, and boom, we have more elements at our disposal!</p>



<p>Or, that was the idea. Somewhere along the way, the space got flooded by JS frameworks aficionados, who revel in complex APIs, overengineered build processes and dependency graphs that look like the roots of a banyan tree.</p>



<figure><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/2025/32441377780_e3acf6de12_b.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>This is what the roots of a Banyan tree look like. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/79721788@N00/32441377780/">Photo by David Stanley on Flickr (CC-BY)</a>. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Perusing the components on <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/">webcomponents.org</a> fills me with anxiety, and I’m perfectly comfortable writing JS — I write JS for a living! What hope do those who can’t write JS have? Using a custom element from the directory often needs to be preceded by a ritual of npm flugelhorn, import clownshoes, build quux, all completely unapologetically because “here is my truckload of dependencies, yeah, what”. Many steps are even omitted, likely because they are “obvious”. Often, you wade through the maze only to find the component doesn’t work anymore, or is not fit for your purpose.</p>



<p>Besides setup, the main problem is that HTML is not treated with the appropriate respect in the design of these components. They are not designed as closely as possible to standard HTML elements, but <em>expect</em> JS to be written for them to do anything. HTML is simply treated as a shorthand, or worse, as merely a marker to indicate where the element goes in the DOM, with all parameters passed in via JS. I recall <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/12839#webcomponents">a wonderful talk by Jeremy Keith</a> a few years ago about this very phenomenon, where he discussed <a href="https://shop.polymer-project.org/">this e-shop Web components demo by Google</a>, which is the poster child of this practice. These are the entire contents of its <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element:</p>



<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;shop-app unresolved=""&gt;SHOP&lt;/shop-app&gt;
	&lt;script src="node_assets/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script type="module" src="src/shop-app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
	&lt;script&gt;window.performance&amp;&amp;performance.mark&amp;&amp;performance.mark("index.html");&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>



<p>If this is how Google is leading the way, how can we hope for contributors to design components that follow established HTML conventions?</p>



<p>Jeremy criticized this practice from the aspect of backwards compatibility: when JS is broken or not enabled, or the browser doesn’t support Web Components, the entire website is blank. While this is indeed a serious concern, my primary concern is one of <strong>usability</strong>: <strong>HTML is a lower barrier to entry language</strong>. Far more people can write HTML than JS. Even for those who do eventually write JS, it often comes after spending years writing HTML &amp; CSS.</p>



<p>If components are designed in a way that requires  JS, this excludes thousands of people from using them. And even for those who <em>can</em> write JS, HTML is often easier: you don’t see many people rolling their own sliders or using JS-based ones once <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code> became widely supported, right?</p>



<p>Even when JS is unavoidable, it’s not black and white. A well designed HTML element can reduce the amount and complexity of JS needed to a minimum. Think of the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog">&lt;dialog&gt;</a></code> element: it usually does require *some* JS, but it’s usually rather simple JS. Similarly, the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element is perfectly usable just by writing HTML, and has a comprehensive JS API for anyone who wants to do fancy custom things.</p>



<p>The other day I was looking for a simple, dependency free, tabs component. You know, the canonical example of something that is easy to do with Web Components, the example 50% of tutorials mention. I didn’t even care what it looked like, it was for a testing interface. I just wanted something that is small and works like a normal HTML element. Yet, it proved so hard I ended up writing my own!</p>



<h3>Can we fix this?</h3>



<p>I’m not sure if this is a design issue, or a documentation issue. Perhaps for many of these web components, there are easier ways to use them. Perhaps there are vanilla web components out there that I just can’t find. Perhaps I’m looking in the wrong place and there is another directory somewhere with different goals and a different target audience. </p>



<p>But if not, and if I’m not alone in feeling this way, we need a directory of web components with strict inclusion criteria:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plug and play.</strong> No dependencies, no setup beyond including one <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. If a dependency is absolutely <em>needed</em> (e.g. in a map component it doesn’t make sense to draw your own maps), the component loads it automatically if it’s not already loaded.</li><li>Syntax and API follows <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/designing-html-apis/"><strong>conventions established by built-in HTML elements</strong></a> and anything that <em>can</em> be done without the component user writing JS, <em>is</em> doable without JS, per <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">the W3C principle of least power</a>.</li><li><strong>Accessible by default</strong> via sensible ARIA defaults, just like normal HTML elements.</li><li><strong>Themable</strong> via <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part">::part()</a></code>, selective inheritance and custom properties. Very minimal style by default. Normal CSS properties should just “work” to the the extent possible.</li><li><strong>Only one component of a given type</strong> in the directory, that is <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>extensible</strong> and continuously iterated on and improved by the community. Not 30 different sliders and 15 different tabs that users have to wade through. No branding, no silos of “component libraries”. Only elements that are designed as closely as possible to what a browser would implement in every way the current technology allows.</li></ul>



<p>I would be up for working on this if others feel the same way, since that is not a project for one person to tackle. <em>Who’s with me?</em></p>



<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Wow this post blew up! Thank you all for your interest in participating in a potential future effort. I’m currently talking to stakeholders of some of the existing efforts to see if there are any potential collaborations before I go off and create a new one. <a href="https://twitter.com/leaverou">Follow me on Twitter to hear about the outcome</a>!</p>

We are coming at you today with a very special episode with Garry Tan of Initialized Fame and before that—Y Combinator, Posterous, and has a long and very illustrious career here in Silicon Valley. We are going to talk about the evolution of early-stage investing.</p><p>Garry has seen it all. I think he started back in the early days when early-stage investing meant a $2 million Series A at a $5 million poster. Maybe that was even high. </p><p>Garry: Yeah, it’s a while.</p><p>David: Goodness, things have changed. I'm so excited to have you here. Thanks for joining us and we can't wait to dive in.</p><p>Garry: Yeah, thank you for having me. Big fan of the show and it means a lot to me that you'd have me.</p><p>David: Likewise that you would come on. Let's just dive right in. We're going to weave in the story of Initialized along the way, but we thought maybe we'd start way back in those prehistoric days of what life is like?</p><p>Garry: So, Arthur Rock.</p><p>David: We've already done that on the Sequoia episodes. Not that far back but when was it that you started Posterous? Was it in 2005?</p><p>Garry: It was 2008, actually. </p><p>David: It was 2008. It’s later than I thought.</p><p>Garry: 2005 I was still at Palantir, so I had just designed the logo for Palantir and built one of the major product teams. Before that, I was Stanford Computer Engineering, and the crazy story for me is that friends of mine were starting a company. And I was the lowest of the low PM at Microsoft.</p><p>Ben: What that’s like?</p><p>Garry: Great place to start, great reach. Friends of mine were starting a company with Peter Thiel. They flew me down to San Francisco to have dinner with Peter right when he wrote the $500,000 check to Facebook. He said, “Garry, what are you doing at Microsoft? You're wasting your time.” I said, “I wanted to work at a startup, but they weren't startups in 2003, 2004.”</p><p>He said, “I'm so sure this is the right thing. You need to quit your job.” He asked me how much a year I made. I told him it was $70,000. He said, “Well, how about this? I'll write you a personal check from my bank account to yours. This is your risk opportunity. Quit your job.” I said, “Thank you very much, Mr. Thiel, but I might make it to level 60 next year,” and I got on a plane and went back to Seattle. That company turned into Palantir. </p><p>David: Oh my gosh.</p><p>Garry: I ended up joining a year later, they had hired away some of my closest friends who were way smarter than me. Bob McGrew, who now runs stuff over at OpenAI. Just so many smart people you get to meet in Silicon Valley over time. Once they hired away people smarter than, I was like, I need to quit my job at Microsoft. At the moment, when your friends are starting a business and you don't know anything about startups, tech, or how these things are funded. You say, well, I have a real job, and you say no.</p><p>David: We're talking about this with Kevin and Julia Hartz on the Eventbrite episode. I imagine you're right out of college. Your parents were probably (if you even told them about this) like, no way would they let you do this.</p><p>Garry: They’re like don’t do it. That seems unsafe. Yeah. The immigrant mentality for sure.</p><p>Ben: Garry, that's an amazing story, and it is absolutely one of survivorship bias because I want to share my story. I had a friend who was starting a YC Company. I had just moved to Seattle, and I was about to start my job at Microsoft. This friend lobbied and lobbied and lobbied. They’d come and get me to co-found the company with them.</p><p>For years, it looked like a huge mistake that I said, are you kidding me? I'd have to give back my signing bonus. I just moved here. This person told me something very similar that they would help definitely pay back the signing bonus. [...] your risk thing, they’d pay for my move. But as years have gone by, that company sold for exactly the preference. It would have been completely awash.</p><p>Garry: Yeah. That's tough.</p><p>Ben: For a while I was like, wow, that's one of several examples in my life where I really blew it on joining something early. Sometimes, not that my choice was the right choice, but unless it's Peter Thiel calling, the story doesn't always end the way you’re—</p><p>Garry: Yeah. These things are crazy risky. I often think about, wow, he was willing to pay that much upfront for an engineer. The rest of my career—even as an investor today—is now actually the inversion of that. Which is now I realize actually, it's the software engineers, designers, product people, and the builders who create the future. That's why we're able to do early-stage at all is that we look a lot more like them at that stage and so they'll pick us.</p><p>On the flip side, because I can still code a little bit and I still do design. I'm probably better at marketing now than I was 10 years ago.</p><p>David: You've diversified your skillset.</p><p>Garry: Yeah. That's right. We look more like them. Then that's the cool thing. I think that fits with the overall series. It's like we're talking about the traitorous eight—sending real typewritten letters across the country to financiers who were totally different from them. Now, what we're talking about—what you guys do and what we're doing—is we're no different. I think that time was for venture capitalists to say we're set apart, we're different.</p><p>David: We're in this ivory tower.</p><p>Garry: Yeah. The ivory tower is different. There's actually a ritualistic aspect that I was talking with Geoff Lewis at Bedrock. He has this theory that is really interesting. There is something to be said for I'm walking up the steps of Sequoia, this is what legends before me did, and I can be a part of that.</p><p>Now it's Zoom. If anything, now it's flipped. Now it's about the one on one conversation that you can have right here. That's why you have the rise of influencer investing. I know, we'll talk about it later, but that's part of the reason why I think YouTube is so important, for me anyway. I'm investing very deeply into it because I think it's a very interesting innovation in the course of how ventures are created.</p><p>David: VCs historically take a long time to catch on. YouTube was founded right around this time that we're talking about, and here we are in 2020 and people only just were starting to catch on.</p><p>Garry: 2005, yeah.</p><p>Ben: Garry, you talked about your time as a builder, and we're going to put a pin in this influencer investing and definitely come back to it because I think it'll be a nice way to round out the full story. Take us through founding Posterous, leaving Palantir, how you raised money for that, and how you went about getting enough proof that there's a there, there to invest more of your time.</p><p>Garry: There's nothing quite like seeing a super early-stage startup for your own eyes. Actually, I've always been really thankful for my time working with Stephen Cohen, Joe Lonsdale, and Alex Karp—just the founders of Palantir. Being able to build software from scratch. The more subtle interesting thing that I feel like I learned was how important it is to basically continue to hire people way smarter than you actually.</p><p>The cult making and the mythmaking of the startup very early are really underplayed. I don't feel like people talk about it enough, and Palantir, I think remains very good at it. The only cult that was stronger than our cult was the Facebook cult (I think). But it's interesting to see. Years later, that's an order of magnitude bigger as a company, which is fascinating to me. I think that actually is directly proportional. How strong your cult will result in how big your company ends up being.</p><p>Assuming you're in the right market and 10 other things that you need to survive. You need to be one of those survivors. A lot of things have to break your way.</p><p>Ben: What's an example of something that was done at Palantir to help build that cult brand?</p><p>Garry: Honestly, I think the simplest thing was even just trying to get the smartest, most capable, and hardworking people, which sounds really stupid simple. It seems like everyone should do that, but honestly, people just don't. When you think about hiring, the mistake that a lot of founders make—and honestly, I made this mistake at some level too when I worked on Posterous—was who can I get? And that's the wrong question.</p><p>You should start with who is the smartest person I know, and it doesn't matter where they're at. Because if I get them, then our self-fulfilling prophecy becomes destiny. If I don't, then it doesn't. I'm not doing myself or them a favor by not going after them. We would just go. </p><p>People would pass out yellow legal pads, and we would force everyone to step away from their computers, and it'd be like, write down the names of 20 people who were the smartest people you've ever met in any walk of life. It didn't have to be engineering, design, or whatever. It was just, who are the smartest people you know in your life. We take it into a backroom and cross-reference it and then those are like our hit list. It's like let's go get those people. We're going to take them to dinner, we're going to take them to lunch, we're going to meet them, we're going to chop down the tree, and we're going to go get them.</p><p>David: That mindset leads to doing things like what Peter offered to you. I can't believe I've never thought of that before. Yeah, you were ungettable. You were at Microsoft, but what if you just offered to personally cover the gap in your salary? It didn't work for you then, but a certain number of people, that's going to work with. And if you're not in that mindset of okay, I don't even go to try to get this person. Well then, you don't know, but once you're like, no, I'm going to try and get them. Well, what can I do?</p><p>Garry: Yeah. It just compounds from there because smart people want to work with smart people. I think that is testament and credit to what they've been able to build over the years. That becomes a self-fulfilling …</p></div></div>

        <p>Back when I first learnt tmux, I realized it was a really valuable tool. Soon
afterwards, I found myself in need of wanting to make a split only to find out
I wasn’t in tmux. This would lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Killing the running process.</li>
<li>Starting tmux.</li>
<li>Restarting the previous process.</li>
</ul>
<p>In pursuit of an ideal solution, I added a tiny script in my scripts directory
which was called by my bashrc.</p>
<h2 id="current-workflow">Current Workflow<a href="#current-workflow" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>My current workflow simply starts by opening the terminal. Instead of the bash
prompt, I am greeted by this.</p>
<pre><code>Choose the terminal to attach:
1 - 12: 3 windows (created Wed Sep 30 14:26:37 2020) (attached)
2 - tana: 3 windows (created Wed Sep 30 18:17:24 2020) (attached)
3 - userbot: 1 windows (created Tue Sep 29 18:37:19 2020)
4 - ytc: 1 windows (created Tue Sep 29 18:37:19 2020)

Create a new session by entering a name for it
</code></pre><p>At this point, I either</p>
<ul>
<li>enter a number (in this case from 1 to 4) to connect to an existing session.</li>
<li>enter a name to create a named tmux session.</li>
<li>hit enter (or C-D) to create an unnamed session (tmux will name it
sequentially).</li>
<li>type nil and hit enter to drop to shell without starting tmux</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation<a href="#implementation" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>In my <code>.bashrc</code>, live these lines.</p>

<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Although I use vim as my sole editor, I needed to demo something in VSCode and
for that case I have added an exception so that the script does not run the
<code>tmux_chooser</code> in VSCode’s integrated terminal.</p>
<p>Here is the source of <code>tmux_chooser</code> called above.</p>

<h2><a id="intro" name="intro">INTRO</a></h2>

<p>The vast majority of people on earth argue in a <em>destructive </em>fashion. Debates, especially in online spaces, are viewed as a battle of the wits in which egos are put on display and there can be only one "winner".</p>

<p>Instead, we should be arguing in a <em>constructive </em>fashion: treating arguments as an opportunity to expand knowledge, finding points of disagreement, and collaborating towards a common truth.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I used to be a destructive arguer. When I was younger, my goal in any argument was not to learn something new, but rather to assure my superiority over what I felt to be the clear stupidity of the other side. I even used to save screenshots of debates I had on various forums and social media platforms, returning periodically to reminisce about past skirmishes in which I "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/trigger-the-libs">owned the conservatives</a>".</p>

<p>Luckily, several years spent abroad gave me a different perspective. I realized that in the small-sided debates I used to engage in back home, my positions lacked the nuance and context of the greater world. For the first time, I began to do deep research on how to think — and argue — &nbsp;more clearly, drawing from concepts from philosophy, psychology, and behavioral economics.</p>

<p>This widened outlook led me to see arguments as a chance to build value, rather than destroy it. Instead of going through the mental anguish of battle, I now follow a collaborative approach to debate that I'd like to share in this guide in hopes that it will inspire others to argue more constructively.</p>

<p>Note that the content in this guide will focus on arguments about public issues, like politics and religion, as opposed to personal issues, like "you need to communicate more" or "you haven't done the dishes in weeks". Though there is overlap between the two, interpersonal arguments are much more complex and require more nuance than this guide can provide, plus there are already a ton of great resources out there that explore these topics more thoroughly.</p>

<h2><a id="mindset" name="mindset">MINDSET</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><span><em>&nbsp;"An argument should be a collaboration between two people to find the truth."</em></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I had to distill this guide down to one sentence, it would be the above. Even if you forget the individual tenets and strategies this guide has to offer, as long as you are treating any given argument as a collaboration in search of truth, you can't go wrong.</p>

<p>Arguing more effectively requires detaching yourself from the idea of "winning" in the traditional sense. Instead, you should declare victory when you have argued in good faith and kept an open mind.</p>

<p>True collaboration requires that both parties open an investigation into why they may be wrong and consider changing their beliefs. Which brings us to the three core tenets of a constructive debate mindset:</p>

<h3>Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind <a href="#Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind" id="Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind" name="Acknowledge You May Be Wrong, and Be Willing to Change Your Mind"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>Was there ever a time in which you had a deeply-held belief about something, but slowly came to realize that you were wrong? Maybe you thought a past partner was "the one", or you were devoted to a religious faith. Or perhaps something as simple as believing in Santa Claus.</p>

<p>What's to say that couldn't happen with the rest of your deeply-held beliefs, given enough evidence?</p>

<p>Go into every debate with the mindset that you may not know everything about the topic at hand, and in fact <em>may be wrong</em>.</p>

<p>If you successfully acknowledge that you may be wrong, it follows that you must then be willing to change your mind. Having the humility to admit that your mind has been changed is one of the most honorable positions in a good faith debate.</p>

<h3>Arguments Are Not Soldiers <a href="#Arguments Are Not Soldiers" id="Arguments Are Not Soldiers" name="Arguments Are Not Soldiers"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>In a war, all soldiers take an oath to fight for their own side, no matter what amount they agree with its principles. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f/politics-is-the-mind-killer">Eliezer Yudkowsky once observed</a> that in political debates, arguments were treated like soldiers: "<em>Once you know which side you're on, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side; otherwise it's like stabbing your soldiers in the back.</em>"</p>

<p>Because most people go into debate with a war-like mentality, they feel they must fly the flag for all points that <em>their</em><em> side</em> supports, regardless of how much they actually agree with them.</p>

<p>The red state gun-owner must be pro-religion, anti-abortion, anti-drugs, anti-tax, and skeptical of gender issues.</p>

<p>The blue state Subaru-owner must be anti-religion, pro-abortion, pro-drugs, pro-tax(ing-the-rich), and concerned about gender issues.</p>

<p>Most annoying is that given the societal expectations for this divide, being for or against one issue immediately assigns you to a "side" in the views of everyone involved. Breaking out of this Arguments as Soldiers mindset involves two steps:</p>

<p>1. Do not be afraid to agree with the arguments of the other side when they strike you as reasonable, and critique the arguments of your own side when they strike you as unreasonable (better yet, try not to have a side).</p>

<p>2. On the flip side, avoid stereotyping your debate partner based on one opinion. If you are engaging with someone in debate for the first time, assume that they agree with you on every other position than the one they are defending, until proven otherwise.</p>

<h3>There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil <a href="#There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil" id="There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil" name="There's Always Someone Who Thinks the Jedi Are Evil"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p><em>Brace yourself, Star Wars references incoming:</em></p>

<p>In a given debate, almost everyone thinks they are a member of the Jedi order, fighting for all that is virtuous and good in the universe. Yet for every Jedi, there's a Sith out there <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llLKar19XhA">who thinks that the Jedi are evil</a> and wrong and that <em>they</em> are actually the ones fighting for virtue and good. Remember that this person might even be <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, you are not a full agent of good, and your debate partner is not an agent of evil, or vice versa. You are simply citizens of the galaxy who happen to be operating with different sets of information. Look at the situation from a different perspective: if you were raised with Sith beliefs from childhood, don't you think you might believe the exact same things a Sith would?</p>

<p>In debate, your goal should not be to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMNKwZTv1d0">strike down the side of evil with all your hatred</a>, but rather work together with them to uncover the true facts about the universe, and in doing so perhaps change both your perspectives.</p>

<h2><a id="mindset" name="prework">PRE-WORK</a></h2>

<p>It would be great if choosing to pursue the path of arguing constructively was just a matter of changing your mindset overnight, but as Carl Sagan once said: <a href="https://youtu.be/BkHCO8f2TWs?t=9">"If you wish to bake an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."</a></p>

<p>In the same vein, if you wish to improve the constructiveness of the debates you engage in, you must first spend time re-inventing your entire mind.</p>

<p>This is because our mind is constantly working against us, plagued by ancient errors from the times in which we lived in caves and hunted woolly mammoths. These errors work against us in the form of cognitive biases and logical fallacies, which hinder our ability to clearly see reality and engage in sound debate.</p>

<h3>Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases <a href="#Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases" id="Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases" name="Recognize and Avoid Cognitive Biases"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>Cognitive biases are limits and mistakes in human judgement that prevent someone from acting rationally. They are present in every aspect of human life, and in tense situations like arguments, they tend to appear more often as emotions are heightened and the brain gets overloaded.</p>

<p>Common examples that relate to debates are <em>confirmation bias</em>, or the tendency of humans to seek out information that confirms existing beliefs, and <em>ingroup bias</em>, or the tendency to agree more strongly with people that appear to be part of our "tribe", but there are over 100 identified biases, and it's worth reading through the Wikipedia article on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">most common cognitive biases</a> so you can recognize when they might be clouding your thinking.</p>

<h3>Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies <a href="#Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies" id="Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies" name="Recognize and Avoid Logical Fallacies"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></h3>

<p>In part caused by cognitive biases, logical fallacies are errors in argument that give off an air of decisiveness, despite making points that don't hold up to logical scrutiny. While these are often used unintentionally, due to bias, carelessness, or ignorance, unfortunately, they can also be wielded intentionally by a shrewd debate partner.</p>

<p>Common examples in debate include the <em>false dilemma fallacy</em>: "you're either with us or against us", and the <em>slippery slope fallacy</em>: "if we allow the gays to marry, what's next: plants?" Just like cognitive biases, there are a large number of identified logical fallacies, and it's worth it to review the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies">entire list</a>, so you can spot them in your own arguments and in those of others.</p>

<h2><a id="debatebreakdown" name="debatebreakdown">BREAKING DOWN A DEBATE</a></h2>

<p>To the untrained eye, a debate might look like two or more parties trading argumentative points back and forth. But interestingly, these points can almost perfectly be classified into a few categories. Understanding these categories, and why some types of arguments are better than others, is crucial for learning how we and those whom we engage with in debate might shape their points. In a brilliant post called <em><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/08/varieties-of-argumentative-experience/">Varieties of Argumentative Experience</a></em>, Scott Alexander does just this, illuminating and labeling practically every part of a debate. The post itself is basically required reading, but is long-ish<em>,</em> so I will summarize here.</p>

<p>Think of a debate as a pyramid: <a href="#debatepyramid" id="debatepyramid" name="debatepyramid"><img alt="" src="http://liamrosen.com/anchor.png"></a></p>

<p><img alt="" height="548" src="http://liamrosen.com/Pyramid%20of%20Argumentative%20Experience.svg" width="978"></p>

<p>In general, the lower on the pyramid you are, the worse debate you're having. The goal should be to start as high as possible and continue to work your way towards the top.</p>

<p>Debates on twitter and other forms of social media are almost guaranteed to never rise above the lower dotted line, as these platform don't allow for more nuanced debate. Everything above the higher dotted line is our gold standard: two intelligent, charitable, and versed debaters can successfully maintain a debate at this level until some form of resolution.</p>

<p>The blue side represents the discussion …</p></div></div>

<p>Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html">wrote</a> about how to reach the top:</p>



<blockquote><p>If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:</p><p>1. Become the best at one specific thing.<br>2. Become good (top 25%) at two or more things.</p><cite>Scott Adams (<a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html">source</a>)</cite></blockquote>



<p>Number one, he says, is as good as impossible but number two is easy. </p>



<p>It’s called <strong>Skill Stacking</strong>. I went down the rabbit hole and found <a href="https://forge.medium.com/how-to-become-the-best-in-the-world-at-something-f1b658f93428">this excellent post</a> with this image:</p>

<p>See that little fella in the middle there? That’s the sweet spot. </p>



<p>I will never be the best in the world at running or programming or writing or agile process. But I can be in the top 25% of each. If I can find a way to combine two or more of them, then I can be the best at that combination. </p>



<p>I could build an audiobook reader app specifically for runners. I could create a niche blog for programmers who run. I could apply for Strava’s engineering team. I could write a book on how to apply agile principles to running. </p>



<p>Here’s another example, plucked from a random Hacker News comment:</p>



<blockquote><p>I learned this lesson from Clifford Stoll. He said that astronomers figure he must be an exceptional programmer, since he’s clearly a mediocre astronomer. While programmers figure he must be an exceptional astronomer, since his programming is strictly middle-of-the-road!</p><cite><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24263882">samatman on HN</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Of course, there are different types of skills. You’ll have trouble combining some skills, but others are universal. Public speaking, writing, marketing, programming, charisma; these can stack with almost anything. Scott Adams says this about public speaking:</p>



<blockquote><p>I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only one skill.</p><cite>Scott Adams</cite></blockquote>



<p>It’s a fun thought experiment. List the things you’re pretty good at, and brainstorm ways to combine 2 or more of them. What do you come up with?</p>

September 30, 2020 | https://parametricity.com/posts/2020-power/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://parametricity.com/posts/2020-power/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Recently there was a minor controversy over a blogpost from Coinbase’s <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">CEO</a>
discouraging employees from thinking about politics, and encouraging them to focus on profit-making.
I really appreciated this post, because I think it can be very clarifying for those employees who think their
company can be a pure force for good. The Coinbase blogpost gives the honest truth that in the final calculus,
corporations whose primary goal is profit-maximization can only incidentally and in small ways advance any other
aim.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a lot of promise for good in the actual technology underlying the crypto industry. This post will argue</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>If work is organized through for-profit corporations, there will be strong pressure from management and capital to
distort positive aspects of the technology in favor of profit-making</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>naive utopianism</strong> which has sustained the industry so far and helped produce some good technology <strong>is no match for this pressure</strong></li>
<li><strong>The only realistic way to combat this</strong> distorting pressure and focus on the socially-beneficial aspects of the technology <strong>is for workers</strong>
(the other human factor of production apart from management and capitalists) <strong>to use their collective power to push back</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is not surprisingly somewhat controversial among executives and VCs, but happily that same group loves
free speech and hates cancel-culture, so I assume I will not be attacked for expressing it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-web-and-what-should-it-be">What is the web and what should it be?</h2>
<p>What should the web be? It should be a medium for personal communication, organization for people in projects, art and creative expression, etc. that is oriented around the goals of individual and collective flourishing. That would be ideal.</p>
<p>In reality, it is not operated that way. It – like almost everything in our society – is operated as a profit-extraction machine in the service of a small group of people.
This machine started off performing the above functions (of course, already distorted by its origins as a technology for the military and academia).
Soon, an industry of for-profit companies sprung up around developing the internet. Many of these companies became large enough to have a decisive influence on what the web would be.</p>
<p>As the years went by, the parts of it that did not contribute much to profit generation (like weird personal websites) were scrapped under the influence of these companies,
and new pieces which enhanced profit generation were added. It happened this way because there is enormous pressure from management and investors to focus on profit-generation
to the exclusion of all else.</p>
<p>Of course, because these modifications were made primarily in pursuit of profit with other reasons being secondary, this resulted in a bunch of unintended (or un-“cared about”) negative consequences like</p>
<ul>
<li>creepy data-collection and surveillance which is used to manipulate us into buying things</li>
<li>right-wing radicalization which has resulted in widespread political violence</li>
<li>distribution of misinformation</li>
<li>an enormous carbon footprint</li>
<li>collective billions in wasted minutes spent scrolling because we were tricked by the algorithm to stay on just a bit longer</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things are natural results of a system that cannot “see” the concept of social good and can only see profits.
These problems just do not matter to the system, and only could in the event that they interfered with profit-generation.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-push-back">How to push back</h2>
<p>Let’s say you are a worker at a crypto company who sees this history and want to make sure that in crypto, socially useful aspects of
the technology are prioritized rather than those that make the most profit. What should you do?</p>
<p>First, I think it is necessary to deal with the most popular response, which is a utopian faith that the decentralized
nature of some crypto technology will inherently stop bad things from happening.</p>
<h3 id="crypto-utopianism">Crypto-utopianism</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of utopianism in crypto. This ranges from the lowest Bitcoin-booster all the way up to people like Vitalik.</p>
<p>This quote is somewhat <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/this-political-conversation-with-vitalik-buterin-shows-how-ethereum-could-change-the-world">examplary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These three white men talked about the protests erupting across the United States. To his credit, the Russian-Canadian Buterin spoke broadly instead of attempting to comment on inequality in American politics. He said the current generation is facing a global “crisis of legitimacy,” concerning both corporations and “many types of governments.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The challenge here is can we create systems that allow some groups of people to cooperate without that downside of a centralized or trusted actor having to be in the middle,” Buterin said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crypto-utopianism usually includes a suggestion that crypto will replace existing systems (which are bad because they’re “centralized” or some other vague reason) and be better because they are “decentralized” (whatever that might mean).</p>
<p>These analyses give crypto projects a sense of grandeur and importance which is motivating to developers and investors alike. Unfortunately, if your goal is to push back against the existing profit-maximizing power structures, you need to have a better analysis than “centralized bad, decentralized good”. It sounds good, but it doesn’t actually constitute a plan to defeat the Facebooks of the world or even to resist pressure from investors.</p>
<p>The crypto-utopian prescription for all that ails the web is some new technology.
Technology is great and a necessary part of the puzzle, but unless Glenn Weyl has a way of forcing Facebook to use quadratic voting for corporate governance, it’s not useful yet.
<strong>The existing power structure can always pick-and-choose the new technology that best advances its goals.</strong>
If you have goals which are distinct from theirs, you need to build power that is capable of a serious challenge.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-power-do-they-have">What kind of power do they have?</h3>
<p>What kind of power does the existing “power structure” consisting of senior management and capitalists have?
It has</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20983053/google-fires-four-employees-memo-rebecca-rivers-laurence-berland-union-busting-accusation-walkout">the ability to fire people</a> that won’t comply with its goals</li>
<li>the ability to withhold funding from companies that won’t comply with its goals (this is kind of another version of the previous)</li>
<li><a href="https://parametricity.com/posts/2020-power/news.ycombinator.com">public platforms</a> to spread <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">messaging that argues in favor of its goals</a></li>
<li>control of platforms which allows them to <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/on-facebook-banning-anarchist-and-antifascist-pages-the-digital-censorship-to-come/">censor unfavorable currents in the culture at large</a></li>
<li>endless legal resources to neutralize those that won’t comply with its goals</li>
<li>in some cases, relationships with law enforcement that can be used against those that won’t comply with its goals
and surely much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Profit-maximization is the “prime directive” of the existing power structure and as a result challenging it inevitably provokes a fight.
This fight is usually waged (on their end) by making use of all the above tools and more.</p>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-power-do-you-have">What kind of power do you have?</h3>
<p>What kind of power do you, a worker at a crypto company, have to resist all of the above? On your own, basically none. If you
make too much trouble, you will simply be fired and then you’re out of luck. Some small number of people can try starting a company (which I have done)
but you’re still subject to some of the same kinds of retaliation as funding can be withheld, which either “fires” the company or redirects
it toward whatever profit-maximization opportunity is available. And even if you have an independent revenue stream, you will be competing
against firms that are willing to do whatever it takes to maximize profits.</p>
<p>As a group however, workers have an enormous amount of power. It is sometimes considered controversial to say so, but VCs and senior
management cannot actually do anything without workers. As such, if workers organize together into a strong company or industry-wide union,
they can make demands of the existing power structure and refuse to participate in the production process (i.e., strike) if those demands are not met.
This power can be augmented with legal resources, platforms of their own, etc.</p>
<p>If you are interested in building power with your fellow workers to advance your own goals rather than those of the profit-maximizers,
both within your company and across your industry, I recommend reaching out to <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a>
who can provide further guidance. You can also get in touch with or <a href="https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership2020">join your local DSA</a> to
build your analysis, help push more broadly for a world beyond profit maximization, and get support.</p>

September 30, 2020 | https://without.boats/blog/revisiting-a-smaller-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://without.boats/blog/revisiting-a-smaller-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>A bit over a year ago, I wrote some <a href="https://without.boats/blog/notes-on-a-smaller-rust">notes on a “smaller Rust”</a> - a higher level language
that would take inspiration from some of Rust’s type system innovations, but would be simpler by
virtue of targeting a domain with less stringent requirements for user control and performance.
During my time of unemployment this year, I worked on sketching out what a language like that would
look like in a bit more detail. I wanted to write a bit about what new conclusions I’ve come to
during that time.</p>
<h2 id="the-purpose-for-our-language">The purpose for our language</h2>
<p>Re-reading my previous post, I’m struck by how vague my statement of purpose for this language is.
My entire blog post is really focused on differentiating the language from <em>Rust</em>, and I frame the
discussion in terms of what I would remove from Rust, and how the language would not support certain
use cases of Rust. This isn’t really surprising: I was working on Rust, and I never had taken the
time to think of this hypothetical language in itself the way I have now.</p>
<p>The goal of this design was to create a language that could compete as an “application programming
language.” The design goals of this language were:</p>
<ol>
<li>It should try not to be notably hard to learn. To the extent possible, it should be familiar to
most programmers. Since I’m comitting by the exercise to trying to apply ownership and borrowing
to the application domain, it will necessarily contain some features most programmers find
pretty novel (like Rust “lifetimes”). But in general, we will try to reduce the onboarding ramp
and simplify things.</li>
<li>It should typecheck and compile quickly. It should not have bad batch compilation performance,
and it should be designed with incremental recompilation in mind, to enable a good experience for
users who integrate their compiler into their development environment (with a full IDE or even
just with a plugin for a text editor). I didn’t even mention this concern in the previous post.
As others have discussed elsewhere; Rust’s poor compile times are not the result of its advanced
type system, but of a combination of other factors. Some are essential, like the runtime
guarantees it makes (e.g. monomorphization) whereas others are accidental, like some aspects of
its module system. None of these factors would be essential for our language, so we would
carefully avoid these pitfalls.</li>
<li>It should have a runtime which suits it well to the major use cases for application programming
languages today. This means mainly being well suited to the developing for the web, both
front-end and back-end. (Being well-suited to the mobile platforms is unrealistic for a language
not sponsored by those platform developers, unfortunately.) Being well-suited to CLIs would also
be beneficial.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to focus the rest of this post on my thoughts for evolving Rust’s ownership and borrowing
system, but before I do that I want to briefly touch on other design decisions that fell out of this
thought process:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would target WASM, and only WASM, for this language. WASM with reference types is suitable as
an environment for application programming (with shims for future extensions like properly
integrated garbage collection). This way the language designers can piggy back on the work being
done at many companies to establish WASM as a good shared VM platform, instead of being
responsible for things like platform compatibility or using the very slow LLVM. Targeting WASM
would also mean easier FFI integration into other languages that run on the same VM as WASM; that
is, other languages targeting WASM (like Rust) and JavaScript.</li>
<li>I would explore control-flow-capturing closures as a core language abstraction, similar to Kotlin.
As I wrote in <a href="https://without.boats/blog/the-problem-of-effects">an earlier blog post</a> inspired by the design on this hypothetical
language, I think these are a great way to integrate effects well with higher order function
abstractions.</li>
<li>I would provide syntactic sugar for <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> as the way to handle null and errors,
similar to Swift.</li>
<li>As I wrote in a previous blog post, I would provide green threads as the sole concurrency model,
with language or standard library provided channels and cells (discussed later) as the way of
sharing data between threads. How these green threads are mapped to CPUs is a matter for the
runtime you choose to run the compiled WASM in.</li>
<li>I didn’t get to the point of designing a polymorphism system; I would probably start with a
strenuous comparison of Rust’s traits and Go’s interfaces, and (knowing the other features of the
language) try to figure out what from Rust’s traits is unimportant.</li>
<li>I would be hope the language could avoid macros, which (in the case of pattern based macros) add a
second meta language to the language that advanced users need to understand, and in all cases
substantially complicate compilation.</li>
</ul>

<p>But now onto the meat of this post: the ownership and borrowing model. In my previous post I made
some points that I largely agree with still, but would probably reframe. Here’s what I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust works because it enables users to write in an imperative programming style, which is the
mainstream style of programming that most users are familiar with, while avoiding to an impressive
degree the kinds of bugs that imperative programming is notorious for. As I said once, pure
functional programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but Rust is an
even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Resource acquisition is initialization:</strong> Objects should manage conceptual resources like file
descriptors and sockets, and have destructors which clean up resource state when the object goes
out of scope. It should be trivial to be confident the destructor will run when the object goes
out of scope. This necesitates most of ownership, moving, and borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>Aliasable XOR mutable:</strong> The default should be that values can be mutated only if they are not
aliased, and there should be no way to introduce unsynchronized aliased mutation. However, the
language should support mutating values. The only way to get this is the rest of ownership and
borrowing, the distinction between borrows and mutable borrows and the aliasing rules between
them.</p>
<p>In other words, the core, commonly identified “hard part” of Rust - ownership and borrowing - is
essentially applicable for any attempt to make checking the correctness of an imperative program
tractable. So trying to get rid of it would be missing the real insight of Rust, and not building
on the foundations Rust has laid out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still think this is Rust’s “secret sauce” and it does mean what I said: the language would have to
have ownership and borrowing. But what I’ve realized since is that there’s a very important
distinction between the cases in which users <em>want</em> these semantics and the cases where they largely
get in the way. This distinction is between types which represent <em>resources</em> and types which
represent <em>data</em>.</p>
<p>In this mental model, resources are types which represent “a thing” - something with an identity and
a state which can change with time as the program executes. In Rust, almost everything is a
resource: a String is a resource a HashMap is a resource, most user types are resources. In
contrast, data types are just “information” - a fact, which has no meaningful identity, contains no
state that evolves over time, etc. In Rust, types like integers, <code>&amp;str</code>, and so on - which all
implement <code>Copy</code> - are data types. (However, a mutable reference to those types is a resource: more
on this later.)</p>
<p>In Rust, only types which can be cloned by a mempcy can implement <code>Copy</code>. This is because Rust is
designed to encourage treating all heap memory as a <em>resource</em>, the management of which the end
user can control by selecting when the type representing that memory is dropped. This is very
valuable in the domains which Rust is intended to target. However, for higher level applications
that most programmers write, control over heap memory is not <em>usually</em> important. This is what users
mean when they want to “turn off the borrow checker” - they want to let a garbage collector figure
it out for them when this bit of data is freed, because to them it is “just data” and not a
resource.</p>
<p>This hypothetical language would lean into that distinction. Using persistent data structures (like
those from Clojure) and garbage collection, the set of types which could be treated as data types
would not be restricted in this language. The string type would be a data type, rather than
a resource; a dynamically sized array of data types would be a data type as well, as would a map
with keys and values that are data types.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, types representing IO objects would always be resource types. Collections containing
resource types would also be resource types. Composite types (like structs and enums) which contain
a resource type would also have to be a resource type. There would be an easy way to convert data
types to fully owned resource types as well; in the case of persistent data structures, converting
a data type to a resource type would be the point at which the “copy on write” operation occurs.
As a result users can use ownership semantics for things which impact global and external state
(like IO) and for cases where they know it will be an important performance optimization.</p>
<p>And the difference in how the language treats data and resources would be identical to the
difference between how Rust treats Copy and non-Copy types. Only resources would have affine
“ownership” semantics - in which moving them invalidates the previous binding. Data types would have
the standard non-linear semantics users are familiar with from most languages. This means that
writing algorithms using data types would be functionally the same as writing algorithms in other
imperative languages, easing the onboarding of users to the language and limiting their errors
related to linear types to areas where they are certain to care.</p>

<p>When you think about cost in the DevOps world, the first thing that will come to mind is your AWS bill, or maybe that Datadog subscription. However, the cost is not always as straightforward as receiving an invoice, and in the DevOps world, the hidden cost is about doing it wrong.</p>

<p>I believe that being aware of hidden costs is a “mental model” you can use when making decisions. Without taking it to account, you are making bets with only half of the information.</p>

<p>Hidden cost takes on many forms in DevOps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Idle developers are waiting for builds to finish.</li>
<li>Over architected Jira workflows that take forever to go through - Jireaucracy (not my term).</li>
<li>Automating things that don’t need to scale - we are all lazy engineers who would rather spend a full day scripting something than doing 5 minutes of manual work.</li>
<li>Trying to save cost where there is no real benefit.</li>
<li>Higher Churn Rate.</li>
<li>Technical debt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s try to take a close look at some of these examples.</p>

<h3 id="not-accounting-for-the-human-element">Not accounting for the human element</h3>

<p>In these complicated days, companies are franticly working to reduce their cloud costs. However, there’s a trap that you need to be mindful of when going through such a process.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this oversimplified equation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>$100</strong> <em>(hourly cost of a developer)</em> <strong>x</strong> <strong>10</strong> <em>(developers)</em> <strong>x</strong> <strong>2</strong> <em>(idle hours a day)</em> <strong>x</strong> <strong>21</strong> <em>(work days in a month)</em> <strong>=</strong> <strong>$42,000</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If, on average, a developer at a company waits on builds or deployment for two hours per day and there are 10 developers on the team, that’s <strong>$2,000/</strong> per day going down the drain. Multiply by 21 workdays per month, and you get <strong>$42,000</strong> of wasted developer time.</p>

<p>Now, suppose that you can cut the idle time by half by adding two new build workers, where each one costs $3000/month. Is it worth it?
It seems trivial when you present it this way but harder to consider when cutting costs across the board.</p>

<p>The problem is that employees are a “fixed cost”, a different budget, and you don’t think of them in the context of wasted resources.</p>

<p>Now think about that developer idling for two hours a day. An idle engineer is a bored engineer, which leads me to the next point -  chasing away competent engineers, or making it more challenging to attract new ones.</p>

<p>You spend significant resources to keep your top engineers, but then they will be the first to jump ship when work is just not fun.</p>

<p>Team leaders spend much of their time in the recruiting process when the company is growing. Time that could be used for onboarding new employees, or mentoring the team, or doing actual development work.</p>

<p>If it takes weeks for engineers to see their work in production or they spend their time chasing the DevOps team to get a simple thing running, they will not stay for long. And worse, you will start getting a bad reputation, resulting in fewer hiring options.</p>

<p>Add burnout to the mix, and now your top developers are producing less, which trickles down to more jr. engineers. You are now stuck with a disgruntled team and no new hires on the horizon.</p>

<h3 id="trying-to-automate-and-scale-at-all-cost">Trying to automate and scale at all cost</h3>

<p>Here is another example that I see all the time - A belief that everything has to be automated and scalable.</p>

<p>“Write this script to automate task XYZ, and don’t forget to document everything and make sure it’s IaC and write a confluence page and…”
But do you really need to automate it? How much time does this task take, and how many times are you planning to perform it?</p>

<p>If it’s an annoying task that takes an hour to perform, and you expect to repeat it three times in the future, does it justify a full week of an engineer to automate?</p>

<p>What about a deployment that is pretty much a one-off? Do you really need to automate it fully? Is it worth your time? Isn’t there something else that is more meaningful for you to do?</p>

<p>I mean, yes, we have standards and workflows and beliefs, but we don’t have to follow them blindly when it doesn’t make sense.</p>

<h3 id="technical-debt">Technical Debt</h3>

<p>Managers who brush off the importance of technical debt are a bit like people who never back up their system. They never saw how technical debt could cripple a company.</p>

<p>If you don’t account for the effects of technical debt, it’s hard to see the cost, but by looking closely, you will soon see how much it affects your velocity, churn, and pretty much every aspect of the value you deliver:</p>

<ol>
<li>It slows down your developers.</li>
<li>Each feature takes twice as much time to complete.</li>
<li>The system keeps crashing.</li>
<li>It burns out your team members.</li>
<li>It makes some business decisions impossible.</li>
</ol>

<p>Think about credit card debt. At one point, the interest rates will make you go bankrupt.
Yes, fixing some of the issues takes time and resources, but can you afford to continue rolling the snowball?</p>

<h2 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity cost</h2>

<p>In a previous example, I referred to the cost “as is,” using the developer’s direct hourly cost.  But unless you are a service business, a developer hour is worth much more than the cost.</p>

<p>This is why software companies are worth so much - The Developer’s time is a force multiplier. Developers are adding value to the company that is much higher than their yearly cost. The value they add takes the the form of IP and products that you can sell over and over without scaling inventory and distribution.</p>

<p>If we go back to the previous example, if you instead have the developers work on a new product or initiative with those hours, it’s not $42k per month that you are losing, but giving up a much higher future revenue.</p>

<p>And of course, opportunity cost can take on other forms that may not be as intuitive:</p>

<h3 id="milestone-investing">Milestone Investing</h3>

<p>Suppose that you are an early startup that has raised capital with set milestones (<a href="https://avc.com/2009/08/milestone-based-investing/">Milestone Investing</a>). By hitting the next milestone, you will increase your valuation and get a hefty cash infusion.
Now imagine your runway running out, and you have yet to meet the milestone.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great if you had more time to reach your goals?</p>

<p>Suppose that your developers worked much more efficiently. Instead of idling for two hours, automating and simplifying your developers’ workflow added an hour a day of “working in the zone” for each developer.</p>

<p>How much more could you accomplish by having three more hours a day per developer?</p>

<p>Could you meet that arbitrary board goal with an impossible deadline they set for you?</p>

<p>Is it going to help you meet the milestone the investors set for receiving the next cash infusion?</p>

<p>That’s where we, the DevOps engineers (or whatever you call this function at your company), can help move the needle. We can facilitate growth and improve the productivity of our engineering teams.
It’s not just about throwing new technology at the solution and implementing the latest fad.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-can-we-produce-value-as-devops-engineers">So how can we produce Value as DevOps engineers?</h2>

<p>DevOps has always been tied to business value, but it’s rare to see this idea fully implemented in corporate culture.
Even when it does, it’s usually wrapped around a vague user story with a soggy and generic statement that doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“This feature will increase user happiness and deliver more value by making the top navigation bar a bit more blueish.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way to create value is by addressing the cost - by reversing it, we can generate value. All you need is to look at it from a different perspective.</p>

<p>I mentioned Churn before as a metric that the business is actively working to reduce, but for engineers, it’s just “downtime.” Engineers are seldomly exposed to the idea that lowering Churn increases customer lifetime value and affects customer acquisition cost.</p>

<p>So put your DevOps cap on for a minute. Can you think of ways to reduce the churn rate?</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce downtime.</li>
<li>Reduce latency and load speed.</li>
<li>Optimize report generation time.</li>
<li>Increase email deliverability.</li>
<li>Enable toggle features to allow your product team to test their new features on users.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on, and it’s just for reducing Churn.
And yes, these are obvious priorities for operations, but now you have a clear business value tied to it.</p>

<p>Almost every hidden cost I mentioned earlier could turn into a value proposition for a DevOps related project.</p>

<h2 id="make-sure-you-have-all-the-data">Make sure you have all the data</h2>

<p>All of this “Cost” and “Value” talk is almost meaningless or non-actionable if you don’t have metrics in place.</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to have a cloud provider cost breakdown to know how much you’re spending on a project or a server.</li>
<li>Build time statistics.</li>
<li>Build and deployment success rate over time.<br></li>
<li>How long it takes to onboard a new developer to the team.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need the metrics for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Visibility - You need to be aware of the cost in the first place.</li>
<li>When making a decision, you have to have a benchmark.</li>
<li>To see the impact of your actions when working to reduce the cost.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can’t make informed decisions without having all the data; otherwise, it’s just guessing.</p>



<p>Ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do we really need to scale this?</li>
<li>How much time will it take to reduce a cost? What can your developers do instead?</li>
<li>How can you improve the development workflow? How much time can you save?</li>
<li>Do we have a culture that allows open discussion? Do engineers have a voice when it comes to new projects and features?</li>
<li>How can we share knowledge across the organization, so engineers are aware of the product, sales, and marketing struggles?</li>
</ol>

<p>This chapter will give an overview of <code>ruby</code> syntax for command line usage and some examples to show what kind of problems are typically suited for one-liners.</p>
<h2><a href="#why-use-ruby-for-one-liners" id="why-use-ruby-for-one-liners">Why use Ruby for one-liners?</a></h2>
<p>I assume you are already familiar with use cases where command line is more productive compared to GUI. See also this series of articles titled <a href="https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/">Unix as IDE</a>.</p>
<p>A shell utility like <code>bash</code> provides built-in commands and scripting features to make it easier to solve and automate various tasks. External *nix commands like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>parallel</code> etc can be combined to work with each other. Depending upon your familiarity with those tools, you can either use <code>ruby</code> as a single replacement or complement them for specific use cases.</p>
<p>Here's some one-liners (options will be explained later):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ruby -e 'puts readlines.uniq' *.txt</code> — retain only one copy if lines are duplicated from the given list of input file(s)</li>
<li><code>ruby -e 'puts readlines.uniq {|s| s.split[1]}' *.txt</code> — retain only first copy of duplicate lines using second field as duplicate criteria</li>
<li><code>ruby -rcommonregex -ne 'puts CommonRegex.get_links($_)' *.md</code> — extract only the URLs, using a third-party <a href="https://github.com/talyssonoc/CommonRegexRuby">CommonRegexRuby</a> library</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63954081/bash-remove-duplicate-of-key-values-with-preserving-order">stackoverflow: merge duplicate key values while preserving order</a> — a recent Q&amp;A that I answered with a simpler <code>ruby</code> solution compared to <code>awk</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The main advantage of <code>ruby</code> over tools like <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> includes feature rich regular expression engine, standard library and third-party libraries. If you don't already know the syntax and idioms for <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>, learning command line options for <code>ruby</code> would be the easier option. The main disadvantage is that <code>ruby</code> is likely to be slower compared to those tools.</p>
<h2><a href="#command-line-options" id="command-line-options">Command line options</a></h2>

</tbody></table>
<p>This chapter will show examples with <code>-e</code>, <code>-n</code>, <code>-p</code> and <code>-a</code> options. Some more options will be covered in later chapters, but not all of them are discussed in this book.</p>
<h2><a href="#executing-ruby-code" id="executing-ruby-code">Executing Ruby code</a></h2>
<p>If you want to execute a <code>ruby</code> program file, one way is to pass the filename as argument to the <code>ruby</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>$ echo 'puts "Hello Ruby"' &gt; hello.rb
$ ruby hello.rb
Hello Ruby
</code></pre>
<p>For short programs, you can also directly pass the code as an argument to the <code>-e</code> option.</p>
<pre><code>$ ruby -e 'puts "Hello Ruby"'
Hello Ruby

$ # multiple statements can be issued separated by ;
$ ruby -e 'x=25; y=12; puts x**y'
59604644775390625
$ # or use -e option multiple times
$ ruby -e 'x=25' -e 'y=12' -e 'puts x**y'
59604644775390625
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#filtering" id="filtering">Filtering</a></h2>
<p><code>ruby</code> one-liners can be used for filtering lines matched by a regexp, similar to <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>. And similar to many command line utilities, <code>ruby</code> can accept input from both <code>stdin</code> and file arguments.</p>
<pre><code>$ # sample stdin data
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n'
gate
apple
what
kite

$ # print all lines containing 'at'
$ # same as: grep 'at' and sed -n '/at/p' and awk '/at/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | ruby -ne 'print if /at/'
gate
what

$ # print all lines NOT containing 'e'
$ # same as: grep -v 'e' and sed -n '/e/!p' and awk '!/e/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | ruby -ne 'print if !/e/'
what
</code></pre>
<p>By default, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> will automatically loop over input content line by line (with <code>\n</code> as the line distinguishing character). The <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code> option will enable this feature for <code>ruby</code>. As seen before, the <code>-e</code> option accepts code as command line argument. Many shortcuts are available to reduce the amount of typing needed.</p>
<p>In the above examples, a regular expression (defined by the pattern between a pair of forward slashes) has been used to filter the input. When the input string isn't specified in a conditional context (for example: <code>if</code>), the test is performed against global variable <code>$_</code>, which has the contents of the input line (the correct term would be input <strong>record</strong>, see <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_ruby_oneliners/record-separators.html#record-separators">Record separators</a> chapter). To summarize, in a conditional context:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/regexp/</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ =~ /regexp/</code></li>
<li><code>!/regexp/</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ !~ /regexp/</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>$_</code> is also the default argument for <code>print</code> method, which is why it is generally preferred in one-liners over <code>puts</code> method. More such defaults that apply to the <code>print</code> method will be discussed later.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here's an example with file input instead of <code>stdin</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat table.txt
brown bread mat hair 42
blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14

$ # same as: grep -oE '[0-9]+$' table.txt
$ ruby -ne 'puts $&amp; if /\d+$/' table.txt

</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#substitution" id="substitution">Substitution</a></h2>
<p>Use <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code> methods for search and replace requirements. By default, these methods operate on <code>$_</code> when the input string isn't provided. For these examples, <code>-p</code> option is used instead of <code>-n</code> option, so that the value of <code>$_</code> is automatically printed after processing each input line.</p>
<pre><code>$ # for each input line, change only first ':' to '-'
$ # same as: sed 's/:/-/' and awk '{sub(/:/, "-")} 1'
$ printf '1:2:3:4\na:b:c:d\n' | ruby -pe 'sub(/:/, "-")'
1-2:3:4
a-b:c:d

$ # for each input line, change all ':' to '-'
$ # same as: sed 's/:/-/g' and awk '{gsub(/:/, "-")} 1'
$ printf '1:2:3:4\na:b:c:d\n' | ruby -pe 'gsub(/:/, "-")'
1-2-3-4
a-b-c-d
</code></pre>
<p>You might wonder how <code>$_</code> is modified without the use of <code>!</code> methods. The reason is that these methods are part of Kernel (see <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Kernel.html">ruby-doc: Kernel</a> for details) and are available only when <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code> options are used.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sub(/regexp/, repl)</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_.sub(/regexp/, repl)</code> and <code>$_</code> will be updated if substitution succeeds</li>
<li><code>gsub(/regexp/, repl)</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_.gsub(/regexp/, repl)</code> and <code>$_</code> gets updated if substitution succeeds</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#field-processing" id="field-processing">Field processing</a></h2>
<p>Consider the sample input file shown below with fields separated by a single space character.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat table.txt
brown bread mat hair 42
blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14
</code></pre>
<p>Here's some examples that is based on specific field rather than the entire line. The <code>-a</code> option will cause the input line to be split based on whitespaces and the field contents can be accessed using <code>$F</code> global variable. Leading and trailing whitespaces will be suppressed and won't result in empty fields. More details is discussed in <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_ruby_oneliners/field-separators.html#default-field-separation">Default field separation</a> section.</p>
<pre><code>$ # print the second field of each input line
$ # same as: awk '{print $2}' table.txt
$ ruby -ane 'puts $F[1]' table.txt
bread
cake
banana

$ # print lines only if last field is a negative number
$ # same as: awk '$NF&lt;0' table.txt
$ ruby -ane 'print if $F[-1].to_f &lt; 0' table.txt
blue cake mug shirt -7

$ # change 'b' to 'B' only for the first field
$ # same as: awk '{gsub(/b/, "B", $1)} 1' table.txt
$ ruby -ane '$F[0].gsub!(/b/, "B"); puts $F * " "' table.txt
Brown bread mat hair 42
Blue cake mug shirt -7
yellow banana window shoes 3.14
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#begin-and-end" id="begin-and-end">BEGIN and END</a></h2>
<p>You can use a <code>BEGIN{}</code> block when you need to execute something before input is read and a <code>END{}</code> block to execute something after all of the input has been processed.</p>
<pre><code>$ # same as: awk 'BEGIN{print "---"} 1; END{print "%%%"}'
$ # note the use of ; after BEGIN block
$ seq 4 | ruby -pe 'BEGIN{puts "---"}; END{puts "%%%"}'
---

</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#env-hash" id="env-hash">ENV hash</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to automation and scripting, you'd often need to construct commands that can accept input from user, file, output of a shell command, etc. As mentioned before, this book assumes <code>bash</code> as the shell being used. To access environment variables of the shell, you can call the special hash variable <code>ENV</code> with the name of the environment variable as a string key.</p>
<pre><code>$ # existing environment variable
$ # output shown here is for my machine, would differ for you
$ ruby -e 'puts ENV["HOME"]'
/home/learnbyexample
$ ruby -e 'puts ENV["SHELL"]'
/bin/bash

$ # defined along with ruby command
$ # note that the variable is placed before the shell command
$ word='hello' ruby -e 'puts ENV["word"]'
hello
$ # the input characters are preserved as is
$ ip='hi\nbye' ruby -e 'puts ENV["ip"]'
hi\nbye
</code></pre>
<p>Here's another example when a regexp is passed as an environment variable content.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat word_anchors.txt
sub par
spar
apparent effort
two spare computers
cart part tart mart

$ # assume 'r' is a shell variable that has to be passed to the ruby command
$ r='\Bpar\B'

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> is famously unintuitive. This post starts with an extreme version where the solution is blindingly obvious. We then go through a series of small changes. It will be clear that these don’t affect the solution. At the end, we arrive at the classic Monte Hall problem.</p>

<p>For reference, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">classic formulation</a> goes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intuitively, many people guess it doesn’t matter if you switch. But it does. You get the car 2/3 of the time if you switch, and 1/3 of the time if you don’t. Why?</p>



<p>Here’s our first game.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind all of the other 9 doors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game1.png">
</p>

<p>There’s nothing mysterious here. You should choose option B. There’s only a 10% chance you picked the right door, so there’s a 90% chance the car is behind one of the others.</p>



<p>Now, we slightly update the game (new part in bold).</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li><strong>Monty says “Hey! I promise you that there is a goat behind at least 8 of the other 9 doors!”</strong></li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind all of the other 9 doors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game2.png">
</p>

<p>Monty’s statement changes nothing. You don’t need to rely on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall#/media/File:Monty_hall_abc_tv.JPG">trustworthy looks</a>. You already <em>knew</em> there were at least 8 goats! Option B still gets you the car 90% of the time.</p>



<p>Let’s update the game again (new part in bold).</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li><strong>Monty looks behind the other 9 doors. He chooses 8 with goats behind them, and opens them.</strong></li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind all of the other 9 doors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game3.png">
</p>

<p>The key insight is this: When Monty shows you that 8 of the 9 other doors contain goats, you haven’t learned anything relevant to your decision. You <em>already knew there were at least 8 goats behind the other doors</em>! So this is just like game 2. Option B still gets you the car 90% of the time.</p>

<p>Want more intuition? Suppose you picked door 3. Imagne Monty walking past the doors, opening doors 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, <strong>skipping 7</strong>, then opening 8, 9, and 10. Doesn’t door 7 seem special?</p>



<p>Let’s make another change. Finally, we arrive at a game very similar to Monty Hall.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li>Monty looks behind the other 9 doors. He chooses 8 of them with goats behind them, and opens them.</li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind <strong>the other closed door</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game4.png">
</p>

<p>The only difference with Game 3 is that option B doesn’t get you the 8 visible goats. Since you don’t care about goats, this makes no difference. This is still just like the game 3. You get the car 90% of the time by switching.</p>



<p>Here is the last game. We just change the number of doors from 10 to 3.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are <strong>3</strong> doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other <strong>2</strong>.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li>Monty looks behind the other <strong>2</strong> doors. He chooses one <strong>1</strong> of them with a goat behind it, and opens it.**</li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind the other closed door.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game5.png">
</p>

<p>Of course, you still want to choose option B. The chance of success is now 2/3 instead of 9/10. This game is exactly Monty Hall, so we’re done.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s important that Monty looked behind the doors before choosing which to open. This is where people’s intuition usually fails. If he had chosen a door at random — <em>in a way that he risked possibly exposing a car</em>, then the situation would be different. (In that case, there’s no advantage or harm in switching.) But he doesn’t choose the door at random. He deliberately chooses to show you goats. Since this is always possible, it tells you nothing. I think this is the crux of what makes this problem unintuitive. Many people intuitively think it doen’t matter if you switch. And that <em>would be correct</em> if the door had been opened at random!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be helpful to draw a diagram of the relationship of the different games, starting with classic Monty Hall and ending with the extreme version.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Game 5 (Classic Monty Hall)<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (Use 10 doors instead of 3)<br>
 ↓ <br>
Game 4<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (If you switch, get the contents of <em>all</em> other doors, not just the other closed door.)<br>
 ↓<br>
Game 3<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (Monty promises 8 goats behind the other doors instead of showing you.)<br>
 ↓<br>
Game 2<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (Monty doesn’t bother promsising.)<br>
 ↓<br>
Game 1 (Dyno Might© Monty Hall)</p>

  <li>
    <p>Monty Hall was actually named “Monte” at birth! Given that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo simulations</a> are often used for exploring the Monty Hall problem, that’s either a tragedy for puns or a miracle for confused students.</p>

<p>Of all the allures of startup culture, few are more desireable than the speed and nimbleness of a small team. Maintaining that feeling as a company grows is a challenge. In 2012, Spotify shared its way of working and suggested it had figured it out.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I was excited to see <em>the Spotify model</em> in action when I interviewed for a product management role at its Stockholm headquarters in 2017. However, the recruiter surprised me before the first interview. She cautioned me to not expect Spotify to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> utopia.</p>
<p>I joined the company after it had tripled in size to 3,000 people over 18 months. I learned the famed squad model was only ever aspirational and never fully implemented. I witnessed organizational chaos as the company’s leaders incrementally transitioned to more traditional management structures.</p>
<p>When I asked my coworkers why the content was not removed or updated to reflect reality, I never got a good answer. Many people ironically thought the posts were great for recruiting. I no longer work at Spotify, so I am sharing my experience to set the record straight. The Spotify squad model failed Spotify and it will fail your company too.</p>

<h3>But you don’t have to take my word for it.</h3>
<p>The co-author of the Spotify model<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> and multiple agile coaches who worked at Spotify have been telling people to not copy it for years. Unfortunately, truth doesn’t spread as quickly or as widely as an idea people want to believe in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even at the time we wrote it, we weren’t doing it. It was part ambition, part approximation. People have really struggled to copy something that didn’t really exist.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—Joakim Sundén, agile coach at Spotify&nbsp;2011–2017<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It worries me when people look at what we do and think it’s a framework they can just copy and implement.</em> … We are really trying hard now to emphasize we have problems as well. It’s not all ‘shiny and everything works well and all our squads are super amazing’.”</p>

<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>You can read and watch the <a href="#1">original content</a> in less than 30 minutes or <a href="#spread-4">skip to the next section</a> if you are familiar. Here is a brief summary.</p>
<p>Spotify had teams it called <em>squads</em> because it sounded cooler (not joking). A group of teams were organized into a department called a <em>tribe</em>. Each team was intended to be an autonomous mini-startup, with a product manager acting as mini-CEO for a feature area. The teams had designers and software engineers with a range of specializations. The intent was that a team should have every skill necessary without needing to rely on another team for success.</p>
<p>Product managers had a traditional management structure. A product manager for a team reported to their department’s product director (<em>“tribe lead”</em>). Same for designers. Software engineers, however, were managed outside of the team structure.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<div>
<p><em>“Chapter leads”</em> managed software engineers specializing in a specific type of software development across the department. For example, all of the software engineers working on backend APIs across all the teams within the department would have one manager and all of the Android mobile engineers in the department would have a different manager. The intent was to allow engineers to be moved between teams within the department to best meet business requirements without them having to change managers.</p>

<h3>Matrix management solved the wrong problem</h3>
<p>The “full stack” agile team worked well, but the matrix management of software engineers introduced more problems than it solved.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teams at Spotify were rather long-lived. The benefit of not having to change manager when moving to another team was limited.</p></li>
<li><p>Engineering managers in this model had little responsibility beyond the career development of the people they managed. Even then, their ability to help with interpersonal people skills development was limited. An engineering manager would not manage enough of the other people on the team or be involved enough in the daily context to independently assess conflict within the team.</p></li>

<li><p>Without a single engineering manager responsible for the engineers on a team, the product manager lacked an equivalent peer—the mini-CTO to their mini-CEO role. There was no single person accountable for the engineering team’s delivery or who could negotiate prioritization of work at an equivalent level of responsibility.</p><p>When disagreements within the engineering team arose, the product manager needed to negotiate with all of the engineers on the team. If the engineers could not reach a consensus, the product manager needed to escalate to as many engineering managers as there were engineering specializations within the team. A team with backend, Web app, and mobile app engineers would have at least 3 engineering managers who might need to get involved. If those engineering managers could not reach a consensus, a single team’s issue would have to escalate to the department’s engineering director.</p></li>

<p>“Chapter leads are servant-leaders who help you grow as an individual. They don’t really work with any team. They have direct reports on all the teams.

<p><strong>Learn from Spotify’s mistakes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A product—design—engineering team typically contains more engineers than designers or product managers. Having a single engineering manager for the engineers on the team creates an accountable escalation path for conflict within the team.</li>
<li>Product managers should have an equivalent peer for engineering. Product managers should be accountable for the prioritization of work. Engineering managers should be accountable for the engineers’ execution, which includes being able to negotiate speed and quality tradeoffs with the product manager.</li>

<section id="too-much-autonomy">
<div>
<h3>Spotify fixated on team autonomy</h3>
<p>When a company is small, teams have to do a wide range of work to deliver and have to shift initiatives frequently. As a company grows from startup to scale-up, duplicated functions across teams move to new teams dedicated to increasing organization efficiency by reducing duplication. With more teams, the need for a team to shift initiative decreases in frequency. Both of these changes allow for teams to think more deeply and long term about the problems they are scoped to solve. Faster iteration, however, is not guaranteed. Every responsibility a team cedes to increase its focus becomes a new cross-team dependency.</p>
<p>Spotify did not define a common process for cross-team collaboration. Allowing every team to have a unique way of working meant each team needed a unique way of engagement when collaborating. Overall organization productivity suffered.</p>
<p>The Spotify model was documented when Spotify was a much smaller company. It was supposed to be a multiple part series, according to Anders Ivarsson. Autonomy made the first cut, but the parts on alignment and accountability were never completed.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Learn from Spotify’s mistakes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want.</li>
<li>Processes for cross-team collaboration must be defined. Autonomy does not mean leaving teams to self-organize every problem.</li>
<li>How success is measured must be defined by leadership so people can effectively negotiate cross-team dependency prioritization.</li>
<li>Autonomy requires accountability. Product management is accountable for value. The team is accountable for delivering ‘done’ increments. Mature teams can justify their independence with their ability to articulate business value, risk, learning, and the next optimal move.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup></li>

<h3>Collaboration was an assumed competency</h3>
<p>While Spotify gave teams control over their way of working, many people did not have a basic understanding of Agile practices. This resulted in teams iterating through process tweaks in blind hope of finding the combination that would help them improve their delivery. People lacked a common language to effectively discuss the process problems, the education to solve them, and the experience to evaluate performance. It was not really <em>agile</em>. It was just <em>not-waterfall</em>.</p>
<p><em>“Agile coaches”</em> were internal consultants Spotify provided teams to teach and suggest process improvements. While well-intentioned, there were not enough coaches to help every team. A coach’s engagement with a team was rarely long enough to span a project’s completion to help a team evaluate performance. More so, they were not accountable for anything.</p>

<p>Sure, it took me 6 days to amass 3,626 sales for a total of $101,528, but like any overnight success, it was years in the making. In my case, about 7 years.</p>

<p>In 2013, the jailbreaking days of iOS were in full effect. Inspired, I created and sold an icon set titled 'Greyish HD' on the Cydia store for $0.99. It was the first few dollars I ever made on the internet. I think I made a total of $17, and it was magical.</p>

<p>It wasn't about the $17, obviously; it was how I earned it. I spent time creating something that I thought was cool, then hit publish. After a few days, random strangers I've never met before decided to spend their hard-earned cents on my icon set, oftentimes while I was working on something else entirely. Without realizing it, I just discovered digital content leverage: <strong>create something once with sufficient effort, then sell it repeatedly with minimal effort.</strong></p>

<p>Fast forward 7 years later, minus 6 days. I saw some people sharing screenshots of their iPhones after discovering that iOS 14 now allows you to add custom icons to your home screen using the Siri Shortcuts app. This was the first time you can really customize iOS, and it was catching on. </p>

<p>This is something people have been doing for years on jailbroken iOS and Android devices, except this time, you can do it natively on iOS.</p>

<p>As soon as I noticed the hype, I put together some <a href="https://icons.tr.af/">icons</a> in my own style, downloaded some widgets, and tried it all out. I thought it looked cool, so I shared a screenshot of it on Twitter. Right away, people started asking about the icons in the screenshot. So I quickly packaged them, uploaded them to <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>, and embedded them on a <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a> site using <a href="https://super.so/">Super</a>. All of this took about two hours.</p>

<p>The next day, the tweet had hundreds of retweets, thousands of likes, and over 100k impressions. The day after that, almost a million. The next thing I knew, it was everywhere. My icons got published on notable tech sites like <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/723490/ios-14-iphone-home-screen-customization/">Cult of Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.imore.com/people-are-making-real-money-selling-icon-sets-ios-14-home-screens">iMore</a>, <a href="https://allthingst3ch.com/ios14homescreen">AllThingsTech</a>, and <a href="https://gridfiti.com/aesthetic-ios-home-screen-ideas">Gridfiti</a>. I think at this time I was around the $6k mark in sales.</p>

<p>Then, MKBHD happened. He shared a <a href="https://youtu.be/cH66LWWluVE">video</a> about all of this—using my icons for his setup, and linked them in the description. The next thing I knew, I was making $28 what felt like every 28 seconds. My phone turned into the ultimate dopamine dispenser (if it wasn't already). I had to disable notifications.</p>

<p>The day after, sales jumped from $6k to about $40k, and during the time of this writing, sales are at $116,147 from 4,188 customers.</p>

<p>All from one. Single. <a href="https://twitter.com/traf/status/1307707156788060160">Tweet</a>.</p>

<p>The right content, posted at the right time, can create unimaginable results. Although there's likely plenty of other variables that went into making this work, there are a few key insights that I think increased my odds.</p>

<h3>Publish often</h3>

<p>Continually putting things out into the world creates proof of work. The difference between where you are and where you want to be could be as little as sharing what you build, or even what you know.</p>

<p>There's only so much we can control once pushing something out into the world, but publishing often will increase your odds at finding something that sticks. They say that fortune favors the bold. In the internet age, the bold are those that aren't afraid to publish their work for the world to see. The internet is a never-ending stream of content, the idea of being annoying or over-sharing is only an idea that you invent to stop you from sharing. </p>

<h3>Act immediately</h3>

<p>I could have easily ignored the requests for the icons, or directed people to icon sets that already existed, but that would be a missed opportunity. Since I've done similar icon sets so many times already in the past, I was ready for it. Acting quickly is crucial if you plan on riding the wave. </p>

<h3>Be transparent</h3>

<p>I shared <a href="https://twitter.com/traf/status/1308158718975111175">this tweet</a> the day after posting my home screen with details of all the hype, and it created even more hype. It brought another 540,000 impressions and added fuel to an already growing fire. <strong>Share what works, and share what doesn't.</strong> Transparency is visibility.</p>

<h3>Have a clear schedule</h3>

<p>A lot of this was happening on a Monday morning. If I were working a more traditional job, or had time commitments that I had previously scheduled, I wouldn't have been able to act on my ideas as quickly as I did. I get that not everyone has the privilege of a flexible schedule, but almost anyone can start to move towards it if they want it badly enough. Freedom of a clear schedule allowed me to take action as soon as the inspiration hit, which was incredibly important to maximize exposure. Inspiration is a productivity-multiplier, but it's perishable—so act quickly.</p>

<h3>Charge more</h3>

<p>If I would have asked anyone what to price these at, most would have said $2, or maybe $5. One thing I knew for sure was that the people most likely to buy these were not the same people who were jailbreaking their iOS devices in the past. These are first time iOS customizers, so there's no notion of what an iOS icon set should be priced at.</p>

<h3>Do it for the art</h3>

<p>If I would have done this exclusively for the goal of making money, I'm convinced it wouldn't have worked nearly as well as it did. I see copycats showing up everywhere. They see success, and try to replicate exactly how it happened, but it won't work. At least not nearly as well. The reasons for this post is not to teach you how to sit on the edge of your seat, foaming at the mouth at the chance to exploit the next big internet trend, but it's to push you to keep working at the things you enjoy, share them with the world, and letting the internet do the rest.</p>

<h3>Aftermath</h3>

<p>So what came of all this? I suspect this is why most of you are here reading this, so here's a recap of everything that came from last week in numbers, from the time of this writing:</p>

<h4>Short-term metrics:</h4>

<ul><li>4,188 total icon sales</li><li>$116,147 in revenue</li><li>97% profit margins</li><li>6.2m impression</li><li>216,800 visitors</li></ul>

<h4>Long-term metrics:</h4>

<ul><li>5,216 email subscribers</li><li>4,620 Twitter followers</li><li>180 <a href="https://super.so/">Super</a> customers</li></ul>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>In the same way that creating icon sets 7 years ago prepared me for last week, this whole experiment has likely prepared me for what's to come years from now.</p>

<p>The best part about this is the freedom its bought me, to keep building things that'll create even more freedom. <strong>Spending time on things that will buy you time is always a good use of it.</strong> When people buy into what ever it is you're selling, they're not only giving you money, but they're contributing to your future freedom.</p>

<p>The market will decide a huge part of what comes after sharing something, so continually increase your odds by building, publishing, then repeating. Try many things once to figure out what you want to do twice. Figure out what you've got stored in your brain that can be of value to others, then share it with the world. You might be surprised of what comes of it.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

September 30, 2020 | https://pgaleone.eu/cicd/unreal-engine/2020/09/30/continuous-integration-with-unreal-engine-4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pgaleone.eu/cicd/unreal-engine/2020/09/30/continuous-integration-with-unreal-engine-4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is an essential step in the development pipeline of well-designed software infrastructure. The goal of CI is to <strong>automatize the boring stuff</strong> by letting the developers focusing on the code and, at the same time, helping them in producing good quality software.</p>
<p>Often, we read together two acronyms (and this article makes no exception) CI &amp; CD. While CI always stands for Continuous Integration, CD has two different meanings:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> where a developer’s change is automatically bug-tested and uploaded to a repository, or</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Deployment</strong> where a developer’s change is automatically released to the production environment, where the customer can use this brand-new version.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to configure and use the CI/CD tool provided by GitLab to correctly manage the CI/CD pipeline of an <strong>Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) project</strong> that needs to work (and thus, to be tested) on 3 different platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>macOS</li>
<li>Linux</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, “CD” will stand for Continuous Delivery - so I won’t cover the Deployment part.</p>

<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> is a complete DevOps platform: it offers us a complete CI/CD toolchain, an amazing issue tracking suite, and exposes in a user-friendly-way almost every Git’s feature.</p>
<p><img src="https://pgaleone.eu/images/ciue4/cicd_pipeline_infograph.png" alt="GitLab Continuous Integration pipeline"></p>
<p>The CI/CD toolchain is composed of 3 main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>gitlab-ci.yml</code> file that contains the configuration of the CI/CD pipeline. Using this YAML file we can configure the CI/CD behavior: what should happen on every commit or merge request, what should happen at scheduled times, and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/">many many more</a>. This file contains the commands to execute (a batch of commands is called “job”) on the specified runner.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/">GitLab Runners</a>. A runner is a software able to receive from GitLab a job, execute it, and send back the result to GitLab. Several runners can (and should) run in parallel, allowing the whole infrastructure to scale. The execution of the job is delegated to an “executor”.</li>
<li><strong>The executor</strong>. During the configuration of the runner, we can specify what type of executor to use. In particular, it’s possible to use the machine where the runner is installed to run directly in its shell the commands (that’s the shell executor), or use Docker to execute the commands into a container, or even use a virtual machine or a Kubernetes cluster (for a complete reference see: https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/).</li>
</ul>
<p>The amazing thing is that GitLab Runner is a software written in Go: this means that it can run perfectly on our three target platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<p>Moreover, installing it is trivial as explained in <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/#install-gitlab-runner">the documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="executors-for-ue4-projects">Executors for UE4 projects</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/">Unreal Engine</a> is a cross-platform game engine, quoting the official website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unreal Engine is the world’s most open and advanced real-time 3D creation tool. Continuously evolving to serve not only its original purpose as a state-of-the-art game engine, today it gives creators across industries the freedom and control to deliver cutting-edge content, interactive experiences, and immersive virtual worlds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UE4 is really an amazing project, but this amazingness comes at a cost: it’s <strong>heavy</strong>. The engine itself, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/index.html">available on GitHub</a>, weights ~132GB on Linux:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>du</span> <span>-hs</span> /opt/unreal-engine/
132G    /opt/unreal-engine/
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Since our goal is to create an environment that contains the compiled engine (for our three target platforms) and use it inside our CI. Using a <strong>Docker executor</strong> it is perhaps the best possible solution.</p>
<h3 id="docker-executor">Docker executor</h3>
<p>As previously stated, one of the costs of using UE4 is its size: when we have enough resources this isn’t a problem (you need a good amount of storage and a lot of memory and CPU power to compile and use the engine), and it’s not a problem even when using Docker on Linux. However, building a Docker image containing UE4 on Windows is somehow a difficult and long process, because there is a well-know and <em>unresolved</em> issue about the creation of <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/37581">filesystem layers lager than 8 GiB</a>.</p>
<p>Although there are well-known issues (only on Windows), using a Docker executor have a lot of advantages like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spawning a container is a cheap operation.</li>
<li>Every container is isolated.</li>
<li>It is possible to scale the solution easily (easy to parallelize).</li>
<li>Customizing/Creating a Dockerfile is easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating docker containers with unreal-engine inside is a challenge that <a href="https://adamrehn.com/">Adam Rehn</a> with his <a href="https://unrealcontainers.com/">Unreal Containers</a> <strong>amazingly faced</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://pgaleone.eu/images/ciue4/ue-plus-docker.svg" alt="UnrealContainer logo"></p>
<p>The project, and Python package, <a href="https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4-docker/read-these-first/introduction-to-ue4-docker">ue4-docker</a> contains all we need to create a docker image that we will later on use in our <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file.</p>
<p>Using <code>ue4-docker</code> creating an image is so easy as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>REPO_URL</span><span>=</span><span>"&lt;set url here&gt;"</span>
<span>BRANCH</span><span>=</span><span>"&lt;set branch here&gt;"</span>
ue4-docker build custom:4.25.3 <span>-repo</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$REPO_URL</span><span>"</span> <span>-branch</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$BRANCH</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
           <span>--exclude</span> debug <span>\ </span><span># exclude debug symbols to reduce the image and workaround the windows issue</span>
           <span>--exclude</span> templates <span>\ </span><span># exclude the templates since we don't need them in our CI</span>
           <span>--exclude</span> ddc <span># exclude DDC to speed up the image creation </span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The same command can be executed in a Linux and in a Windows machine. Personally, I prefer having a Linux machine that executes a docker container, instead of using a Windows machine to execute a docker container containing a Linux image (for performance reasons and to save time during the creation of the images too).</p>
<p>At the end of the execution of the <code>ue4-docker</code> command, we end up with a set of images ready to use like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>docker images | grep ue4

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>A complete description of what is inside every image is available in the <a href="https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4-docker/building-images/available-container-images">List of available container images</a> page.</p>
<p>Using Docker we can cover the CI for the Linux and Windows platforms. macOS, instead, can’t run inside a container :( hence we have to use another executor.</p>
<h3 id="shell-executor">Shell executor</h3>
<p>The shell executor is just “the current machine”. Thus, we can install <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/osx.html">GitLab Runner on macOS</a> and manually install all the dependencies that are, in our case, only unreal engine and the Xcode toolchain.</p>
<p>Differently from the Docker executor, the Shell executor has several disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>No isolation at all.</li>
<li>No native support for parallel and isolated executions.</li>
<li>It doesn’t scale well.</li>
<li>We have to clean up the dirt left by the operations we do in the CI (e.g. temporary files).</li>
</ul>
<p>The only advantage we have is the simplicity of installation: we just have to install UE4 on our machine and we are ready to go.</p>
<p>Supposing to have Unreal Engine already installed (the setup on Mac, Linux, Windows is straightforward; it’s just a matter of following the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/Installation/index.html">guide</a>), the only thing we need to do is to install another Python tool created by Adam Rehn: <a href="https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4cli/overview/introduction-to-ue4cli">ue4cli</a>.</p>
<p>This Python package implements a command-line tool called <code>ue4</code>: this tool simplifies the invocation/usage of the UE4 toolchain and, perhaps more importantly, it unifies the interface we have to use on different platforms.</p>
<p>The tool is installed into the <code>ue4-full</code> images and that’s the reason we’re going to use these images in our <code>gitlab-ci.yml</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="the-cicd-pipeline">The CI/CD pipeline</h2>
<p>As introduced at the beginning of the article, after setting up the runners and the executor, we are ready to describe the CI/CD pipeline in the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the automatization of the boring stuff, we need to find a way to automatically answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the code following the code style / required formatting?</li>
<li>Does the code I want to merge compile correctly on every platform?</li>
<li>Am I introducing regressions?</li>
</ol>
<p>To answer all these questions, and be ready for the continuous delivery stuff, we need to define the variables and the stages (of the pipeline) we plan to execute.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>variables</span><span>:</span>
    <span>GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>recursive"</span>
    <span>GIT_STRATEGY</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>fetch"</span>
    <span>GIT_CHECKOUT</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>true"</span>
    <span>GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>1"</span>
    <span>GET_SOURCES_ATTEMPTS</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>10"</span>

<span>stages</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>static-analysis</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>build</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>tests</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>package</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>static-analysis</strong> stage will contain the jobs related to the source code analysis. The checks for the source code formatting (the only one presented in this article) and other checks related to the analysis of the source code itself.</li>
<li>The <strong>build</strong> stage will contain the jobs that answer question 2.</li>
<li>The <strong>test</strong> stage contains the execution of the test cases (because every unreal project uses the unreal test suite - isn’t it?)</li>
<li>The <strong>package</strong> stage contains the continuous delivery part of the pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis</h5>
<p>Every C++ project should follow a code style. This CI job uses <code>clang-format</code> and <code>dos2unix</code> to check if every committed file has the correct encoding (we need UTF-8 encoded files to be sure that every compiler on every platform can read them well) and follows the style rules present in the <code>.clang-format</code> file that should be present into every project :)</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>clang-format</span><span>:</span>
    <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>alpine</span>
    <span>stage</span><span>:</span> <span>static-analysis</span>
    <span>variables</span><span>:</span>
        <span>GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>1"</span>
    <span># empty dependencies = do not need artifacts from previous stages</span>
    <span>dependencies</span><span>:</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>script</span><span>:</span>

<h3>What's inside</h3>
<p>How can you drive the thinking on what to develop, why and how to
do it — leveraging the insights from both team and stakeholders — all the way from idea to
deploy?</p>
<p>This book tries to answer the above question. As part of our own
product development at Delibr, we interviewed over 300 Product Managers to understand how they work
and collaborate around feature development, what problems they face, and the many approaches to
solving those problems. </p>
<p>"Epic alignment" describes four broad approaches that we saw help
Product Managers excel.</p>
<h3>What you'll learn</h3>
<ul>
<li>How to drive product development towards impact based on research</li>
<li>How to use user stories as a shared language to align your entire team</li>
<li>How to write feature documents that drive joint understanding and act as a single source of
truth
</li>
<li>How to tackle the massive amounts of decisions needed for every epic</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs that describes how to ask &amp; fetch the data from the server to the client which of course requires setting up a server. Below you will find a list of the most popular GraphgQL server implementations. There’s quite a few of them so we’re not going to get through the lot of them in one go.</p>
<h2>Express GraphQL</h2>
<p>It is said that <a href="https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql">Express GraphQL</a> is the simplest way to run a GraphQL API server. Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js allowing you to create a GraphQL server with any HTTP web framework supporting connect styled middleware including <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, <a href="http://restify.com/">Restify</a> and, of course, <a href="https://github.com/senchalabs/connect">Connect</a>. Getting started is as easy as installing some additional dependencies in form of <code>npm install express express-graphql graphql --save</code></p>

<p>Friends, this should give you a little boost at the end of your day – because 8-Bit Show and Tell has located a Commodore 64 program hidden within Prodigal’s 1984 album entitled Electric Eye. I was just goofing around on YouTube when I came across this video – which was originally uploaded back on October 19th of this year. Since I have been known to talk about my love of the Commdore 64 computer of my youth – the title of the video caught my attention pretty quickly. And seriously, how absolutely amazing is it that in this day and age we can still be surprised by little Easter eggs from 35 years ago? As Robin will demonstrate on the video itself the program was hidden in the runout groove on the B side of <em>Electric Eye</em>  – which you can plainly see in this article image header has a “C-64” scratched into said groove. Probably one of the reasons that not a lot of people know about the program is because it needed to be played on your turntable where you could record the hidden program on a cassette tape to upload it on your C64… that is a little bit of work. As the video will show – sometimes using older technology takes a couple of tries – or even totally different equipment in some cases.</p>







<p>I will have to in the near future share an article about the Mattel Electronics Aquarius computer that we obtained at the arcade – in fact I talked just a bit about it in the <em><a href="https://popcultureretrorama.com/2019/11/24/diary-of-an-arcade-employee-podcast-1up-night-stalker/">Night Stalker</a></em> podcast earlier today. Robin was able to make contact with one of the surviving members of <strong>Prodigal</strong> by the way – which was a Christian rock group, active from 1975 until 1986 – to ask how and why this 35 year-old computer program was included on the <em>Electric Eye</em> album. </p>

<p>The discovery of what amounts to a simple message from <strong>Prodigal</strong> 35 years later might not be the most groundbreaking thing you’ll see today… but I thought it was special enough that I had to share it. Watching this particular 8-Bit Show and Tell video will in addition show you how to hack your turntable to disable the auto return if you need to!</p>

<p>Last week I was trying to add some <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/822/commits/aa833603a6b4c947c21da04aeac40d80444ebcc1#diff-b04459e37839cd223176618536295715R425">testing code to libsecp256k1</a> and I was pulling out my hair trying to get it to work.
No amount of <code>printf</code> was working to illuminate what I was doing wrong.
Finally, out of desperation, I thought I would do a quick check to see if there are any compiler bugs related to <code>memcmp</code>, and lo and behold, I found <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95189">GCC bug #95189: memcmp being wrongly stripped like strcmp</a>.</p><p>Honestly this was a pretty horrifying bug to read about.
Under some circumstances GCC 9 and 10 will cause <code>memcmp</code> to return an incorrect value when one of the inputs is statically known array that contains <code>NULL</code> bytes.
As I rushed to <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/roconnor/2b8e22e829ed80088ed6690cc3c7f3a8/raw/455571a6d9053c597c1585debe6f9dbd6af85071/gistfile1.txt">recompile my computer system using GCC 8</a>, I contemplated the vast consequences of such a bug could be, and pondered how it was possible that computers could function at all.</p><p>However over the week, with the help of my colleagues, we managed to get a better understanding of the scope of the bug.
The bug can only convert non-zero values to zero values.
The static array needs to have a <code>NULL</code> byte within the first 4 bytes.
Most importantly, the <code>memcmp</code> result must not immediately be compared to <code>0</code> for equality or inequality, or any equivalent test.
A different code path is taken in the compiler in that case.
That explained why computers were still functioning.
I expect the vast majority of the uses of <code>memcmp</code> does an immediate test for equality with <code>0</code>.</p><p>I still wondered though, how much code was being affected. My colleague Tim suggested that it would be possible to instrument GCC to emit a message when it was about to miscompile a program.
Together we came up with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=49276&amp;action=diff">a patch</a> to GCC 9 and 10 that would print a debugging message.
Once again, I recompiled my entire system, to see what GCC was miscompiling.

<p>On my entire system I only found 10 lines of code that were miscompiled.

None of the lines looked that serious.
I am not sure which one is the worse: the reduced message integrity code(?) from some ARCFOUR implementation or the something something from an ATM driver?</p><p>The mplayer miscompilation is the most mysterious.
The code surrounding that function all appears to be immediately compare <code>memcmp</code> with <code>0</code>.
And given that my debug message refused to point to exactly what line is being miscompiled in that function, I fear some set of optimizations has happened to allow this code to be miscompiled in some way.</p><p>With more hardware I could do <a href="https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixpkgs/trunk#tabs-jobs">a more thorough investigation</a> of the consequences of this GCC bug.
Until then I am going to stick with GCC 8 until GCC 9 and 10 have a new point releases.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>You’ve likely used UUIDs in projects before and assumed them to be unique. Today, we’ll take a look at the main aspects of the implementation and understand why UUIDs are <em>practically </em>unique, though an incredibly small potential for duplication exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modern day implementation of UUIDs can be tied back to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RFC 4122 </a>which introduced 5 different approaches for generating these identifiers. We’ll take a look at each one and we’ll step through the implementation details of Version 1 &amp; Version 4 in a moment.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>UUIDs, or universally unique IDentifiers, are simply a 128 bit number used to uniquely identify items in software development. Their canonical textual representation is as a series of 32 hexadecimal characters which are separated into five groups by hyphens in the form 8-4-4-4-12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example,&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>3422b448-2460-4fd2-9183-8000de6f8343</code></p>
<p>Embedded inside this seemingly random series of hexadecimal characters is information about the UUID implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>xxxxxxxx-xxxx-<strong>M</strong>xxx-<strong>N</strong>xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx</code></p>
<p>The values in the M and N locations uniquely identify the UUID version and variant respectively.</p>
<h4><strong>Version</strong></h4>
<p>The version number is identified by looking at the most significant 4 bits of the value in the M position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following table lists the currently defined versions:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1ePxhp-OP2JdmdHVLd3rbfDc9dcNP5J9QQncT0bYPdJ5W3_2pAHfGZ9a7Q7m3mav6VA1syO22nTIavepVicTMW9YxqiuGcSePUOanJeyz67K_bZwDbd_KO25oLgPirr53qj1wZq9" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h4><strong>&nbsp;Variant</strong></h4>
<p>The variant field determines the layout of the information embedded in the UUID. The interpretation of all other bits in the UUID depends on the value of the variant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We identify the variant by considering the first 1-3 most significant bits of N.&nbsp;</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FeXxFJcHdVVJA7IorpHtQx67F3eiSkMJVAr2Q5E4t3IierXggi-DR1uthMBOgRBXRP4JzcdRMuHbVqMMkCWZ47fo7sUO8sDBQcwgALwr45qLdpC9bSUBoXKQF9Bhdnnc9kN-g8p9" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The most common implementation nowadays is Variant 1 where the MSB0&nbsp; is fixed as 1 and MSB1 is fixed as 0. This means that considering our wildcard values – the bits marked with an <code>x</code> above – the only possible values are 8, 9, A, or B.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Quick Reminder:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1 0 0 0 = 8&nbsp;</p><p>1 0 0 1 = 9</p><p>1 0 1 0 = A</p><p>1 0 1 1 = B</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you ever see a UUID with these values in the N position, you’ll know it’s the common Variant 1 type.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Version 1 (Time Based + Unique or Random Host Identifier)&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>In this version, the UUID is generated by taking the current timestamp and some identifying property of the device generating the UUID – most commonly, the MAC address (also called the node ID).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This UUID is generated by concatenating the 48 bit MAC address, a 60 bit-timestamp, and a 14 bit “uniquifying” clock sequence, along with the 6 reserved bits for version and variant to generate a unique UUID.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The clock sequence is simply a value incremented every time the clock is modified.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The timestamp used in this version is the number of 100 nanosecond time intervals since October 15, 1582 – the date of Gregorian reform to the Christian calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>You may be familiar with Unix systems and time since epoch. This is simply just a different Day 0. There are several algorithms online that allow you to convert one time representation to the other, so we won’t go over this here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though this implementation seems fairly straightforward and robust, because it reveals the MAC address of the machine it was generated on, this approach is not suitable for all use cases.&nbsp; Especially, when security is a major concern. Instead, some implementations will use 6 random bytes sourced from a cryptographically secure random number generator as a replacement for the node ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;To assemble a Version 1 UUID, we’ll do the following steps:&nbsp;</p>
<ol><li>Take the low 32 bits of the current UTC timestamp. This will be the first 4 bytes / 8 hex characters of our UUID [TimeLow]</li><li>Take the middle 16 bits of the current UTC timestamp. These will be the following 2 bytes / 4 hex characters. [TimeMid]</li><li>The next 2 bytes / 4 hex characters will concat the 4 bit UUID version with the remaining high 12 bits of the current UTC timestamp (which is 60 bits in total). [TimeHighAndVersion]</li><li>Now, the next 1-3 bits will specify the variant of the UUID version. The remaining bits will contain the clock sequence which is meant to contribute some small amount of randomness to this implementation. In doing so, it helps avoid collisions in the event multiple UUID generators are running on the same system, a system clock for a UUID generator is set backwards, or the system clock doesn’t advance fast enough. [ClockSequenceHiAndRes &amp;&amp; ClockSequenceLow]</li><li>The final 6 bytes / 12 hex characters / 48 bits are the “node id” which is most commonly the MAC address of the issuing device. [NodeID]</li></ol>
<p>Putting everything together, our Version 1 UUID is generated by concatenating:</p>
<p><code>TimeLow + TimeMid + TimeHighAndVersion + (ClockSequenceHiAndRes &amp;&amp; ClockSequenceLow) + NodeID&nbsp;</code></p>
<p>Due to this implementation’s reliance on the clock, there are some edge cases we’ll need to handle. Firstly, to minimize correlation across systems, the clock sequence is defaulted to a random number – this will only happen once in the lifetime of a system. This has the added benefit of allowing us to support node identifiers that may move from system to system as the initial value of the clock sequence is completely agnostic of the node identifier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that the main purpose of the clock sequence is to introduce some amount of randomness into the equation. The bits allocated for the clock sequence help us extend the timestamp and account for situations where multiple UUIDs are generated before the processor clock advances. This helps us avoid the potential creation of duplicates when the clock is set backwards in time (device is powered off) or the node ID changes. If the clock is set backwards, or might have been set backwards (e.g., while the system was powered off), and the UUID generator can not be sure that no UUIDs were generated with timestamps larger than the value to which the clock was set, then the clock sequence has to be changed. If the previous value of the clock sequence is known, it can just be incremented; otherwise it should be set to a random or high-quality pseudo-random value.</p>
<h4><strong>Version 2 (Distributed Computing Environment Security)</strong></h4>
<p>The main difference between this version and Version 1 is that this implementation uses some identifier specific to the system in place of the “randomness” generated by using the least significant bits of the clock sequence. This value is often just the current user’s ID. This version is less common and only a small deviation from Version 1, so we won’t explore it any further.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Version 3 (Name-based + MD5 Hash)</strong></h4>
<p>In the event that you want to have unique identifiers for information within a namespace or for “nameable” information more generally, UUID version 3 and version 5 are your preferred options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They’ll encode any “nameable” entity (website, DNS information, plain text, etc) into the UUID value. The main takeaway here is that for the same namespace and text, the generated UUID will be the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take note that the namespace itself is a UUID.</p>
<pre><code>let namespace = “digitalbunker.dev”
let namespaceUUID = UUID3(.DNS, namespace)

// Ex: 
UUID3(namespaceUUID, “/category/things-you-should-know-1/”) 
4896c91b-9e61-3129-87b6-8aa299028058

UUID3(namespaceUUID, “/category/things-you-should-know-2/”) 
29be0ee3-fe77-331e-a1bf-9494ec18c0ba

UUID3(namespaceUUID, “/category/things-you-should-know-3/”) 
33b06619-1ee7-3db5-827d-0dc85df1f759
</code></pre>
<p>In this implementation, the UUID of the namespace is transformed to a string of bytes, concatenated with the input name, then hashed with MD5, yielding the 128 bits for the UUID. Then, we’ll overwrite some of those bits to accurately reflect the version and variant information leaving the rest unchanged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also important to understand that neither the namespace nor the inputted name can be generated from the UUID. This is a one-way operation. The only exception here would be through a brute force approach if one of the values (namespace or text) were known by the attacker.</p>
<p>For Version 3 and Version 5, as long as you use the same inputs, the generated UUID will be deterministic.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Version 4 (PRNG)</strong></h4>
<p>This is probably the simplest implementation of the bunch.</p>
<p>As we’ve now seen, 6 bits are reserved for the version and variant information leaving us 122 bits free to decide. This version simply generates all 128 random bits and then fills in the values for the version and variant information as a secondary step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UUIDs of this variety rely heavily on the quality of the PRNG in use (pseudo-random number generator). If the PRNG is lacking a sophisticated algorithm or the correct seed and initialization values, the likelihood of a duplicate can increase. To better understand how computers generate random numbers, <a href="https://digitalbunker.dev/2020/09/08/how-do-computers-generate-random-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out my previous article.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Version 4 is what you’ll find most commonly implemented in modern programming languages.</p>
<p>It’s implementation is reasonably simple.&nbsp;</p>
<ol><li>Generate 128 random bits</li><li>Now, we’ll need to overwrite some of these bits with the correct version and variant information&nbsp;<ol><li>Take the 7th byte and perform an AND operation with <code>0x0F</code> to clear out the high nibble. Then, OR it with <code>0x40</code> to set the version number to 4.&nbsp;</li><li>Next, take the 9th byte and perform an AND operation with <code>0x3F</code> and then OR it with <code>0x80</code>.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Convert the 128 bits to hexadecimal representation and insert the hyphens to achieve the canonical text representation.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<h4><strong>Version 5 (Name-based + SHA-1 Hash)</strong></h4>
<p>This version is no different than Version 3 with the exception that the <code>SHA-1</code> hashing algorithm is used here in place of <code>MD5</code>. This version is preferred to Version 3 (SHA-1 &gt; MD5).&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>In Practice</strong></h2>
<p>One of the notable benefits of UUIDs is that their uniqueness does not depend on a central authority or coordination between different systems. Anyone can create UUIDs with reasonable assurance that a duplicate value does not exist and will conceivably not be made in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has the added benefit of allowing UUIDs generated by independent parties to be combined into a single database or moved across databases with a trivial probability of duplication / collision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to this uniqueness, you can use UUIDs as primary keys in databases, unique filenames for uploaded files, unique names for any web resource, or …</p></div></div>

<p>The Apple T2 security chip has finally been jailbroken! Here’s all you need to know about it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="The_Apple_T2_Security_chip_now_has_a_jailbreak"><strong>The Apple T2 Security chip now has a jailbreak</strong><span></span></span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://yalujailbreak.net/checkra1n-jailbreak-ios-14/">latest update of checkra1n</a> adds support for bridgeOS – the operating system that powers the Apple T2 security chip.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, the T2 chip is not A10 per se but it is derived from the Apple A10 Fusion architecture.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>bridgeOS</strong> is a proprietary operating system created by Apple for its hardware. It is responsible for operating the Touch Bar and managing secure data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what hacker Jamie Bishop had to say about this development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">With <a href="https://twitter.com/checkra1n?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@checkra1n</a> 0.11.0, you can now jailbreak the T2 chip in your Mac. An incredible amount of work went into this and it required changes at multiple levels.</p>
<p>There’s too many people to tag, but shoutout to everyone who worked on getting this incredible feature shipped.</p>

<p>Since checkra1n is still in beta, there are a few issues you need to be aware of. Firstly, you might have to reconnect your device after jailbreaking for bootstrap upload.</p>
<p>Secondly, macOS takes over the USB connection and blocks communication after bootup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are interested in jailbreaking the T2 chip, download checkra1n jailbreak v0.11 from this <a href="https://yalujailbreak.net/checkra1n-jailbreak-ios-14/">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="What_can_a_bridgeOS_jailbreak_be_used_for"><strong>What can a bridgeOS jailbreak be used for?&nbsp;</strong><span></span></span></h2>
<p>The T2 security processor and the Touch Bar can run while the operating system is shutdown.</p>
<p>Apparently, jailbreak tweak developers could develop tweaks for the Touch Bar if it gets Substrate support in the future.</p>
<p>At present, there are no publicly dumped headers available for bridgeOS. It lacks a MobileSubstrate port too. However, that could change in the future because it shares some of the components of watchOS and iOS frameworks.</p>
<p>Once we get Substrate working, <strong>tweaking and theming could become possible.</strong></p>

<p>The ability to exploit the T2 processor could also allow you to bypass the anti-repair mechanism built into the Touch Bar. Further, it may allow hackers to get rid of the password or unlock MDM-locked systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as the OS goes, we could also add secure boot certificates like Microsoft’s secure boot signing or a self-signed Linux certificate.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>It will definitely be interesting to see what the future holds for the <em>T2 security chip</em> following the release of checkra1n.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t forget to follow us on Twitter and Facebook for the latest jailbreak news and updates.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The C++ STL may be the most impressive achievement in language standard libraries. Where most programmers are stuck complaining that their language’s default strings aren’t performant enough, about every standard C++ function for strings actually runs on arbitrary character sequences. Design your own container? <span>std::find_if</span> works just as well as for the built-ins. And it does this while often being more performant than the code you’d write yourself.</p>

<p>Alex Stepanov is the man who made this happen, and Elements of Programming (EOP) is his 200-page paean to his method for writing generic code. He’s a believer that programming can be turned from an art to a rigorous discipline based on mathematics, and I’ve long admired him for his deep knowledge and impact. Indeed, he’s spent years at  #1 on my list of people I’d like to have lunch with. (Hey readers — can anyone help?)</p>

<p>And now, I’m about to ruin all that by writing a negative review.</p>

<p>EOP has a strong beginning and a strong finish. The first chapter explains core programming language concepts such as types and state — using non-standard terminology, but probably intentionally, judging by the explanation’s lucidity. This culminates in his big idea of being able to write programs on any type that offers a bundle of operations and properties called a concept, explained in this book over a decade before they entered the C++ standard. The afterword is a few pages of reflection on the power of this approach.</p>

<p>Between them is 11 chapters where he plays the same game: define a new abstraction and then show a bunch of functions that can be written using it. And unfortunately, these functions and abstractions are largely not very interesting.</p>

<p>There’s a famous site called Project Euler, where users write code to solve mathy problems such as “In a modified version of the board game Monopoly, on what three squares is a player most likely to land?” My former programming-contest coach advocated against using it to practice, because “It’s not really programming, and it’s not really math.”</p>

<p>I think this is an apt description of EOP, particularly the first half. This starts from Chapter 2, which is about cool algorithms that involve applying some function to itself repeatedly (iteration). One of my <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdm/pdf/lect-05.pdf">favorite lectures</a> in undergrad was on this topic, and yet I still couldn’t enjoy this chapter, as I know no application of these algorithms outside of niche mathematical topics. This gets taken up another notch in Chapter 5, where, in about 5 pages, he goes from explaining commutativity to defining the algebraic structures of monoids, groups, and rings, all the way up to algebraic modules (no relation to software modules). I cannot fathom these explanations being useful to someone who does not already know these concepts, and certainly not to someone who already does. And while I do know many uses of groups in software engineering — as an abstraction of the idea of an invertible operation — he actually spends the remainder of this chapter considering generalizations of the greatest common divisor function.</p>

<p>I slogged through these chapters, excited for the second half of the book, which focused largely on iterators and containers, things more relevant to typical software engineering. Yet after encountering endless listings of variations of list-copy functions, I found myself no more fulfilled, and soon regressed to skimming through the pages.</p>

<p>Aside from my long-term goal to find all the good writing on software design, I had a short-term goal when reading this book: a student wanted me to teach a lesson based on it. But, halfway through the book, my deadline was fast approaching, and I hadn’t found any material useful enough for a software design lesson for experienced engineers.</p>

<p>I then noticed all the chapters were generated by the deeper principle of coming up with a good abstraction to write generic functions against. I got the idea that maybe I could use EOP as a problem book, telling them to look at the descriptions of generic functions, and then come up with both the code and the abstractions they can be written against. Alas, the topic selection is not suitable for this purpose. One section of the book, for example, deals with computing integer sequences by matrix exponentiation. Asking students to come up with this themselves would be too familiar for many who have taken a linear algebra course, and impossible for those who haven’t. I did design a lesson where students come up with their own abstractions for generic programming problems, but I used examples completely unrelated to the book.</p>

<p>I asked the friend who recommended EOP what he got out of the book, and his first answer was a technique for elegantly expressing state machines using goto’s. I similarly loved that part, but, alas, that was the only concrete thing I got out of this book. I’ll explain it at the end of this review and spare you the other 200 pages.</p>

<p>I have an undergraduate degree in mathematics and have authored several papers on generic programming, so I knew I was reading it for others’ benefit. Still, I don’t think my opinion would be changed were this not the case, and I’d really like help understanding the viewpoint of the many readers who did thoroughly enjoy it. Instead, I find myself agreeing with this Amazon reviewer, although I have too much admiration for Stepanov to contemplate a 1-star rating:</p>

<blockquote>If you've ever written a generic function, you already know that the type parameters must obey a set of preconditions. This book lays out a big pile of definitions for types, numbers, algebraic structures, iterators, and such, so as to bamboozle people easily impressed by mathematical notation. It does so sloppily and writes some trivial generic algorithms in C++. To whatever extent one might accomplish something interesting with this topic, this book doesn't. Avoid.</blockquote>

<p>As I read other material by Stepanov, I mourn for the book that could have been. Stepanov clearly cares about these abstractions and algorithms, to the point where he wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Generic-Programming-Alexander-Stepanov/dp/0321942043">second book</a> on largely the same material, with a chattier exposition and chapters more explicitly focusing on pure math. How different would it be had he managed to transmit this appreciation to me? The day after finishing, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2tWOdzgXHA&amp;t=1344s">this talk</a> by a close colleague of Stepanov. “In this menu, you can select a bunch of rows and drag them somewhere else,” he explained over animated slides. “How many of you could implement this in one line?” It made me want to open section 10.4 on “rotation algorithms” again.</p>

<p>I’ve started watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxtyCq_WDLXryyw91lahwdtpZsmo4BGD">a seminar</a> he gave at Amazon. I’m only a few lectures in, but I’m already enthralled by his high teaching ability. I feel like I’m there with him working through problems. I feel like I’ve learned a great secret as he tells the story of how he invented “regular types,” something used throughout EOP but never motivated. To be honest, I still don’t know what this lecture series is about, but nonetheless expect to recommend it when I’m done.</p>

<p>In short, Stepanov has given many gifts to the world of programming, and EOP is not one of them.</p>

<p><b>Overall rating</b>: <span>Not recommended</span></p>

<p>With a smattering of exceptions, EOP neither teaches abstractions useful in everyday programming, nor teaches you the skills to invent your own.</p>

<h2><b>Addendum</b>: State machines by goto’s</h2>

<blockquote>“The fastest way to go from one place in code to another is goto.”</blockquote><p>

— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp_IBYVqMeQ&amp;list=PLHxtyCq_WDLXryyw91lahwdtpZsmo4BGD">Alexander Stepanov</a></p><p>Many iterative algorithms can be described as state machines: first it looks for an X, then it does Y with it, then it looks for another X, and so on. Rather than trying to massage the cycles in the state machine into structured loops, Stepanov advocates a style using goto’s, with one goto-label per machine state.</p>

<p>In searching for an example to best illustrate this, I wanted something where the code was under 40 lines (which ruled out Stepanov’s examples), understandable with little context or knowledge of C++, and which was not equivalent to a regular expression. And so:</p>

<p>In my defunctionalization talk, I showed that many state machines are derived from recursive functions, being turned into iterative traversals by creating a state for each point in the program between recursive calls. For that talk, I demonstrated this in full for the example of printing a binary tree. It turns out that adding parentheses makes this derivation substantially harder, as an arbitrary number of close-parentheses may need to be printed after processing a node. And that difficulty comes from trying to massage a state machine into a loop.</p>

<p>In this case, seeing as I came up with this example by starring with a recursive function, the recursive version is quite simple:</p>

<div><pre><span>void</span> <span>print_tree_rec</span><span>(tree</span> <span>*</span><span>t)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(t</span> <span>!=</span> <span>NULL)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>printf(</span><span>"("</span><span>);</span>
    <span>print_tree_rec(t</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>left);</span>
    <span>printf(</span><span>" %d "</span><span>,</span> <span>t</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>element);</span>
    <span>print_tree_rec(t</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>right);</span>
    <span>printf(</span><span>")"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But, for other state machines, the recursive version is not so easy. For example, Dijkstra created the “shunting yard” algorithm for parsing an arithmetic expression all the way back in 1961, yet I’m not aware of the recursive equivalent being discovered <a href="https://www.brics.dk/RS/07/7/BRICS-RS-07-7.pdf">until 2007</a>, using the technique of refunctionalization.</p>

<p>Here’s the state machine:</p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-068c5e82-7fff-aeae-61d2-74453ca23aeb"><span><span><img height="566" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bfYT7CeU0eo8KAoMt8gB5Y4FDgD7Y1UlUJYSNI3ndYZ6jQpZv5Nwpyqyqoqffi_tgSRBYslU93EZy_nCil9ub6FZraaRGOBoABGPk0i9DoNbgr1fWAnkQzXMxPvLvEYFSDRWZ1RL" width="572"></span></span></span></p>

<p>A confession: the first time I thought about how to make this recursive function function iterative, I didn’t get it, and had to look it up. The solution is to merge the “Next from stack” state in the diagram with its successors, resulting in a solution with two nested while-loops, at the cost of some duplicated code.</p>

<p>However, the version based on goto’s reads off this diagram rather nicely. One C++-ism in this code to note: while the stack s is initialized to NULL, the  <span>push()</span> and  <span>pop()</span> calls can actually change it.</p>

        <p>This is the third post in our <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/tag/zero-to-main">Zero to main() series</a>,
where we bootstrap a working firmware from zero code on a
cortex-M series microcontroller.</p>

<p>Previously, <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/zero-to-main-1">we wrote a startup file to bootstrap our C environment</a>, and <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/how-to-write-linker-scripts-for-firmware">a linker
script to get the right data at the right addresses</a>. These two will allow us to
write a monolithic firmware which we can load and run on our microcontrollers.</p>

<p>In practice, this is not how most firmware is structured. Digging through vendor
SDKs, you’ll notice that they all recommend using a <em>bootloader</em> to load your
applications. A bootloader is a small program which is responsible for loading
and starting your application.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>In this post, we will explain why you may want a
bootloader, how to implement one, and cover a few advanced techniques you may
use to make your bootloader more useful.

<h2 id="why-you-may-need-a-bootloader">Why you may need a bootloader</h2>

<p>Bootloaders serve many purposes, ranging from security to software architecture.</p>

<p>Most commonly, you may need a bootloader to load your software. Some
microcontrollers like Dialog’s
<a href="https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/connectivity/bluetooth-low-energy/smartbond-da14580-and-da14583">DA14580</a>
have little to no onboard flash and instead rely on an external device to store
firmware code. In that case, it is the bootloader’s job to copy code from
non-executable storage, such as a SPI flash, to an area of memory that can be
executed from, such as RAM.</p>

<p>Bootloaders also allow you to decouple parts of the program that are mission
critical, or that have security implications, from application code which
changes regularly.  For example, your bootloader may contain firmware update
logic so your device can recover no matter how bad a bug ships in your
application firmware.</p>

<p>Last but certainly not least, bootloaders are an essential component of a
trusted boot architecture.  Your bootloader can, for example, verify a
cryptographic signature to make sure the application has not been replaced or
tampered with.</p>

<h2 id="a-minimal-bootloader">A minimal bootloader</h2>
<p>Let’s build a simple bootloader together. To start, our bootloader must do two
things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Execute on MCU boot</li>
  <li>Jump to our application code</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll need to decide on a memory map, write some bootloader code, and update our
application to make it bootload-able.</p>

<h3 id="setting-the-stage">Setting the stage</h3>

<p>For this example, we’ll be using the same setup as we did in our previous Zero
to Main posts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adafruit’s <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3505">Metro M0 Express</a> as our
development board,</li>
  <li>a simple <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2764">CMSIS-DAP Adapter</a></li>
  <li>OpenOCD (the <a href="https://github.com/arduino/OpenOCD">Arduino fork</a>) for
programming</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deciding-on-a-memory-map">Deciding on a memory map</h3>

<p>We must first decide on how much space we want to dedicate to our bootloader.
Code space is precious - your application may come to need more of it - and you
will not be able to change this without updating your bootloader, so make
this as small as you possibly can.</p>

<p>Another important factor is your flash sector size: you want to make sure you
can erase app sectors without erasing bootloader data, or vice versa.
Consequently, your bootloader region must end on a flash sector boundary
(typically 4kB).</p>

<p>I decided to go with a 16kB region, leading to the following memory map:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        0x0 +---------------------+
            |                     |
            |     Bootloader      |
            |                     |
     0x4000 +---------------------+
            |                     |
            |                     |
            |     Application     |
            |                     |
            |                     |
    0x30000 +---------------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can transcribe that memory into a linker script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/* memory_map.ld */
MEMORY
{
  bootrom  (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 0x00004000
  approm   (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00004000, LENGTH = 0x0003C000
  ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00008000
}

__bootrom_start__ = ORIGIN(bootrom);
__bootrom_size__ = LENGTH(bootrom);
__approm_start__ = ORIGIN(approm);
__approm_size__ = LENGTH(approm);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since linker scripts are composable, we will be able to <code>include</code> that memory
map into the linker scripts we write for our bootloader and our application.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that the linker script above declares some variables. We’ll need
those for our bootloader to know where to find the application. To make them
accessible in C code, we declare them in a header file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* memory_map.h */</span>
<span>#pragma once
</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>__bootrom_start__</span><span>;</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>__bootrom_size__</span><span>;</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>__approm_start__</span><span>;</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>__approm_size__</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="implementing-the-bootloader-itself">Implementing the bootloader itself</h3>
<p>Next up, let’s write some bootloader code. Our bootloader needs to start
executing on boot and then jump to our app.</p>

<p>We know how to do the first part from our previous post: we need a valid stack
pointer at address <code>0x0</code> , and a valid <code>Reset_Handler</code>  function setting up our
environment at address <code>0x4</code>. We can reuse our previous startup file and linker
script, with one change: we use  <code>memory_map.ld</code> rather than define our own
<code>MEMORY</code> section.</p>

<p>We also need to put our code in the <code>bootrom</code> region from our memory rather than
the <code>rom</code> region in our previous post.</p>

<p>Our linker script therefore looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/* bootloader.ld */
INCLUDE memory_map.ld

/* Section Definitions */
SECTIONS
{
    .text :
    {
        KEEP(*(.vectors .vectors.*))
        *(.text*)
        *(.rodata*)
        _etext = .;
    } &gt; bootrom
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To jump into our application, we need to know where the <code>Reset_Handler</code> of the
app is, and what stack pointer to load.  Again, we know from our previous post
that those should be the first two 32-bit words in our binary, so we just need
to dereference those addresses using the <code>__approm_start__</code> variable from our
memory map.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* bootloader.c */</span>
<span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
#include "memory_map.h"
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>app_code</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>__approm_start__</span><span>;</span>
  <span>uint32_t</span> <span>app_sp</span> <span>=</span> <span>app_code</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
  <span>uint32_t</span> <span>app_start</span> <span>=</span> <span>app_code</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
  <span>/* TODO: Start app */</span>
  <span>/* Not Reached */</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we must load that stack pointer and jump to the code. This will require a
bit of assembly code.</p>

<p>ARM MCUs use the <a href="http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armasm/armasm_dom1361289882044.htm"><code>msr</code> instruction
</a> to
load immediate or register data into system registers, in this case the MSP
register or “Main Stack Pointer”.</p>

<p>Jumping to an address is done with a branch, in our case with a <a href="http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armasm/armasm_dom1361289866466.htm"><code>bx</code>
instruction</a>.</p>

<p>We wrap those two into a <code>start_app</code> function which accepts our <code>pc</code> and <code>sp</code> as
arguments, and get our minimal bootloader:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* app.c */</span>
<span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
#include "memory_map.h"
</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>start_app</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>pc</span><span>,</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>sp</span><span>)</span> <span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>naked</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>__asm</span><span>(</span><span>"           </span><span>\n</span><span>\
          msr msp, r1 /* load r1 into MSP */</span><span>\n</span><span>\
          bx r0       /* branch to the address at r0 */</span><span>\n</span><span>\

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: hardware resources initialized in the bootloader must be de-initialized
before control is transferred to the app. Otherwise, you risk breaking
assumptions the app code is making about the state of the system</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="making-our-app-bootloadable">Making our app bootloadable</h3>

<p>We must update our app to take advantage of our new memory map. This is again
done by updating our linker script to include <code>memory_map.ld</code> and changing our
sections to go to the <code>approm</code> region rather than <code>rom</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/* app.ld */
INCLUDE memory_map.ld

/* Section Definitions */
SECTIONS
{
    .text :
    {
        KEEP(*(.vectors .vectors.*))
        *(.text*)
        *(.rodata*)
        _etext = .;
    } &gt; approm
  ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also need to update the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/dui0552/latest/the-cortex-m3-processor/exception-model/vector-table"><em>vector
table</em></a>
used by the microcontroller. The vector table contains the address of every
exception and interrupt handler in our system. When an interrupt signal comes
in, the ARM core will call the address at the corresponding offset in the vector
table.</p>

<p>For example, the offset for the Hard fault handler is <code>0xc</code>, so when a hard
fault is hit, the ARM core will jump to the address contained in the table at
that offset.</p>

<p>By default, the vector table is at address <code>0x0</code>, which means that when our chip
powers up, only the bootloader can handle exceptions or interrupts! Fortunately, ARM
provides the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/dui0552/latest/cortex-m3-peripherals/system-control-block/vector-table-offset-register">Vector Table Offset
Register</a>
to dynamically change the address of the vector table. The register is at
address <code>0xE000ED08</code> and has a simple layout:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>31                                  7              0
+-----------------------------------+--------------+
|                                   |              |
|              TBLOFF               |   Reserved   |
|                                   |              |
+-----------------------------------+--------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code>TBLOFF</code> is the address of the vector table. In our case, that’s the start
of our text section, or <code>_stext</code>. To set it in our app, we add the following to
our <code>Reset_Handler</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* startup_samd21.c */</span>
<span>/* Set the vector table base address */</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>vector_table</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>_stext</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>vtor</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>0xE000ED08</span><span>;</span>
<span>*</span><span>vtor</span> <span>=</span> <span>((</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>)</span> <span>vector_table</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xFFFFFFF8</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One quirk of the ARMv7-m architecture is the alignment requirement for the
vector table, as specified in section B1.5.3 of the <a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0403/eb/DDI0403E_B_armv7m_arm.pdf">reference
manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Vector table must be naturally aligned to a power of two whose alignment value is greater than or equal
to (Number of Exceptions supported x 4), with a minimum alignment of 128 bytes.The entry at offset 0 is
used to initialize the value for SP_main, see The SP registers on page B1-8. All other entries must have bit
[0] set, as the bit is used to define the EPSR T-bit on exception entry (see Reset behavior on page B1-20 and
Exception entry behavior on page B1-21 for details).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our SAMD21 MCU has 28 interrupts on top of the 16 system reserved exceptions,
for a total of 44 entries in the table. Multiply that by 4 and you get 176. The
next power of 2 is 256, so our vector table must be 256-byte aligned.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Because it is hard to witness the bootloader execute, we add a print line to
each of our programs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* boootloader.c */</span>
<span>#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
#include "memory_map.h"
</span>
<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>s…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

          <p><a href="https://thejollyteapot.com/2020/09/29/nobody-seems-to-give-a-crap-about-google-s-monopoly-on-search-not-even-google">29 September 2020</a></p>
<p>Quick summary of the situation, from the <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/">Choice Screen webpage on the Android website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On August 2, 2019, following the European Commission’s July 2018 Android decision, Google announced that it would implement a choice screen for general search providers on all new Android phones and tablets shipped into the European Economic Area (<span>EEA</span>) where the Google Search app is pre-installed. This updated Help Center article describes a modified choice screen design that was developed in consultation with the European Commission.</p>
<p>The choice screen will appear during initial device setup and will feature multiple search providers, including Google. An illustrative version of the choice screen follows. Providers may vary by country. […]</p>
<p>Eligible search providers will need to fill out an application form and can bid for inclusion based on an auction. The auction process is explained in greater detail below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering how much this farce has been <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/duckduckgo-blasts-googles-android-choice-screen-says-it-incentivizes-ads">covered</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/googles-no-choice-screen-on-android-isnt-working-says-ecosia-querying-the-eus-approach-to-antitrust-enforcement/">already</a>, I will not repeat what <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-android-choice-screen-eu-duckduckgo-2020-9?IR=T">everybody knows</a>. Instead I will just point out how Google announced the result of the auctions <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen-winners/">on the Android website</a>: four sentences, two footnotes, a table listing the<span></span> <span>“</span>winners” per country, a title that reads do-not-give-a-shit, and that’s it.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t think I have ever heard of — <em>check notes</em> — PrivacyWall and info.com.<span></span> <span>’</span>What are they?’, you may ask: they are search engines apparently, and they are the only two search engine options offered to Android users in France that are not Google or Bing. And yes, in case you’re wondering, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfHuZ5qrYX4">Bing is still around</a>. Ecosia, DuckDuckGo, barely appear on the list.</p>
<p>If anything, this whole thing will reinforce Google’s monopoly on search. Users will see this<span></span> <span>’</span>choice screen’ and think:<span></span> <span>“</span><span>OK</span>, so two shady things I don’t know, Bing (laughs), and yep, Google. Why would they even ask me to choose?”</p>
<p>It’s like asking kids who have only ever watched the movie <em>Ratatouille</em> if they want to watch Ratatouille again, or another movie from this list: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2120120/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><em>Pixels</em></a> (even the kids would know it sucks), <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257778/?ref_=ttls_li_tt">The Hunchback of Notre Dame <span>II</span>: The Secret of the Bell</a></em> (you’re lucky if the kids even know about the first one), and <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083630/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">The Beastmaster</a></em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="motivation"><a href="#motivation" aria-label="motivation permalink"></a>Motivation</h2>
<p>Hitting the front page of Hacker News is an incredible source of short-term traffic to your website or article.</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://thehftguy.com/2017/09/26/hitting-hacker-news-front-page-how-much-traffic-do-you-get" rel="nofollow">article</a>, in 2017, being on the front page brings a sudden influx of between 10k and 30k visitors to your website/article, something many content marketers, product people, and entrepreneurs undoubtedly salivate over, including me.</p>
<p>I occasionally post to Hacker News (with random things and personal stuff) but have never reached the front page before. Therefore, I decided to dig a little deeper into the mechanics of Hacker News and the best approach to take if the sole goal is to hit the front page.</p>
<p>Obviously, a critical part of hitting the front page is submitting an interesting article which resonates with the HN audience. But beyond this, there are other factors at play—timing, title, upvotes, etc.</p>
<h2 id="methodology-a-unique-approach"><a href="#methodology-a-unique-approach" aria-label="methodology a unique approach permalink"></a>Methodology: A unique approach</h2>
<p>I am not the only person to want to know the best approach to hitting the front page. A few people have analyzed data from <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/y-combinator/hacker-news" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google’s Hacker News Dataset</a> on BigQuery to find the best time to submit to Hacker News.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that BigQuery doesn’t know how long a post spent on the front page, nor how long it was there for or what position it reached. It can only provide the total number of upvotes.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I wrote a small NodeJS script to poll Hacker News every 2 minutes. Using a Postgres database, I stored every post, user, and upvote over two weeks.</p>
<p>With this information, I compiled a list of useful information and insights below.</p>
<p>Note: To filter out posts that are either flagged or transiently featured, I set an arbitrary duration of 60+ minutes as a time requirement in the top for a post to be considered a “front page post.”</p>
<h2 id="limitations"><a href="#limitations" aria-label="limitations permalink"></a>Limitations</h2>
<p>Obviously, the lack of data (13,159 posts) and time spent collecting data (2 weeks) is the most significant limitation of my results. Nonetheless, I believe the results are still relatively useful, at least for the next few weeks or months.</p>
<h2 id="results"><a href="#results" aria-label="results permalink"></a>Results</h2>
<h3 id="basic-stats"><a href="#basic-stats" aria-label="basic stats permalink"></a>Basic stats</h3>
<ul>
<li>I tracked a total of 13,159 posts over two weeks.</li>
<li>Of these, 1,073 made the front page for more than 60 minutes.</li>
<li>That’s a hit rate of 8.15%</li>
<li>Frontpage posts stayed at the top for an average of 483.3 minutes (8 hours)</li>
<li>30% of posts reaching the front page were posted by users who posted more than once over the two weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> In my opinion, more posts reach the front page than expected and for longer than expected.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-posts-breakdown"><a href="#types-of-posts-breakdown" aria-label="types of posts breakdown permalink"></a>Types of posts breakdown</h3>

<h3 id="hit-rate--of-different-post-types-making-the-front-page"><a href="#hit-rate--of-different-post-types-making-the-front-page" aria-label="hit rate  of different post types making the front page permalink"></a>Hit rate % of different post types making the front page</h3>

<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Interestingly, “Show HN” posts make the front page by proportion very slightly less than “Links,” which goes against previous thought that “Show HN” posts perform better due to an algorithm bias. That being said, there may well be an algorithm bias, just many “Show HN” posts are simply not worth upvoting.</p>
<h3 id="when-is-the-best-day-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020"><a href="#when-is-the-best-day-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020" aria-label="when is the best day to post to hacker news in 2020 permalink"></a>When is the best day to post to Hacker News in 2020?</h3>

<p>The chart above shows that you should post on the weekend to stand the best chance of reaching the front page of Hacker News. The difference from the worst to the best day is only 3.2%, so there’s not a lot in it.</p>
<p>The weekend likely gives you a higher chance to reach the front page because fewer posts are submitted, probably due to lower traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: If your goal is to reach the front page regardless of traffic, posting on the weekend is your best bet. However, because the difference in chance is relatively low throughout the week, posting on a more popular day might be a better risk-reward ratio based on the considerable difference in the traffic you’d likely receive.</p>
<h3 id="when-is-the-best-time-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020"><a href="#when-is-the-best-time-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020" aria-label="when is the best time to post to hacker news in 2020 permalink"></a>When is the best time to post to Hacker News in 2020?</h3>

<p>Taking a more granular look at the combined hours of all the posts submitted, the chart above highlights a much more significant difference (10.9%) between the chance of reaching the front page of Hacker News.</p>
<p>The best time to post to Hacker News is between 6 am—12 pm UTC (11 pm—5 am PDT). Again, the reason is likely because this is when the website traffic is at it’s lowest, and therefore the competition is relatively low.</p>
<p>I imagine the US is responsible for most of Hacker News’s web traffic, which lines up with the results above. Therefore, if you are posting a link for a US-specific audience to HN, it’s probably best to pick a different time like 4 pm UTC (9 am PDT), or midnight UTC (5 pm PDT).</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> If your link requires a US-specific audience, post at 4 pm UTC (9 am PDT / 12 pm EDT), or midnight UTC (5 pm PDT). Otherwise, post between 6 am—12 pm UTC (11 pm—5 am PDT) for the best chance of reaching the front page of Hacker News.</p>
<h3 id="when-in-the-best-day-and-time-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020"><a href="#when-in-the-best-day-and-time-to-post-to-hacker-news-in-2020" aria-label="when in the best day and time to post to hacker news in 2020 permalink"></a>When in the best day and time to post to Hacker News in 2020?</h3>
<p>Combining both days and hours into a total weekly picture is even more evident when it is best to post. However, please note, the lack of data makes this chart vulnerable to skewed results.</p>

<p>The chart above illustrates wild fluctuations between the different hours of the week. The lowest chance of reaching the front page is 1-2%, and the highest is 18%-27%. That’s a massive difference.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, below are generally the best days &amp; times to post to Hacker News:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday:</strong> 1 am—4 pm UTC (6 pm—9 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday &amp; Thursday:</strong> 12 am—6 am &amp; 9 am—12 pm UTC (5 pm—11 pm &amp; 2 am—5 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Friday:</strong> 5 am—12 pm UTC (10 pm—5 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Saturday:</strong> 4 am—9 am UTC (9 pm—2 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Sunday:</strong> 3 am—8 am &amp; 10 am—6 pm UTC (8 pm—1 am &amp; 3 am—11 am PDT)</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are the best times specifically (bear in mind these may not be the case week-in-week-out because the amount of data limits the results):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday:</strong> 12 pm UTC (5 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> 9 am UTC (2 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> 10 am UTC (3 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Thursday:</strong> 12 pm UTC (5 pm PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Friday:</strong> 8 am UTC (1 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Saturday:</strong> 9 am UTC (2 am PDT)</li>
<li><strong>Sunday:</strong> 5 am OR 1 pm (10 pm OR 6 am PDT)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> It’s pretty clear that the best times to post on Hacker News to reach the front page are usually around 6 am UTC (11 pm PDT), 9 am UTC (2 am PDT), or 12 pm UTC (5 am PDT), when the US is asleep.</p>
<p>However, given that 8 hours is the average time spent on the front page, it’s probably best to post at 12 pm UTC on Monday, Thursday, Saturday or Sunday to maximize traffic for when the US wakes up.</p>
<h3 id="how-many-votes-does-a-post-need-to-reach-the-front-page-of-hacker-news-in-2020"><a href="#how-many-votes-does-a-post-need-to-reach-the-front-page-of-hacker-news-in-2020" aria-label="how many votes does a post need to reach the front page of hacker news in 2020 permalink"></a>How many votes does a post need to reach the front page of Hacker News in 2020?</h3>
<p>5.22 is the average number of votes a post needed within an average time of 27.1 minutes to reach the front page for the first time.</p>
<p>Below is a chart of box plots to illustrate the variation of votes required over 24 hours.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this graph clearly shows every post, regardless of time, required at least three upvotes, and for 75% of posts, they never needed more than eight votes to reach the front page of Hacker News.</p>
<p>Expectedly, the range of upvotes required is lower for the first half of the day than the second half, roughly matching up to the timings above.</p>
<p>In some cases, posts required a lot more votes to reach the front page. Presumably, because either the time it took to get these votes was over more time, or there was a lot of competition.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The votes required to be seen on the front page is relatively small. For the best chance of getting on the front page, you’ll need between 4-6 votes in about 30 minutes, posting in the first half of the day (12 am—12pm UTC).</p>
<h3 id="how-much-karma-do-you-need-to-reach-the-front-page-of-hacker-news-in-2020"><a href="#how-much-karma-do-you-need-to-reach-the-front-page-of-hacker-news-in-2020" aria-label="how much karma do you need to reach the front page of hacker news in 2020 permalink"></a>How much karma do you need to reach the front page of Hacker News in 2020?</h3>
<p>Finally, I thought it would be interesting to see the relationship between karma and reaching the front page of Hacker News.</p>
<p>This first pie chart demonstrates the proportion of posts being posted by users with varying levels of karma.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, over 50% of posts are submitted by users with over 1,000 karma points. However, the largest single segment is by users with little to no karma.</p>

<p>The chart above shows that newer users (0-50 karma) make the front page proportionally less than more experienced users. Interestingly, really experienced users (over 10,000 karma) reached the front page significantly more than experienced users.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> It’s hard to say whether karma has anything to do with rankings. Likely, users with more karma are just better at posting content that resonates with the Hacker News audience.</p></div></div>]]>
