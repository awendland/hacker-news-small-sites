<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a
language unlike most others. It’s not functional <em>or</em> object oriented, it doesn’t
have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>



<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>

<pre><code>123 456 +
</code></pre>



<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>

<pre><code>5 2 + 10 *
</code></pre>



<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 dup
</code></pre>



<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 drop
</code></pre>

<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 swap
</code></pre>

<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 over
</code></pre>

<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 rot
</code></pre>

<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>

<pre><code>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . .
</code></pre>



<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="section"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 = .
5 5 = .
</code></pre>

<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; .
3 4 &gt; .
</code></pre>

<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using …</p></section></div>

<p><em>Guest post originally published on <a href="https://elastisys.com/top-5-cloud-to-cloud-migration-woes-and-how-to-solve-them/">Elastisys’s blog</a> by Lars Larsson, Senior Cloud Architect and Branch Manager</em> at <em>Elastisys</em></p>



<p>All companies that use cloud services do so for a reason. But those reasons may change. Whether motivated by the need for a multi-cloud strategy, expenditure minimization, legislative or regulatory demands, or simply to get closer to end users, many organizations find themselves migrating from one cloud to another. Cloud-to-cloud migration for a non-trivial application contains a lot of unknown unknowns. This causes stress and uncertainty for a CTO. To help shed some light based on years of experience in the field, we have asked senior cloud architect Lars Larsson at Elastisys, to list some of these issues.</p>



<h2>Executive summary</h2>



<ul><li>Cloud providers offer a wide range of services, each with their own associated costs. Make sure to fully understand the situation as you make your calculations.</li><li>Providers tend to lock in customers via well-integrated services. These may make migration more difficult.</li><li>Make clear inventory of features and functionality your application requires of a managed service. These may or may not match what other cloud providers offer.</li><li>Also make an inventory of the tools and services supporting your organizational processes.</li><li>Take all these inventories into account to calculate your total cost of ownership for any cloud-to-cloud migration.</li><li>Use cloud native technologies to decouple your application and organization from the services offered by a particular cloud provider. This makes migration easier in the future.</li></ul>



<h2>1. Pricing models vary wildly</h2>



<p>Most companies have been hit by that one cloud bill that surprised them. Some services or features wound up costing far more than originally anticipated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you considering a cloud-to-cloud migration to reduce operational costs? If so, please take a long and hard look at the various costs in each of the clouds. Because each service has a different cost model, making it very difficult to compare accurately. You really need to get to the bottom of it.</p>



<p>Compute and storage costs are often easy enough to compare, because those are the most obvious two. But what about other services? How much are you spending on, e.g., log handling or monitoring? Good services such as AWS CloudWatch come at a cost, especially if you use it for log handling too (AWS CloudWatch Logs). Are you heavily using a managed database service? A queueing or pub/sub service?</p>



<p>Avoid feeling like that one time the surprise cloud bill hit you in the face by doing your homework this time. You are wiser from the experience, after all.</p>



<p>Network transfers in and out of the cloud can also vary by quite a large amount. The three major providers will give you incoming network traffic for free, but charge you for the outgoing traffic. Smaller, regional, cloud providers will often have higher compute and storage costs, but not charge you for network traffic. Or include a much larger amount of it in a free tier offering.</p>



<p>Overwhelming? I get it. It sure looks that way at first glance! But it doesn’t have to be. My trick is to look at your past few detailed billing statements, and map those costs to your new cloud provider options.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Deeply take all aspects of your current cloud billing into account. Find the differences between offerings, and make a more informed decision.</em></li></ul>



<h2>2. Cloud vendor-specific integrations</h2>



<p>Tell me, did you adopt Kubernetes to make yourself less dependent on cloud providers? Reduce vendor lock-in? Are you now surprised at finding out that you are still locked in, but on a different level?</p>



<p>What I’ve seen is that most organizations will make sure they have highly portable application definitions. By relying on Kubernetes, the application definitions work across cloud providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I’ve also seen is that if you are using a managed Kubernetes service, your users and permissions handling is perhaps tied not to Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) features, but rather, to cloud-specific offerings. Like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Great service, but ties you to the AWS platform.</p>



<p>Fully-managed Kubernetes services, if offered by cloud vendors themselves, serve to offer a highly integrated experience. The cost of that integration is that migration to another cloud provider becomes just that certain amount more difficult.</p>



<p>As a community, we’ve tried to fix this. But as a community of engineers, those fixes are technical. Kubernetes dictates standards for certain components or aspects. Networking has to work according to the Container Network Interface (CNI) standard. Storage according to Container Storage Interface (CSI). And so on. Great. But the business people have put in much more clever ways of locking you to the platform. This means that other less obvious aspects are more difficult to freely migrate from one cloud to another.</p>



<p>So what is the option? Do you have to manage Kubernetes yourself? No. Of course not. But it may make sense to investigate managed Kubernetes offerings that are not tied to a particular cloud provider to reduce the risk of vendor lock-in. Without having to take on the task of day-to-day operations on your own, of course.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Investigate the ways in which cloud providers make migration more difficult due to incompatible integrations. Choose third-party vendors that are not tied to any particular cloud provider, and can offer their services on top of other cloud providers if need be.</em></li></ul>



<h2>3. The devil is in the (technical) details</h2>



<p>Almost all organizations I’ve talked to say the same thing. They went to the cloud because they wanted to get infrastructure or platform functionality on an as-a-Service basis. That is the whole point of the cloud, is it not?</p>



<p>So, of course, all cloud providers will offer certain services. It used to be just infrastructure as a service (virtual machines, network, and storage) but we are starting to also take, e.g., object storage and queuing services for granted. Many such services will claim to offer an “S3 compatible API” or similar. And that is a great starting point! But beware, because what does such a compatibility claim really mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS S3, for example, was, until December 2020, merely eventually consistent. Since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/12/aws-s3-strong-consistency/">their announcement</a>, it is read-after-write consistent (strong consistency). Which level of consistency would a service that is “S3 compatible” have? The old one? Or the new one? And do you have aspects of your applications that depend on that answer being one or the other? Would you know off-hand?</p>



<p>If you don’t, by the way, you’re in excellent company. Most people’s eyes gloss over when consistency guarantees are discussed. But then again, you don’t want to get bitten by a bug caused by wrongful assumptions, so somebody has to stay awake to figure this stuff out. Hopefully not past midnight!</p>



<p>Ready for another unexciting example? Queuing services, such as AWS SQS, offer certain delivery guarantees. SQS standard queues offer “at least once” guarantees. That means that a message can be delivered to your application more than once, and must have logic in place for dealing with duplicates. An application that is not prepared for this will start showing strange behavior. Especially under heavy load, because that is when the risk for multiple deliveries is higher. This is because high load means there is less time to do housekeeping for the queuing service. (Note that while SQS offers FIFO queues that have “exactly once”&nbsp;<strong>processing</strong>&nbsp;guarantees, however, that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/sqs-fifo-queues-message-ordering-and-exactly-once-processing-guaranteed">does not imply exactly once delivery</a>.) So confusing for an application that was coded with assumptions of RabbitMQ’s “at most once” delivery guarantees!</p>

<p>The point I am making here is that you must make an inventory of all the cloud services you use, and what features in these are key to your applications working the way they are intended. Because&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;use case is the one that matters.</p>



<p>Cloud providers offer services that make certain trade-offs to ensure the scalability and availability&nbsp;<em>of their service</em>. From the perspective of individual customers and applications, the ideal trade-off choice might have been different. If you use a software such as RabbitMQ, you can configure it perfectly for your use case and requirements. Not the ones of the cloud providers. There are companies that offer managed services in a cloud-agnostic way. Especially on top of Kubernetes, which deserve your consideration.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Make a clear inventory of all cloud services you use, along with the required features of each for your use case. To make a cloud-to-cloud migration easier, start depending on software not tied to any particular provider.</em></li></ul>



<h2>4. Tools supporting your processes (may) change</h2>



<p>Industry wisdom and rule of thumb says that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.econnectivity.se/app-maintenance-cost-can-be-three-times-higher-than-development-cost/">about 70% of software costs</a>&nbsp;are in maintenance. Not development. Just keeping the thing running as intended. How do you address that? My take on it is to rely on smart tools and automation as much as possible. The less your staff has to work on rote menial tasks, the better. Everything they do is a process. So let’s talk about those processes.</p>



<p>Operating your mission-critical cloud application? A bunch of processes. And most, if not all, of these are supported by tools. Continuous integration and deployment, monitoring, notifications and alerting. These are the tools your operations staff is using to analyze and optimize your application deployment.</p>



<p>Great tools like AWS CloudWatch offer insight into monitoring, logging (CloudWatch Logs), and containerized workloads (CloudWatch Container Insights). Your team probably depends on them. But they are specific to a particular cloud vendor.</p>

</p>


<h2><span id="Kill_the_alarm_clock.21">Kill the alarm clock!</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_epidemic">Alarm clock epidemic</span></h3>
<p>Few upwardly mobile people in the modern rat-race society can live without an alarm clock. With a shot of strong coffee and round-the-clock stress, most people learn to live and survive with an alarm clock. Half of the population wakes up with an alarm, 9% are woken by a partner, 4% by pets, 3% by children, etc. That leaves a minority that wake up naturally. Increasingly, time becomes the most precious commodity in society where achievement is often associated with speed and perfect time-management. However, alarm clocks introduce harmful side effects: stress, sleep debt, and worst of all, disruption of the natural physiological sleep function. At worst, those factors will result in physical damage to the brain (e.g. such sensitive structures as the hippocampus, your memory switchboard, may literally <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!" title="If you do not sleep, you die!">lose neurons as a result of disrupted sleep</a>).
</p><p>The art of time-management makes it possible to live at a high speed with an alarm clock at your side, and still be free from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Stress" title="Factors that affect sleep">stress</a>. However, the societal damage inflicted by alarm clocks and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> is unforgivable. An alarm clock that interrupts your sleep damages your memories, your ability to learn, your creativity, your mood and temper, your relationships with other people, your ability to focus, and your overall intellectual performance!
</p><p>Dr Robert Stickgold has shown that people who learn a skill during the day do not show significant improvement until they get 7-8 hours of good sleep<sup id="cite_ref-stickgold-2005_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-stickgold-2005-1">[1]</a></sup>. There was a noticeable correlation between the degree of improvement and the quality of sleep received. My own work with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_habits#SleepChart_in_SuperMemo" title="Sleep habits">SleepChart</a> also shows that the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Alarm_clock_vs._learning" title="Sleep and learning">use of alarm clocks can dramatically reduce memory recall and consolidation</a>. Forgetting is so painless that we rarely notice its effects. In a natural way, forgetting will proceed even if you get as much sleep as you need, and it is difficult to point to specific memories lost as a result of not sleeping enough. Moreover, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">sleep deprivation may leave your memories intact while their storage will be sub-optimum</a>. The difference may be impossible to spot without measurement. We are more likely to notice sleepiness, reduced mental agility, or bad mood.
</p><p>Disrespect for sleep has reached biblical proportions. This is most noticeable in the US and other highly industrialized nations. <i>Men's Health's</i> Dan Vergano writing for <i>ABC News</i> in <i>"No More Rude Awakenings"</i> suggests a seven-day system for fighting sleepiness: <i>"The secret is to fuel that arousal system so it can <b>beat the pants off the sleep system</b>. By creating the kind of feel-good expectations that trigger hormones to wake the brain, you’ll override the need to sleep and be able to jump out of bed like a man on fire"</i>. The article suggests a "fresh" mind method that capitalizes on the fact that stress hormones help keep you alert. However, the only rational remedy for <i>"rude awakenings"</i> is simple: get enough sleep! Jumping <i>like a man on fire</i> is not likely to have a positive effect on your creative potential!
</p><p>You may often notice that waking up with an alarm clock gives you a jumpstart for the day. You may then come to believe that using the alarm clock might help you stay alert later in the day. This is not the case. The alarm signal simply scares your brain into wakefulness, disrupting the carefully planned process of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">neural optimization</a> that occurs in sleep. As a result, you get an immediate injection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline">adrenaline</a> and your levels of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTH">ACTH</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol">cortisol</a> also increase. This is cortisol that peaks at awakening in natural sleeping rhythm that provides you with the fresh-mind impression. With passing time, this cheaply gained alertness will wear thin unless you continue abusing your physiology with more "remedies". You may use more scare tactics for keeping yourself alert, abuse caffeine, or even get a more profound effect with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil">modafinil</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine">cocaine</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamines">amphetamines</a>. Alertness should be achieved with the help of sufficient sleep, not despite the lack of sleep! Apart from your reduced ability to learn new things, all unnatural anti-drowsiness methods will produce a great deal of side effects that can be pretty damaging to your health in the long run.
</p><p>All efforts to overcome sleepiness by means other than sleep itself can be likened to a chase of the first high in the use of psychoactive substances. If you drink buckets of coffee, do pushups, pour cold water over your head, or slap your face, you only dip into the last reserves of your alertness hormones that only worsen the effects of deprivation after the effects of the stimulation wear off, which is usually a matter of minutes. Rarely can you get a boost lasting more than an hour, and the more you perk up, the lower you fall in the aftermath.
</p>
<h3><span id="Insomnia_trap">Insomnia trap</span></h3>
<p>If your life without an alarm clock may seem like an impossibility, you will probably need to use all methods in the book to be sure you get enough sleep and minimize the damage. If you need to wake up early at the cost of your brain, avoid the <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia trap</a></b>! Insomnia trap is a vicious circle of:
</p>
<ol><li> going to sleep too early to get more sleep,</li>
<li> failing to fall asleep in time (or worse, waking up prematurely),</li>
<li> feeling even more tired on the next day, and</li>
<li> going to sleep even earlier on the next day to catch up with the lost sleep.</li></ol>
<p>It is better to go to sleep at a natural hour (i.e. a bit later), wake up early, suffer a degree of sleep deprivation, and hope for a phase reset that will make it possible to continue on the <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/">designer schedule</a>. For a solution to the insomnia trap see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia" title="Curing DSPS and insomnia">Curing DSPS and insomnia</a>.
</p><p>If you cannot reset your phase and still feel tired when getting up early on a regular basis, consider choosing a job that is acceptable for your body, not the other way around. Your long-term health and well-being is at stake. If you absolutely cannot live without an alarm clock, you can at least start from changing your mindset about the importance of sleep and ensure you do not impose wrong habits on your children. Perhaps the young ones will be lucky enough to work in a flex-time system that will make it possible to get sufficient amount of undisturbed sleep. At least, do not set a bad example!
</p>
<h3><span id="Wake_up_the_President">Wake up the President</span></h3>
<p>President Bill Clinton was woken up twice by telephone during the night of April 22, 2000 before the infamous I.N.S. raid on the home of Miami relatives of the young Cuban exile Elian Gonzales. He was probably the most often disrupted and sleep deprived president in history. Only after a heart surgery did Clinton take diet, sleep and (real) exercise seriously. Those interrupted nights would definitely influence his performance and the quality of his decisions! Has anybody thought of a rule: <i>Do not wake up the president?</i> A rule that could only be revoked in a true national emergency? President G. W. Bush (b. 1946) was woken up when an American spy plane landed in China in 2001. He was also woken up after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem in 2002. George H. W. Bush (b. 1924) and Hilary Clinton made "waking up in the middle of the night" part of their presidential campaign and prowess. It seems that only Ronald Reagan had pretty strong rules for protecting his own sleep. He also famously napped during some cabinet meetings. He slept through a couple of international events without an apparent negative impact on his somewhat delayed decision-making. Critics would say he slept through the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">Iran-Contra affair</a>. Was Reagan so protective of sleep because he understood the role of sleep better, or perhaps he was just a bit lazier than other presidents? I don't know. However, he sure set a good example.
</p>
<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_monsters">Alarm clock monsters</span></h3>
<p>Andrea K. wrote to me with skepticism: 
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Take the alarm clock away from a typical person and they won't just wake up on their own at their desired time and they will miss work, school, or whatever. An alarm clock can't be that bad for you because of the simple fact that most people use it and I never noticed any problem with them&nbsp;:) Everyone in my family has been using one since they were children, and no one suddenly went crazy or began to mutate into a monster (yet)!"</i></p></blockquote> 
<p>When you use an alarm early in the morning in order to get to work or to school, you cut off the later stages of sleep. If the intrusion into natural sleep is not large (e.g. from minutes to an hour), the damage may be limited and hard to notice. Alarm clock will do far more damage if it cuts deep into the middle of the night sleep. You can compare the use of alarm clocks to smoking or eating hot dogs. The harm is not great enough to be instantly noticeable. It took the public many years to largely accept that "smoking is bad" or "fast food is bad". It is hard to quantify the degree of damage. However, as we move to knowledge society where our intellectual performance becomes increasingly important, the effects of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> will come under closer scrutiny and alarm clocks are bound to gradually fall out of favor. Unlike hot dogs, they are already universally hated by their users. Most people are able to somewhat adapt their sleep to their schedules if their routines are regular enough. When those people need to resort to the use of the alarm clock, they cut less of their sleep and the damage is proportionally smaller. Nevertheless, we should always strive at eliminating alarm clocks altogether. Most of all, we should protect our kids from suffering interrupted sleep!

We want it to be the height of the viewport and the margin centers our content. We have set the overflow to hidden as we will be doing some positioning later on and this will hide some of the overflowing elements.</p><p>main-grid</p><p>Looking at the poster we could go for a flexbox layout and use a direction of column, stacking all the elements vertically. That would be a viable solution, but to have a little more control over the size of each column and its placement we can instead use the grid. We are setting an explicit height on the top section and the title section then saying the rest (which is made up of the circles) should take up the rest of the available space, or 1 fractional unit.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.main-grid</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>50</span><span>px</span><span> </span><span>200</span><span>px</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>fr</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>info-section</p><p>The top section of the poster, with the two paragraphs of text will also utilize the grid. Flexbox would indeed be a good solution here, we could have used <code>justify-content: space-between</code> and then a padding on the horizontal of each text section to push them to the edges of the pages but with some padding from the actual edge. In keeping with using grid however, we can use a nifty feature of the <code>auto</code>cloumn size to set a defined width on the elements on the edges but an auto size in between, pushing the outer elements apart. The left and right section of text use flexbox with a direction of column.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.info-section</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-row</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span> auto </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>  p</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.8</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.section-left</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.section-right</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>title-section</p><p>We are on a roll with grid! Let's use another one. Here we will be defining the width of each text section whilst also setting the rows height to that of the given second section in the <code>main-grid</code> class. The subtitle, that is, the text on the right which is split into three rows, was a little more fiddly to get right. Our final result is ok but it's not 100% accurate.</p><p>Due to the size of the title text on the left we use a cheeky <code>margin-top</code> to push the three rows down a tad, this gives our eyes the impression that these three rows are centered to the big text on the left. That's not actually true due to the dots on the <code>i</code> raising the height of the title text.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.title-section</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-row</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>400</span><span>px</span><span> auto </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>200</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>align-items</span><span>:</span><span> center</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>%</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.title</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-weight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>500</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>letter-spacing</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.subtitle</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>color</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--white-color</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.3</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-weight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>justify-content</span><span>:</span><span> space-evenly</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>150</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>margin-top</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>circles-grid</p><p>Our final class is the most "complicated". If we take a look at the original poster we can count how many circles we see, it's an 11x11 grid. The <code>repeat()</code> function allows us to set a repeating pattern of sizes in one short statement. For the columns we are saying that there should be 11 columns, each taking up the available space until they reach each end of the parent container. We do the same for the rows except that we explicitly state the height of the rows so that the child elements sizing more closely resemble that of the original poster.</p><p>Remember we set the <code>overflow: hidden</code> on the <code>outer-cointainer</code>? Here we can see why. When looking at the original poster we can see the circles on the horizontal edges are cut off, they are semi-circles. Now, rather than creating some special semi-circle shapes we set the width of this section (this grid) to be slightly larger than the parent container, and by hiding the overflow we give the illusion that the circles are semi-circles contained within our bounderies.</p><p>We use another little trick with the before pseudo element to give the illusion that the top of the grid is cut off and thus the circles look like semi-circles. The pseudo element here is creating a 20px high block which has the same colour as the poster. It's got an absolute position and lays on top of the <code>circles-grid</code>.</p><p>The nested <code>circle</code> class is the base circle that will be used to generate a circle dynamically using JavaScript. The <code>white-circle</code> will be used as an override to colour the white circles on the poster.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.circles-grid</span><span>

<p>I get the temptation to make standup asynchronous. “Stop forcing a daily meeting on everyone! Take back those <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/14/parkinsons-law-and-friends/">15 minutes</a>!” It sounds great, and I’m usually a fan of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">writing as a way to collaborate</a>. </p>



<p>But <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/02/09/say-things-that-can-be-wrong/">asynchronous standups are not standups</a>. They’re a way for teams to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/24/declare-bankruptcy-and-dont-be-ashamed-of-it/">kill standups</a> without feeling guilty about it. </p>



<p>Why? Two reasons:</p>



<p><strong>Reason 1: Standups are not status updates. </strong>I like Scrum’s definition of a standup, even for teams not doing Scrum:</p>



<blockquote><p>The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.</p><cite><a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum">Scrum Guide</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>See that? In a good standup, you’re <strong>re-<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">planning the sprint</a> every day</strong>. That can’t happen if you rattle off a quick “last 24 I did X, next 24 I’ll do Y, no blockers” and move on with your day.</p>



<p><strong>Reason 2: <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">Nobody’s reading</a> all those updates.</strong> At best, the manager reads them and one or two other people skim them. That’s not collaboration. That’s reporting up the chain, which is not what standups are for.</p>



<p>If your <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">standups are so useless</a> that you don’t miss anything by taking it to Slack, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/17/zombie-standups-try-walking-the-board/">try fixing them</a> instead of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">giving up</a>. </p>

				<p>Imagine you are handed this device and asked to get root on it as quickly as possible. No further information is given. Where would you begin? &nbsp;<em>(If you just want to see the router get rooted, jump down to "Mounting an Attack: Rooting a Home Router" ;-)</em></p>    <p><em>Our target: A <strong>VERY</strong> common/popular consumer Access Point.</em></p>  <p>Since you have the device in your hands, you might try directly attacking the hardware. However, if you've never done any kind of hardware hacking, getting started can be intimidating. In this post, we are going to talk about the fundamental information you need to know to use JTAG for hacking hardware. We'll also go over a quick example to illustrate the power of direct hardware access. ​</p>  <h2><u><span size="5" color="#3f3f3f"><strong>Why Do Manufacturers Use JTAG?</strong></span></u></h2>  <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/boundary-scan-history_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/boundary-scan-history.png?241" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><p>​JTAG is a common hardware interface that provides your computer with a way to communicate directly with the chips on a board. It was originally developed by a consortium, the Joint (European) Test Access Group, in the mid-80s to address the increasing difficulty of testing printed circuit boards (PCBs). JTAG&nbsp;has been in widespread use ever since it was included in the Intel 80486 processor in 1990 and codified as IEEE 1491 that same year.&nbsp;Today JTAG is used for debugging, programming and testing on virtually ALL embedded devices.&nbsp;<br></p> <hr>    <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/dfx-dft-ictdi-img01_orig.gif" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/dfx-dft-ictdi-img01.gif?264" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><p><strong>Boundary Scanning</strong><br>With the invention of integrated circuits came the need to test physical interconnects. That is: test whether "Point A" on a circuit board correctly connects to "Point C". As industry drove toward higher density interconnects and finer pitch (i.e. smaller) components, a standardized way of testing integrated circuits (or "chips") was needed. By embedding the test logic within the IC itself and limiting the physical interface to just a few signals, JTAG/boundary-scan presented an elegant solution to testing, debugging, and diagnosing modern electronic systems.&nbsp;Simply stated, boundary Scanning allows you to read and write individual bits, on individual pins, of the individual chips on a board. This ability to read and write 1's and 0's directly onto the pins is extremely powerful, but widely misunderstood.&nbsp;</p> <hr>  <div><div><div> 	<table> 		<tbody> 			<tr> 				<td> 					 						  <p>​The JTAG interface gives manufacturers a way to test the physical connections between pins on a chip. When electrical engineers talk about using JTAG to "debug" a chip, they are talking about something very different than traditional software debugging. They are talking about making sure pin A on chip A is physically connected to pin B on chip B, and that all those pins are functioning correctly. Since JTAG gives you direct hardware access to a device, it's also a fantastic tool for security research.</p>   					 				</td>				<td> 					 						  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/connectiontest_orig.gif" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/connectiontest.gif?158" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </div></div></div>  <h2><u><span size="5" color="#3f3f3f"><span><strong>JTAG Fundamentals</strong></span></span></u></h2>  <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/654px-jtag-chain-svg_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/654px-jtag-chain-svg.png" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><div><p>Before we go into using JTAG to actually hack something, let's review the JTAG fundamentals.</p><p><strong>4 Pins, Plus 1</strong><br>The official JTAG standard requires 4 standard pins (or signals), and defines an optional 5th. These signals, and the small bit of silicon logic that connects and controls them, are collectively referred to as the Test Access Port, or TAP controller.</p></div> <hr>  <p><strong>The JTAG "Tower of Babel"</strong></p>  <div><p>One of the most confusing thing about learning to get hands-on with JTAG is how much partial and disinformation there is about it. Manufacturers' websites tell you the "theory" of how it works, but leave you longing for more information about "how to get started". To further confuse things there are other factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Buzzword</strong>:&nbsp;It is a infosec buzzword, everyone talks about it but few really share actionable info</li><li><strong>Loaded Word: </strong>JTAG has come to mean many things to many people. For example,&nbsp;in the gamer community "JTAG" means a hardware modification&nbsp;for a console that allows playing pirated games or loading homebrew content (i.e. "a <a href="http://hackaday.com/2009/10/20/freeboot-gives-the-xbox-360-jtag-hack-new-life/" target="_blank">jtagged&nbsp;XBox</a>"). This makes it difficult to search for useful information.</li><li><strong>Vernacular Overlap:</strong> As mentioned above, when an Electrical Engineer says "debug" he means: <em>"Are the pins in the right place?&nbsp;Is there enough power?&nbsp;Is the logic of the circuit correct?"</em> When a Software Engineer says "debug" he thinks of GDB or WinDBG. JTAG is designed for the former, not the latter.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Misunderstanding: </strong>As software developers the closest similarity&nbsp;to JTAG is maybe Kernel debugging via a debug cable (USB, Parallel, or Serial). But this is a dangerous comparison, because even on the "debugee" (in that scenario) there is software code executing on the remote system&nbsp;handling the translation of commands arriving on the debug cable. The JTAG state machine implemented&nbsp;entirely in hardware on the target.</li></ul></div>  <p><strong>What JTAG <u>ISN'T!</u></strong></p>  <div><p>In an effort to dispel disinformation (which is so rampant) here is what JTAG isn't.</p><ul><li><strong>The name of a specific device</strong> for debugging firmware or hardware</li><li><strong>The name of a piece of software</strong> used for debugging software code running on an embedded device.</li><li><strong>The name of a protocol:&nbsp;</strong>The JTAG specification doesnt even define the protocol for how data is passed between debugger and debugee (i.e. there is no .h file you can reference defining a "JTAG packet" to be passed over a serial, parallel, or USB cable to a target)</li><li><strong>The name of a kind of connector: </strong>Unlike a specification like USB or Ethernet, the&nbsp;JTAG specification doesn't even define what connectors should look like. This&nbsp;leads to a VERY confusing diversity of "JTAG" connectors. This is often a huge source of confusion&nbsp;to a software person. Imagine if every USB cable was different!</li></ul></div>  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-21-am_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-21-am_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>All of the connectors above can be referred to as "JTAG" connectors. </p> </div></div>  <div><div><div> 	<table> 		<tbody> 			<tr> 				<td> 					 						  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-1-33-15-am_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-1-33-15-am.png?329" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>JTAG connector for a DD WRT router</p> </div></div>   					 				</td>				<td> 					 						  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-1-33-08-am_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>JTAG connector for a Point-Of-Sale device</p> </div></div>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </div></div></div>  <p>All of the connectors above are "JTAG" connectors.

In it's most fundamental. The JTAG specification 1149.1 requires these five signals:</p><ul><li><u><strong><span size="5">TCK</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>C</strong>loc<strong>k</strong><ul><li>The drummer, or metronome that dictates the speed of the TAP controller. Voltage on this pin simply pulses up and down in a rhythmic, steady beat. On every “beat” of the clock, the TAP controller takes a single action. The actual clock speed is not specified in the JTAG standard. The TAP controller accepts its speed from the outside device controlling JTAG.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><u><strong><span size="5">TMS</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>M</strong>ode <strong>S</strong>elect<ul><li>Voltages on the Mode Select pin control what action JTAG takes. By manipulating the voltage on this pin, you tell JTAG what you want it to do.</li></ul></li><li><u><strong><span size="5">TDI</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>D</strong>ata-<strong>I</strong>n<ul><li>The pin that feeds data into the chip. The JTAG standard does not define protocols for communication over this pin. That is left up to the manufacturer. As far as JTAG is concerned, this pin is simply an ingress method for 1s and 0s to get into the chip. What the chip does with them is irrelevant to JTAG.</li></ul></li><li><u><strong><span size="5">TDO</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>D</strong>ata-<strong>O</strong>ut<ul><li>The pin for data coming out of the chip. Like the Data-In pin, communication protocols are not defined by JTAG.</li></ul></li><li><u><strong><span size="5">TRST</span></strong></u>: &nbsp;<strong>T</strong>est <strong>R</strong>e<strong>s</strong>e<strong>t&nbsp;</strong><span>(Optional)</span><ul><li>This optional signal is used to reset JTAG to a known good state, we'll explain why this is optional in a few paragraphs.</li></ul></li></ul></div>  <p>Now that we know what pins/signals are really defined as "JTAG" let's take a second look at the sample of connectors from above:</p>  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-26-am_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-26-am_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>Ah hah! We now see that each of these connectors have JTAG related signals!</p> </div></div>  <p><span>We now see that what <strong>makes these connectors "JTAG" is not their pin configurations,</strong> but rather the mere presence of these JTAG signals. It is with these signals that we can manipulate and communicate with the State Machine of a target device via it's "Test Access Port" (or TAP) controller embedded in its silicon.</span></p>  <blockquote>...the JTAG State Machine is so simple that you can <a href="http://hackaday.com/2013/08/31/learn-jtag-by-writing-a-bit-banging-programmer/" target="_blank">write Arduino code to "bit-bang" interface with it...</a></blockquote>  <p>​<strong>The JTAG State Machine</strong><br>The JTAG specification IEEE 1149.1 specifies not only the signals but how the "State Machine" embedded in the TAP Controller of a device must behave. The State controller diagram is in the upper left of the video below. By manipulating the voltage on the TMS pin of the TAP controller and the TCK pin, you control the way the State Machine changes state. On each beat of the clock, the JTAG TAP controller in your targeted device checks if there is voltage on the TMS pin, and interprets that as either a 1 (voltage) or a 0 (no voltage). This series of 1’s and 0’s moves JTAG through a relatively simple State Machine. This state machine is so simple that you can <a href="http://hackaday.com/2013/08/31/learn-jtag-by-writing-a-bit-banging-programmer/" target="_blank">even write Arduino code to manipulate it</a>. The value of the TMS pin needed to change state is denoted with a tiny "1" or "0" in the state machine diagram. You can see the operation of the state machine in the animation below</p>    <p><em><span size="2">The JTAG State Machine in operation. (A very simplified representation.)

Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer’s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers’ heads. It’s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack “code browsers” that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we’ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
In simple cases, some constructs manifest as naming conventions: prefixes in a name may be a rudimentary way to namespace classes<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, while suffixes may be a rudimentary way to group classes or identify their type<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>. But these are easy examples; many patterns are much more subtle.</p>
<h2>
“Where is this used?”</h2>
<p>
Imagine figuring out “where is this used?”, for various types of “this”:</p>
<p>
Most code editors (perhaps paired with a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a>) can show you where local variables are used. This usually also works for finding where methods are invoked — although perhaps less reliably in dynamic-dispatch languages, or languages without types.</p>
<p>
What if you want to find where instances of a particular model get created? There may be multiple ways to create a model, so this isn’t super simple. In Rails, for example, there’s two built-in ways to create a model: you can either call <code>.new</code> to create a new instance in memory followed by <code>.save</code> to persist it to the database, or call <code>.create</code> to automatically do both. Your particular codebase might have additional wrappers for doing this that you’re supposed to use. Even worse, imagine that sometimes you create a <code>.new</code> instance, then set some properties on it over the next few lines, then finally call <code>.save</code>. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>user = User.new
user.email = '<a href="https://feifan.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="97fff2fbfbf8d7f2eff6fae7fbf2b9f4f8fa">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>' unless self.anonymous?
user.save</code></pre>
<p>
Conceptually, that’s still code that creates an instance of a particular model. But with the intervening syntax, this would be a difficult case to find with <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h2>
Static config</h2>
<p>
At <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I work, we have a lot of code for jobs that need to run at certain times each day. For example, we might need to move funds from one financial partner to another at noon UTC each day. Each of these jobs has configuration code describing when and how it should be run, implemented as a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/">DSL</a>. This config might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>run_config RunConfig.new(
  job_name: 'partner-daily-funding',
  env_vars: self.config_env,
  cron: RunConfig::Cron.new(
    schedule: { hour: 12, minute: 0 }
  ),
  owning_team: Company::Team::Liquidity
)</code></pre>
<p>
In our codebase, we have hundreds of these jobs, each with their own <code>run_config</code>. If you look at this codebase as a database, you can imagine these jobs being rows in a <code>jobs</code> table, where the fields on each row correspond to the parameters provided to the <code>RunConfig</code> class. </p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse all these jobs in a table? Maybe you could perform some basic operations on this data: searching for specific jobs by name or owning team; sorting by the time-of-day they’re scheduled to run; filtering for jobs owned by your team that have errored in the past week. Maybe you could edit the <code>run_config</code> from that interface (like you might edit a spreadsheet) and have it automatically make the corresponding change in the source code (or open a PR). Maybe you could even compute some aggregations on this data — for example, if you’re introducing a new job that requires some expensive computation, maybe you’d like to know which hours have the fewest other jobs scheduled. And of course, this job browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each entry that shows the code for the job inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<h2>
Diffused concepts</h2>
<p>
Codebases typically contain logical concepts that are implemented across multiple pieces of code. This is often the case when you need to create multiple files to implement a particular feature.</p>
<p>
For example, in Rails, a “resource” is collectively implemented across a line in the router, a model file, a controller file, and a bunch of view files. Rails even ships with a code generator to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5f3ff60084ab5d5921ca3499814e4697f8350ee7/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/resource/USAGE">create some of these files</a> for you. But despite resources being a core concept when working with Rails, there’s no good way to browse the resources in your codebase<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a>. There’s no good way to filter or query your codebase either — you can’t, for example, see which resources support JSON vs XML params. </p>
<p>
For another example, consider pubsub (aka emitter-consumer) pipelines. In web services, when you have processing that can happen “in the background”, one service will publish an event; another service subscribes to that event and will do the background processing on its own when it receives the event. Often, these will form event “pipelines” or trees where an event consumer will emit additional events that are consumed by yet other services. These pipelines are concepts that developers talk about (as in, the “account creation pipeline” or “funding reconciliation pipeline”), but in most codebases the pipeline itself isn’t declared or reified anywhere in the code.</p>
<p>
If you’re looking at code that emits an event, how do you find the consumers? If you’re lucky, the event has a unique, literal name and the consumer uses that name literally as well. But maybe some subscribers are using wildcard event names, or names generated by string concatenation, and that becomes a lot harder to grep for. Likewise, if you’re looking at a consumer of an event, how do you find the locations in the codebase that could emit that event<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>?</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse those pipelines in a table or perhaps a directed graph<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a>? Maybe that graph would support some basic operations on this data: searching for specific publishers or subscribers by class name or event name; filtering for pipelines that have run into errors; maybe even showing the flow of a particular event given an event ID<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. And of course, this pipeline browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each graph node that shows the code for the publisher or subscriber inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<p>
For a final example, consider code that has functionality inherited from elsewhere. Some environments let you see a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-structure-of-a-source-file.html">list of inherited properties</a> or methods, but this isn’t possible for more specialized cases. At Stripe, we have code that implements shell scripts that can take command-line arguments and flags. These arguments are defined via a DSL in the implementing code, but these commands can be subclassed, and there’s no way to see what the available arguments are while working in the subclass.</p>
<h2>
Philosophy</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to consider these problems not as disparate cases in need of bespoke tooling, but as a <em>class</em> of problems characterized by a lack of access to the data structures embedded within codebases. Just like SQL databases and spreadsheets provide a singular querying abstraction and a set of visualization primitives that can be applied to any kind of data, programming environments need a singular querying abstraction and set of visualization primitives that can be applied to the concepts lurking in codebases. Getting there does <em>not</em> mean using proprietary drag-and-drop visual programming interfaces where the introspection capabilities are limited to whatever the programming environment happens to have implemented. Just the opposite — you should still be able to do whatever you want with your code (including treating it as plain-text files), <em>and also</em> have access to more advanced introspection tools that can query and slice your code — tools that let you easily understand and navigate complex codebases to reduce the <em>incidental complexity</em> of building software.</p>
<h2>
Solutions</h2>
<p>
I don’t have a solution to sell you here (at least, not yet!). But <a href="https://twitter.com/hirday_g/status/1356657607381946369">by popular demand</a> I think it’s worthwhile to at least discuss principles that solutions should embody and directionally-related prior art. </p>
<p>
To start with a simple example, see <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a>, a full-stack web framework similar to Rails. It comes with a web interface for manipulating your project’s codebase and database schema. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbDtS_mUMpI?t=102">One point in the introduction video</a> showed changes being made in the visual schema editor being automatically reflected in the SQL code that describes the database schema — and changes being made to the SQL code being bidirectionally reflected in the visual schema editor. </p>
<p>
For a more in-depth example, consider <a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>, a Smalltalk environment. “Environment” in this case means that it feels like you’re using a custom OS (including global menus, idioms, and keyboard and mouse conventions) designed specifically for browsing, writing, and debugging programs in the Smalltalk programming language<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a>. The holistic integration of these tools is important. Unlike the programming environments we cobble for ourselves today — where the editor is agnostic of the language and runtime and other tools like debuggers, inspectors, and code browsers are tacked on (if they exist at all) — it’s worth thinking about what an entire computing experience <em>for</em> writing and building custom tools might look like<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>
Pharo is also interesting because of its Class Browser, which looks like this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://files.tanagram.app/file/tanagram-data/prod-feifans-blog/database-codebase-pharo-browser.png" alt="Pharo class browser">
</p>
<p>
This browser breaks free from the source code <em>file</em> as the atomic unit of browsing; instead, it allows the user to browse one method at a time. Making the “unit of browsing” …</p></article></div></div></div>

<p>In late 2020, a coalition of predatory, money-losing, private-equity backed companies ran a $200m disinformation campaign that resulted in the passage of California's Prop 22, legalizing worker misclassification and mass-scale labor law violations.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#prop-22">https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#prop-22</a></p>
<p>Almost immediately, the passage of Prop 22 led to the loss of unionized jobs paying a living wage and offering basic worker protections, especially for people of color – only to have them replaced by "gig work" that lacked any of the above.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/05/manorialism-feudalism-cycle/#prop22</a></p>
<p>One of the primary funders – and beneficiaries – of Prop 22 was Uber, which pioneered worker misclassification. Uber is now pushing the EU to "harmonize" its regulations in a game of transatlantic pingpong where each volley makes things worse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/uber-proposes-california-style-gig-work-reforms-in-europe.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/uber-proposes-california-style-gig-work-reforms-in-europe.html</a></p>
<p>The irony? Uber is a "bezzle" – JK Galbraith's name for "the magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it." Uber is a scam and it will never be profitable.</p>
<p>Uber is a product of Softbank, the Saudi-backed Japanese investment fund that has $100b to spend on helping the Saudi royals find a revenue stream to replace oil. Softbank is a pioneer of accounting frauds that make stupid businesses look profitable.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/19/larval-pegasi/#long-con">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/19/larval-pegasi/#long-con</a></p>
<p>From Wework to Uber to Doordash and beyond, Softbank makes two kinds of bets: first, that they can achieve a monopoly by doing illegal or quasi-illegal things so quickly that they become faits accompli before they get shut down.</p>
<p>And second, that the companies that fail to achieve a monopoly can be unloaded on suckers ("investors") who assume that a money-losing company that has been around for a decade or more must have a path to profitability ("a pile of shit this big <em>must</em> have a pony under it!").</p>
<p>Uber will never, ever be profitable. The company admitted as much on its S1 IPO filing, where it said that profitability depended on every public transit system in the world being replaced with Uber. The company lost <em>$4b</em> in the first half of 2020,</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/10/folksy-monopolists/#bezzled">https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/10/folksy-monopolists/#bezzled</a></p>
<p>If you think the first half of 2020 was bad, you should see the second half of 2020: <em>Uber lost $6.8b more!</em> As usual, transportation analyst Hubert Horan has the absolute best context on the company's haemorrhagic losses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-four-uber-loses-another-6-8-billion.html">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-four-uber-loses-another-6-8-billion.html</a></p>
<p>He points out that things are even worse than they seem for Uber. For many years, the pony-under-all-this-shit show required that Uber spend billions on the doomed pretense that they would someday replace drivers with autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>$2.5B later, Uber's "self-driving" cars could go a whopping <em>0.25 miles</em> before crashing. They had to <em>pay</em> someone $400m to take the division off their hands. Even so, ditching the business-unit produced a gain for Uber's H2-2020 balance-sheet.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#goober">https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/08/required-reading/#goober</a></p>
<p>Now, Uber <em>did</em> experience massive growth in H2-2020, in their food delivery division. However, that growth led to massive losses for them, because every delivery loses the company money, by design (more expensive pony-under-the-pile theatrics):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza">https://pluralistic.net/2020/05/18/code-is-speech/#schadenpizza</a></p>
<p>But Uber's food delivery long con doesn't just victimize its investors: the primary harms accrue to the restaurants the company nonconsensually opts into its delivery services (with help from Google), draining them until they collapse.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/19/we-are-beautiful/#man-in-the-middle</a></p>
<p>Uber claims that it is just consuming every beloved restaurant in the world in order to attain liftoff for "ghost kitchens" – literally shipping containers stuffed with precarious chefs <em>paying</em> to cook in unsafe working conditions.</p>
<p>This is what we mean when we talk about "financialization." Uber is a finance shell-game, one that can only be sustained by the destruction of all public transit, all restaurants, basic worker protections and the minimum wage.</p>
<p>And once it has taken that brutal toll on workers and the real economy, once it has fleeced the last investor lured into paying to excavate a little more of the pile of shit, it will collapse.</p>
<p>You can't lost $10b/year forever. $10b here, $10b there, pretty soon you're talking real money.</p>

<p>Ring – Amazon's surveillance doorbell division – has 4,000 "partnerships" with US police ("public safety") orgs. The company has lied about how these work for years, but the basic deal is that they give cops free stuff to buzz-market their products.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5wyjy/amazon-told-police-it-has-partnered-with-200-law-enforcement-agencies">https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5wyjy/amazon-told-police-it-has-partnered-with-200-law-enforcement-agencies</a></p>
<p>Ring tells its customers that they get to choose whether to share the footage from their street-facing cameras with cops, but that's a lie, too. If you say no, the cops still get to look through your camera.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kga3/amazon-is-coaching-cops-on-how-to-obtain-surveillance-footage-without-a-warrant">https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kga3/amazon-is-coaching-cops-on-how-to-obtain-surveillance-footage-without-a-warrant</a></p>
<p>That's why cops debase themselves to serve as buzz-marketers for Ring – in exchange, they get an off-the-books, free-to-use, warrantless, city-scale, video surveillance grid.</p>
<p>It's an investment that pays off. Back in July, EFF documented how the San Francisco Police Department was able to commandeer 200 Avigilon cameras to produce surveillance data on BLM protesters:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/san-francisco-police-accessed-business-district-camera-network-spy-protestors">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/san-francisco-police-accessed-business-district-camera-network-spy-protestors</a></p>
<p>And in a new blockbuster report, EFF's Dave Maass and Matthew Guariglia document how the LAPD did the same thing, fraudulently using "unusual occurance" protocols to gain access to last summer's BLM protests.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests</a></p>
<p>Ring has a terrible track record, kicking off its marketing by sending out deceptive news-bulletins to convince people that they lived in high-crime areas and needed its products:</p>

<p>They lied about their facial recognition program:</p>

<p>A program that included a plan to make "watch lists" of people who'd be tracked from camera to camera:</p>

<p>Far from keeping its customers safe, Ring exposed them to real harm, leaking their home addresses:</p>

<p>Allowing third parties to hack their cameras, spy on them, and scream abuse at them:</p>

<p>Not just hackers, either! Multiple Ring employees got caught spying on Ring owners and their families, including their children:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3mdvk/ring-fired-employees-abusing-video-data">https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3mdvk/ring-fired-employees-abusing-video-data</a></p>
<p>As Maass and Guariglia point out, Ring made some improvements to user privacy over the past year, adding end-to-end encryption. But at the same time, Ring has cemented its relationship with American police forces, leading to far more police requests for Ring owners' footage.</p>
<p>These "requests" start to feel a lot more like coercion, and, as with other coercive law-enforcement requests, "like police 'asking' to search your phone during a traffic stop," they should be bound by strict limits.</p>
<p>EFF proposes four rules for coercive electronic searches:</p>
<p>I. Requests must be specific, targeting a particular time and place where there is reasonable suspicion that crime has happened (rather than general requests)</p>
<p>II. Police must collect and publish statistics about their consent searches of electronic devices, to deter and detect racial profiling</p>
<p>III. Police and reviewing courts must narrowly construe the scope of a person’s consent to search their device.</p>
<p>IV. Before an officer attempts to acquire footage from a person’s Ring camera, the officer must notify the person of their legal right to refuse.</p>
<p>The public-private surveillance partnership between Ring and the cops epitomizes the paradox of the American privacy debate.</p>
<p>When I talk to military, intelligence and government audiences about surveillance, they say, "Look, Uncle Sam already knows everything about me, but those scumbags in Silicon Valley would sell their mothers for a nickel."</p>
<p>And when I talk to tech audiences, they say, "Google just wants to show me better ads, big deal. But cops and spooks? They're the thickwitted sociopaths who were too stupid to get a job at a tech company. No <em>way</em> I want them spying on me."</p>
<p>But the reason companies like Ring are allowed to conduct such indiscriminate surveillance (a one mile walk in DC puts you under the gaze of 13 Ring cameras!) is that governments are wholly dependent on requisitioning their footage.</p>
<p>Rather than warning people about the dangers of Ring cameras – or agitating for ordinances banning them – cops served as street-teams marketing Ring's products. Private surveillance depends on government complicity, and spying governments depend on private surveillance.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>My personal computer was a 4 year old MacBook Pro with a permanent battery service warning, a butterfly keyboard (AKA Apple’s greatest hardware design mistake), and a high chassis temperature issue when I use the <a href="https://twitter.com/_zouhir/status/1292878918677139464">left USB-C to charge it</a>, which throttled its Intel i7 CPU and spun the fan so much that it was quite noticeable — I guess what I am trying to say here is, my personal computer was due for a replacement.</p>
<p>After weeks of research, I ended up purchasing a Mac Mini with Apple’s M1 chip and 16 GB of memory. It arrived on Dec 9th and I have been using it for about 2 months now as my daily driver and primary web development machine. In this post I will be sharing my experience migrating away from my Intel-based Mac and how I set up a clean and productive web development environment on the new Apple silicon based Macs.</p>
<p>I will start out by highlighting some of the research I did around the M1 SoC and explain a little on how Apple has managed to achieve great results emulating stronger memory models on their ARM processor, before I walk you through my web development environment setup with Homebrew, Go, Node.js, and Docker.</p>
<h2 id="researching-apple-silicon"><a href="#researching-apple-silicon">Researching Apple Silicon </a></h2><p>Apple’s “One more thing…'' event in November brought us their M1 SoC and a handful of numbers: up to 3.5x faster CPU performance, up to 6x faster graphics, up to 2x battery life, and faster than 98 percent of PC laptops.</p>
<p>Although some people were <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3596814/new-macbook-air-is-not-faster-than-98-percent-of-pc-laptops.html">skeptical about Apple’s claims</a>, there was enough third-party data soon after the announcement that confirmed Apple’s M1 chip does provide a substantial <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks#single-core">performance increase</a>.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the performance and energy efficiency of the M1 chip should have not really been that surprising. Over two years ago, the reputable tech reviews magazine Anandtech ran the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13392/the-iphone-xs-xs-max-review-unveiling-the-silicon-secrets/4">SPEC2006 industry standard benchmark on Apple’s A12 chip</a>, and we learned that the A12 chips Apple used in their iPhone XS are capable of handling desktop workloads. They were capable of outperforming a moderately-clocked Skylake CPU in single-threaded tasks while having better energy efficiency than all Android SoCs.</p>
<p>As it became quickly evident that those who bought an M1 Mac would enjoy great responsiveness and blazing fast startup times, I shifted my attention to the main concern: <strong>the ARM architecture</strong>. I wanted to understand which Intel-based executables Rosetta 2 would <em>not</em> be able to translate? And how stable and performant were Rosetta 2 translated binaries?.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-rosetta-2-behavior-and-performance"><a href="#understanding-rosetta-2-behavior-and-performance">Understanding Rosetta 2 Behavior and Performance </a></h3><p>On the surface, nothing about Rosetta 2’s behaviour is out of the ordinary. It takes <code>x86_64</code> instructions and translates them to <code>arm64</code> instructions ahead-of-time. Once the translation process is finished, the translated <code>arm64</code> code blocks are cached so the subsequent executable launches do not need to repeat this process.</p>
<p>To get some insight on how Rosetta 2 translated executables perform compared to native <code>arm64</code> ones, Anandtech ran <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/6">various SPEC benchmarks on the M1 chip in both formats</a>. The results showed that memory-intensive <code>x86_64</code> workloads translated by Rosetta 2 consistently achieved more than 90% of the native <code>arm64</code> speed and CPU-intensive workloads performed at 70-80% of its native counterparts. Overall, these results are simply outstanding. Combined with the raw power of the M1 chip, people should, in theory, barely notice any difference using translated macOS <code>x86_64</code> applications.</p>
<p>So, we now know that Rosetta 2 translated executables performance is great in general, and specifically for memory-intensive workloads, the question becomes: <em>how is this possible</em>?</p>
<h3 id="m1s-approach-to-emulating-strongly-ordered-memory-models-on-arm"><a href="#m1s-approach-to-emulating-strongly-ordered-memory-models-on-arm">M1’s Approach To Emulating Strongly Ordered Memory Models on ARM </a></h3><p>At a fundamental level, a multi-core processor requires reads and writes to memory to be communicated between its cores in a consistent manner. Each processor architecture defines the semantics of this communication as a part of its memory consistency model (often referred to as just memory model). The ARM architecture used by the M1 SoC provides <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100941/0100/">weaker memory ordering semantics</a> than the <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-sdm-volume-3a-system-programming-guide-part-1.html">x86 architecture</a> used by Intel processors. To understand the difference between the two, let’s look at the four basic types of memory reads &amp; writes orderings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write → Read: write must complete before subsequent read</li>
<li>Read → Read: read must complete before subsequent read</li>
<li>Read → Write: read must complete before subsequent write</li>
<li>Write → Write: write must complete before subsequent write</li>
</ul>
<p>Strongest memory model (known as Sequential consistency) maintains all orderings above, and ensures any change is communicated before the next instruction is run. This intuitive, sequential execution of instruction is bad for performance, and defeats the purpose of having multiple cores that can run things on parallel. Weaker consistency models allow some orderings to be violated, enabling the processors to overlap memory access with other operations. The table below captures which reoderings ARM’s “weaker” memory model and the “stronger” X86 one allow.</p>
<div>

<p>
source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_ordering#Runtime_memory_ordering" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, ARM chose to adopt a memory model that allows any of the four basic memory operations to be reordered as a way to beat sequential consistency and make a wide range of hardware optimizations possible. x86 on the other hand chose to preserve orderings for the most parts, and adopt an on-core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_buffer"><em>write buffers</em></a> as a way to beat sequential consistency and hide memory writes latency. x86’s behavior is often referred to as <em>Total Store Ordering</em> (or TSO) where write operations are placed on the local write buffer, and subsequent read instructions can be executed before that write changes are communicated.</p>
<p>When compiling binaries for ARM or x86 architectures, we are basically informing our software what are all the reorderings allowed by the target architecture that it needs to account for to ensure correctness.</p>
<p>Typically, this makes it extremely difficult to emulate x86 correctly on ARM without introducing a significant performance disadvantage caused by the ARM processor trying to explicitly guarantee the orderings x86 executables expect. While there aren’t any official details available publicly on how Apple has managed to overcome this hurdle, a plausible explanation is that it’s been solved at the hardware level, and the M1 chip is capable of switching between ARM’s memory model and the x86 TSO.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-rosettas-limitations"><a href="#what-are-rosettas-limitations">What are Rosetta’s limitations? </a></h3><p>In an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">official documentation page</a>, Apple stated that Rosetta 2 can translate most Intel-based apps, including the ones that contain just-in-time (JIT) compilers. The two exception are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kernel extensions</li>
<li>Virtual Machine apps that virtualize x86_64 computer platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Catalina is the last version of macOS that supports third-party kernel extensions. Without these, developers are now limited to the collection of APIs and frameworks that macOS officially provides and supports. In turn, this means that Mac developers’ freedom and creativity are limited with BigSur – but that’s a topic for another day.</p>
<p>The lack of support for virtual machines was a big concern. It meant I wouldn’t be able to run <code>x86_64</code> Docker because it runs virtual machines under the hood. Luckily there was a path forward, as Docker was able to shift to Apple’s new hypervisor framework and provide <code>arm64</code> binaries. Today, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/">Docker supports M1 chips natively</a>.</p>
<h3 id="decision-day"><a href="#decision-day">Decision Day </a></h3><p>Fascinated and feeling good about the M1’s performance and Rosetta 2 efficiency, I decided it was safe to buy a M1 Mac Mini and give it my own series of real-world tests. And I figured that if it did not meet my expectations or needs, I could take advantage of Apple’s return policy, or hang onto it as a secondary computer or as a media server. (Spoiler: It’s neither!)</p>
<h2 id="installing-rosetta-2"><a href="#installing-rosetta-2">Installing Rosetta 2 </a></h2><p>To make the process of setting up a new Mac less cumbersome and repetitive, I -like many others- have a shell script to configure new installations of macOS, copy my dotfiles and install some of the necessary tools via Homebrew.</p>
<p>If this “setup my new macOS” shell script is being executed on an Apple silicon based Mac, one of the first things we need to do is to check for an existing installation of Rosetta 2, and if one was not found, we should go ahead and install it.</p>
<h3 id="detecting-the-processors-architecture"><a href="#detecting-the-processors-architecture">Detecting the processor’s architecture </a></h3><p>We can use the <code>uname</code> utility to get details about the processor’s architecture (e.g. arm, i386, i686, arm, etc), the machine’s hardware class (e.g. arm64, x86_64, etc) as well as various other characteristics of our system.</p>

Lately I have been getting several emails and there have been postings around the web about the quality / coolness of this site. Mostly comments like, "His POS software is really good, just try to ignore the way his site looks.", "Once you get past the '90's look of his site...", "Just disregard the way the site looks, this is really functional software.", "If your site looks that bad your software must really suck."  And there have been several offers to take the maintenance of this site out of my pathetic hands by folks who like the software but think I have the site design skills of a mushroom.<p>
Piles of thanks for the feedback.</p><p>
So why does this site look like this?</p><hr>
<b>Answer #1</b><p>
Well, I like it.</p><hr>
<b>Answer #2</b><p>
It makes everyone else's site look so much better in comparison. Think of this site as a public service.</p><hr>
<b>Answer #3</b><p>
It isn't that bad, most of the words are spelled correctly. (How many sites can say that?)</p><hr>
<b>Answer #4</b><p>
This is an eye test to see if I can make you go blind.
</p><hr>
<b>Answer #5</b><p>
The real reason. Folks, I am doing the best I can.</p><p>
First realize that I am old. When I was in grade school / high school there were NO COMPUTERS IN THE SCHOOL because outside of main frame computers that cost millions of dollars, computers did not exist. Even pocket calculators did not exist. This made computer classes sort of problematical. (However I used to be a wizard with a slide rule.) So while you have had the advantages of computer classes in school and a bunch of friends to trade computer tips with, I have not. Half of my friends cannot even use a computer which makes them sort of useless when it comes to having a nice chat about HTML or Java. Needless to say I have no teachers, instructors, or professors to help guide my hand to learn this stuff.</p><p>
When I need a new talent (such as HTML) I have to research it on the net, get some books, and then shove myself into a cave until I get the concept, barely. Although if the idea of "learning through your mistakes" is correct then I should know everything because not only do I have the capability of screwing up every possible feature but I can also screw up each feature in every possible way.</p><hr>
So why do I not just stick with it until I actually learn it completely?<br>
 Well unlike some out there who get Christmas, spring, and summer vacations and weekends off, and can study this stuff during class, I have a 6 day a week job, 50 weeks a year. I have a family that I occasionally like to see. I am also writing the software, updating the manual, doing my incompetent best to update the site, and I sometimes sleep. At last count there was still only one of me. So since my computer time is limited I have two choices, either learn more about website design or add more features to the software. My guess is that adding more to the software would be a better use of my time for everyone.<hr>
So why not hire a professional service to maintain the website?<br>
Let me once again explain the concept of "FREE." Free means that you do not pay anything for my software. This means that there is no money coming in to pay for a professional service to maintain the website. I imagine that I could pay for a service out of my pocket for this but that is insane. Free is bad enough but I am not going to pay to provide folks with my software for nothing.<hr>
But if I have a slick site wouldn't that lead to more downloads of my software?<br>
Well, yes, but so what? Remember that FREE thing? An additional billion downloads would not put a dime in my pocket. As of 1-19-17 I have had 800,000 downloads of the POS program from just my site. How many more do I need? Just more people to complain about the website.<hr>
So how about having one of those volunteers do the site.<br>
Well there are two reasons. First I would lose control of the site. Sure, it would look great but I would not understand the code needed to create the site. If I needed to make a change in the site (which happens about weekly) I would have to dig up the volunteer to make the changes. For the volunteer this could quickly become a pain in the neck. Sure it would be fun to redesign this site and show off what you can do but then to have to update it every damn week would rapidly become a chore.<p>
So the volunteer quits, now what? I need to update the website for a new version of the program and I can't even change a period to a comma in this mess. Time to revert to my code that I at least can understand. I may as well just leave it as it is.</p><p>
Sorry.</p><p>

But if you have a better idea or just want to be the next person to bitch about this site <a href="mailto:daleharris@prodigy.net">daleharris@prodigy.net</a>

Here is another comment from <a href="http://smallbusinessonlinecommunity.bankofamerica.com/message/71459"> http://smallbusinessonlinecommunity.bankofamerica.com/message/71459 </a><p>
If you want a totally free POS system that is very easy to use, accepts bar code scanners, various printers and does nearly everything and very easy to set up and use, then try Cash Register By Dale Harris. <span color="red">I looked at the website and thought it looked a piece of junk being a small program and the tacky look of the website, but the free software works excellently and so easy to use.</span> Its not Excel is the only problem I see for you. It actually runs in Msdos , but will run from your windows main screen. Take a look it, it costs nothing though he does offer a donation if the person likes it, but you don’t have to pay anything. I tried many free POS programs which had too many features for a small retail business, but this is so easy even the sales girl.
only took 30 minutes to understand it.

<span color="red">"Also, Did you know your website Sucks?"</span></p><p>

Ah yes, another appreciative fan.

I've been using the first one in that list for the last few years. DHPOS doesn't do customer tracking, but its a reasonable system. There's good support for it via forums and online chat, and it is regularly updated with bug fixes and new features. <span color="red">Don't get turned off by the ugly website or the DOS interface, it works well.</span>

<p>One of the Amazon reviewers of "Sun Performance and Tuning: Java and the
Internet" gave it 3/5 stars. While still a nice introduction, the book by
Adrian Cockcroft has become dated — claimed Roland in 2003, which believe it
or not was 18 years ago. The book Roland reviewed was published in 1998, and it
is a second edition. The first edition (1994) has a significantly different
title: "<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">Sparc &amp; Solaris</a>",
is the focus instead of "Java and the Internet". Other than reflecting a major
shift in Sun’s focus happened between '94, and '98, the two editions also have
a different price tag. "Java and the Internet" costs 15.97 EUR, while one can
get "Sparc &amp; Solaris" used in allegedly <strong>Very Good</strong> conditions for 1.94.  If
I’m buying an outdated book I’m gonna get the most outdated version possible, I
figured, plus imagine the embarrassment if someone would find a book about Java
in my bookshelf. Shipping is 3 bucks, for a grand total of 4.94 EUR the book is
in my hands 15 days after placing the order.</p>

</div>
<p>"The Porsche Book" is quick to explain the analogy between UNIX and the Porsche
911 featured on the cover: both were created in the '60s, in a form similar to
the current one. Both represent the latest and greatest of products still around
in 1994, and indeed 2021, despite their quirks.</p>
<p>A valid question at this point clearly is: why do you care about a book
published 30 years ago when there’s so much recent and surely more useful
material? One reason is that I find the history of Sun Microsystems
particularly interesting.  I’ve read and very much enjoyed
<a href="https://archive.org/details/highnoon00kare">High Noon</a> as well as
<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunburstascentof00hall">Sunburst</a> — dealing with
recent history there’s the privilege of having plenty of primary sources
readily available, which is great. When it comes to the Porsche book, I find it
fascinating to read about the most common usage scenarios of Sun servers in the
'90s, and I can’t help but feel sorry for the admin who didn’t know that for
SunOS 4, only filenames up to 14 characters long are cached in the Directory
Name Lookup Cache (DNLC). In this article, however, I want to focus on the
information contained in the book which is still valid today.  In a world that
moves as quickly as the world of computing, you could argue that all books are
outdated to begin with. If some of the information in "Sun Performance and
Tuning" was valid in 1994 and is still valid in 2021, there’s a good chance
that it will still be valid 30 years from now.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we can categorize tech knowledge as follows: theoretical
knowledge, generic practical information, and implementation details. Of the
three, theoretical knowledge is the most likely to stay relevant with time,
followed by generic practical information which might still apply some years
later, and finally implementation details which are very likely to become
irrelevant as time goes by. Those details are far from being useless however:
in fact they provide the distinction between novice and experienced
practitioner. To give an example: the chapter about Networks opens with a
description of the built-in <strong>le</strong> network interface, pointing out that it shared
its DMA connection with the SCSI interface. Crucially, the network interface had
higher priority: heavy network activity was likely to reduce disk throughput. In
1994 you would have needed to see multiple workstations with bad disk
performance before concluding that network traffic had anything to do with it — or read the book.</p>
<p>But what is the content that stood the test of time?</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_configuration_factors_and_levels">Configuration Factors and Levels</h2>
<div>
<p>When performing a set of tests, there are multiple settings and knobs one can
work with, each having various options to choose from. Which filesystem are we
using?  What’s the version of the application we’re testing? Kernel buffer
size?</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><b>Factor</b></td><td><b>Level</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Filesystem type</td><td>ext4, xfs, btrfs,...</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS version</td><td>5.10.16, 5.11, ...</td></tr>
<tr><td>vm.dirty_ratio kernel setting</td><td>20, 40, 60, ...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To measure every combination of 6 different factors with 4 levels each would
take 4^6 = 4096 measurements, which clearly is madness. By reducing the levels
we consider to 2, still evaluating all 6 different factors in all possible
combination, we get down to 2^6 = 64 measurements instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_throughput_response_time_utilization">Throughput, Response Time, Utilization</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Throughput</strong> — the amount of work performed in a given amount of time — was a
thing in the '60s, it’s the same thing today, and it will still be <strong>work/time</strong>
in 2050. Your web server might have a maximum throughput of 10000 requests per
second (rps), that’s something you can use to compare it with another one.
<strong>Response time</strong> (latency) is defined as the amount of time the user has to
wait.  For example, how long did a given database transaction take.
<strong>Utilization</strong> is how much of the computer’s resources were used to do the work.
The values reported by <code>sar</code> and <code>iostat</code>, two tools very much still in use
today, are an example of Utilization measures.</p>
<p>The author suggests taking multiple <code>sar</code> Utilization measurements at various
load levels and combine them with <code>awk</code> to get an overview of how the system
behaves. We do have <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>,
<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>, and friends nowadays, but the <code>sar | awk</code> idea
is a useful reminder that quick, simple measurements can go a long way too!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_vmstat_sar_and_iostat_rules">vmstat, sar and iostat Rules</h2>
<div>
<p><code>vmstat</code> and <code>sar</code> are described in detail, with a focus on runnable queue,
blocked queue, swap usage, and so forth. The Linux versions of <code>vmstat</code> and
<code>sar</code> from <a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps">procps</a> and
<a href="http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/">sysstat</a> are a bit different than
the Solaris ones, but the main ideas still apply.</p>
<p>The three commands are also used in the <strong>Rules and Tunables Quick Reference
Tables</strong> section. For each subsystem (Disk, Network, Memory, CPU), the author
specified a list of Rules involving the commands and the action to take if the
rule applies. Rules consist in the name of the command with any options, then a
"." followed by the name of the variable to take into account. For example, the
following indicates a disk bottleneck: <code>35%  &lt; iostat-D30.util &lt; 65%</code>. The
action to take is to try balance the I/O load on other disks too, or get more
disks.</p>
<p>A contemporary version of those rules for Linux would be great to have.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_interrupt_distribution_tuning">Interrupt Distribution Tuning</h2>
<div>
<p>Interrupts in Solaris 2.2 were load-balanced among all available CPUs. The
drawback was that, in case of heavy interrupt load from a given device, cache
hit rate would suffer: the OS allowed to statically assign IRQs to CPUs as an
improvement instead.</p>
<p>Nowadays a very similar problem occurs with the <code>irqbalance</code> daemon on Linux,
which on systems doing lots of network activity should not be used. SMP
affinity should instead be configured to ensure the interrupts of multiqueue
network cards are statically mapped among CPUs.</p>
<p>There’s more information in "Sun Performance and Tuning" that can still provide
valuable lessons today, as well as some true historical gems for those into
such things. Go <a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">check it
out</a> on the Internet Archive if you’re interested!</p>

<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>One of the favorite activities of tech analysts, VCs and similar Twitter armchair experts is to predict what the next big technology platform might be.</p>



<p>The usual suspects that come up in these conversations are VR/AR, crypto, smart speakers and similar IoT devices. A new contestant that I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNorgard/status/1108755070642880512">seen</a> <a href="https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2019/11/19/airpods-are-becoming-a-platform">come up</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1177619897884368904">more</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings/status/1215425809944543240">frequently</a> in these debates recently are Apple’s AirPods.</p>



<p>Calling AirPods “the next big platform” is interesting because at the moment, they are not even a small platform. They are no platform at all. They are just a piece of hardware. </p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean they can’t become platform.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/platform.png"></p><p><span>02</span> What is a platform?</p>



<p>Let’s first take a look at what a platform actually is.</p>



<p>At its core, a platform is something that others can build on top of. A classic example would be an operating system like iOS: By providing a set of APIs, Apple created a playground for developers to build and run applications on. In fact, new input capabilities such as the touch interface, gyroscope sensor and camera allowed developers to create unique applications that weren’t possible before. </p>



<p>Platforms are subject to network effects: More applications attract more users to the platform, while more users in turn attract more developers who build more apps. </p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flywheel.png"></p><p>It’s a classic flywheel effect that creates powerful winner-takes-all dynamics. This explains why there are only two (meaningful) mobile operating systems – iOS and Android. </p>



<p>It also explains why everyone is so interested in upcoming platforms – and why Apple might be interested in making AirPods a platform.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Why AirPods aren’t a platform</p>



<p>In their current form, AirPods are not a platform. They don’t provide any unique input or output functionalities that developers could leverage. Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode are neat but not new or Airpods-exclusive features – other headphones offer exactly the same. In either case, developers don’t have any control over them and thus can’t build applications that use these functionalities.</p>



<p>Some say that AirPods will give rise to more audio apps because they are “always in” which in turn will lead to more (and perhaps new forms of) audio content. That might be true – content providers are always looking for <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/26/newsletters-and-alternative-trade-routes/">alternative routes</a> to get consumers’ attention – but, again, it does not make AirPods a platform. You can use any other pair of headphones to use these audio apps as well.</p>



<p>If Apple wants to make AirPods a platform, it needs to open up some part of the AirPods experience to developers so that they can build new things on top of it.</p>



<p><span>04</span> On Siri &amp; Voice Platforms</p>



<p>The most obvious choice here is Siri, which is already integrated into every pair of AirPods.</p>



<p>In contrast to other voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, Apple has never really opened up Siri for 3rd-party developers. If they did, it would create a new platform that could have its own ecosystem of apps and developers.</p>



<p>But I’m not convinced that this is Apple’s best option.<br>Let me explain why.</p>



<p>Opening up Siri wouldn’t make AirPods a platform, it would make Siri a platform. This might sound like a technicality, but I think it’s an important difference. As <a href="https://twitter.com/einkoenig">Jan König</a> <a href="https://context-first.com/alexa-please-send-this-to-my-screen-6f4839eb415a">brilliantly summarized in this article</a>, voice isn’t an interface for <em>one</em> device – it’s an interface <em>across</em> devices. It’s more of a meta-layer that should tie different products together to enable multi-device experiences.</p>



<p>This means Apple has little interest in making Siri an AirPods-exclusive. Voice-based computing works best when it’s everywhere. It’s about reach, not exclusivity. This is part of the reason why Google and Amazon excel at it.</p>



<p>At the moment, Siri’s capabilities are considerably behind those of Google Assistant and Alexa. Again, this isn’t overly surprising: Google’s and Amazon’s main job is finding the right answers to users’ questions. The required ML capabilities for a smart assistant are among the core competencies of these two companies.</p>



<p>But even Amazon and Google haven’t really figured out the platform part yet, as indicated by the lack of breakout 3rd-party voice applications. It seems like the two platforms are still looking for their product-market-fit beyond being just cheap speakers that you can also control with your voice.</p>



<p>This is partly because the above-mentioned use case of voice as a cross-device layer isn’t something developers can build with the current set of APIs. </p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/voiceonlyinterfaces-3.png"></p><p>The other big reason I see is that people are mistaking voice as a replacement for other interfaces. Movies like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne6p6MfLBxc">Her</a> paint a future where human-computer-interaction primarily occurs via voice-powered smart assistants, but in reality, voice isn’t great as a primary or stand-alone interface. It works best as an *additional* input/output channel that augments whatever else you are doing.</p>



<p>Let me give you an example: Saying “Hey Google, turn up the volume” takes 10x longer than simply pressing the volume-up button on your phone. It only makes sense when your hands are busy doing other things (kitchen work, for example).</p>



<p>The most convincing voice app I have seen to date was at a hackathon where a team <a href="https://upsidelab.io/blog/design-voice-user-interface-starcraft/">used the StarCraft API to build voice-enabled game commands</a>. Not to replace your mouse and keyboard but to give you an additional input mechanism. Actual multitasking.</p>



<p><span>05</span> What Apple Should Build</p>



<p>I’m not against Apple opening Siri for developers. On the contrary, given that AirPods are meant to be worn all the time, a voice interface for situations that require multitasking is actually a very good idea. But voice input should remain the exceptional case. And it shouldn’t be what makes AirPods a platform.</p>



<p>Instead of voice, I’d love to see other input mechanisms that allow developers to build new ways for users to interact with the audio content they consume.</p>



<p>Most headsets currently on the market offer the following actions with one (or multiple) clicks of a physical button:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/earpodsremote-1.png"></p><p>These inputs were invented a long time ago and there has been almost zero innovation since. <strong>Why has no one thought about additional buttons or click mechanisms that allow users to interact with the actual content?</strong></p>



<p>For example, when listening to podcasts I often find myself wanting to bookmark things that are being talked about. It would be amazing if I could simply tap a button on my headphones which would add a timestamp to a bookmarks section of my podcast app. <span>(Or better even, a transcript of the ~15 seconds of content before I pressed the button, which are then also automatically added to my notes app via an Apple Shortcut.)</span></p>



<p>Yes, you could build the same with voice as the input mechanism, but as we discussed earlier, saying <em>“Hey Siri, please bookmark this!”</em> just doesn’t seem very convenient.</p>



<p>While podcast apps might use the additional button as a bookmarking feature, Spotify could make it a Like button to quickly add songs to your Favorites playlist. Other developers could build completely new applications: Think about interactive audiobooks or similar two-way audio experiences, for example. </p>



<p>This is the beauty of platforms: You just provide developers with a set of tools and they will come up with use cases you hadn’t even thought about. Crowdsourced value creation.</p>



<p><span>06</span> Closing Thoughts</p>



<p>(1) The input mechanism I describe doesn’t have to be a physical button. In fact, gesture-based inputs might be even more convenient. If AirPods had built-in accelerometers, users could interact with audio content by nodding or shaking their heads. Radar-based sensors like Google’s Motion Sense could also create an interesting new interaction language for audio content.</p>



<p>(2) You could also think about the Apple Watch as the main input device. In contrast to the AirPods, Apple opened the Watch for developers from the start, but it hasn’t really seen much success as a platform. Perhaps a combination of Watch and AirPods has a better chance of creating an ecosystem with its own unique applications?</p>



<p>(3) One thing to keep in mind is that Apple doesn’t really have an interest in making AirPods a standalone platform. The iPhone (or rather iOS) will always be the core platform that Apple cares about. Instead of separate iPhone, Watch and AirPods ecosystems, think about Apple’s strategy as more of a multi-platform bundle. Even as a platform, AirPods will remain more of an accessory that adds stickiness to the existing iPhone ecosystem.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard that phrase in TV and movies, in fact, it’s become quite cliché in my opinion. I recently watched an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc9TDjhaYg8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc9TDjhaYg8" target="_blank">interview with Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen</a> from 2018 where Paul discusses how he got the role of Vision in Avengers: Age of Ultron. In the interview, he says he had a meeting with a producer that told him he was done in Hollywood, and immediately following that meeting he [Bettany] received a phone call from Joss Whedon offering him the part of Vision. This story reminded me of the time that I was told I would “never work in this town again”.</p>



<p>Years ago, while living and working in Greenville, South Carolina, I was unhappy with my job and I was trying to break out of it. I was looking for another position in local marketing agencies as a web developer. At the time, I had zero connections to the <a href="https://stevenwadejr.com/2016/03/03/starting-a-user-group/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://stevenwadejr.com/2016/03/03/starting-a-user-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local community</a> and did all of my job searching with Google: “php developer greenville sc”. Despite the no networking abilities, no connections, and poor job search skills, I found a local shop that was more web development than marketing, and they were hiring. Their website’s job description included a link to an online application with the usual resume upload and personal info, but it also included a questionnaire wanting more specifics on experience, programming style, and various bits and bobs. So, I started filling out the application. That’s when I received a phone call.</p>



<p>A local recruiter, who shall not be named, from a local recruiting agency, that too will remain nameless, phoned me up. They had seen my profile on LinkedIn and had an opportunity for me. They told me all about the company and the position and it all sounded great. I was excited about the possibility of interviewing there, so the recruiter agreed to send them my information. At the end of the call, he revealed the name of the company he was hiring for. It was the same company I had tracked down myself and was in the middle of applying for.</p>



<p>After the phone call, I went back to my browser and looked at my half completed application. The direct application was asking many more questions than the recruiter asked me, so in my inexperienced and young mind, I thought “hey, I’ll just finish filling this out and when they get my resume from the recruiter, they’ll have a little extra info on me for the interview”. I didn’t see anything wrong with my thinking. I thought it would help my chances. I was wrong.</p>



<p>The next day I got a call from the recruiter. Excited and thinking it was to schedule an interview, I answered the phone. I was immediately berated with accusations of “double submittal” and trying to “screw” the recruiter. I was in shock. I casually explained that I had already been in the middle of an application and decided to finish it as the company was asking more specific questions than the recruiter did. I also explained that since the recruiter was sending my info over, I didn’t see how it was a “double submittal”. The recruiter wasn’t having any of it, and then he hit me with “I’ll make sure you never work in this town again”.</p>



<p>I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. I was nervous and scared. Could this person really prevent me from getting another job in my city? Logically I knew he couldn’t, but emotions are quicker to the brain than logic. Years later I would become friends with the owners of the company that I had attempted to interview with and they remembered the incident. They told me the same recruiter threatened to blackball their company if they hired me.</p>



<p>Needless to say, I did not get the interview. A few months after the incident, I received a cold call from a local business owner about a different opportunity in town that was a bigger step up than the one I had attempted to get earlier. I took the job which eventually led to other possibilities and eventually to where I am now, a full-time remote Software Engineer working for an international company. So I guess that recruiter was right, I never did work in that town again.</p>

February 16, 2021 | https://materialize.com/temporal-filters/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.com/temporal-filters/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a> provides a SQL interface to work with continually changing data. You write SQL queries as if against static data, and then as your data change we keep the results of your queries automatically up to date, in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Materialize leans hard into the ideal that SQL is what you know best, and what you want to use to look at streaming data. At the same time, there are several tantalizing concepts that native stream processors provide that aren’t obviously possible with standard SQL.</p>
<p>Today we’ll look at how to perform time-windowed computation over temporal data.</p>
<h2>Temporal Data</h2>
<p>Temporal databases are a pretty neat thing, and we aren’t going to go deep on that today. Instead, let’s just start with a relation that has a pretty simple schema, and which includes some times.</p>
<pre><code>-- Making a new data source.
CREATE TABLE events (
    content text,
    insert_ts numeric,
    delete_ts numeric
);
</code></pre>
<p>We have some content, clearly you could fluff that up to something more interesting, and two additional columns. The <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code> columns will play the role of timestamps, indicating when an event should first appear and when it should be removed.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all just data right now. These are fields, and you could put whatever you want in them. They don’t have any specific meaning yet. You could make <code>delete_ts</code> be smaller than <code>insert_ts</code>, if you are that sort of person.</p>
<h2>Time-Windowed Queries</h2>
<p>The question is now what do you do with these data?</p>
<p>In Materialize, you can ask questions that grab the “logical time” for your query (roughly: the wall clock when you run the query) and then use that in your query’s logic. For example, this query counts up <code>content</code> based on events that start by and end after the current logical timestamp.</p>
<pre><code>-- Reduce down to counts within a time interval.
SELECT content, count(*)
FROM events
WHERE mz_logical_timestamp() &gt;= insert_ts
  AND mz_logical_timestamp()  &lt; delete_ts
GROUP BY content;
</code></pre>
<p>This query will change its results over time. Not just because you might add to and remove from <code>events</code>, but because <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> advances as you stare at your screen. Each time you issue the query you may get a different result.</p>
<p>This looks like a great query! What’s not to like?</p>
<p>The main issue really is that it is <em>just a query</em>. You can ask this question over and over, but you can also ask the same thing with an arbitrary timestamp in place of <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code>. To support that, Materialize has to keep the entire collection of data around. Your <code>events</code> table will grow and grow and grow, and the time to answer the query will grow as well.</p>
<h2>Time-Windowed Computation</h2>
<p>Materialize specializes at <em>maintaining</em> computations like the above, both because that can make it faster to get your answers out, but also because by specifying what you actually need Materialize can run much more lean. We’ll see that now with the query above!</p>
<p>Until recently, if you tried to create a materialized view of the query above, Materialize would tell you to take a hike. The subject of this post is that you can now do it. Moreover, comparing parts of your data to <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> in views (rather than just in queries) introduces powerful new idioms, ones that we’ll explore in this post.</p>
<pre><code>-- Maintained collection of only valid results.
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW valid_events AS
SELECT content, count(*)
FROM events
WHERE mz_logical_timestamp() &gt;= insert_ts
  AND mz_logical_timestamp()  &lt; delete_ts
GROUP BY content;
</code></pre>
<p>What’s all this then?</p>
<p>Presumably <code>valid_events</code> has the property that if you <code>SELECT</code> from it you should see the same results as for the time-windowed <code>SELECT</code> in the previous section. That is 100% true.</p>
<p>What is also true is that <code>valid_events</code> has enough information from you, in the form of the query itself, to maintain only enough historical detail to answer these <code>SELECT</code> queries from now onward. Once Materialize’s <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> passes a record’s <code>delete_ts</code> it cannot be seen (at least not through this view), and Materialize can dispose of the event. The in-memory footprint of <code>valid_events</code> stays bounded by the number of records in the system that could still satisfy this constraint (those records that are currently valid, or who may yet become valid in the future).</p>
<p>While you add to <code>events</code>, Materialize collects up the events that are no longer visible, automatically. Of course, you can also <em>change</em> the records in <code>events</code>, in case you want to remove some events early, or draw out the <code>delete_ts</code> of any record, or replace one event with its next stage (and new <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code>). If you happen to adjust any fields that interact with <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> Materialize will update the views appropriately.</p>
<h2>A Brief Example</h2>
<p>Let’s do some testing with our table and maintained view. Tables have the nice property that we can interactively update them from within Materialize, rather than spinning up a Kafka cluster.</p>
<p>Let’s start with something simple: we’ll just look at the records currently present in our <code>valid_events</code> view. Let’s define a different view to do that, though, without the aggregation so you can see the raw data:</p>
<pre><code>-- Maintained collection of only valid results.
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW valid AS
SELECT content, insert_ts, delete_ts
FROM events
WHERE mz_logical_timestamp() &gt;= insert_ts
  AND mz_logical_timestamp()  &lt; delete_ts
</code></pre>
<p>We’ll print out the things in our view, along with the current logical timestamp. It is initially empty, because we haven’t put any data in. But, these are the columns we’ll be looking at.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content | insert_ts | delete_ts | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+-----------+-----------+----------------------
(0 rows)

materialize=&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s put some data in there. I’m going to just take advantage of the fact that <code>INSERT</code> statements can also use <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> to populate the data with some records that we will make last five seconds.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; insert into events VALUES (
    'hello',
    mz_logical_timestamp(),
    mz_logical_timestamp() + 5000
);
materialize=&gt; insert into events VALUES (
    'hello',
    mz_logical_timestamp(),
    mz_logical_timestamp() + 5000
);
materialize=&gt; insert into events VALUES (
    'hello',
    mz_logical_timestamp(),
    mz_logical_timestamp() + 5000
);
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these were executed by me, a human, and so almost certainly got different <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code> timestamps. We’ll see them in just a moment!</p>
<p>Next, I typed <em>incredibly fast</em> to see the output for the query; what was previously empty just up above:</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084609890 | 1613084614890 |        1613084613168
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084613168
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084613168
(3 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the <code>insert_ts</code> and <code>delete_ts</code> values are indeed <code>5000</code> apart, and for each of the outputs the <code>mz_logical_timestamp</code> lies between the two. What happens if we type the query again, very quickly?</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084609890 | 1613084614890 |        1613084613988
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084613988
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084613988
(3 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>mz_logical_timestamp</code> values have increased. We still see all of the record, as the timestamp hasn’t increased enough to fall outside the five second bound yet. We type again ..</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084609890 | 1613084614890 |        1613084614843
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084614843
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084614843
(3 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>.. and the timestamp increases again ..</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084615628
 hello   | 1613084610799 | 1613084615799 |        1613084615628
(2 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>.. and we lost one! Now that <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code> has reached <code>1613084614890</code> that record no longer satisfies the predicate, and is no longer present in the view.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content |   insert_ts   |   delete_ts   | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+---------------+---------------+----------------------
 hello   | 1613084611459 | 1613084616459 |        1613084616392
(1 row)
</code></pre>
<p>One more has dropped out.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; SELECT *, mz_logical_timestamp() FROM valid;
 content | insert_ts | delete_ts | mz_logical_timestamp
---------+-----------+-----------+----------------------
(0 rows)
</code></pre>
<p>Ah, they are all gone. My fingers can rest now.</p>
<p>Although this looks rather similar to re-typing the <code>SELECT</code> query that explicitly filters against <code>mz_logical_timestamp()</code>, the difference here is that everything is dataflow with updates flowing through it. If we were to <code>TAIL</code> the view, we would see exactly the moments at which the collection changes, without polling the system repeatedly.</p>
<p>And of course, we can handle a substantially higher volume of updates than if we were continually re-scanning the entire collection.</p>
<h2>Windows: Sliding and Tumbling</h2>
<p>The pattern we saw above was actually very powerful: records could state both their insertion and deletion times. If a record wants to be around for 10s it can do that, if it wants to stay for a year or forever, it could do that too (note: please read further before choosing to do that).</p>
<p>But, let’s check out some other idioms.</p>
<p><strong>Sliding windows</strong>…</p></div></div>

<p>At least in the West, the impact of the pandemic as far as restrictions and shelter-at-home orders didn’t kick in until March/2020 (late February in a few places). So the chart above is the first comparison of usage <strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong> the effects of the pandemic. Data indicates that major online learning platforms enjoyed a banner year. Many of them grew by double digits year-over-year: Udemy, Coursera, edX, Skillshare, and Pluralsight all grew by more 10%. Traffic to Coursera jumped 75%!</p>
<p>A major reason behind this growth is the increasing popularity of <em>micro-credentials</em> ⎼ series of courses that let students demonstrate competence in specific areas. With micro-credentials, students typically get badges or certificates upon completion, and depending on the program, they are able to <em>combine and stack</em> different micro-credentials towards a more comprehensive qualification. I have spoken to several people who have started micro-credential programs over the last year and I get the sense that they are representative of what’s happening in online learning. With many people sheltering in place, micro-credential programs are booming.</p>
<p>All of the major online learning platforms offer micro-credentials in many different disciplines and subjects, here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>edX offers more than sixty <a href="https://www.edx.org/micromasters">MicroMasters®</a> degrees.</li>
<li>Coursera offers <a href="https://www.coursera.org/browse">Specializations, Certificates, and Degree Programs</a>.</li>
<li>Linkedin Learning offers 150 different <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/business?entityType=LEARNING_PATH">Learning Paths</a>.</li>
<li>Traditional Universities are beginning to acknowledge demand for micro-credentials and some well-known public institutions in the U.S. are rolling out offerings: <a href="https://gradpathways.ucdavis.edu/micro-credentials">UC Davis</a>, <a href="https://system.suny.edu/academic-affairs/microcredentials/">SUNY</a>, <a href="https://www.unh.edu/continuingeducation/micro-credentials/about">UNH</a> – just to name a few.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few trends make me think that&nbsp;online learning platforms will be able to maintain at least some of the growth we’re seeing once the world returns to normal. First of all digital transformation is fueling demand for skilled workers across all industries and traditional educational institutions alone cannot meet demand. Secondly employees realize that they increasingly need to keep their skills up to date, and online learning platforms are just so much more cost-effective and convenient.</p>
<p>Finally, the pandemic has caused many to question the cost of higher education. This is particularly true in the U.S. where there’s already a looming <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/how-student-debt-became-a-1point6-trillion-crisis.html">crisis in student loans</a>. While I think the <strong><em>top</em></strong> private and public Colleges and Universities have enough brand power to hold off more affordable alternatives, many academic institutions will have difficulty countering lower cost and more convenient alternatives. It’s hard to fault people who want to continue to study from the comfort of their home, while focusing only on the topics they are most passionate about!</p>

                    <div data-clipboard="Copy link to clipboard."><p>One of the best ways to make software more accessible is to reduce the hardware resources needed to run it. Blockchain software is no exception. The XRP Ledger is already <a href="https://xrpl.org/carbon-calculator.html">one of the greenest blockchains</a> due to its pioneering consensus protocol, but its ecosystem can still benefit from more efficient resource usage. Reduced inefficiencies benefit businesses, developers, and enthusiasts alike.</p><p>So how much can we really improve?</p><p>The C++ team at Ripple spent a significant amount of time in 2020 focusing on how to make better use of available system resources. We're proud to report that, compared to previous versions, the improvements we've contributed to version 1.7.0 of <code>rippled</code>, our reference implementation of the XRP Ledger server, cut its memory usage to <em>less than half</em>.</p><p>That's not a typo and these aren't theoretical numbers. These are <em>real-world</em> improvements of more than 50% in servers running <code>rippled</code> on the XRP Ledger mainnet. The operator of <a href="https://alloy.ee/">alloy.ee</a> calls it "sheer voodoo":</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1.7b9 is sheer voodoo - The higher one is 1.6.0 <a href="https://t.co/NOlqAmpvBU">pic.twitter.com/NOlqAmpvBU</a></p>— Alloy Networks (@alloynetworks) <a href="https://twitter.com/alloynetworks/status/1341495806893973506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>"Sheer voodoo"</figcaption></figure><p>Keep reading to learn the technical details that made this engineering work possible.</p><p>Alongside our other experiments, we set out to measure and understand how <code>rippled</code> uses resources and how to improve it.</p><p>As a result of these measurements, we contributed support for link compression in <a href="https://xrpl.org/blog/2020/rippled-1.6.0.html">version 1.6.0</a>, which reduces the amount of bandwidth used by servers, benefiting operators of single servers and large clusters alike.</p><p>We're also working on optimizing how messages are propagated or routed throughout the XRP Ledger network so that every server receives everything it needs to know without getting redundant copies of info.</p><p>However, the primary pain-point for many operators of the software is RAM usage. Memory is a critical and scarce resource. Reducing the amount required by the server could have an outsized impact on the performance of individual servers, and potentially, the network as a whole.</p><p>To get the best return on our effort, we focused on identifying what parts of the server used the most RAM and experimented with what we could do about them.</p><h2 id="understanding-shamap"><strong>Understanding SHAMap</strong></h2><p>In <code>rippled</code>, one of the largest targets was the SHAMap and its constituent parts—specifically, the nodes within the SHAMap's tree-like structure.</p><p>This data structure holds the state of <a href="https://xrpl.org/ledgers.html">the ledger itself</a>—all the accounts, balances, settings, exchange orders, and everything else the XRP Ledger tracks. On the mainnet, the SHAMap consists of millions of nodes, which means that even small savings in the size of individual nodes can result in large savings overall.</p><p>More precisely, the SHAMap is a combination of a <a href="https://medium.com/@theblockchaincafe/what-is-merkle-tree-complete-guide-for-beginners-9bcf4631bb19">Merkle tree</a> and a <a href="https://medium.com/basecs/compressing-radix-trees-without-too-many-tears-a2e658adb9a0">Radix tree</a> with a branching factor of 16. This branching factor is especially relevant in this instance. It means that the <em>inner nodes</em> in the tree (the nodes other than the "leaves") can have <em>up to</em> 16 children. For example, consider this simple tree:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/2021/02/Tree-01.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Tree-01.png 600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Tree-01.png 1000w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Tree-01.png 1600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Tree-01.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Each node has 16 children, whether they point to something or not. And that was the key insight: just because nodes can have <em>up to</em> 16 children doesn't mean that they actually do in practice.</p><p>The question then became, how many children does a "typical" inner node have? We gathered data from Ripple-operated servers, which resulted in the following distribution:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/2021/02/Histogram.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Histogram.png 600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Histogram.png 1000w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Histogram.png 1600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Histogram.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>The data we collected shows that most inner nodes only have a handful of children. With that in mind, we examined if the nodes of the tree could be adjusted, at runtime, to accommodate only as many children as they needed.</p><p>In other words, what if we changed the tree to look more like this?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/2021/02/Tree-02.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Tree-02.png 600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Tree-02.png 1000w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Tree-02.png 1600w, https://blog.ripplex.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Tree-02.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="the-naive-shamap-design"><strong>The Naive SHAMap Design</strong></h3><p>The SHAMap is a tree-like data structure where keys are 256-bit hashes, and a node in the tree (other than the leaves), can have up to 16 children. Children are always stored as a 256-bit hash value that can be used to retrieve the child node from a database. Children are also sometimes cached directly in a node for quick traversal.</p><p>The original implementation of the non-leaf nodes had a C++ class that looked a bit like this:</p><pre><code>struct SHAMapInnerNode {
    std::bitset&lt;16&gt; isBranch_;
    SHAMapHash hashes_[16];
    std::shared_ptr&lt;SHAMapTreeNode&gt; cachedChildren_[16];
}</code></pre><p>To traverse the tree, the code looks at the 256-bit key four bits at a time. These 4-bit numbers represent which of the sixteen children to transition to next. This means the children are ordered, and it's possible that some branches (such as 2, 5, and 7) are occupied while the rest are empty.</p><p>The <code>isBranch_</code><em> </em>variable tracks which branches have children and which are empty, but the <code>hashes_[16]</code> array always leaves space for sixteen 256-bit identifiers anyway.</p><h3 id="sparse-shamap"><strong>Sparse SHAMap</strong></h3><p>Instead of always storing sixteen children, we want to use a space-saving sparse representation when there are only a few children and only switch to the dense representation when there are more children.</p><p>Such a representation could look like this:</p><pre><code>struct SHAMapInnerNode {
    std::bitset&lt;16&gt; isBranch_;
    SHAMapHash* hashes_;
    std::shared_ptr&lt;SHAMapTreeNode&gt;* cachedChildren_;
    std::uint8_t arraySize_;
}
</code></pre><p>A sparse representation would store <code>hashes_</code> and <code>cachedChildren_</code> without gaps. For example, if branches 2, 5, and 7 are occupied while the rest are empty, then <code>hashes_</code> would store these values at indexes 0, 1, and 2. To look up a child in a sparse array, count how many non-empty branches come before it.</p><p>For example, if branches 2, 5, and 7 are occupied, and you want to find the child in branch 5, there's 1 branch with an index less than 5, so you'd look at array index 1 of the <code>hashes_</code> array.</p><p>How much memory does this save? Each hash is 256 bits—that's 32 bytes—and each shared pointer is 16 bytes. That means that every time the sparse representation doesn't leave empty space for a nonexistent child that the naive, dense implementation would have, you save 48 bytes.</p><p>With the data we had collected on how many children the nodes in the SHAMap really had when used in production, we could calculate how much memory could be saved by using a sparse representation.</p><p>The following Python code demonstrates how to perform such a calculation:</p><pre><code>def savings(child_hist, arg_indexes):
"""
Given a histogram of the number of children, and the array size boundaries,
calculate the ratio of memory used for a sparse representation/memory used
for a dense representation
"""
if not arg_indexes:
	return 1.0
# add one (and copy so we don't modify original list)
indexes = [a+1 for a in arg_indexes]
	if indexes[0] != 0:
indexes.insert(0, 0)
	if indexes[-1] != 17:
indexes.append(17)
per_child_bytes = 48.0 # 32 for the hash 16 for the shared_ptr
dense_bytes = 16.0 * per_child_bytes * sum(child_hist)
sparse_bytes = 0.0
	for i in range(1, len(indexes)):
		sparse_bytes += ((indexes[i]-1) *
				per_child_bytes *
				sum(child_hist[indexes[i-1]:indexes[i]])
				)
return (sparse_bytes/dense_bytes)</code></pre><h2 id="how-sparse-to-go"><strong>How Sparse to Go?</strong></h2><p>It was clear that a sparse representation could save a substantial amount of memory, but the next challenge was to determine how sparse to go.</p><p>If we used 16 different sparse array sizes, one for every possible number of children, then no space would be wasted at all. But doing that brings in other costs. For example, when you have a size-10 array and you need to add an 11th child, you need to allocate space for a size-11 array and copy all 10 existing entries into the new array.</p><p>Another approach is to have just two sizes of arrays. For example, you might use a sparse array with room for up to 5 children, and a dense array when you need to hold 6 to 16.</p><p>This approach still wastes some space (i.e. when the sparse array has just 1 of its 5 spots occupied, or when the dense array uses only 6 or 7 of its 16 spots, it's simpler and faster than constantly changing the size of the array). Alternatively, we could have different 3 sizes or more (i.e. 3, 6, 16).</p><p>To decide between all the possibilities, we had to consider the trade-offs of different numbers of sparse array sizes. This kind of analysis is common in engineering and even in other disciplines; it's kind of like deciding how many different sizes of jeans you want to manufacture to make the most profit.</p><p>In our case, we considered all of the following in deciding how to approach the problem:</p><ol><li>Costs of moving data when the sparse array changes representations. If you need to add a child and the current sparse array is full, you need to allocate a new array and move the data into it.</li><li>Costs of inserting and removing data in the sparse array. Since the sparse arrays are sorted, you have to move elements around whenever you add or remove children from them. Keeping the sparse arrays small reduces the amount of data movement necessary.</li><li>Space savings. The more sparse array sizes, the greater the savings. However, we expected diminishing returns from each additional size option.</li><li>Implementation considerations. A tagged pointer (described below) can be used to store a small number of bits without using additional space. Keeping the number of array sizes below this number results in additional savings.</li></ol><p>Fortunately, we didn't have to make these decisions based on pure intuition and generalizations. Using our histogram data, we could calculate the actual space savings of various numbers and sizes of sparse arrays, which helped us figure out where the diminishing returns actually kicked in.</p><p>The following code helps compute this.</p><pre><code>def savings_dim(dim=1):
	if dim == 0:
		s = savings(collected_child_histogram, [])
		return ([s], [()], 0)
	args = [arg for arg in itertools.combinations(range(17),dim)]
	r = [savings(collected_child_histogram, arg) for arg in args]
	return (r, args, numpy.argmin(r))

def doit():
	result = []
	for dim in range(17):
		r, args, arg_min = savings_dim(dim)

<p>If you ever had a look at <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_globex.html">CME’s Bitcoin futures</a>, you might have noticed that there are multiple contracts – one for each month, and that they have different prices. Systematically, the futures contracts for months that are further away, are more expensive than those with closer expiration, and also cheaper than spot. When this happens for a commodity like oil, we’re talking about contango.</p>



<p>This is usually due to the fact that there’s a risk premium on the uncertainty of the future, and it costs a little bit to be sure of the price that you’ll pay for something three months from now. But for futures on financial products, it’s very rare. Currently, the premium for Bitcoin is a whopping 2% per month, and it’s a red warning sign.</p>



<h3>Term structure of Bitcoin futures</h3>



<p>The reason contango for commodities like oil is normal, is that you can’t arbitrage it. The way to arbitrage contango is to buy spot, short the future, wait till expiry, and collect the premium. But you can’t simply “wait” when you buy thousands of barrels of oil – you have to store those barrels somewhere, and it will cost you an arm and a leg. The storage costs will eat up your contango premium, plus some.</p>



<p>There were occurrences in the past where traders were able to arbitrage this premium, but the contango needed to be absolutely off-the-charts (“super-contango”). For instance, after the 2008 financial panic, the spread between spot and futures in the oil market was so big, <a href="https://doc.rero.ch/record/323428/files/TDIBM_Loris_Beltramello.pdf">traders would literally rent tankers and use them as storage facilities</a> for oil, waiting for their futures leg to mature.</p>



<p>The reason contango for financial products isn’t normal, is that you can arbitrage it very easily, as you don’t have storage costs. You buy Bitcoin spot, sell an April future for 4% more than spot, and simply wait two months.</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35.png 952w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35-300x79.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-13.42.35-768x203.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></figure>



<p>At expiry, you’ll sell your Bitcoin at a certain price, while the future will settle at the exact same price, and you’ll collect the premium. Your only cost is the carry, i.e. the interest you have forfeited on the cash you used to buy Bitcoin, but this is virtually zero today.</p>



<p>Why the premium, then? Why don’t hedge funds with hundreds of billions of dollars to spare don’t arbitrage the Bitcoin contango down to zero?</p>



<h3>Credit risk?</h3>



<p>One quick answer would be that you aren’t guaranteed to close your trade because of counterparty risk. This is what happened when Lehman went bust – all the hedge funds that had OTC derivatives positions with Lehman as one leg of a trade, suddenly saw the “Lehman leg” disappear, while the other leg was still there. Lehman going bust single handedly destroyed the convertible bonds market, as hedge funds who had bought convertible bonds and hedged their risks (credit, volatility, equity risks – you name it) with Lehman, suddenly were out of hedges, and had to sell their cash position (their convertible bonds) at literally any price.</p>



<p>But there is no counterparty risk here. You can’t lose your Bitcoins – you just keep them on chain, and no exchange going bust will affect your position. CME can’t go bust – it has margin calls, initial margin deposits, has a guarantee fund, and is almost explicitly guaranteed by the Fed because of its critical importance to financial markets.</p>



<p>So, again, why is nobody picking those hundred dollar bills lying on the street?</p>



<h3>Systemic risk</h3>



<p>There is one risk that you can’t edge – that of the world collapsing overnight, when there’s nobody left to pay you even if you win your bet. Imagine shorting USDT on Binance. What happens if you’re right and USDT goes to zero? Do you really think Binance will still be around to pay you?</p>



<p>You can always say, “bah, I’ll see it coming, the moment shit starts to hit the fan, I’ll close my positions”. But what if you don’t have the time to do so? What if a black swan event happens overnight?</p>



<p>This is the risk with Bitcoin. A whim from regulators, like passing the STABLE act, and all USDT exchanges go bust. What will happen to Bitcoin futures then? CME uses the “<a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/cryptocurrency-indices.html">Bitcoin Reference Rate</a>” (BRR) to calculate the spot for its Bitcoin futures, which is a weighted average of the spots taken from multiple crypto exchanges, the list of which changes over time. What happens if the Bitcoin ecosystem collapses, the prices of Bitcoin on half of those exchanges go to 100,000 on paper because those exchanges become insolvent and people rush for the exits by buying Bitcoin to try and send it to their own wallets (as happened with MtGox)? Futures skyrocket because of a technicality, CME is slow to react, and you get wiped out on your “short futures” leg – while you can’t really sell the “long Bitcoin” leg either, because every exchange is on fire and nobody processes redemption requests.</p>



<h3>Implied probability of default</h3>



<p>This risk is rewarded handsomely – a big fat 2% per month. With interest rates at zero, we can borrow a formula from the Credit Default Swaps market to calculate the <a href="https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/15986/how-to-compute-the-implied-probability-of-default-from-a-cds-spread#:~:text=Risk%2Dneutral%20default%20probability%20implied,R%20is%20the%20recovery%20rate.&amp;text=Hulls%20equation%20is%20a%20gross,works%20for%20all%20tenor%20points.">implied probability of default</a>, which we’ll <a href="http://nzz-files-prod.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files/4/1/2/cds+deutsche+bank+161214_1.18446412.pdf">simplify to the extreme</a>:</p>



<p><strong>p = S/(1-R)</strong></p>



<p>Where p is the probability of default, S the annual “swap rate” that compensates for that probability, and R the recovery rate, i.e. how much you can expect to recoup from your investment if a default occurs.</p>



<p>In our case, S = 24% (12 months in a year, at 2% for each month), and R ≈ 50% based on what happened after MtGox collapsed. This means that we assume you’ll be able to cash out in the event of an apocalypse with an average 50% loss. Remember, this is assuming that you are hedged!</p>



<p>This gives us an implied probability of default p ≈ 50% over the next year. Again, that’s the probability of the whole Bitcoin ecosystem collapsing overnight, not giving you the time to close your positions, cutting you off from exchanges, and where CME futures no longer trade.</p>



<p>This is the risk as it’s being priced by the market, on relatively liquid financial instruments. So the next time someone tries to explain to you that “Bitcoin is a store of value”, when the chances of it getting utterly destroyed overnight before the year is over are around 50/50, try not to shoot coffee through your nose laughing.</p>

      </p>
<p>
Throughout <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Machine-M-Mitchell-Waldrop/dp/1732265119"><em>The Dream Machine</em></a>, a history of the early days of computing, tinkering and having fun was a recurring theme throughout the decades. I wasn’t around to experience the early days of computers myself, but they seemed to be genuinely exciting and rewarding. In the words of MIT sociologist Sherry Turkle: computers empowered their users, making them feel smart[er], “in control”, and “more fully participant in the future”. </p>
<p>
Those feel like odd descriptions for the modern computing experience. Using computers today doesn’t feel like￼ an empowering experience￼. Sometimes it’s mindless and distracting. Sometimes, when a redesign rolls out, or laptop doesn’t wake from sleep mode,￼ it’s downright hostile. The experience of using a computer in 2020 is a concoction of data silos, dinging notifications and reinvented wheels, presented in gratuitously bubble-wrapped UIs hyper-optimized by persnickety product managers and soulless A/B tests. </p>
<p>
For most people, the computing experience is <a href="https://feifan.blog/2020/06/22/no-one-cares-about-software-quality/">clicking around a lot</a>, typing into disparate apps in which your data is trapped except through narrowly-defined, bespoke integrations, and struggling to find <em>that thing you were just reading a few days ago</em> among all the silos. This doesn’t make anyone feel smarter or more in control. It’s simply frustrating.</p>
<p>
Software <em>development</em> is stuck in the doldrums too. A massive amount of cumulative engineering effort is spent rebuilding the same primitives<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a> because the software engineering industry hasn’t convincingly developed platforms at higher levels of abstraction<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>. A significant portion of development effort goes to placating not-invented-here-ness, where companies feel the need to build their own version of every feature, each slightly different (user familiarity be damned). A lot of software is little more than looking up API documentation and plugging one into another. There’s a dearth of creativity, of joy and discovery, of inventing something interesting and new. </p>
<p>
To be fair, computers — both the desktop kind and various mobile kinds — enable<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a> seemingly-impossible<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a> things<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>. But it feels frustrating to see the pioneering spirit that originally led to the development of modern computers giving way to uninspired flat interfaces<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> SaaS apps. The things you can do are limited to bespokely-implemented features, dribbled out only as fast as a small team of designers and developers can think of and build them. Of course you have an extensive list of things you <em>wish</em> your phone/computer/most-used apps could do; everyone does. You know the majority of it will remain a wishlist; there’s almost no hope of the feature you really want being implemented<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. This isn’t empowering. What’s more, new features tend to be one-off improvements and ungainly new ways for you to do more work<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a> rather than adding or improving functionality in a generalized way so you can remix functionality and do things faster.</p>
<p>
For the people who’ve figured out the right incantations to type and buttons-buried-in-submenus to click, computers can automate administrivia, surface information, and make them feel “more fully participant in the future”. But getting there is an arduous journey, and many people get in a place where computers just make things harder. The experience of using computers is, in various ways, awkward and frustrating (and maybe even dangerous<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>) for everyone. Computers were supposed to be bicycles for the mind. So far we only have penny-farthings.</p>

<p>
Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer’s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers’ heads. It’s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack “code browsers” that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we’ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote">1</a>.</p>
<p>
In simple cases, some constructs manifest as naming conventions: prefixes in a name may be a rudimentary way to namespace classes<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">2</a>, while suffixes may be a rudimentary way to group classes or identify their type<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote">3</a>. But these are easy examples; many patterns are much more subtle.</p>
<h2>
“Where is this used?”</h2>
<p>
Imagine figuring out “where is this used?”, for various types of “this”:</p>
<p>
Most code editors (perhaps paired with a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server</a>) can show you where local variables are used. This usually also works for finding where methods are invoked — although perhaps less reliably in dynamic-dispatch languages, or languages without types.</p>
<p>
What if you want to find where instances of a particular model get created? There may be multiple ways to create a model, so this isn’t super simple. In Rails, for example, there’s two built-in ways to create a model: you can either call <code>.new</code> to create a new instance in memory followed by <code>.save</code> to persist it to the database, or call <code>.create</code> to automatically do both. Your particular codebase might have additional wrappers for doing this that you’re supposed to use. Even worse, imagine that sometimes you create a <code>.new</code> instance, then set some properties on it over the next few lines, then finally call <code>.save</code>. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>user = User.new
user.email = '<a href="https://feifan.blog/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="97fff2fbfbf8d7f2eff6fae7fbf2b9f4f8fa">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>' unless self.anonymous?
user.save</code></pre>
<p>
Conceptually, that’s still code that creates an instance of a particular model. But with the intervening syntax, this would be a difficult case to find with <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h2>
Static config</h2>
<p>
At <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I work, we have a lot of code for jobs that need to run at certain times each day. For example, we might need to move funds from one financial partner to another at noon UTC each day. Each of these jobs has configuration code describing when and how it should be run, implemented as a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/concepts/domain-specific-languages/">DSL</a>. This config might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>run_config RunConfig.new(
  job_name: 'partner-daily-funding',
  env_vars: self.config_env,
  cron: RunConfig::Cron.new(
    schedule: { hour: 12, minute: 0 }
  ),
  owning_team: Company::Team::Liquidity
)</code></pre>
<p>
In our codebase, we have hundreds of these jobs, each with their own <code>run_config</code>. If you look at this codebase as a database, you can imagine these jobs being rows in a <code>jobs</code> table, where the fields on each row correspond to the parameters provided to the <code>RunConfig</code> class. </p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse all these jobs in a table? Maybe you could perform some basic operations on this data: searching for specific jobs by name or owning team; sorting by the time-of-day they’re scheduled to run; filtering for jobs owned by your team that have errored in the past week. Maybe you could edit the <code>run_config</code> from that interface (like you might edit a spreadsheet) and have it automatically make the corresponding change in the source code (or open a PR). Maybe you could even compute some aggregations on this data — for example, if you’re introducing a new job that requires some expensive computation, maybe you’d like to know which hours have the fewest other jobs scheduled. And of course, this job browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each entry that shows the code for the job inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<h2>
Diffused concepts</h2>
<p>
Codebases typically contain logical concepts that are implemented across multiple pieces of code. This is often the case when you need to create multiple files to implement a particular feature.</p>
<p>
For example, in Rails, a “resource” is collectively implemented across a line in the router, a model file, a controller file, and a bunch of view files. Rails even ships with a code generator to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5f3ff60084ab5d5921ca3499814e4697f8350ee7/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/resource/USAGE">create some of these files</a> for you. But despite resources being a core concept when working with Rails, there’s no good way to browse the resources in your codebase<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote">4</a>. There’s no good way to filter or query your codebase either — you can’t, for example, see which resources support JSON vs XML params. </p>
<p>
For another example, consider pubsub (aka emitter-consumer) pipelines. In web services, when you have processing that can happen “in the background”, one service will publish an event; another service subscribes to that event and will do the background processing on its own when it receives the event. Often, these will form event “pipelines” or trees where an event consumer will emit additional events that are consumed by yet other services. These pipelines are concepts that developers talk about (as in, the “account creation pipeline” or “funding reconciliation pipeline”), but in most codebases the pipeline itself isn’t declared or reified anywhere in the code.</p>
<p>
If you’re looking at code that emits an event, how do you find the consumers? If you’re lucky, the event has a unique, literal name and the consumer uses that name literally as well. But maybe some subscribers are using wildcard event names, or names generated by string concatenation, and that becomes a lot harder to grep for. Likewise, if you’re looking at a consumer of an event, how do you find the locations in the codebase that could emit that event<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote">5</a>?</p>
<p>
Wouldn’t it be great to be able to browse those pipelines in a table or perhaps a directed graph<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote">6</a>? Maybe that graph would support some basic operations on this data: searching for specific publishers or subscribers by class name or event name; filtering for pipelines that have run into errors; maybe even showing the flow of a particular event given an event ID<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote">7</a>. And of course, this pipeline browser should be bidirectional with respect to the codebase — there should be a button beside each graph node that shows the code for the publisher or subscriber inline or opens the corresponding code in your editor.</p>
<p>
For a final example, consider code that has functionality inherited from elsewhere. Some environments let you see a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/viewing-structure-of-a-source-file.html">list of inherited properties</a> or methods, but this isn’t possible for more specialized cases. At Stripe, we have code that implements shell scripts that can take command-line arguments and flags. These arguments are defined via a DSL in the implementing code, but these commands can be subclassed, and there’s no way to see what the available arguments are while working in the subclass.</p>
<h2>
Philosophy</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to consider these problems not as disparate cases in need of bespoke tooling, but as a <em>class</em> of problems characterized by a lack of access to the data structures embedded within codebases. Just like SQL databases and spreadsheets provide a singular querying abstraction and a set of visualization primitives that can be applied to any kind of data, programming environments need a singular querying abstraction and set of visualization primitives that can be applied to the concepts lurking in codebases. Getting there does <em>not</em> mean using proprietary drag-and-drop visual programming interfaces where the introspection capabilities are limited to whatever the programming environment happens to have implemented. Just the opposite — you should still be able to do whatever you want with your code (including treating it as plain-text files), <em>and also</em> have access to more advanced introspection tools that can query and slice your code — tools that let you easily understand and navigate complex codebases to reduce the <em>incidental complexity</em> of building software.</p>
<h2>
Solutions</h2>
<p>
I don’t have a solution to sell you here (at least, not yet!). But <a href="https://twitter.com/hirday_g/status/1356657607381946369">by popular demand</a> I think it’s worthwhile to at least discuss principles that solutions should embody and directionally-related prior art. </p>
<p>
To start with a simple example, see <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a>, a full-stack web framework similar to Rails. It comes with a web interface for manipulating your project’s codebase and database schema. <a href="https://youtu.be/UbDtS_mUMpI?t=102">One point in the introduction video</a> showed changes being made in the visual schema editor being automatically reflected in the SQL code that describes the database schema — and changes being made to the SQL code being bidirectionally reflected in the visual schema editor. </p>
<p>
For a more in-depth example, consider <a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a>, a Smalltalk environment. “Environment” in this case means that it feels like you’re using a custom OS (including global menus, idioms, and keyboard and mouse conventions) designed specifically for browsing, writing, and debugging programs in the Smalltalk programming language<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote">8</a>. The holistic integration of these tools is important. Unlike the programming environments we cobble for ourselves today — where the editor is agnostic of the language and runtime and other tools like debuggers, inspectors, and code browsers are tacked on (if they exist at all) — it’s worth thinking about what an entire computing experience <em>for</em> writing and building custom tools might look like<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote">9</a>.</p>

Pharo is also interesting because of its Class Browser, which looks like this:</p>

        Why is esbuild fast?
      </h2>
      <p>Several reasons:</p>
      <ul><li><p> It's written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and compiles to native code. </p> <p> Most other bundlers are written in JavaScript, but a command-line application is a worst-case performance situation for a JIT-compiled language. Every time you run your bundler, the JavaScript VM is seeing your bundler's code for the first time without any optimization hints. While esbuild is busy parsing your JavaScript, node is busy parsing your bundler's JavaScript. By the time node has finished parsing your bundler's code, esbuild might have already exited and your bundler hasn't even started bundling yet. </p> <p> In addition, Go is designed from the core for parallelism while JavaScript is not. Go has shared memory between threads while JavaScript has to serialize data between threads. Both Go and JavaScript have parallel garbage collectors, but Go's heap is shared between all threads while JavaScript has a separate heap per JavaScript thread. This seems to cut the amount of parallelism that's possible with JavaScript worker threads in half <a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/111#issuecomment-719910381">according to my testing</a>, presumably since half of your CPU cores are busy collecting garbage for the other half. </p></li><li><p> Parallelism is used heavily. </p> <p> The algorithms inside esbuild are carefully designed to fully saturate all available CPU cores when possible. There are roughly three phases: parsing, linking, and code generation. Parsing and code generation are most of the work and are fully parallelizable (linking is an inherently serial task for the most part). Since all threads share memory, work can easily be shared when bundling different entry points that import the same JavaScript libraries. Most modern computers have many cores so parallelism is a big win. </p></li><li><p> Everything in esbuild is written from scratch. </p> <p> There are a lot of performance benefits with writing everything yourself instead of using 3rd-party libraries. You can have performance in mind from the beginning, you can make sure everything uses consistent data structures to avoid expensive conversions, and you can make wide architectural changes whenever necessary. The drawback is of course that it's a lot of work. </p> <p> For example, many bundlers use the official TypeScript compiler as a parser. But it was built to serve the goals of the TypeScript compiler team and they do not have performance as a top priority. Their code makes pretty heavy use of <a href="https://mrale.ph/blog/2015/01/11/whats-up-with-monomorphism.html">megamorphic object shapes</a> and unnecessary <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/39247">dynamic property accesses</a> (both well-known JavaScript speed bumps). And the TypeScript parser appears to still run the type checker even when type checking is disabled. None of these are an issue with esbuild's custom TypeScript parser. </p></li><li><p> Memory is used efficiently. </p> <p> Compilers are ideally mostly O(n) complexity in the length of the input. So if you are processing a lot of data, memory access speed is likely going to heavily affect performance. The fewer passes you have to make over your data (and also the fewer different representations you need to transform your data into), the faster your compiler will go. </p> <p> For example, esbuild only touches the whole JavaScript AST three times: </p> <ol> <li>A pass for lexing, parsing, scope setup, and declaring symbols</li> <li>A pass for binding symbols, minifying syntax, JSX/TS to JS, and ESNext-to-ES2015</li> <li>A pass for minifying identifiers, minifying whitespace, generating code, and generating source maps</li> </ol> <p> This maximizes reuse of AST data while it's still hot in the CPU cache. Other bundlers do these steps in separate passes instead of interleaving them. They may also convert between data representations to glue multiple libraries together (e.g. string→TS→JS→string, then string→JS→older JS→string, then string→JS→minified JS→string) which uses more memory and slows things down. </p> <p> Another benefit of Go is that it can store things as compactly in memory, which enables it to use less memory and fit more in the CPU cache. All object fields have types and fields are packed tightly together so e.g. several boolean flags only take one byte each. Go also has value semantics and can embed one object directly in another so it comes "for free" without another allocation. JavaScript doesn't have these features and also has other drawbacks such as JIT overhead (e.g. hidden class slots) and inefficient representations (e.g. non-integer numbers are heap-allocated with pointers). </p></li></ul>
      <p>Each one of these factors is only a somewhat significant speedup, but together they can result in a bundler that is multiple orders of magnitude faster than other bundlers commonly in use today.</p>

        Upcoming roadmap
      </h2>
      <p>These features are already in progress and are first priority:</p>
      <ul><li>Code splitting (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/16">#16</a>, <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/#splitting">docs</a>)</li><li>CSS content type (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/20">#20</a>, <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#css">docs</a>)</li><li>Plugin API (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/111">#111</a>)</li></ul>
      <p>These are potential future features but may not happen or may happen to a more limited extent:</p>
      <ul><li>HTML content type (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/31">#31</a>)</li><li>Lowering to ES5 (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/297">#297</a>)</li><li>Bundling top-level await (<a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/253">#253</a>)</li></ul>
      <p>After that point, I will consider esbuild to be relatively complete. I'm planning for esbuild to reach a mostly stable state and then stop accumulating more features. This will involve saying "no" to requests for adding major features to esbuild itself. I don't think esbuild should become an all-in-one solution for all frontend needs. In particular, I want to avoid the pain and problems of the "webpack config" model where the underlying tool is too flexible and usability suffers.</p>
      <p>For example, I am <em>not</em> planning to include these features in esbuild's core itself:</p>
      <ul><li>Support for other frontend languages (e.g. <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>)</li><li>TypeScript type checking (just run <code>tsc</code> separately)</li><li>An API for custom AST manipulation</li><li>Hot-module reloading</li><li>Module federation</li></ul>
      <p>I hope that the extensibility points I'm adding to esbuild (<a href="https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/">plugins</a> and the <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/">API</a>) will make esbuild useful to include as part of more customized build workflows, but I'm not intending or expecting these extensibility points to cover all use cases. If you have very custom requirements then you should be using …</p></div></div>

<p>Jazzer is a coverage-guided fuzzer for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It works on the bytecode level and can thus not only be applied directly to compiled Java applications, but also to targets in other JVM-based languages such as Kotlin or Scala.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Jazzer consists of two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Jazzer driver</strong> is a native binary that links in <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html" rel="nofollow">libFuzzer</a> and runs a Java fuzz target through the Java Native Interface (JNI).</li>
<li>The <strong>Jazzer agent</strong> is a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">Java agent</a> that runs in the same JVM as the fuzz target and applies instrumentation at runtime. The information obtained through this instrumentation is fed back to libFuzzer <span>just as it would be for a compile-time instrumented native binary.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, the driver and the agent make it seem to libFuzzer as if it were fuzzing an ordinary native binary. Our goal is to make all of libFuzzer's features work with Jazzer <span>out of the box</span>. In the following, we want to highlight some of the most interesting aspects of the engineering effort required to achieve this goal.</p>
<h2>Instrumenting JVM bytecode for fuzzing</h2>
<p>The JVM bytecode of a compiled Java class is much more higher-level than the machine code of an equivalent C/C++ binary. This makes it possible to instrument a JVM application at runtime rather than at build-time, which means that neither the code nor the build script requires any changes. The Jazzer agent, which is written in Kotlin, instruments the classes right as <span>they are being loaded</span> by the JVM.</p>
<p>To obtain coverage information from the JVM fuzz target, the Jazzer agent inserts bytecode instructions together with a unique ID at the beginning of every basic block. When we enter a block, the previous basic block’s shifted ID is XORed with the current ID to obtain an identifier for the control flow edge between the two blocks.&nbsp;This idea to obtain edge-level coverage information from basic block instrumentation originated in <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt" rel="nofollow">AFL</a> and has already featured in the early AFL-based Java fuzzer <a href="https://github.com/isstac/kelinci">Kelinci</a>. By relying on memory shared directly between the JVM and the Jazzer driver through a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html" rel="nofollow">direct <code>ByteBuffer</code></a> as well as implementing a branch-free saturating counter increment, we found this approach to coverage instrumentation to be very efficient in practice (take a look at <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/agent/src/main/java/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/instrumentor/AFLCoverageMapInstrumentor.kt">AFLCoverageMapInstrumentor.kt</a> if you want to know how this is done).</p>
<p>Since coverage is not the only type of information that is used by libFuzzer to guide its exploration of the fuzz target, Jazzer also instruments other JVM constructs (see <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/agent/src/main/java/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/instrumentor/TraceDataFlowInstrumentor.kt">TraceDataFlowInstrumentor.kt</a>):</p>

<li>constant array indices (corresponding to the <span><code>*aload</code></span> opcodes and <span><code>get*</code></span> methods on array-like objects)</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, interesting observed values are forwarded to libFuzzer callbacks such as <span><code>__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4</code></span> (for comparisons of 32-bit integral types) and <span><code>__sanitizer_weak_hook_strcmp</code></span> (for string comparisons). The values populate libFuzzer's table of recent compares and will be incorporated into the fuzzer input bytes via random mutations.</p>
<h2>Value profile support</h2>
<p>The table of recent compares is usually quite effective at letting the fuzzer progress through simple compares in which the required input can be obtained directly by inserting bytes reported via the compare hooks. But real-world fuzz targets are rarely that simple. For example, a function might encode the input into Base64 or apply a simple, non-cryptographic checksum function, followed by a comparison. In these cases, the relation between the input required to explore the fuzz target further and the bytes reported via callbacks is highly non-trivial.</p>
<p>libFuzzer's <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#id33" rel="nofollow">value profile</a>, which can be enabled with the runtime flag <span><code>-use_value_profile=1</code></span>, can be very helpful in this situation. In this mode, for every comparison between two values<span></span>, an extra set of coverage counters will be incremented for every matching bit position in <span><code>A</code></span> and <code><span>B</span></code>. This allows the fuzzer to track its partial progress in getting <span><code>A</code></span> and <span><code>B</code></span> to match, thereby simplifying the problem from brute force (exponential time) to a linear search (linear time).</p>
<p>Since Jazzer builds on libFuzzer and reports string comparisons using <span><code>__sanitizer_weak_hook_strcmp</code></span>, basic value profile support is automatic.&nbsp;Allowing the value profile to track comparisons between integral types is a more difficult task as the relevant fuzzer hooks such as <span><code>__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4</code></span> do not take the address of the compare instruction as an argument. Instead, these hooks retrieve the return address from the stack via the <span><code>__builtin_return_address</code></span> compiler intrinsic.</p>
<p>While this is a very natural approach for instrumented native binaries, our calls to the callbacks all go through the JNI and will thus have the same native return address somewhere in the JNI dispatcher. This would mean that the fuzzer would not be able to distinguish between different compare instructions, which would render the value profile <span>largely useless for non-string types</span>. We initially considered submitting a patch to LLVM that would add variants of the compare callbacks that take a call site address as an additional argument, but then found a way to provide full value profile support even without upstream changes.</p>
<p>A small piece of inline assembly in the Jazzer driver implements a "trampoline" that can invoke any of the libFuzzer callbacks with an arbitray fake return address <span><code>addr</code></span>, e.g., a unique ID assigned to a bytecode instruction (see <a href="https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer/blob/v0.9/driver/sanitizer_hooks_with_pc.cpp">sanitizer_hooks_with_pc.cpp</a> for the implementation). The trampoline first pushes an address pointing to the <span><code>addr &amp; 0xFFF</code></span>-th entry in a "sled" of <span><code>0xFFF + 1=4096</code></span>&nbsp;ASM <span><code>ret</code> </span>instructions to the (native) stack and then performs a direct jump (also called a "tail call") to the sanitizer callback.&nbsp;The callback will see the address of the <code>ret</code> corresponding to the lower 12 bits of the synthetic address <span><code>addr</code> </span>as the return address via <span><code>__builtin_return_address</code> </span>and associate the bit-wise progress made in the comparison with it in the value profile map.&nbsp;Since libFuzzer only uses the lower 12 bits of an address for the purpose of the value profile, this allows for fast and complete value profile support also for integral types.</p>
<h2>FuzzedDataProvider</h2>
<p>Both libFuzzer and Google’s Python fuzzer <a href="https://github.com/google/atheris" rel="noopener">Atheris</a> provide convenience functions that transform the raw byte input received from the fuzzer into useful primitive types, such as strings, integers, and arrays. While working on Jazzer's analogue of such a <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code></span>, we found the two prior implementations to differ in <span>quite a few relevant ways</span>. Adding our own experience with building fuzzers to the mix, we arrived at the following design decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jazzer's <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>turns raw fuzzer input bytes into valid JVM strings by carefully applying the least number of bit changes required to turn the input bytes into valid UTF-8. This differs from the approach taken by Atheris, which randomly chooses between ASCII, UTF-16 and UTF-32. We found the fuzzing to be more stable if a consistent, ASCII-compatible encoding is used throughout the <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>and the libFuzzer callbacks. This however comes at the cost of added complexity in the implementation of the string generation functions: The JNI internally uses an encoding that historically predates UTF-8 and is best described as "UTF-16 code points encoded using UTF-8, with special handling of zero bytes". <span>We found this additional complexity</span> to be worth it based on the increased fuzzing efficiency.</li>
<li>The provider distinguishes between "data byte" and "choice bytes". More complex data which is likely to be parsed by the fuzz target, such as strings or arrays of primitive types, is consumed from the beginning of the fuzzer input. Small primitive types such as single integers, floats, and booleans, which are more likely to guide control-flow, are consumed from the end of the fuzzer input. This idea goes back to libFuzzer's <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>and has two key benefits: It makes the consumed fuzzed data more stable under the typical mutations applied by libFuzzer<span>and also ensures</span> that corpus entries preserve the structure of valid input files (e.g., JSON, PDF, or JPEG files) as much as possible.</li>
<li>Reproducing crashes in fuzz targets using a <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code></span> would be challenging if it always required running the crashing input through the driver. For this reason Jazzer, in addition to the crashing input dumped by libFuzzer, creates a Java-only reproducer for every crash. This reproducer contains all values consumed from the <span><code>FuzzedDataProvider</code> </span>in serialized form and can be run like any other Java program without any native dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Custom method hooks</h2>
<p><a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2020/may/27/science-on-memory-unsafety-and-security/" rel="nofollow">Experience shows</a> that roughly 65% of all serious security bugs found in projects using languages without memory-safety guarantees stem from incorrect memory handling. For the most part this high percentage is likely explained by how difficult memory handling can get if memory-safety is not built into the language from the ground up. However, there is another part to this story: With the likes of AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, there is excellent tooling available to detect such bugs with fuzzing.</p>
<p>While there is no need to detect violations of memory-safety for Java applications (at least those without native libraries), <span>other vulnerabilities </span>such as SQL injections, path traversals, or infinite loops occur in JVM-based languages just as often as they do in C/C++. One of the core ideas behind Jazzer is that the higher-level structure of JVM bytecode compared to native binaries coupled with suitable "sanitizers" should make these bugs detectable via fuzzing. For this purpose, Jazzer includes a flexible <a href="https://codeintelligencetesting.github.io/jazzer-api/com/code_intelligence/jazzer/api/MethodHook.html" rel="nofollow">annotation-based mechanism to hook methods</a>, regardless of …</p></article></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p>Creating a traditional computer program involves a fixed sequence of steps. First, we need to understand the problem and translate it into formal logic. Then, we implement that in code. Often surprisingly, the implementation of a program’s logic is comparatively easy. The challenging part is understanding and translating the problem.</p>
<p>The more complex systems become, the more brainpower we spend to understand them. It becomes necessary to distill the problem and its logic into components, which are easier to work with. Given an input to a component, we know which output to expect. Even before writing a single line of code, we formalize these expectations in <em>contracts</em>. These contracts describe how various components interact with each other. And ultimately, how the overall system interacts with the real world. Once the software is written, we can ensure that the contracts hold. This process makes the concept of failure transparent and clearly defined.</p>
<p>This way, we have managed to build <em>extremely</em> safe software systems that can operate in real-world environments. For example, software autopilots for airplanes, which have been in use for half a century<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, don’t fail even once in a billion flight hours. To put this in perspective, think about flying a Boeing 747 around Earth 22 million times<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. We don’t expect it to fail once in that time! Flying is the safest mode of transport<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> for a good reason. It is designed with failure in mind.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-era-of-machine-learning">The New Era of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>But things have changed over the past decade. More recently, the idea of letting a computer learn program behavior with data has heralded a new era of <em>machine learning</em>. It is now one of the most powerful tools of our age.</p>
<p>Machine learning can leverage statistical dependencies in data to learn complex input-output mappings. The program behavior is deduced from data. Therefore, we no longer need to distill the logic and implement it in code. Instead, the computer does so from data. We no longer have to translate the problem into formal logic. Instead, the computer does so from data. To some extent, we don’t even have to understand the problem anymore – or at least we are fooled into believing that we don’t.</p>
<p>Through machine learning, a computer can learn behaviors that are much more complex than anything humans can describe with hand-written rules. On well-designed datasets, or sometimes even in well-controlled environments, we can now do things that we couldn’t even imagine with traditional software.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://david-haber.github.io/images/aisafetyreqs.png" alt="AI systems have all of the developmental and operational problems of traditional code, plus a vast additional set of AI-specific issues. AI software typically operates with more uncertainty, and it is challenging to demonstrate its safety and compliance."> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Traditionally, we left the difficult parts – like understanding and translating the problem – to humans. We explicitly defined the behavior of traditional programs. Now machine learning solves this for us. It automatically distills the problem and its assumptions into a model. As a result, we can learn much more complicated program behaviors. But, at the same time, the understanding and behavioral guarantees of traditional software are lost. The contracts, which we previously relied on, no longer exist. This makes it much more difficult to analyze AI behavior, let alone to demonstrate its safety.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-mindset-for-ai-development">A New Mindset for AI Development</h2>
<p>AI systems have the same developmental and operational problems as traditional software, plus a vast set of AI-specific issues. As a result, <a href="https://david-haber.github.io/posts/ai-discipline/" target="_blank">companies can create impressive demos but fail to translate them into real products</a>. Or even worse, they operate AI software with a lot more uncertainty. This has already led to catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Regulatory organizations, industry-specific working groups, and researchers are investigating how existing safety standards can be extended to cover the additional challenges of AI software. With decades of experience certifying traditional software, they know that safety <em>follows</em> from adopting a system-level view. Moreover, it requires a mindset that holds all stages of the development process accountable, from requirements collection to end-user interaction.</p>
<p>AI development teams must adopt a similar top-down approach. Crucially, this means a development workflow that looks beyond the model. We need to systematically combine the best practices from traditional software with the tools specific to AI. Only then can we reestablish the contracts that traditional software relies on, reduce the uncertainty around AI applications, and achieve the failure rates that mission-critical applications require.</p>
<p>With quickly evolving regulatory standards and improving machine learning tools, we now have a chance to get this right. Both sides of the table, regulators and industry, need to work together to create frameworks that support innovation, not stifle it.</p>

<p>Wrangling dates and times in JavaScript can be a headache. JavaScript date libraries provide user-friendly APIs and useful utilities that alleviate some of that pain. But with so many options how do you pick the best one? In this post we delve into the world of JavaScript date libraries to help you choose. Our top pick, <strong>date-fns</strong>, delivers the best feature set combined with an elegant modular architecture.</p>
<h2 id="our-picks">Our picks</h2>
<h3 id="best-overall-date-fns">Best overall: <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/date-fns">date-fns</a></h3>
<p><strong>date-fns</strong> offers great documentation, functional architecture, and utilities that handle almost any task you can think of. If dates are a critical concern for your JavaScript application, use <strong>date-fns.</strong>&nbsp;Each feature has clear documentation written in ESM (ES Modules) for the browser. Logical and consistent function names encourage readable code. A modular architecture allows build tools to trim away unused code for a slimmer final build.</p>
<h3 id="best-for-time-zones-luxon">Best for time zones: <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/luxon">Luxon</a></h3>
<p>If time zones or localization are your primary concern, we recommend <strong>Luxon</strong>. <strong>Luxon</strong> leverages JavaScript’s <code>Intl</code> for speed and slimness while providing what <code>Intl</code> doesn’t: an immutable user-friendly API. Concise, well-written documentation eases the learning curve for getting started.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="best-minimalist-option-dayjs">Best minimalist option: <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/dayjs">Day.js</a></h3>
<p>For basic handling of dates, <strong>Day.js</strong> is a minimalist library that offers an excellent API without much overhead. While <strong>Day.js</strong> has fewer features than <strong>Luxon</strong> or <strong>date-fns</strong>, it’s much smaller in size.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-a-datetime-package">When to use a JavaScript date library</h2>
<p>Why not just use JavaScript’s built-in <strong>Date</strong> object? A good JavaScript date library provides a clear advantage over JavaScript’s <strong>Date</strong> in several ways: immutability, parsing, and time zones. In addition, JavaScript date libraries offer useful utilities for date manipulation and formatting, which can save developers time and energy.</p>

<p>JavaScript’s <strong>Date</strong> is mutable, which can lead to unintentional bugs. Let’s say you create a <strong>Date</strong> object named <code>currentTime</code>. You display it on top of the website. Another developer comes in and wants to create a widget that displays next weeks events. They use <code>currentTime.setDate(currentTime.getDate() + 7)</code> at the top to the widget to display next week’s date. However it also changes the date in the header! Oops. With an immutable date library, adding a week would create a new instance so the original would not change.</p>
<p>While <strong>Date</strong> has a <code>parse</code> method, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date">MDN documentation for <strong>Date</strong>‘s <code>dateString</code> notes</a> that usage is “strongly discouraged.” An excellent answer in the Stack Exchange question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20463521">Why does Date.parse give incorrect results?</a> describes in detail differences in formatting standards and browsers lead to inconsistent and unreliable results. If you need to parse, a date library is a must.</p>

<p>Time zones are another major frustration. <strong>Date</strong> in the browser always represents the local system date stored as milliseconds since January 1st, 1970 in UTC. A <strong>Date</strong> can rendered as a <code>string</code> in a different time zone using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl"><strong>Intl</strong></a>, but the <strong>Date</strong> itself is always the local system time.</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong> also lacks utilities for common tasks like creating human-readable relative dates. Using library utilities for such tasks can save a lot of time.</p>

<p>In the meantime, be aware of the limitations of <strong>Date</strong> and use a library when you need one.</p>
<h2 id="our-previous-pick-momentjs">Our previous pick: Moment.js</h2>
<p>For a long time <strong>Moment.js</strong> was king of the JavaScript date libraries, but in 2020 <strong>Moment.js</strong>‘s maintainers published a <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status">Project Status</a> announcing they consider Moment.js a legacy project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The maintainers argued that there was no way to refactor <strong>Moment.js</strong> to meet the demands of modern JavaScript development such as immutability and tree shaking. Lighthouse (Chrome’s built-in auditing tool) warns against using Moment because of its large size (329 kb).</p>
<p>For these reasons, we do not include it as one of our recommended picks. If you are looking for a replacement to <strong>Moment.js</strong> that closely matches its API, try <strong>Day.js</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-picked">How we picked</h2>
<p>We looked at data from <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a> and <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/">NPM trends</a> to identity the most popular and trending libraries and evaluated them against these core criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser-friendly</strong>: We evaluated JavaScript date libraries for use directly by the browser rather than the Node.js backend.</li>
<li><strong>Great documentation</strong>: Users look to this to implement the library correctly. We looked at the parts the facilitate this process: organization, search, examples, and the individual pages relating to the methods we tested.</li>
<li><strong>Modularity + Tree shaking</strong>: Modular architecture allows you to shrink your library size by “tree-shaking” out any library code you’re not using. Common build tools capable of tree-shaking include <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a> and <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">Rollup</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: Feature-richness was just one factor. We also considered whether a library was especially good at certain tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Measuring performance gives us a clue at how fast each library performs common operations. This usually isn’t noticeable but in large, complex apps can cause lag.</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: One of the biggest problems people had with <strong>Moment.js</strong> was size. A large library can substantially increase page load times.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-bug features</strong>: Immutability, readability, and informative error messages can help prevent bugs. When code is readable, you can learn a lot about what it does by reading it. Format, syntax, and naming conventions can make all the difference in readability.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-we-tested">How we tested</h3>
<p>When evaluating each library we made a CodePen using Skypack. We attempted to pick out common use cases that illustrate differences between libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rendering the current date &amp; time</li>
<li>Rendering the current date using a custom format</li>
<li>Modifying a date to add/remove time</li>
<li>Working with timezones</li>
<li>Parsing arbitrary date strings</li>
</ul>
<p>First we implemented these cases using JavaScript’s <strong>Date:</strong></p>
<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="15606" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="melissamcewen" data-slug-hash="NWRMoLm" data-preview="true" data-pen-title="datetime example">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen/pen/NWRMoLm"> datetime example</a> by melissa (<a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen">@melissamcewen</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>We wrote up examples for performance testing on <a href="https://perf.link/">perf.link</a> and all of the tests and code are available in the <a href="https://github.com/melissamcewen/date-time-perf-examples/">Date/time performance examples GitHub repository</a>. If you have a specific use-case, you can modify one of the provided examples. JavaScript date libraries contain hundreds of methods and features that we couldn’t test them all. Instead, we opted to test the same methods demonstrated in our Codepens.</p>
<figure id="attachment_79" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/testing-performance-perf-link-skypack-javascript-date-library-1024x559.jpg" alt="A code block imports all the tested libraries via Skypack, then there are four blocks showing code for adding a week to a date using each JavaScript date library.

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/melissamcewen/pen/YzGMyyd">A chart of the performance data is also available on CodePen</a>. The data&nbsp; doesn’t indicate a clear advantage for any one library. Each JavaScript date library implements different features differently, so that’s not surprising.</p>

<p>The sizes listed on each review are based on loading via the Skypack CDN. If you’re using a build tool to tree-shake and the library is tree-shakable (like <strong>date-fns</strong>), the size will depend on what parts you use. For evaluating libraries with tree-shaking we recommend <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/">Bundlephobia.</a></p>
<p>A caveat to our testing is we did not consider back-end <code>Node.js</code> use. Many JavaScript date libraries rely on browser APIs so may not work correctly on the back-end.</p>
<h4 id="other-cases-to-test">Other cases to test</h4>
<p>Depending on your needs there are lots of other tests you could do. If you’d like to test other features not covered here, you can make changes to any of the examples in our embedded Codepens or <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/DKYbjR">CodePen date collection</a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it let us know if we have an invalid date when we pass in invalid items? For example moment(undefined) behaves like moment() and doesn’t output an error, which could lead to bugs.</li>
<li>How well does it handle different languages and locales?</li>
<li>Can it render relative dates (like “4 days ago”)? Can it do this in different languages?</li>
<li>Does it work in older browsers?</li>

<p><strong>date-fns</strong> is a pleasure to use, offering all the benefits of a modular architecture and covering almost any date use case. Our example shows the power of good naming and syntax in conveying information. Code like <code>add(now, {days: 7})</code> is straightforward to understand even if you’re unfamiliar with <strong>date-fns</strong>.</p>
<p>To get the most out of <strong>date-fns’</strong>s modular architecture, use a tree-shaking build tool (see our criteria section) and import only the features you need:</p>
<pre><code>import { format, add, getHours, parse } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/date-fns@2.16.1";
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, a tree-shaking build tool would remove all code from <strong>date-fns</strong> that’s not used in <code>format</code>, <code>add</code>, <code>getHours</code>, or <code>parse</code>. The final build would be much slimmer. Still at 58.9kb for the whole package, it’s not giant in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>date-fns</strong> doesn’t package a browser build for NPM (<a href="https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/1780">see the related GitHub issue</a>) and therefore only works on CDNs that transform for the browser like <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack</a> and <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/esm">ESM.run</a>. However, documentation has examples labeled for the browser as both ESM(ES Modules) and ES2015. This ensures developers don’t get confused trying to run <code>Node.js</code> backend code in the browser.</p>
<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
<p>Although we liked almost everything about <strong>date-fns</strong>, it is not for everyone. For starters, <strong>date-fns</strong> seems geared towards experienced developers working with a professional tool chain. Working without a build tool, the tree-shaking advantage disappears.</p>
<p>Note that our CodePen example starts with a <code>const now = new Date()</code>, which is the default JavaScript <strong>Date</strong> object. As noted in our <strong>Date</strong> section a <strong>Date</strong> is always the current system’s time zone. <strong>date-fns</strong> has a separate library for working with time zones using helper functions. We found the documentation and examples for these helper functions less consistent than the main <strong>date-fns</strong>. Our resulting code is less readable than the rest of the examples. Our time-zone example for <strong>date-fns</strong> is 4 lines of code, compared to 1 for <strong>Luxon</strong>.</p>
<p>Another quirk we encountered was if you Google “date-fns parse” the top results take you to the <a href="https://date-fns.org/v2.0.0-alpha.9/docs/parse">v2.0.0-alpha docs for parse</a>, which no longer work (the current version is 2.16). We found ourselves using Google because the documentation’s built-in search seems to search only title and descriptions of sub-pages. The information architecture of the menu could also use improvement, as we would it overwhelmingly …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>There are a whole bunch of popular interview questions that can be solved in one of two ways:
Either using common data structures and algorithms in a sensible manner, or by using some properties of XOR in a seemingly hard to understand way.</p>

<p>While it seems unreasonable to expect the XOR solutions in interviews, it is quite fun to figure out how they work.
As it turns out, they are all based on the same fundamental trick, which we will derive in a bottom-up way in this post.
Afterwards we will look at a bunch of applications of <em>that XOR trick</em> ™, such as solving this popular interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are a number of straightforward ways to solve this problem, but there is also a perhaps surprising one using XOR.</p>

<h3 id="xor">XOR</h3>

<p>XOR is a logical operator that works on bits.
Let’s denote it by <code>^</code>.
If the two bits it takes as input are the same, the result is <code>0</code>, otherwise it is <code>1</code>.
This implements an <em>exclusive or</em> operation, i.e. exactly one argument has to be <code>1</code> for the final result to be <code>1</code>.
We can show this using a truth table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Most programming languages implement <code>^</code> as a bitwise operator, meaning XOR is individually applied to each bit in a string of bits (e.g. a byte).</p>

<p>For example:</p>



<p>since</p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because of this, we can apply XOR to anything, not just booleans.</p>

<h3 id="deducing-some-useful-properties">Deducing Some Useful Properties</h3>

<p>We can derive a bunch of properties from the previous definition.
Let’s go through them one by one, and then compose them to solve the interview questions previously mentioned.</p>

<h4 id="xor-and-0-x--0--x">XOR and 0: <code>x ^ 0 = x</code></h4>

<p>If one of the two arguments to XOR is <code>0</code>, then the remaining argument is the result.
This directly follows from the truth table by checking the rows where <code>y = 0</code>, namely the first and third row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="xor-on-the-same-argument-x--x--0">XOR on the same argument: <code>x ^ x = 0</code></h4>

<p>If the two arguments are the same, the result is always <code>0</code>.
Again, we can convince ourselves that this is true by inspecting the truth table.
This time we have to check the rows where <code>x = y</code>, i.e. the first and last row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Intuitively, this means that if we apply XOR to the same arguments, they cancel each other out.</p>

<h4 id="commutativity-x--y--y--x">Commutativity: <code>x ^ y = y ^ x</code></h4>

<p>XOR is commutative, meaning we can change the order in which we apply XOR.
To prove this, we can check the truth table for both <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
      <th><code>y ^ x</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As we can see, <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code> always end up with the same value.</p>

<h4 id="sequences-of-xor-operations">Sequences of XOR operations</h4>

<p>By combining all of this, we can deduce the central insight behind everything that is about to follow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The XOR trick</strong>: If we have a sequence of XOR operations <code>a ^ b ^ c ^ ...</code>, then we can remove all pairs of duplicated values without affecting the result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commutativity allows us to re-order the applications of XOR so that the duplicated elements are next to each other.
Since <code>x ^ x = 0</code> and <code>a ^ 0 = a</code>, each pair of duplicated values has no effect on the outcome.</p>

<p>Let’s go through an example of this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>  a ^ b ^ c ^ a ^ b     # Commutativity
= a ^ a ^ b ^ b ^ c     # Using x ^ x = 0
= 0 ^ 0 ^ c             # Using x ^ 0 = x (and commutativity)
= c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because <code>^</code> is a bitwise operator, this will work regardless of what kind of values <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are.
This idea is really at the heart of how XOR can be used seemingly magically in many situations.</p>

<h3 id="application-1-in-place-swapping">Application 1: In-Place Swapping</h3>

<p>Before we solve the problem of finding the missing number, let’s start with this simpler <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/">problem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swap two values x and y in-place, i.e. without using any helper variables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out that one can easily solve this problem using the following three XOR instructions:</p>



<p>That seems a bit mysterious.
Why do we end up swapping <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> if we do this?</p>

<p>To see how it works, let’s go through this step by step.
The comment after each instruction shows the current values of <code>(x, y)</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x ^= y # =&gt;                      (x ^ y, y)
y ^= x # =&gt; (x ^ y, y ^ x ^ y) = (x ^ y, x)
x ^= y # =&gt; (x ^ y ^ x, x)     = (y, x)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that this is really just using the properties derived earlier.</p>

<p>The fundamental insight here is that having <code>x ^ y</code> in one register and <code>x</code> in the other, allows us to perfectly reconstruct <code>y</code>.
Once <code>x ^ y</code> is stored (instruction 1), we can just put <code>x</code> into the other register (instruction 2), and then use it to change <code>x ^ y</code> to just <code>y</code> (instruction 3).</p>

<h3 id="application-2-finding-the-missing-number">Application 2: Finding the Missing Number</h3>

<p>Let’s finally solve the problem posed in the beginning of this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are many straightforward ways of solving this, but we did set out to do it using XOR.</p>

<p>From the XOR trick we know that having a sequence of XOR statements means we can remove all duplicated arguments.
If we just XOR all values in the given list, however, we cannot apply this trick because there are no duplicates:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code>A[n - 2]</code> is the last index of a list of <code>n - 1</code> elements.</p>

<p>What we can do additionally is to also XOR all values between 1 and n:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>1 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ n ^ A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give us a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All values in the given list now appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The missing value appears exactly once:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we XOR all of this, we essentially remove all values that appear twice, thanks to the XOR trick.
This means that we are left with the missing value, which happens to be exactly what we were looking for in the first place.</p>

<p>Coded up, it looks something like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># XOR of all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>^=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># XOR of all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>^=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just looking at the code, this seems to be a difficult to understand algorithm.
When knowing how the XOR trick works, however, it becomes fairly trivial.
I think that also shows why it is unreasonable to expect this solution in an interview: It requires knowledge of a very specific trick but not much algorithmic thinking beyond that.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the next application, let me follow up with two remarks.</p>

<h4 id="generalizing-this-beyond-integers">Generalizing this beyond integers</h4>

<p>While we worked on integers from 1 to n so far, this is not required.
In fact, the previous algorithm works in any situation where there is (1) some set of potential elements and (2) a set of elements actually appearing.
The sets may only differ in the one missing element.
This worked out nicely for integers because the set of potential elements just corresponds to the elements from 1 to n.</p>

<p>One could imagine applications where the elements are not integers from 1 to n:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The set of potential elements are <code>Person</code> objects and we ought to find the <code>Person</code> missing from a list of values</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are all nodes in a graph and we are looking for a missing node</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are integers in general (not necessarily from 1 to n) and we want to find a missing integer</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="arithmetic-operators-instead-of-xor">Arithmetic operators instead of XOR</h4>

<p>If the algorithm still seems a bit magical – which I hope it does not – it might help to think about how one could achieve the same result using arithmetic operators.
This is actually fairly straightforward:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># Add all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># Subtract all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>-=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add all potential integers and then subtract the ones actually appearing.
The solution is not as nice because one would need to handle overflows and because it requires the type of the elements to support <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> with certain properties.
It, however, has the same logic of elements canceling each other out because they appear a certain number of times (once positive, once negative).</p>

<h3 id="application-3-finding-the-duplicate-number">Application 3: Finding the Duplicate Number</h3>

<p>Here’s where it gets fun: We can apply the <em>exact</em> same solution to a similar interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n + 1</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is <strong>duplicated</strong>. Find this duplicated number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s think about what happens if we just apply the exact same algorithm as in the previous solution.
We would get a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The duplicated value appears three times:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>twice because it was duplicated in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All other values in the given list appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were unique in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As previously, all the duplicated elements cancel each other out.
This means we are left with exactly what we are looking for: the element that was duplicated in the original array.
This element appearing three times, combined with XOR, reduces to that very element:</p>


<p>All other elements cancel each other out because they appear exactly twice.</p>

<h3 id="application-4-finding-two-missingduplicate-numbers">Application 4: Finding Two Missing/Duplicate Numbers</h3>

<p>It turns out we can take this even further.
Consider the following, slightly more difficult, problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n - 2</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except <strong>two</strong> numbers, which are missing. Find these two missing numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As before, the problem is completely equivalent when looking for two <em>duplicated</em> numbers, instead of two <em>missing</em> numbers.</p>

<p>And I am sure you guessed it, but we will stick with what worked before and start exactly the …</p></article></div>

But those companies don’t control the project in this case, there is a foundation behind it. This is the ideal situation, when there is no company behind the project. Of course, each company pushes in their direction, but no one can change the project license.</p> <p>On the other hand you have Mongo or Elastic, they created the project and control it. Their business model depends on the project, so to protect it they’ll do whatever is needed. There are plenty of examples of companies changing license terms to limit what other companies -basically large cloud services providers- can offer. Mongo, Elastic, Redis, Mapbox are recent examples.</p> <p>We truly believe in open source. Ideally following the foundation way, but any piece of code that enables others to do things is welcome in our book. Open source is one of the things that make the world a better place: COVID vaccine scientists used spark for its development, Wikipedia uses Kafka (and runs entirely on open source software), OpenStreetMap uses Postgres and PostGIS.</p> <p>In our previous companies, we based most of our products on open source technology but we often felt we weren’t contributing enough. Not just because you should feel the pressure to contribute if you are making money out of it; also because if you are contributing to it, it probably means you really understand how it works and therefore your product will be better.</p> <p>Our service relies heavily on Clickhouse, the database Yandex published as open source a few years ago. It’s one of the best pieces of technology I’ve seen, the kind of software you get when you put the best minds to solve one hard problem.</p> <p>We have been contributing to the database with some pull requests, but not as many as we would like. And even though we understand Clickhouse inside and out now, we feel that’s not enough. That’s why we have decided to hire developers to work on the open-source project full-time.</p> <p>For a company of our size this means a long-term effort but we are pretty sure it will pay off in the short and medium-term. And not just for us but for everybody facing the same problems we are trying to solve.</p> <p>If you are a C++ developer and like working on high-performance projects you’ll feel at home at Tinybird. Please take a look at the <a href="https://www.tinybird.co/jobs/clickhouse-developer">Clickhouse Developer job offer</a> and consider applying.</p> </div>  </article>  </div> </div></div>]]>

                    <p><code>I2C</code> is a communication protocol which was originally designed and used for inter-board communications between peripherals, like the processor talking to an EEPROM in a system. These days it is also used for short distance communication with sensors - not what it was designed for, but it works anyway. Wikipedia has this to say about <code>I2C</code>:</p>

<p><i>I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), pronounced I-squared-C, is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus invented in 1982 by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors). It is widely used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. Alternatively, I2C is spelled I2C (pronounced I-two-C) or IIC (pronounced I-I-C).</i> (thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">Wikipedia</a>!)</p>


<p>I've been playing around with some <code>I2C</code> based sensors from SparkFun. They have <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic">QWIIC</a> connectors making it easy to speak to them from SparkFuns <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16832">OpenLog Artemis</a>. The OpenLog Artemis can log sensor data to SD card and also presents itself as a serial device where it streams data from the sensors in a CSV-like format. It works great and I can highly recommend the whole <code>QWIIC</code> ecosystem.</p>

<p>Occationally I need to use one of the <code>QWIIC</code> sensors from some FreeBSD based system, without the <code>OpenLog Artemis</code>. In this case I am using a <code>Raspberry PI Zero</code> with FreeBSD a 13-CURRENT from December. This is easy because the <code>QWIIC</code> system is just plain <code>I2C</code> underneath, so it is easy to hook a sensor up directly to the <code>GPIO</code> pins of the RPI with <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14988">one of these</a>.</p>

<p>In FreeBSD land we have <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=i2c&amp;sektion=8">i2c(8)</a> which is a userspace utility for reading and writing to <code>I2C</code> devices. I will start by going over basic usage before diving deeper into the actual sensors I am playing with in this learning session.</p>

<p>My test rig for this blogpost looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://people.bornhack.org/tyk/i2c/IMG_20210206_201331.jpg"><img src="https://people.bornhack.org/tyk/i2c/IMG_20210206_201331.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<h3>Basic I2C on FreeBSD</h3>
<p>First things first, I need some hardware with an <code>I2C</code> bus which is exposed to FreeBSD. I am using a <code>Raspberry PI Zero</code> and the <code>I2C</code> bus looks like this in <code>dmesg</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# grep I2C /var/run/dmesg.boot 
iicbus0: &lt;OFW I2C bus&gt; on iichb0
iic0: &lt;I2C generic I/O&gt; on iicbus0
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>The first sensor I've hooked up is a SparkFun <code>TMP117</code> temperature sensor. According to the <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-tmp117-high-precision-digital-temperature-sensor-hookup-guide">hookup guide</a> the default <code>I2C</code> address of this sensor is <code>0x48</code> which matches what I am seeing after hooking up the hardware and running <code>i2c(8)</code> with the <code>-s</code> flag to make it scan the <code>I2C</code> bus for devices:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -s
Hardware may not support START/STOP scanning; trying less-reliable read method.
Scanning I2C devices on /dev/iic0: 48 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>After connecting an additional sensor which has a default <code>I2C</code> address of <code>0x60</code> the bus scan can see that device too:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -sv
dev: /dev/iic0, addr: 0x0, r/w: r, offset: 0x00, width: 8, count: 1
Hardware may not support START/STOP scanning; trying less-reliable read method.

[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<h3>Reading From I2C Devices</h3>
<p>Reading from the sensor is straightforward. I specify that I want to read with <code>-d r</code> (meaning <code>read</code>), the length of data to get with <code>-c 2</code> (meaning 2 bytes) and the address of the device to read from with <code>-a 48</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr
0d 67 
[root@pizero1 ~]# while true; do date; i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr; sleep 1; done
Sun Dec 20 00:51:45 UTC 2020
0d 67 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:46 UTC 2020
0d 67 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:48 UTC 2020
0d 66 
Sun Dec 20 00:51:49 UTC 2020
0d 66 
^C
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>After some trial and error I also add <code>-m tr</code> to set the <code>addressing mode</code> to <code>complete-transfer</code> which is needed on this I2C bus to make everything work.</p>

<p>The reading shown is a hex value, exactly two bytes as requested with <code>-c 2</code>.</p>

<p>When reading temperature from this sensor I don't need to add <code>-o</code> to the <code>i2c(8)</code> command to specify an offset, since the temperature is stored in the first register in the device. If I wanted to read from the next register (which for the <code>TMP117</code> is where the configuration is stored) I would use <code>-o 1</code>:

</p><pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 1
22 20 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>

<p>All the registers in the <code>TMP117</code> are 16 bits (or two bytes), but the <code>I2C</code> command can read or write any number of bytes, just specify the width with <code>-c</code>.</p>

<p>Trying to read more data than the register size just results in FF bytes being returned:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr
0c bc 
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 4 -m tr
0c bc ff ff 
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 40 -m tr
0c bd ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>


<h3>Writing To I2C Devices</h3>
<p>The <code>i2c(8)</code> utility also makes it easy to write values back to the device. The <code>TMP117</code> sensor has a programmable low and high thresholds in registers 2 and 3. The first one defaults to <code>0x6000</code> and changing it is much like reading, except we want the bytes to be written on <code>stdin</code>:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 00 
[root@pizero1 ~]# echo -en "\x60\x01" | i2c -a 48 -d w -c 2 -m tr -o 2
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 01 
[root@pizero1 ~]# echo -en "\x60\x00" | i2c -a 48 -d w -c 2 -m tr -o 2
[root@pizero1 ~]# i2c -a 48 -d r -c 2 -m tr -o 2
60 00 
[root@pizero1 ~]# 
</pre>


<h3>Understanding Readings From the TMP117 Sensor</h3>
<p>Reading the <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/9/e/5/1/8/tmp117.pdf">datasheet</a> for the <code>TMP117</code> sensor I learned that the temperature readings are stored in the first register, as a 16-bit value, which means I use <code>-c 2</code> for <code>i2c(8)</code> so it reads two bytes (16 bits) from the sensor.</p>

<p>The datasheet for the <code>TMP117</code> has this to say about the register where the temperature is stored: <code>The data in the result register is in two's complement format, has a data width of 16 bits and a resolution of 7.8125m °C.</code>.</p>


<h3>Two's Complement Format</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">Two's complement</a> is a widely used and convenient way to work with signed (negative) numbers in binary. Basically the most significant bit is used to indicate if what follows is a positive or a negative binary number.</p>

<p>The following table is from the <code>TMP117</code> datasheet, it shows some sample temperatures in celcius and what those readings translate to in decimal, two's complement binary, and hex:</p>

<p>I haven't worked much with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's complement format</a>, so I started out by familiarising myself with it in Python. I borrowed the following function from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1604464/twos-complement-in-python/37075643#37075643">SO</a> and started out by reproducing the values in the above table:</p>

<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# cat twos.py 
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def twos(binary_str, bytecount):
    integer = int(binary_str, bytecount)
    bytes = integer.to_bytes(bytecount, byteorder="big", signed=False)
    return int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder="big", signed=True)

print(twos(sys.argv[1], int(sys.argv[2])))
[root@pizero1 ~]#
</pre>

<p>Trying it out with the values from the table:</p>
<pre>[root@pizero1 ~]# echo "$(python twos.py 1000000000000000 2) * 0.0078125" | bc

<p>Looks like it works perfectly. Going from a reading to celcius is also easy, I tested with the values from the table again:</p>

She was among the first to earn a degree in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, has worked in the field of software development her entire career, and worked her way up to become president of her own custom software development company here in Michigan, and later on, a Senior Vice President of a Fortune 500 company.<br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><img height="400" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/I_JBY1MgrnV3vaSDYSKCmbpPcdBqZgHi3_BHf75JmS1hqsBnafdWNLk0FXO_znQO7STWS7LDumylUgns2hWV2RzUXClodbjRT04DPAvs8RRt0l_G7b8z9c7-nQRB5d2N5szEdbnT" width="400"></span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>This is an interview with Amanda about her early years in software development, back in the 1970s and 1980s, and about one project in particular that I remembered her doing from my days as a grade school kid.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>You were among the first Computer Science graduates at the University of Michigan, right?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I was! I graduated from Michigan with a Computer Science Degree in 1974. The Computer Science degree program was fairly new back then. We had no textbooks, just mimeographed handouts (which I wish I’d kept!).&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Nearly all of our work was done on an IBM System/360 Mainframe Computer, primarily by submitting our code on punched cards via a remote card reader. I took one class on a DEC PDP-8 Mini Computer, and I learned to build logic boards by soldering chips in an elective Electrical Engineering course. The programming languages were primarily Fortran and Assembler.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Only 43 of us graduated with a Computer Science degree from U of M in ‘74. Fun Fact: I graduated without ever actually seeing the IBM System/360 Computer!</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>What did you do after graduation?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I worked as a Programmer for various companies (and customer accounts).&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>My first assignment was to single-handedly write the real time process control code to run a custom carburetor test stand for Oldsmobile.&nbsp; The computer was a16-bit Modcomp mini computer with 16K of memory, and no disk! When I started that project, I knew nothing about Modcomp computers, their operating system, their language -- or what a carburetor was!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I wrote the code in an Assembler level language, and loaded my compiled code into the machine via paper tape.&nbsp; When I found a bug in my code, I wrote the fix, de-compiled it by hand, converted it to hexadecimal, and keyed the fix into memory using 16 binary switches.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Writing process control code was fun because I could actually see my code working as it opened and closed mechanical valves, and turned stepping motors. I was only 21, but I did successfully complete the project.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>That’s pretty amazing! As a developer these days, there are so many layers of indirection between code we write, and what’s actually happening at the hardware level.&nbsp; You actually got to add instructions to memory directly, with no steps in between! (And without Google or StackOverflow to help you know what to do!)</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>After that, you worked at a startup called Custom Software Services, right? What was your role there?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>In 1981, Custom Software Services, a programming consultancy startup in the Detroit area, hired me to work part-time on a two-month project. I only had 3 years of programming experience at the time, because I took a 4-year break when you and Jeremy were born. My assignment was to single-handedly develop a daily Profit and Loss system for a local restaurant chain on an IBM Series/1 Computer (a 16-bit mini computer with the EDX Operating System), using a low level language called EDL. At the time, CSS had only one employee. After the project was completed, I stayed on to work on other projects. After 4 years, I went full time as a programmer.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>Highland Superstores was a big appliance sales company back in the 1980s, right? What was the project that you did for them?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores was a national chain of 100 appliance stores selling TVs, electronics, washers, dryers and refrigerators. In 1987, the Internet did not yet exist. Highland Superstores wanted a networked Point of Sale (POS) system in all of their stores, and headquarters. The system would track their inventory, daily sales, gross margins, commissions, and so forth.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores wanted a system to enable the salespeople on the floor to negotiate pricing, view how a lowered price negatively affected their own commission, check accurate up-to-date store inventories, sell the items, and schedule delivery.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Before this system, a salesperson had to leave the customer (or make a phone call) to check inventory in the back of the store. Salespeople had no idea if the next closest store had the item in stock that his customer desired. It was important to Highland to have up-to-date inventories of ALL of their stores available in each store. With this feature, a salesperson would be able to sell the item, and send the customer to the next closest store to pick it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>The POS system in each store had to communicate and update the headquarters computer every 15 minutes. It also had to download inventory updates from the other stores every 15 minutes.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>How did IBM get involved in this project?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores had spent 2 years working with another local software company to develop the POS system using PC LANs, but it wasn’t working and Highland was getting frustrated.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Rick Teague, Highland’s IBM Salesperson, told them that putting an IBM System/36 in each store, all communicating with an IBM System/38 at their headquarters, would work.&nbsp; The hardware was up to the job.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>With no Internet, how did this kind of communication work? Dial-up modems?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Yes, dial-up modems. The POS system had to dial the headquarters IBM System/38 every 15 minutes, establish a connection, upload the local store inventory, and download updated inventories from the other 99 stores.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>You mentioned Highland was getting frustrated? What was the issue with the other company’s in-progress implementation?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Well, they couldn’t get their PC LAN system to work. If I remember correctly, their software could perform&nbsp; the in-store functionality, but it had a great deal of trouble getting the communications with headquarters to work properly and quickly.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>So how did you, and CSS, get involved in this project?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>The IBM System/36 hardware solution was a good idea, but there was no POS software to run on that platform. Since Highland Superstores had been paying another software company, they weren’t willing to fund another software development project on a different platform.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Rick said, “If I can get your POS system up and running in one of your stores on an IBM System/36, will you buy 100 System/36s?” Highland Superstores said maybe, provided they didn’t have to spend any money for the trial, and that the system would be up and running in the pilot store in 90 days!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Highland Superstores also made it clear they were keeping their focus and money on the PC LAN-based solution. The new IBM System/36-based solution would have to out-perform a solution that had a two-year head start!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>IBM approached several software companies in the Detroit area, and asked if they would be willing to develop the POS system for free, demonstrate that it worked, and then hope to get paid afterwards. They all said “No”... except my boss, Don George, who owned Custom Software Services.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Our company had about 15 employees at the time, business was slow, and we were in danger of going under.&nbsp; Don was an ex-IBM Systems Engineer, so he knew the guys in the local IBM office. He sat down and had some serious discussions with them about the project, and then he decided to take on the risk and tackle the project. I got involved when my boss asked me to manage the project.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>That does sound like quite a risk! What was it like working on a project, and leading a team, that would have a zero payout for everyone involved if it wasn’t successful?&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>It was extremely challenging. We couldn’t afford to pay a team of developers to write the software, so Don came up with a creative idea to share the risk. He offered several local developers a double-or-nothing deal. If they signed on with our project, we’d track all of their hours, and then pay them double their going hourly rate at the end -- if it was successful and Highland Superstores purchased it. If not, they’d get zero.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Surprisingly, he found 7 developers who were willing to take his offer, but they all had to keep their day jobs. So, they worked on our POS project nights and weekends.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>And you were in charge of managing this? How did you approach that?</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>I was 34 years old, and this was my very first project management assignment. The first thing I did was to read 3 books on project management. I knew that the project would be very difficult, and that I’d have to use every bit of education, new knowledge, guts, and perseverance I had!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>As it turned out, it was even more stressful, and challenging that I’d first thought. The project lasted 5 months, not 3. At the 90 day mark, we had accomplished enough that we earned another month or two as a grace period.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>The developers and I were all working 2 shifts, 7 days a week. Over that summer, none of us had any family time, or vacation time. There were many days when I came home late at night, dropped my clothes on the floor and fell into bed. Then, the next morning, I showered, grabbed clean clothes and was gone again. We worked 2 shifts, 7 days a week. The good news is that as the project progressed, everyone had more skin in the game. The developers saw their potential earnings mount, and became more and more unwilling to walk away.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>When we had the code (in the RPG language) running on a remote IBM System/36, IBM installed a System/36 in one of the Highland Superstores (for a free trial), and we spent about a month troubleshooting and debugging the software in a live store environment.</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span><span>That must have been exhausting! How about the flip side? Was there a best part about the project?</span></span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>Yes! No scope creep! This was the only software development project I’ve ever worked on with zero scope creep.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span><span>We didn’t realize at first, how important this would be, but it was one of the biggest contributors to the project’s success. There was no scope creep because Highland Superstores had already invested 2 years in hammering out the functionality of the system. All we had to …</span></span></span></p></div></div>

<article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I spend a fair amount of time wandering around in the terminal. The chances
are that you are too since you dared to open this story. My daily activities
led me to contribute to various kinds of projects (professional, personal and
open-source). For my sanity, I tend to follow strict rules to organize my
workspace, which helps me keep things tidied up and easily reachable. Or so I
thought.</p>
<p>I decided to arrange my projects by following the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces">Go
philosophy</a>: make the
arborescence mirrors the urls where they are reachable. e.g.,
<code>~/Workspace/src/github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles</code> would contain the
project <a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> owned by
<a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet">@aymericbeaumet</a> and accessible at
<a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. That’s great, but I am now facing a complex
directory structure tedious to navigate quickly. Making it, in the end,
harder to access the resources I need.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/back-end
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Nobody wants to manually deal with this.</em></p>
<p>Remembering and typing the location of each project (even while leveraging
autocomplete) is time-consuming. Creating shell aliases is not scalable.
Instead, I would like to rely on the pseudo-unicity of each project name to
find it among all the directories on my computer.</p>
<h2 id="z">z?</h2>
<p>Several tools exist to tackle this problem. My favorite is
<a href="https://github.com/rupa/z"><em>z</em></a>. It follows the Unix philosophy by being
small, focused and interoperable. <em>z</em> allows jumping around swiftly,
automatically learning from your habits. The entries are ranked based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency">frecency</a> at which you access the
directories.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the basics of this tool. Below is how I advise to install
it for Zsh on macOS (the install process should be similar for other shells
and operating systems):</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>brew <span>install </span>z
<span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"source '</span><span>$(</span>brew <span>--prefix</span> z<span>)</span><span>/etc/profile.d/z.sh'"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> ~/.zshenv
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Install z for Zsh on macOS.</em></p>
<p>Note how installing <em>z</em> is not enough to start using it. You have to source
<code>z.sh</code> at the beginning of each shell session to activate it. The <code>~/.zshenv</code>
configuration file is appropriate as Zsh <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html">loads it in most
circumstances</a>, making the
tool accessible in a wide-variety of contexts (terminals, editors, IDEs,
scripts, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="lets-play">Let’s play</h2>
<p>Once the install and setup are complete: start a new shell session, <code>cd</code>
through some folders and execute <code>z</code> to confirm it has been accurately
tracking your activity:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z | <span>sort</span> <span>-rn</span> | <span>head</span> <span>-3</span>
5331.72    /Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/back-end
637.255    /Users/aymericbeaumet/Workspace/src/github.com/brigad/ops
386.198 /Users/aymericbeaumet/.config/dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Top 3 directories based on frecency.</em></p>
<p>As shown above, I spend quite some time navigating through
<a href="https://github.com/brigad">Brigad</a> projects, but it seems I also often
access my <a href="https://github.com/aymericbeaumet/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> to tweak
some configuration. The ranking score is volatile, and one could observe
significant changes in a brief amount of time.</p>
<p>Now that <em>z</em> has accumulated some knowledge try it by navigating to one of
the tracked folders. Navigating is as simple as executing the <code>z</code> command
followed by the directory name:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z dotfiles
<span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/Users/aymericbeaumet/.config/dotfiles
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Navigating by matching with a whole directory name.</em></p>
<p>As a matter of facts, I do prefer to leverage partial matching (imagine <code>**</code>
surrounding your search pattern) to type fewer characters. Hence, <code>z dot</code> is
valid and should produce a similar behavior as <code>z dotfiles</code> (modulo possible
name collisions, but you get the idea). This works because <em>z</em> relies on
regular expressions. For example, the snippet below will navigate to the
directory ending with the letters “tmp” (with the highest score):</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>z tmp<span>$</span>
<span>$ </span><span>pwd</span>
/private/tmp
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><em>Navigating by matching with a regular expression.</em></p>
<p>Neat right? I guess you start seeing the possibilities of this tool. And we
have only scratched the surface of its capabilities. I suggest you dive in
its <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z/blob/master/README">documentation</a> to get an
idea of its full potential. Features such as autocomplete, subdirectories
matching, consecutive matching, etc. are a game changer.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><em>z</em> is tremendous. This tool saves me a non-trivial amount of time every
single day. When one starts relying on it, there is no going back. And I hope
it’s going to fit your workflow as well as mine.</p>
<p>I would be grateful to hear any of your time-saving tricks. Feel free to
share your experiences!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>It's hard to be in IT, cause your friends have no idea what you do. Engineer, product manager, QA — how does it all differ from fixing a printer in the office? (tip: you don't get $150k/year for fixing printers).</p> <p>You also can't really talk to normal people about IT, because they use this industry, but they don't get it. But there's a topic you can raise with any mortal, that will get their attention: data privacy.</p> <p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/intro.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Typical privacy talk" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/intro.png" height="335" width="600"> </a> </p> <blockquote> <p>Disclaimer:</p> <ul> <li>this one is a biggie. I tried to add some pics and jokes so I don't mess with my readers' clip culture;</li> <li>if you're from IT — well, it would be like learning the alphabet once again. Probably you won't find anything new; if you do, that is a bad sign for your employer.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>How do they gather data about us? Will VPN and incognito mode save us? Maybe we should all just pack our stuff and go into the woods and make friends with wolves and bears?</p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#part-1-classification" id="part-1-classification">  </a><p>Right to privacy in some sense consolidates all other rights as well: to vote, freedom of expression, equal opportunities, and so on. Once you lose your right to privacy you're screwed. Most of the people can easily be caught in a mind trap <em>"I have nothing to hide, why would I care?"</em>. Common mistake. You shouldn't worry about stuff you wanna hide, you should worry about what is in plain sight.</p> <p>This topic is so broad I was forced to come up with a categorization of a sort. I thought of it for no less than 3 minutes and this is the result: the most important thing is how obvious it is for an end user who stores the data, what the data really is and how it is manipulated. So, 3 variables: actor, data, and manipulation. A simple 3-dimensional matrix — you remember I wrote even a dumbass will understand the article? you don't remember? Me neither. Apparently, I didn't write it.</p> <p>Actor:</p> <ol> <li><strong>immediate receiver</strong>. When you give your phone number to get a new discount card the store gets your phone number. Yes, it's the first incredible insight from the article, thanks, Dan — you're welcome, my fellow reader.</li> <li><strong>shadow receiver</strong>. Is it obvious though that in that case your phone number will be sold to anyone else? Would you like it if Google and Facebook found out you are a regular customer of a brothel called "Tight flower bud"? Have no doubt, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/technology/facebook-expands-targeted-advertising-through-outside-data-sources.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they will buy that shit</a>. You're only starting to type "Epstein didn…" and the FBI already checks what toilet paper you use to threaten your ass using Braille writing system — all thanks to your Walmart discount card, ffs.</li> </ol> <p>Data:</p> <ol> <li><strong>stuff you give away consciously</strong>. You open another app that turns you into a cutie doggie. It asks for access to your photo gallery and camera, and you obviously allow it. What can go wrong?</li> <li><strong>stuff you didn't mean to give away</strong>. Mmm, 3896 photos you took over the last 3 years. These photos also contain <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXIF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meta-tags</a> with geo-coordinates of the place the photo was taken. So it means it is a very <a href="https://github.com/KrauseFx/detect.location" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accurate history of your moving</a>. Who would have thought the app gets programmatic access to all the photos and not just the one you choose.</li> </ol> <p>Manipulation:</p> <ol> <li><strong>storing</strong>. Let's get back to the photos. If you choose a photo to add a doggie face, this photo can be stored on the servers of this service for god knows how long. Nothing strange.</li> <li><strong>calculation</strong>. But, as I said, the app also gets access to the whole gallery. Is it that obvious that the app can get a pretty accurate guess on what is your home and work addresses are based on the time and geo-location of each photo? Or that it can run every image against <a href="https://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/151148689421/open-sourcing-a-deep-learning-solution-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an ML algorithm that finds NSFW images</a> and securely upload it to the servers? I hope your fucking doggie face was worth it.</li> <li><strong>selling</strong>. <em>If you don't pay for the product, you are the product</em>. What a cliché. Instagram is free because every single person on Earth can buy ads for a very specific audience. Those who travel to beaches, who loves certain food or have a high income. Instagram calculates all of this from the enormous data set they have, and the advertiser can combine these segments however they want. Of course, once you click an ad the advertiser knows exactly what segment you are in. <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/targeting.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Targeting accuracy" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/targeting.png" height="543" width="600"> </a> </li> <li><strong>hacks or leaks</strong>. Oh, guys and gals, when we get to this I'll turn your camera on to capture how surprised you'd be. For now, just believe me: <em>all the companies</em> lose the data from time to time, from a small garage startup to Google, from a small accounting firm to Revenue Service of an entire country. I get chills from some of the most notorious cases, really.</li> </ol> <p>Some of the bullets require some explanation (and we'll get to that!) because laymen for some reason think Big Corporations are not that bad and want good for humanity. Well, if you also think that your frustration will be very painful.</p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#part-2-actors" id="part-2-actors">  </a><p>Let's go top to bottom. Cumplucters are connected with a huge Great Internet-Network and they talk to each other using Magic Requests.</p> <p><em>(all of it are eligible terms, I'm a pro, believe me)</em></p> <p>When you visit someone's blog your computer makes a request to another computer and gets some response. But the response does not go directly to the server, it has a few stops on the way. Each stop has its own dangers. </p> <p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/request_flow.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Request flow on the internet" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/request_flow.png" height="293" width="600"> </a> </p> <blockquote> <p>The outline is super simple, its accuracy is around 60%, but according to British scientists <a href="https://www.getscience.com/biology-explained/how-genetically-related-are-we-bananas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you are a 60% banana</a>, so if you're very interested go check out <a href="https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the whole story of the request</a>.</p> </blockquote> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#device-dns" id="device-dns"> <h2>Device → DNS</h2> </a><p>Machines identify each other using ip-addresses — those look like 4 numbers split out with dots, like <code>127.0.0.1</code>. People are not that good with numbers, we're used to strings, like <a href="https://dkzlv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dkzlv.com</a>. We call it "domain".</p> <p><em>God save you if you'll come telling me about ipv6.</em></p> <p>But the computers still work — all thanks to a thing called DNS (Domain Name Server, clear, isn't it?). Think of it as a huge table in Excel that translates a domain into an ip-address.</p> <p>DNS will be the first leak. The problem is that the founding fathers of the internet didn't foresee this informational revolution and they made the information exchange with the DNS completely unencrypted. Later we'll talk about transport layer security, but the idea is simple: your internet provider will always know what sites you visit. Sometimes it can even modify the answer from the original DNS if the site owner does not implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNSSEC</a>.</p> <p>Answering your question: yes, your provider knows you visit <em>the site</em>, which makes you sweat like a dog.</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong>: we have a few. You can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNS-over-TLS (DoT)</a>. There's some difference that smart people get (I really don't), but you shouldn't dive into these details.</p> <p>You remember those tech guys who came to your house that set up the internet? They should have given you a piece of paper and said "don't lose this". You immediately threw it in the garbage after that, AND YOU DID RIGHT. It had your provider's DNS there, and that tech guy set up your router to use it. "It helps you with speed" — they said. "Insecure shit" — we understand. They do not support DoT and unlikely they will ever support it, because why would they.</p> <p>Try to use independent DNS-servers. I recommend using Cloudflare DNS with a cool ip-address: <strong>1.1.1.1</strong>. It's free, fast and they promise a zero-logs policy, so they don't save anything about your dirty little secrets. They have <a href="https://1.1.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps for smartphones</a>, that setup everything magically, so use them, otherwise it's kind of difficult to setup.</p> <p>It gets trickier for desktops. First, you need to setup a DNS <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setting-up-1.1.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the OS level</a>, and then turn on <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-will-eventually-roll-out-in-all-major-browsers-despite-isp-opposition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an experimental DoH support in the browser</a>.</p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/en/how-they-harvest-data#device-provider-datacenter-server" id="device-provider-datacenter-server"> <h2>Device → Provider → Datacenter → server</h2> </a><p>There are two types of connections: secure and not secure. You'll get a notification about an insecure connection from the browser if it's not an old piece of mammoth shit. If it's not an old piece of black rhino's shit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rhinoceros" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which got extinct in 2013</a>, it will even ask you to think carefully if you should use this site at all.</p> <p>If you see a notification about an insecure connection, you'd be safer to just close this site and do nothing there. Believe me, this site may be as bad as having unprotected sex with a partner that has radial red stripes spreading from their genitalia.</p> <p> <a href="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/secure_channel.png" target="_blank"> <img alt="Most secure connection of all" src="https://dkzlv.com/static/img/posts/en_privacy1/secure_channel.png" height="720" width="600"> </a> </p> <p>Insecure connections have no real vulnerabilities, except a small one: every single intermediary has complete control over stuff you send and receive — so it means a complete lack of any security at all. Some mobile operators, for example, <a href="https://tjournal.ru/tech/62611-pochemu-megafon-bessovestno-pokazyvaet-reklamu-na-chuzhih-saytah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">embed their fullscreen ads</a> on insecure sites without asking any permission from site owner.</p> <p>So let's talk about secure connections. I'll give you a small lecture about cryptography (no, it has near to no connection to cryptocurrencies) and how the network works so you can impress your grandma.</p> <p>If you're not a Ph.D. in cryptography and haven't launched an ICO from school's canteen, it good enough to know there are two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric is the one that has a single key for both encryption and decryption. Asymmetric one is where you use one key to encrypt stuff (it's called <strong>public key</strong>) and another key to decrypt it (it's called <strong>private key</strong>).</p> <p>Nobody really knows how the math works (like nobody really knows how so heavy-looking planes manage to fly the sky), but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol</a> that powers all this voodoo-shenanigan is safe enough for you to send sacred cat photos to your family.</p> <p>So, we use both types of encryption. It's rather boring to read, so I wrote a play that illustrates the whole process.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Characters</strong>:</p> <p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: young Alamaba fella having troubles with girls for some strange reasons.</p> <p><strong>Hannah</strong>: just a girl I added here to make a full picture.</p> <p><strong>Jimmie's phone</strong>: the device that sends messages.</p> <p><strong>Pinder</strong>: an app. <em>(any similarities to reality are entirely coincidental)</em></p> <p><strong>Pinder's server</strong>: the server that receives messages.</p> <p><strong>Act 1</strong></p> <p><em>Jimmie types a message to Hannah in Pinder</em></p> <p><strong>Jimmie's phone</strong> (talks to Pinder's server_): Hi there, good fellow. My guy wants to write yet another message (<em>signs</em>). Let's do this quickly and securely. I know HTTPS.</p> <p><strong>Pinder's server</strong>: Hi there, pal. Yeah, I get it. I know HTTPS as well. Here's the plan: first, I'll send you my public key, …</p></blockquote></div></div>

		<p><em>Update: an updated version of the ideas in this blog post appears in <a href="https://manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">chapter 9 of my book</a>. </em></p>
<p>URLs are a cornerstone of the web, and are the basic means by which content and resources are shared and disseminated. People copy and paste URLs into Slack or WhatsApp to share interesting links. Google crawls the web, discovering and indexing such links. But what happens when the page you want to link is not public and requires credentials in order to view or interact with it? Suddenly a URL is no longer sufficient, unless the recipient happens to already have credentials. Sometimes they do, and everything is fine, but often they do not. If we really do want to give them access, the problem becomes how to securely pass along some credentials with the URL so that they can access the page we have linked.</p>
<p>A commonly desired approach to this problem is to encode the credentials into the URL itself. While convenient, this solution is fraught with dangers and frequently results in credentials being exposed in insecure contexts. In this article, we’ll look at various ways to accomplish this, the ways that things can go wrong, and conclude with a set of guidelines for cases where this can be made secure, and actually improve security overall.</p>

<h2>What kind of credentials?</h2>
<p>The most usual kind of credential to grant access to a protected resource would be a username and password. Way back in the prehistory of the web there was a standard way to encode a username and password into a URL using the following syntax:</p>
<pre>http://bob:sekret@example.invalid/some/path</pre>
<p>Here “bob” is the username and “sekret” is the password. The way this was supposed to work is that when you clicked on that link, the web browser would automatically submit the username and password using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP Basic</a> authentication (or possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication">Digest authentication</a>, but we should never talk of that). This turned out to be a terrible idea for many reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, putting your username and password in plaintext into a URL that can then be copied far and wide is a really quick way to account compromise. Giving your username and password to somebody else just so they can look at one of your cat photos is not the best idea in the world.</li>
<li>Basic authentication just Base64-encodes the credentials, so unless you were using SSL then the password would be recoverable to anybody observing the network traffic. While sites sometimes put SSL on the login page, they often didn’t bother for other parts of the site (relying on time-limited session cookies instead), so sending a username and password to a random URL was quite risky. This is much better now with the widespread adoption of HTTPS.</li>
<li>Due to the way Basic authentication works, after you have logged into one page with it, your browser will helpfully and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617#section-2.2">proactively send the username and password to every other page on the site</a> under the same path. This can leak credentials to unrelated pages.</li>
<li>It was soon realised that using a URL like <code><a href="http://www.google.com:search@example.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com:search@example.com</a></code> was a really easy way to create convincing-looking phishing links.</li>
<li>If the target of the URL is a login endpoint, then the attacker can attempt to get you to click on the link to perform a <a href="https://support.detectify.com/customer/portal/articles/1969819-login-csrf">Login CSRF</a> attack. In this case the honest user ends up with a session cookie for an account under the control of the attacker.</li>
</ol>
<p>For all these reasons, this specific form of URL was deprecated back in 2005, and now support within browsers is patchy: Safari for instance will just silently ignore any username:password component when following such a link. Other browsers will tolerate them in some cases, but this varies considerably by browser and often by version to version. Some versions of Chrome refuse to follow such links and instead display a large red phishing warning page.</p>
<p>So if not a username and password, then what kind of credentials could we put in a URL? Ideally you’d want a limited-scope credential that provides only permission to access that one specific URL in just the ways that the sharer of the link intends (e.g., read-only access). This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least authority</a> (POLA). Typically this is done by creating an unguessable <em>bearer token</em> that grants limited access to anybody that holds the token (the token bearer). There are two basic approaches to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The token on its own is sufficient to grant access. This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capability-based security</a>. This is similar to how keys work in the physical world, with the token here acting as the key. Just as with a real key, you can have different keys (capabilities) for different doors (URLs) so that one key does not grant access to everything.</li>
<li>The token grants some subset of the permissions of the person/agent who authorised it. Access is granted based on the permissions granted by the token as well as the identity of the user that approved it (the <em>resource owner</em>). This is the model used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/uma/Home">UMA</a>, and a real-world analogy would be a signed note from a teacher granting a child permission to go and fetch something from a store cupboard at school. The teacher’s signature and identity grant the authority here, and the note describes the scope of the permission being granted.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will refer to both methods as <em>capability URLs</em> in this article, although strictly speaking that term only applies to the first option.</p>
<h2>Why put tokens in URLs at all?</h2>
<p>The OAuth approach is pretty popular these days as a way of granting limited access to third parties without giving away your username and password. The capability approach is less common, but has some <a href="http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/Walnut/Secure_Distributed_Computing#Capabilities">attractive security properties</a>. In both cases, if we want to follow POLA then we will end up with many fine-grained tokens that grant access to specific resources. We then have to make sure that we use the right token with the right URL, otherwise we might be denied access and also leak security tokens to unauthorized parties.</p>
<p>If we instead use broad-scope tokens and reuse them for many URLs then we run the risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem">confused deputy</a> attacks, where an attacker tricks us into adding our token to a request of their choosing. This is the basis of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF attacks</a> against session tokens, and the same thing can happen with OAuth tokens if the code that adds access tokens to requests is not carefully written. Often UI code is written to add an access token to every request transparently, as a convenience for the developer. If an attacker can influence any of the requests you make, such as by manipulating URL parameters or the URL fragment, then they may still be able to trick your UI code into adding its token to a request of the attacker’s choosing.</p>
<p>Capability-based systems avoid confused deputy attacks because they fundamentally combine <em>permission to act on something </em>with the <em>ability to name that thing</em>. You can’t name an object you don’t have access to, and you can’t just add a permission token to any request to any resource. In an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">object-capability</a> programming language, capabilities are references to objects; if you hold a reference to an object you can call the methods on it, and you can’t just create a reference out of nowhere. On the web, we can achieve some of the same advantages by combining unforgeable tokens with URLs. CSRF attacks become impossible as the attacker cannot construct a valid URL in the first place (think of this as a bit like anti-CSRF tokens directly in the URL itself). Phishing becomes pointless as there are no credentials to phish independent of the links they are part of. In certain cases, even XSS attacks become less effective, as we shall see later.</p>
<h2>How to do it safely</h2>
<p>Many security professionals reading this will baulk at the very idea of putting security tokens into URLs, and with good reason. A <em>lot</em> can go wrong. Let’s look at some ways to add credentials to URLs and how they can go wrong. Firstly, there are some issues that are common to all methods of putting credentials in URLs:</p>
<ul>
<li>URLs may be saved in the history of a browser, making them potentially accessible to the next user of a public terminal. Most browsers support private browsing modes that can be used on public browsers to prevent this, but use of a public terminal is always a risk. If somebody gains access to your computer or phone, then this may also be a threat even on your own device. Using time-limited tokens in URLs can help mitigate against these threats.</li>
<li>URLs within page content may be cached by the browser and by web proxies. Use of TLS and proper <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control">Cache-Control</a> headers can reduce this risk.</li>
<li>URLs in the content of a HTML page may be sniffed by other scripts running in the page. Sandboxing untrusted 3rd-party scripts in iframes can help, but a more general technique is to avoid links directly in HTML, as we shall see later.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tokens in the path or in query parameters</h3>
<pre>https://example.com/users/<span>Kay2xVuid_tiWxJ5NI0NWmGxQ7Y</span> https://example.com/users/bob?key=<span>Kay2xVuid_tiWxJ5NI0NWmGxQ7Y</span></pre>
<p>An obvious place to put a token in a URL is either into the path (perhaps using random names for resources) or into the query parameters. This is nice and simple, but suffers from some drawbacks.</p>
<p>Firstly, such URLs might inadvertently leak in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer">Referer header</a> when loading resources from other sites. This can also happen via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/referrer">document.referrer</a> field available in Javascript when a third-party resource is loaded in an iframe (ironically, often done to isolate the 3rd-party code). These days the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy">Referrer-Policy</a> header can be used to prevent these kinds of leaks, but browser support is not yet 100%.</p>
<p>A second drawback is that URL path elements and query parameters are often logged in access logs of any servers that the request passes through, making tokens vulnerable to anybody who has access to those logs. The more widespread deployment of HTTPS has reduced this risk, but it still common to terminate TLS at a load balancer or reverse proxy (or even <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204144518-SSL-FAQ">in the cloud</a> before it ever reaches your own servers). The request may then pass through several other gateways and services before being processed (even more …</p></div></article></div>

  <p><i>Posted on <code>16 Feb 2021</code> by
  <code>Boris Kolpackov</code> with comments on <a href="https://redd.it/ll1l6z"><code>r/cpp/</code></a></i></p>

  <p><b>TL;DR</b>: <code>build2</code> now provides conforming and scalable
  support for all the major C++20 Modules features when used with GCC. This
  includes named modules, module partitions (both interface and
  implementation), header unit importation, and include translation. All of
  these features are also supported in libraries, including consumption of
  installed libraries with information about modules and importable headers
  conveyed in <code>pkg-config</code> files. As part of this effort we have
  also created a collection of <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/">examples</a> that
  demonstrate C++20 Modules features that impact the build process.</p>

  <p>Before going into detail on each of these features, let's clarify what we
  mean by <i>conforming</i> and <i>scalable</i>. With GCC (and soon with
  Clang), <code>build2</code> uses the module mapper mechanism to discover
  module and header unit dependencies and communicate their mapping to the
  compiler. As a result, <code>build2</code> does not place any restrictions
  on the structure of translation units or module features used. In other
  words, it is able to handle any conforming C++ module or header unit.</p>

  <p>Similarly, <code>build2</code> does not place on the user any modules
  support burden that would not scale to general, real-world projects and
  use-cases. Specifically, it does not expect the user to manually specify and
  maintain module name to file name mapping, their dependency information, or
  arrange pre-building of any modules or header units, including of system
  headers. In particular, <code>build2</code> will automatically build header
  units if and when imported or include-translated.</p>

  <div>
  <p>While <code>build2</code> support for modules is complete and reasonably
  reliable, at the time of writing the same cannot be said about GCC. As a
  result, until the situation improves, the implementation is meant more for
  early experimentation rather than production use. See <a href="#try">How to
  Try</a> for details.</p>

  <p>One <code>build2</code> feature that is not yet handled by the module
  mapper is support for auto-generated headers. However, this support has
  already been successfully prototyped during the early modules development in
  GCC and we hope to revive and complete it in the near future (see <a href="https://wg21.link/P1842">P1842</a> for details).</p>

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-module"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-module</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  

  <p>Building named modules with <code>build2</code> is fairly
  straightforward. Here is a minimal example consisting of three files,
  <code>hello.mxx</code>, <code>main.cxx</code>, and
  <code>buildfile</code>:</p>

  <pre>// hello.mxx

export module hello;

import &lt;string_view&gt;;
import &lt;iostream&gt;;

export namespace hello
{
  void
  say_hello (const std::string_view&amp; name)
  {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; '!' &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  }
}</pre>

  <pre>// main.cxx

import hello;

int
main ()
{
  hello::say_hello ("World");
}</pre>

  <pre># buildfile

cxx.std = experimental
cxx.features.modules = true

using cxx

assert $cxx.features.modules "no modules support for $cxx.signature"

mxx{*}: extension = mxx
cxx{*}: extension = cxx

exe{hello}: {cxx mxx}{*}</pre>

  <p>If you place all three files into some directory, you should be able to
  build it like this (see <a href="#try">How to Try</a> for details):</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11
c++ .../include/c++/11.0.0/h{string_view}
c++ .../include/c++/11.0.0/h{iostream}
c++ mxx{hello}
c++ cxx{main}
ld exe{hello}

$ ./hello
Hello, World!</pre>

  <p>As you might have noticed, we used a different extension
  (<code>.mxx</code>) for our module interface (<code>hello.mxx</code>)
  compared to other source files (for example, <code>main.cxx</code>). We
  recommend that you follow this practice (using the <code>.mpp</code>
  extension if your source files use <code>.cpp</code>). If, however, you
  would like to use the same extension for all translation units, you can, you
  will just have to sort them out in your <code>buildfiles</code>, for example
  (after renaming <code>hello.mxx</code> to <code>hello.cxx</code>):</p>

  <pre>mxx{*}: extension = cxx
cxx{*}: extension = cxx

exe{hello}: mxx{hello} cxx{main}</pre>

  <p>If you compare the above three files to the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-module"><code>hello-module</code></a>
  example, you will notice that the latter has quite a few more files and some
  internal structure. The reason is that <code>hello-module</code> is a
  package with a structure more suitable for real-world projects. In contrast,
  the above three files are a simple build system-only project more suitable
  for quick tests and prototypes.</p>

  <div>
  <p>Because modules support in GCC is currently experimental and incomplete,
  we have to explicitly force this feature either with the following in our
  <code>buildfile</code>:</p>

  <pre>cxx.std = experimental
cxx.features.modules = true</pre>

  <p>Or by overriding on the command line:</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx.std=experimental config.cxx.features.modules=true ...</pre>
  </div>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-partition"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-partition</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  <p>There is not much difference in dealing with module partitions compared
  to primary module interfaces: both interface and implementation partitions
  should use the same extension as module interfaces (or otherwise be
  explicitly listed as <code>mxx{}</code> targets, as shown above). See the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-partition"><code>hello-partition</code></a>
  example which shows the use of both interface and implementation
  partitions.</p>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-header-import"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-header-import</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  <p>Importing header units is straightforward: simply replace
  <code>#include</code> directives with <code>import</code> declarations and
  hope the compiler can handle it. In fact, we've already used header units in
  our named module example above. Here is another example:</p>

  <pre>// main.cxx

import &lt;iostream&gt;;

int
main ()
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}</pre>

  <pre># buildfile

cxx.std = experimental
cxx.features.modules = true

using cxx

assert $cxx.features.modules "no modules support for $cxx.signature"

cxx{*}: extension = cxx

exe{hello}: cxx{*}</pre>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11
c++ .../include/c++/11.0.0/h{iostream}
c++ cxx{main}
ld exe{hello}</pre>

  <p>Naturally, importation is not limited to standard library headers and we
  can also import our project's own headers as demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-header-import"><code>hello-header-import</code></a>
  example.</p>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-header-translate"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-header-translate</code></a>
  for the complete example.</p>

  <p>Instead of manually replacing <code>#include</code> directives with
  <code>import</code> declarations in our source code we can translate them on
  the fly. To control which headers are translated we use the
  <code>config.cxx.translate_include</code> configuration variable. For
  example, we can try to translate all the importable headers:</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11 config.cxx.translate_include=all-importable</pre>

  <p>Since include translation is non-intrusive, you can try it on any project
  that uses <code>build2</code> by forcing modules support and enabling
  include translation, for example:</p>

  <pre>$ b config.cxx=g++-11 \
  config.cxx.std=experimental \
  config.cxx.features.modules=true \
  config.cxx.translate_include=all-importable</pre>

  <p>Which headers are importable? The C++20 standard specifies that all the
  C++ standard library headers (but not the C library wrappers) are
  importable. For example, this is how we can translate only importable
  standard library headers:</p>

  <pre>config.cxx.translate_include=std-importable</pre>

  <p>We can also mark our own headers as importable with the
  <code>cxx.importable</code> variable, for example:</p>

  <pre># buildfile

...

# Assume headers are importable unless stated otherwise.
#
hxx{*}: cxx.importable = true</pre>

  <p>There could also be third-party headers that are not explicitly marked as
  importable. To handle this, we can request the translation of specific
  headers or header wildcard patterns, for example:</p>

  <pre>config.cxx.translate_include='&lt;iostream&gt; "&lt;boost/container/*.hpp&gt;"'</pre>

  <p>We can also disable the translation of specific headers or header groups,
  for example:</p>

  <pre>config.cxx.translate_include='all-importable std-importable@false'
config.cxx.translate_include='std-importable &lt;iostream&gt;@false'</pre>

  <p>You can also attempt to translate all headers by specifying the
  <code>all</code> header group. This is primarily useful for experimentation,
  for example, to discover which headers would break the build if
  translated.</p>

  <p>Finally, if we need to adjust or disable include translation for our
  project or for specific translation units in our project, we use the
  <code>cxx.translate_include</code> variable, for example:</p>

  <pre># buildfile

cxx.translate_include += &lt;iostream&gt;@false

obj{main}: cxx.translate_include = # Don't translate anything.</pre>

  

  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-module"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-library-module</code></a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-header"><code>cxx20-modules-examples/hello-library-header</code></a>
  for the complete examples.</p>

  <p>Building modules as part of a library does not pose any additional
  complications. Here is how we can convert our example from the <a href="#named-modules">Named Modules</a> section to build a library:</p>

  <pre># buildfile

...

exe{hello}: cxx{main} lib{hello}
lib{hello}: {cxx mxx}{* -main}</pre>

  <p>However, installing libraries with modules and then consuming the result
  in other projects (and potentially with other build systems) requires
  additional mechanisms. Specifically, the installation needs to convey which
  modules are provided by the library and the location of their module
  interface source files (the consuming build system also needs to arrange for
  the compilation of these interfaces on the side).</p>

  <p>Instead of inventing yet another file format, we choose to reuse the
  <code>pkg-config</code> files that <code>build2</code> automatically
  produces for every library it installs. Specifically, the
  <code>pkg-config</code> format supports free variables which is what we use
  to convey the modules information. For example, this is the relevant
  fragment from the <code>libhello.pc</code> file in the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-module"><code>hello-library-module</code></a>
  example (<code>..</code> in <code>hello..check</code> encodes the
  <code>:</code> module partition separator):</p>

  <pre>cxx_modules = \
  hello..check=/usr/include/libhello/check.mxx \
  hello=/usr/include/libhello/hello.mxx</pre>

  <p>Naturally, the same mechanism is used to convey which library headers are
  importable (from the <a href="https://github.com/build2/cxx20-modules-examples/tree/master/hello-library-header"><code>hello-library-header</code></a>
  example):</p>

  <pre>cxx_importable_headers = \
  /usr/include/libhello/check.hxx \
  /usr/include/libhello/hello.hxx</pre>

<p> <a href="https://www.de24.news/"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; editors of Titanic can currently no longer deliver the digital edition of their satirical magazine via the app in the Google Play Store. <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; background is a dispute with the tech company, which, according to the Titanic editor-in-chief, took offense at several magazine covers.</p>



<p>In particular, the December 2020 issue was rejected by Google because of the depiction of a sacred motif (profanity), which was rated as “obscene”: <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; cover of the magazine shows the Pope with a bare backside with a crucifix, and an angry one (because he is jealous of God ) Seeing Jesus with his genitals bared. <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; cover alludes to a cover picture of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, on which the Turkish prime minister could be seen in a similar scene.</p>

<h3>Titanic 12.2020</h3><figcaption> (Image: Titanic Magazine)</figcaption>
<h3 id="nav_antrag_auf__0">Application for re-listing rejected for the time being</h3>
<p>Two weeks ago, shortly before the appearance of the second edition in 2021, Google blocked the app of the satirical magazine with an automatically generated notice without warning, said the Titanic editorial team. This was followed by the demand to delete some older magazine covers with depictions of nudity and sexuality. It is curious that the Titanic app has been listed in the store since 2014 and actually had an age rating of 12 years due to the assignment as satire, explained Titanic editor-in-chief Moritz Hürtgen <em>heise online</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; East German magazine Eulenspiegel, for example, continues to be listed in the store with similarly drastic cover pictures, which is even available without age restriction. According to Hürtgen, as a compromise solution, his magazine had submitted an application for re-approval as an adult app with the age rating “18 and over”. However, Google rejected the application on Monday.</p>

<h3 id="nav__quot_verkniffen__1">“Connected Humor of Monopolwichsern”</h3>

<p>Moritz Hürtgen also affirmed that the satirical magazine will not bow to pressure from Silicon Valley: “TITANIC will not censor itself in order to do justice to the pinched humor of monopoly wankers in San Fernando Valley, err: Silicon Valley.” One would rather accept the loss of digital subscriptions and leave the store permanently if Google does not fully reactivate the Titanic app and its motifs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp;re had already been a misunderstanding with the Apple App Store in the past, but this could be resolved quickly (the lock was lifted, the Titanic app is still available in the App Store). <a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; long-suffering Titanic was also temporarily blocked once on Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="nav_alternative__2">Alternative delivery routes for subscribers</h3>
<p>Titanic claims that it has appealed against Google’s censorship request and is now also considering withdrawing its own app permanently from the Play Store. In the meantime, subscribers will be “supplied by other means”, says the Titanic website.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; Titanic editorial team currently offers subscribers direct delivery of print and PDF editions. Since, according to the editor-in-chief, the magazine “has no access to the contact details of the” Play Store “subscribers,” those affected by the app lock should report by email. Further information can be found in the entry in the Titanic news ticker. Anyone who would like to support the satirical magazine in the matter can still take out a classic print subscription.</p>
<h3 id="nav_die__3"><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; tech corporations and censorship</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.de24.news/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.de24.news/a1/de24.png?resize=400%2C20&amp;ssl=1" alt="© www.de24.news" width="400" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp; incident calls to mind censorship decisions on Facebook, for example, where in January the Board of Appeal had four of the five blocked bans revoked after a review. A Goebbels quote posted in English without context (which did not serve as a satire), false promises of salvation for COVID-19 and the depiction of bare breasts in the course of a breast cancer campaign were then again considered permissible.</p>
<p>In the past, breastfeeding mothers had successfully protested against the deletion of their pictures on Facebook. In the course of the “breast puritanism”, the ZDF Facebook page was temporarily blocked due to a medical image. In a recent report, Amnesty International criticized Facebook and Google for participating in the suppression of people and opinions.</p>

<p>The "Pico" board with the RP2040 chip developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation is the latest tiny fast and versatile board in Arduino Nano format. As you may already know, the board can be programmed using MicroPython and C/C++. In this tutorial, I extended the official MicroPython version to support cryptographic primitives, and this unlocks the possibility to connect the board (using the SX1276 chip) to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/">"The Things Networks"</a> (TTN) - which means LoRaWAN support.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__800.jpg" legend="Raspberry Pi Pico connected to the LoRa V2.0 board" width="400px" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__800.jpg 800w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__800.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__800.jpg 800w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/14e/4d0/d3e/602af6bae274a130446131__768.jpg 768w"></td></tr><tr><td><span>Fig. 1: Raspberry Pi Pico connected to the LoRa V2.0 board.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The RP2040 with a QFN-56 package has the following specifications:</p><ul><li>Dual-Core ARM Cortex-M0+ @133MHz</li><li>264KB of on-chip RAM</li><li>Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash Memory via a dedicated QSPI bus</li><li>DMA Controller</li><li>Interpolator and integer divider peripherals</li><li>30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analog inputs</li><li>2 x UARTs, 2 x SPI controllers, and 2 x I2C Controllers</li><li>16 x PWM Channels</li><li>1 x USB 1.1 Controller and PHY, with host and device support</li><li>8 x Raspberry Pi Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines</li><li>USB mass-storage boot mode with UF2 support for drag-and-drop-programming</li></ul><p>which makes it ideal for projects that need the LoRaWAN technology.</p><div uk-grid=""><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__768.jpg" legend="Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__768.jpg 768w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__400.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__768.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__768.jpg 768w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/576/93b/4e0/6029ab89c7a0c706498019__400.jpg 400w"><br><span>Fig. 2: Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040.</span></p></div><h2><span id="software-and-hardware-454294">Software and Hardware</span></h2><p>This section includes the software and hardware needed for this tutorial.</p><h2><span id="programming-the-raspberry-pi-pico-using-the-visual-studio-code-vscode-ide-454294">Programming the Raspberry Pi Pico using the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) IDE</span></h2><p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation recommends the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny Python IDE</a> to program the Raspberry Pi Pico, but I still prefer <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pycom.Pymakr">PyMakr plugin</a>. The only difference between programming an ESP32 and the Raspberry Pi Pico running MicroPython is that you need to set the <code>address</code> parameter in the <code>pymakr.conf</code> file to <code>"/dev/ttyACM0"</code> instead of <code>"/dev/ttyUSB0"</code> and the file results as:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "address": "/dev/ttyACM0",
    "username": "micro",
    "password": "python",
    "open_on_start": true,
    "safe_boot_on_upload": false,
    "sync_file_types":"py",
    "py_ignore": [
        "pymakr.conf",
        ".vscode",
        ".gitignore",
        ".git",
        "project.pymakr",
        "env",
        "venv",
        ".python-version",
        ".micropy/",
        "micropy.json",
    ],
    "fast_upload": false
}</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can upload, download and run files and projects as you usually do with an ESP32. For more information, take a look at <a href="https://lemariva.com/blog/2018/12/micropython-visual-studio-code-as-ide">this tutorial</a>.</p><div><p>The Pymakr plugin with version 1.1.8 is having compatibility issues with VSCode 1.53.1/2. Therefore, you need to downgrade <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_52">VSCode to 1.52.1</a>. I hope this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pycom/pymakr-vsc/issues/119">issue</a> will be solved soon. If you don't want to downgrade VSCode, you can try the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChrisWood.pico-go">pico-go</a> extension that is a derivative extension of Pymakr, which is working. </p><p> Take a look at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium">VSCodium</a> if you want a to have free release binaries.</p></div><h2><span id="diy-add-encryption-support-454294">DIY: Add Encryption Support</span></h2><p>To connect to LoRaWAN, you need AES encryption. The MicroPython version that supports the Raspberry Pi Pico is still very limited. So, I extended it to include the <code>ucryptolib</code> package.</p><p>I included the compiled custom firmware in the <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/micropython-pico-mbedtls">lemariva/micropython-pico-mbedtls</a> repository. But if you want to build the firmware from scratch, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>First, clone the Micropython official repository, and pull the pico-sdk submodule following these steps:
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git
cd micropython
#
# usually this shouldn't be necessary, but the master branch is not compatible with the actual pico-sdk
git checkout tags/v1.14
#
git submodule update --init -- lib/pico-sdk
cd lib/pico-sdk
git submodule update --init</code></pre></li><li>To build the RP2040 MicroPython port, you’ll need to install some extra tools (toolchain, etc.):
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi build-essential</code></pre></li><li>and build the <code>mpy-cross</code> tool:
<pre><code>cd ../..
make -C mpy-cross</code></pre></li><li>After that, add these <code>define</code>s lines to the <code>mpconfigport.h</code> file inside the <code>ports/rp2</code> folder:
<pre><code>#define MICROPY_PY_UCRYPTOLIB                   (1)
#define MICROPY_SSL_MBEDTLS                     (1)</code></pre></li><li>This means you need to add to the pico-sdk and compile the library <code>MBEDTLS</code>, which is nowadays not included. Therefore, I included that to the CMake project using this file:
<pre><code>include(ExternalProject)
ExternalProject_Add(
mbedtls
PREFIX ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/mbedtls-2.25.0
GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls.git

    ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/mbedtls-2.25.0/library/libmbedx509.a   
    )
include_directories(${MBEDTLS_HEADERS})</code></pre>
<p>As you may already have seen, you need a <code>pico_config.h</code> file, which is included in the repository. I duplicated some of the configurations of the ESP32. Copy that file inside the <code>ports/rp2</code> folder.</p></li><li>Finally, add/modify two lines to the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file inside the <code>ports/rp2</code> folder:
<pre><code># add this under include(micropy_rules.cmake)
include(mbedtls.cmake)
# add ${mbedtls_libraries} to the target_link_libraries as:
target_link_libraries(${MICROPYTHON_TARGET}
hardware_adc
hardware_dma
hardware_flash

hardware_pio
hardware_pwm
hardware_rtc
hardware_spi
hardware_sync
pico_multicore
pico_stdlib_headers
pico_stdlib
pico_unique_id
tinyusb_device
${mbedtls_libraries}
)</code></pre></li><li>Finally, build the MicroPython port for RP2040, that is, the version of MicroPython that has specific support for the Raspberry Pi Pico chip:
<pre><code>cd ports/rp2
make</code></pre></li></ol><p>If everything goes well, there will be a new directory called build (<code>ports/rp2/build</code>), which contains the new firmware binaries. The most important ones are:</p><ul><li><code>firmware.uf2</code> A UF2 binary file that can be dragged onto the RPI-RP2 drive that pops up once your Raspberry Pi
Pico is in BOOTSEL mode.</li><li><code>firmware.elf</code> A different type of binary file, which can be loaded by a debugger (such as gdb with openocd) over
RP2040’s SWD debug port.</li></ul><p>You can drag and drop the custom MicroPython version following the instructions described <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2><span id="diy-raspberry-pi-pico-meets-lorawan-454294">DIY: Raspberry Pi Pico meets LoRaWAN</span></h2><p>Last year, I wrote a driver to connect the ESP32 to the LoRaWAN network.

<pre><code>git clone -b LoRaWAN https://github.com/lemariva/uPyLoRaWAN.git</code></pre></li><li>Include this device configuration in the <code>config.py</code> file:
<pre><code># RASPBERRY PI Pico 
device_config = {

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			

<p>In late August 2020 I read <a href="https://press.stripe.com/#the-dream-machine">The Dream
Machine</a> and it is my favorite
book of 2020. It is an incredible overview of a sliver of computer pioneers in
the 1960s-1980s and how one man was instrumental in tying all their narratives
together. One of the strands the book follows is the group at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">PARC</a> (and other places) that
firmly believed in the notion of interactive computing. Over the last year,
I’ve repeatedly been introduced to this strand of thinking. There is Douglas
Engelbart’s <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned/Doug_Engelbart-AugmentingHumanIntellect.pdf">Augmenting Human
Intellect</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>
and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">mother of all
demos</a>. The notion that
computers should allow humans to <em>think better</em>, and one way to do that is to
allow humans to express and try out ideas better. <em>Writing</em> is a useful skill
to form coherent, but generally linear streams of thought. <em>Computing</em> is the
closest we can yet get to a non-linear exploration of a problem domain, and
freed from the limitations of time and space, we can recreate our thoughts in a
malleable, explorable way. By applying <a href="https://doriantaylor.com/softwares-ailing-mythology">a known process to known information,
but turning a few billion cranks at a
time</a> we can get to better
solutions, faster. The notion is, if we could have a <em>computer</em> (the physical
device including the software) that would allow people to iteratively express
their problems, get immediate sensory (primarily visual, but nothing prevents
using the other senses) feedback and <em>extend the computer as necessary</em>, we can
really liberate the human mind from some of its limitations. It is a very
different vision from the consensus reality of vendors that deliver
pre-packaged applications that all come with restrictions.</p>

<p>Smalltalk<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup> is one of the outputs of this strand of thinking and has had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#History">big impact on general purpose programming
languages</a><sup id="fnref:bak"><a href="#fn:bak">3</a></sup>. However the
focus on object orientation and test-driven development have robbed the world
of what I think are its most important aspects:</p>

<ol>
<li>programming as a dialogue with the computer, with meaningful feedback and <em>assistance</em>.</li>
<li>the environment being just as important to programming as the language, and empowering users to <em>modify the environment to help solve their problem</em>.</li>
<li>semantic simplicity as a necessity for easier comprehension in the face of the above points.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aditya Siram has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/baxtyeFVn3w">this excellent
talk</a> giving a taste of Smalltalk.
If you had to take only one thing away from this post, it is to go and watch
that. I knew I had to try this thing out! While I worked through the <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2021/experiencing-smalltalk/TODO">Pharo
MOOC</a> for a few days, I quickly lost interest in their examples. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent
of Code 2020</a> (AoC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> seemed like a much
better avenue to really try out Smalltalk. All my experiences are based on the
<a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a> variant, which seems to be the leading
implementation right now.</p>

<p>While I was working my way through AoC, Mike Levins wrote <a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/">On repl-driven
programming</a>. I
think he wasn’t fully able to convey the ideas of Smalltalk, because the term
“REPL” is too strongly associated with Python/JavaScript/Ruby REPLs at this
point. I hope I did my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642699">bit</a> of
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642717">evangelizing</a> to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642741">correct
that</a>. Alright, lets jump into
my experience.</p>



<h2 id="a-truly-integrated-development-environment-ide">A truly integrated development environment (IDE)</h2>

<p>What do I mean? Well Smalltalk really facilitates creating a program in an
exploratory style, including test-driven development. As an example, for Day 5,
I wrote the following:</p>



<p>Now, as soon as I “accept” this code (by pressing Ctrl+S), Smalltalk will ask
me if I would like to define this <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code> class. It will pop up
a little window to let me do that. It will also detect I wrote a test case
(because when I created a class for the test case, I inherited from <code>TestCase</code>)
and the system browser and other elements of the interface will have these
little gray/green/red dots next to every test case, letting me run the test and
observe the results right away. Now, this is offered in modern IDEs like
IntelliJ and PyCharm, but this was available 40 years ago in Smalltalk! But
that is just the beginning.</p>

<p>I can now run this test (remember I’ve only defined the <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code>
class at this point) and it will encounter the missing method <code>toSeat:</code> on the
class (think of this like a “static method” in Java/Python<sup id="fnref:static"><a href="#fn:static">5</a></sup>). In a
statically typed language, you would get a compilation error or have your IDE
highlight it for you. If you were in a dynamic language, then you’d just have
an exception thrown when running the program – <code>AttributeError</code> in Python.
Unless you explicitly ran the test in a debugger, that is all you would get and
now you’ve to go back to the editor, fix this, then re-run the test.</p>

<p>Not so in Smalltalk. First this isn’t just an IDE in the sense of a
language-aware editor. The IDE is also very aware of the runtime environment.
It will break at the stack frame with the missing method, and pop up a window.
You can <em>create</em> a method right there. This window has a full fledged editor
with code completion and all the other fanciness right there. I’m not aware of
any other environment<sup id="fnref:lisp"><a href="#fn:lisp">6</a></sup> that does this. Ok so we quickly recover by
creating the method. But I don’t know exactly what to put in there yet. Don’t
worry, this is Smalltalk. We don’t need to go through this cycle of rerunning
the entire test. The state of the running program is <em>preserved</em> until the
point where you hit the error, and you just tell the IDE “ok, I’ve fixed the
immediate error, let’s try again” and it will resume execution from there! You
can do this as many times as you wish, developing the code as a function of
encountering errors and test failures. This very fast iteration cycle feels
amazing! Imagine writing a much more complex program that was running for
minutes to hours but then hit an error. In most languages you would have to fix
it and start from the beginning, but in Smalltalk you would just fix it right
there and proceed.</p>

<p>I think browser developer tools are the closest we can come to having this kind
of interactivity in widespread computing environments. They don’t do that yet,
but they could. But we need to acknowledge how much work had to be put in to
those tools vs Smalltalk. In addition, the that implementation would likely
need to be in C++ instead of JavaScript, which means users wouldn’t be able to
extend and improve it as necessary. Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<h2 id="ide-extension-and-visualization">IDE extension and visualization</h2>

<p>Where most IDEs and language implementations are written in C/C++/Java,
Smalltalk prides itself on bootstrapping from a very minimal native code core.
After that nearly everything about the runtime and the IDE is written in
Smalltalk. The program and the environment are not 2 separate things, they are
one. When you execute your program, it is just another “thread” in the same
environment that you are creating the program in. You can do bizarre things
like remapping <code>true</code> to <code>false</code> or redefining what addition means and the
entire system will reflect the change right away (to disastrous results!). The
fact that the IDE and the program share a language means that any Smalltalk
programmer can understand and extend the IDE itself. Would you like a menu with
your most commonly used commands? Sure, just use the inspector/debugger to find
out where the menus are defined and add an entry there. Boom!</p>

<p>This also offers the really powerful ability to customize the debugger for the
task at hand. <a href="http://kursjan.github.io/petitparser2/">PetitParser2</a> is
probably the best example of this. It is a parser-combinator library. As Aditya
demonstrates in his talk, when you build up a parser, the parser provides
several hooks into the Smalltalk debugger. It can show you the matches it has
built up so far(including negative matches!) and you can run various inputs
against the parser to understand behavior. So you can start with a very simple
parser and iteratively make it complicated, observing the parse tree and
getting the behavior you want.</p>

<p>Whereas a lot of AoC implementations on reddit used various regex and string
operations for parsing inputs, I’d lean to PetitParser for anything beyond
simple white-space delimited numbers. It was just so easy and straightforward.
Instead of having to find subtle bugs in string parsing, I could actually see a
domain specific debugging view as my parser encountered tokens.</p>

<p>You could similarly imagine having domain specific drawings for your project.
If I was writing a build system in Smalltalk, I would write a build graph
viewer, and instead of a <a href="https://graphviz.org/">static graphviz image</a>, it
could be very interactive. While the build was running, it could update the
graph with file modification times, or indicate whether it thinks a file needs
to be rebuilt, and then I could easily debug why a particular file wasn’t being
built.</p>

<p>The folks at <a href="https://feenk.com/">Feenk</a> are really leveraging this in their
<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to fantastic effect! I highly
recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLZHVq_-2D2-iI4rA2O8Ug">their
videos</a>.</p>

<h2 id="minor">Minor</h2>

<p>I appreciated the built-in Array2D class for the various game-of-life
implementations as well as <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20">Jurassic
Jigsaw</a> where it was easy to reason in
terms of rows and columns, and quickly slice those out.  Similarly, the Point
class and special “syntax”<sup id="fnref:point"><a href="#fn:point">7</a></sup> made Day 12 <a href="https://github.com/nikhilm/AdventOfCode2020/blob/bbc331e2af2d948e683cade9ff4f93b4e4a3f667/AdventOfCode/AOCFerry.class.st">really
easy</a>.</p>



<p>Of course everything wasn’t magical. The Smalltalk/Pharo community is very
small, so this shouldn’t be considered a rant, just my disappointments.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>This was my biggest frustration. If we accept that <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">documentation has 4
distinct types</a>, Smalltalk does a great job
of Reference docs, because everything can easily be inspected and browsed, so
reading method documentation, while seeing its implementation is really easy.
You can also easily inspect what an object is at the point of use, and then see
what methods are available on it. However there is still plenty of scope for
improvement here, as not all non-trivial methods have docstrings. In addition,
for such a powerful IDE, the lack of documentation tooltips on hover is very
odd.</p>

<p>It really lags behind in the other categories. There is a wealth of great
content in <a href="http://books.pharo.org/">various free books</a> and the
<a href="http://mooc.pharo.org/">MOOC</a> that explains the language and getting around
the IDE. However all the books on various useful libraries are really out of
date. It isn’t fair to expect someone to …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Web performance isn’t going to save you in this crisis.</p>
<p>But if you’re building a software product, chances are you’re relatively unaffected. And in this case, having a quick app is more important than ever. Internet <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-affecting-internet-performance">is slowing down</a> due to increased demand, and people <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/mobile-phone-shipments-will-drop-to-10-year-low-this-year-as-coronavirus-hurts-demand/">are holding on to their phones</a> for longer – so if your app is slow, your users <em>will</em> be affected by it.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://wpostats.com/"><em>slow app</em> means <em>worse business</em></a>.</p>
<p>Today, let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> – an advanced note-taking web app. Notion is a great product, but one thing customers complain about is its startup time:</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Notion app and my laptop OS take the same time to boot.</p><p>Beautiful application but it's tooooo slow😔</p></div>— Aniket Mandle (@aniketmandle11) <a href="https://twitter.com/aniketmandle11/status/1256659106464698368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>Notion <a href="https://twitter.com/NotionHQ/status/1228074819784073216">shipped tremendous speed enhancements recently</a>, but there’s still a lot of space to improve. Let’s reverse-engineer it and see what else can be optimized!</p>


<p>Notion is a React web app embedded into a native shell. This means its “startup time” is largely the “loading time of the web part”.</p>
<blockquote><div><p><strong>To be concrete.</strong> On the desktop, the Notion app is a web app wrapped with Electron. On mobile, from my understanding, the Notion app runs both React Native parts (likely responsible for some mobile experiences) and web parts (likely responsible for the overall editing UI).</p><p>Due to (apparently) HTTPS certificate pinning in the Android Notion app, I wasn’t able to verify whether the mobile app runs the same bundles the desktop app does. But even if the bundles are different, issues they are having are, likely, similar.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>To understand how the web part is loading, let’s create <a href="https://www.notion.so/iamakulov/Job-Board-f96cfe500e7d47108f44e0b6102e7c01">a public Notion page</a>:</p>

<p>It takes a couple more seconds to finish loading all the hero image.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.2 seconds for a desktop computer is quite a lot. However, with a medium-tier phone like Nexus 5, this time <a href="https://webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=200420_7E_24739856690fea9cbdadeea3e0b934a2-r%3A1-c%3A0&amp;thumbSize=200&amp;ival=100&amp;end=visual">increases to 12.6 seconds</a>. Here’s how that feels:</p>

<p>Let’s see how we can improve it.</p>

<p>When one talks about “loading speed”, one typically means <em>networking performance</em>. From the networking standpoint, Notion is doing well: they’re using HTTP/2, they’re gzipping files, and they’re using Cloudflare as a proxying CDN.</p>
<p>However, another part of “loading speed” that people talk less about is <em>processing performance</em>. All downloaded resources have a processing cost: gzip archives need to be decompressed; images need to be decoded; JS needs to be executed.</p>
<p>Unlike networking performance, processing performance doesn’t improve with better networks – it’s only as fast as the user’s CPU is. And user’s CPUs in phones – especially Android phones – <a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4">are <em>bad</em></a>:</p>

    </picture>
  </figure>
<p>For Notion, processing performance is even more significant. It’s easy to avoid networking costs by caching network resources in the app. But processing costs are paid <em>every single time</em> the app starts – which means a phone user may see a 10-second splash screen multiple times a day.</p>
<p>On our test Nexus 5, executing <code>vendor</code> and <code>app</code> bundles takes 4.9 seconds. This whole time, the page – and the app – stay non-interactive and empty:</p>

<p>What’s happening there? WebPageTest doesn’t record JS traces, but if we go to DevTools and run a local audit, we’ll see this:</p>

<p>First, the <code>vendor</code> bundle is being compiled (for 0.4s). Second, the <code>app</code> bundle is being compiled (for 1.2s). Third, both bundles start executing – and spend 3.3s doing so.</p>
<p>So how can we reduce that time?</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the bundle execution phase. What are all these functions?</p>

<p>Turns out that’s bundle initialization:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Functions with four-character names</em>, like <code>bkwR</code> or <code>Cycz</code>, are application modules.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->

<p>  |
| When webpack builds a bundle, it wraps each module with a function – and assigns it an ID. That ID becomes the function name. In the bundle, this looks as follows:
|
| <em>Before:</em>
|
| <code>js
  | import formatDate from './formatDate.js';
  | 
  | // ...
  |</code>
|
| <em>After:</em>
|
| <code>js
  | fOpr: function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {
  |   "use strict";
  |
  |   __webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);
  |
  |   var _formatDate__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ =
  |     __webpack_require__("xN6P");
  |
  |   // ...
  | },
  |</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>And the <code>s</code> function</em> is actually <code>__webpack_require__</code>.</p>
<p><code>__webpack_require__</code> is the webpack’s internal function that it uses for requiring modules. Whenever you write an <code>import</code>, webpack transforms it to <code>__webpack_require__()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bundle initialization takes so much time because it executes all the modules. Each module may take just a few milliseconds to execute, but with Notion’s 1100+ modules, this adds up.</p>
<p>The only way to fix it is to execute fewer modules upfront.</p>
<h2 id="use-code-splitting"><a href="#use-code-splitting" aria-label="use code splitting permalink"></a>Use code splitting</h2>
<p>The best way to improve the startup time is to code-split away some features that’re not needed immediately. In webpack, this is done <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">using <code>import()</code></a>:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Button</span></span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>openModal<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>


<span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Button</span></span>
  <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./Modal'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>=&gt;</span> m<span>.</span><span>openModal</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span>
<span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><mark>Code splitting is the best first optimization you can do.</mark> It brings huge performance benefits: after doing code splitting, Tinder reported <a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani/a-tinder-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-78919d98ece0">a 60% decrease in the complete load time</a>; and our client, Framer, managed to <a href="https://3perf.com/#clients">cut 40-45% off the CPU Idle time</a>.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://medium.com/js-dojo/3-code-splitting-patterns-for-vuejs-and-webpack-b8fff1ea0ba4">several common approaches to code splitting</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>splitting the bundle by pages,</li>
<li>splitting away below-the-fold code,</li>
<li>and splitting away conditional content (any dynamic UIs that are not visible immediately)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Notion app doesn’t have pages, and code-splitting below-the-fold content is hard because pages are very dynamic. This means the only useful approach is code-splitting conditional content. The following parts may be good candidates for that:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settings</em>, <em>Import</em>, <em>Trash</em> – all UIs that are rarely used</li>
<li><em>Sidebar</em>, <em>Share</em>, <em>Page options</em> – all UIs that are frequently used but are not needed immediately when the app starts. Those could be preloaded and initialized right after the app starts</li>
<li><em>Heavy page blocks.</em> Some page blocks are quite heavy – e.g. the <em>Code</em> block supports highlighting 68 languages, which bundles 120+ minified KBs of language definitions from Prism.js. Notion seems to be code-splitting some blocks already (e.g., <em>Math equation</em>), but it might make sense to extend it to others as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="check-that-module-concatenation-is-working"><a href="#check-that-module-concatenation-is-working" aria-label="check that module concatenation is working permalink"></a>Check that module concatenation is working</h2>
<p>In webpack, the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/">module concatenation</a> feature is responsible for merging multiple small ES modules into one large. This reduces the module processing overhead and makes removing unused code more effective.</p>
<p>To confirm that module concatenation is working:</p>
<ul>
<li>check that you’re not transpiling ES modules to CommonJS with Babel. <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env"><code>@babel/preset-env</code></a> doesn’t transpile ES modules into CommonJS</li>
<li>check that <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/#optimizationconcatenatemodules"><code>optimization.concatenateModules</code></a> is not disabled explicitly</li>
<li>run the production webpack build with <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/#debugging-optimization-bailouts"><code>--display-optimization-bailout</code></a> to see if there are any cases where module concatenation bails out</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><div><p><strong>Fun fact.</strong> Remember that all imports are transformed into the <code>__webpack_require__</code> function?</p><p>Well, what happens when the same function is called 1100 times throughout initialization? Right, it becomes a hot path taking 26.8% of the total time:</p><figure>

  </figure><p>(<code>s</code> is the minified name of <code>__webpack_require__</code>.)</p><p>Unfortunately, apart from concatenating more modules, <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2219">there’s not much to optimize there</a>.</p></div></blockquote>
<h2 id="try-the-lazy-option-of-babels-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs"><a href="#try-the-lazy-option-of-babels-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs" aria-label="try the lazy option of babels plugin transform modules commonjs permalink"></a>Try the <code>lazy</code> option of Babel’s <code>plugin-transform-modules-commonjs</code></h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> this suggestion relies on disabling module concatenation. Because of that, it’s incompatible with the previous one.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy"><code>@babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs</code></a> is an official Babel plugin that transforms ES imports into CommonJS <code>require()</code>s:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
<span>import</span> formatDate <span>from</span> <span>'./formatDate.js'</span><span>;</span>
<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>getToday</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>formatDate</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>const</span> formatDate <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'./formatDate.js'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
exports<span>.</span><span>getToday</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>getToday</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>formatDate</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And with its <code>lazy</code> option enabled, it also inlines all <code>require</code>s right into where they’re used:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
exports<span>.</span><span>getToday</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>getToday</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'./formatDate.js'</span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Thanks to this transformation, if the <code>getToday()</code> function is never called, <code>./formatDate.js</code> is never imported! And we don’t pay the import cost.</p>
<p>There are a few drawbacks, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching the existing codebase to <code>lazy</code> might be tricky. Some modules may rely on side effects from other modules, which we’re delaying here. Also, <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy">the plugin docs</a> warn that the <code>lazy</code> option breaks cyclic dependencies</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>Switching to CommonJS modules disables <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/">module concatenation</a>. This means the module processing overhead will be higher</li>
</ul>
<p>These drawbacks make this option riskier compared to others – but if it plays right, its benefits might far outweigh its costs.</p>
<blockquote><div><p><strong id="note-coverage">How many modules could be deferred like this?</strong> Chrome DevTools let us find an easy answer. Open any JS-heavy page (e.g. <a href="https://www.notion.so/iamakulov/Job-Board-f96cfe500e7d47108f44e0b6102e7c01">the Notion one</a>), go to DevTools, press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>⌘⇧P</kbd> (macOS), type in “start coverage”, and press Enter. The page will reload, and you’ll see how much code was executed in the initial render.</p><p>In Notion, 39% of the vendor bundle and 61% of the app bundle are unused after the page renders:</p><figure>

<p>Self-control isn't merely a matter of eliminating your own weaknesses. Self control is primarily about compensating for those weaknesses. When you go on a diet, you don't just commit yourself to eating well – you also throw away the Oreos so you won't be tempted.</p>
<p>This manoeuvre has a name: a Ulysses Pact, named for the passage in the Odyssey in which Ulysses pilots his ship through the sirens' sea, eschewing wax-stoppered ears so that he could hear their song, protecting himself by lashing himself to the mast.</p>
<p>Ulysses knew he would face a moment of weakness in the future, so he used his strength in the moment to guard against his future self.</p>
<p>Tech was built on a Ulysses Pact: the irrevocable free software license: once a hacker applies the GPL, they can't unchoose it.</p>
<p>No pressure from investors, not even the risk of bankruptcy or physical coercion can remove a free software license once it has been applied.</p>
<p>A Ulysses Pact is an act of humility, an admission of frailty. Alas, humility is in short supply in tech (the GPL is an exception).</p>
<p>Far more common is to build systems that can be abused, and assume that you – and your successors, collaborators, and underlings – will never yield to temptation.</p>
<p>Think of when the W3C incorporated DRM into browser standards, sure that none of its members would use this to exclude future rivals, only to be proven wrong a mere three years later, when Google blocked all free/open entrants into the field.</p>
<p><a href="https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/08/three-years-after-the-w3c-approved-a-drm-standard-its-no-longer-possible-to-make-a-functional-indie-browser/">https://memex.craphound.com/2020/01/08/three-years-after-the-w3c-approved-a-drm-standard-its-no-longer-possible-to-make-a-functional-indie-browser/</a></p>
<p>Or when Apple arrogated to itself the power to decide which software you can run on your phones and tablets, only to have the Chinese state order it to block working privacy tools to facilitate a system of violent, totalitarian control.</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2021/01/cory-doctorow-neofeudalism-and-the-digital-manor/">https://locusmag.com/2021/01/cory-doctorow-neofeudalism-and-the-digital-manor/</a></p>
<p>As Pavel Chekov counselled us all those years ago on the Desliu lot, a phaser on the bulkhead in act one will go off by act three.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, we bought – and then returned – a Canary security camera. We'd just immigrated to the US and were feeling a little nervous.</p>
<p>I was suspicious of this gadget. Though I wasn't technically capable of auditing its software, I WAS able to read its privacy policy, in which they promised not to share footage from your home unless ordered to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/canary-debuts-flex-cam-suited-for-your-living-room-and-your-lawn/?comments=1&amp;amp;post=31916515">https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/canary-debuts-flex-cam-suited-for-your-living-room-and-your-lawn/?comments=1&amp;amp;post=31916515</a></p>
<p>I suspected that meant that Canary didn't employ end-to-end encryption, meaning that company insiders could peek at that footage, and the only thing preventing such peeking was policy and integrity, not that such a thing was impossible.</p>
<p>I wrote to the company and they confirmed that this was so, explaining that having access to cleartext video streams helped them use ML models that could distinguish between intruders and pets, and promising that they carefully vetted people with access to the footage.</p>
<p>So far as I know, Canary hasn't had such a breach…yet. But ADT – an industry leader whose major investor is Google – did. An ADT technician named Telesforo Aviles admitted to spying on at least 200 ADT customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-home-security-worker-hacked-into-surveillance-systems-1846111569">https://gizmodo.com/a-home-security-worker-hacked-into-surveillance-systems-1846111569</a></p>
<p>Aviles wanted to spy on attractive women in order to see them in naked and having sex. ADT's system was designed to allow this; the primary means by which it was prevented was vetting staff – a process that is obviously too imperfect to trust in a high-stakes environment.</p>
<p>When ADT discovered this was happening, they tried to cover it up, offering laughable cash payments to survivors of Aviles's spying in exchange for confidentiality.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/19/adt-worker-accused-of-using-app-to-spy-on-people-for-7-years/">https://nypost.com/2020/05/19/adt-worker-accused-of-using-app-to-spy-on-people-for-7-years/</a></p>
<p>Doubtless certain technical aspects of the administration of ADT's security system were made simpler by choosing to create a system that was vulnerable to insider attacks. But by making this tradeoff, ADT demonstrated its unfitness to be in this market.</p>
<p>Maturity, after all, isn't about resisting temptation – it's about recognizing your own fallibility and taking measures to limit it. Exposing millions of customers to insider attacks on the obviously false belief that you will never hire the wrong person is unforgivable.</p>

<p>The pandemic has afforded all of us a refresher course on the five stages of grief, a theoretical and controversial framework for describing how people cope with tragedy: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief</a></p>
<p>A far slower-moving unfolding of these stages can be seen in the reactions of the super-wealthy to the breakdown in neoliberal orthodoxy, the tale that says that inequality results from meritocracy, and makes us all better off:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/13/data-protection-without-monopoly/#inequality">https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/13/data-protection-without-monopoly/#inequality</a></p>
<p>Denial came out in the "rationalist" view: the world is better off than ever – richer, less violent, healthier, and any discontent you feel with your plummeting fortunes and the contracting possibilities for your kids is just your tunnel vision. Lack of perspective.</p>
<p>But the Great Financial Crisis and Occupy triggered the anger of the elites: violent suppression of protests, the "Doom Boom" in new luxury bunkers, Howard Schultz's insistence that "billionaire" is a slur (he says we should call him a "person of wealth").</p>
<p>The pandemic – and the "K-shaped recovery"- has revealed the existential threat inequality poses for our species, between price-gouging, fraud, profiteering, flouting health directives, and coercing the poor and vulnerable into risking their lives to keep the economy afloat.</p>
<p>A palpable desperation has set in among the ultra-wealthy, and with it, bargaining. VR execs and their major investors have begun to quietly assert that it will stabilize our unequal society by anaesthetizing the have-nots with virtual wealth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/billionaires-use-vr-avoid-social-change/">https://www.wired.com/story/billionaires-use-vr-avoid-social-change/</a></p>
<p>John Carmack: "Not everyone can have a mansion. Not everyone can have a home theater. These are things we can simulate, to some degree, in virtual reality."</p>
<p>Gabe Newell: "The real world will seem flat, colorless, blurry compared to the experiences you'll be able to create in people's brains"</p>
<p>None of this will work. VR as opiate for the masses is a great Ernie Cline plot, but it's lousy social policy. After all, providing the desperate victims of the Great Financial Crisis unlimited access to Oxycontin and Fentanyl did not stabilize our society.</p>
<p>As Matthew Gault writes in Wired: "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a Facebook-branded set of VR goggles strapped to an emaciated human face—forever."</p>

<p>This week on my podcast, a spoken-word version of "Privacy Without Monopoly: Data Protection and Interoperability," a major new white-paper that Bennett Cyphers and I co-authored for EFF.</p>
<p><a href="https://craphound.com/news/2021/02/15/privacy-without-monopoly-data-protection-and-interoperability-part-1/">https://craphound.com/news/2021/02/15/privacy-without-monopoly-data-protection-and-interoperability-part-1/</a></p>
<p>It’s a paper that tries to resolve the tension between demanding that tech platforms gather, retain and mine less of our data, and the demand that platforms allow alternatives (nonprofits, co-ops, tinkerers, startups) to connect with their services.</p>
<p>I read the first half of it this week – about 40 minutes' worth – and I'll finish it next week. If you don't want to wait, you can dive in with the written version straightaway:</p>

I’m not diabetic or even prediabetic. But when I stumbled on the chance to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as part of a challenge partnered with Levels, I jumped on it. I’ve been conscious of blood sugar my whole life because I suffered from spells of hypoglycemia as a child.</span></p><p><span>Hypoglycemia is when your blood sugar drops below 70mg/dL. I still don’t know why it happened, but it wasn’t fun. When my glucose levels dropped too low, I’d experience cold sweats, lightheadedness, trembling hands, and an elevated heart rate. These symptoms were likely the result of my body releasing epinephrine (adrenaline) to stabilize my blood glucose.</span></p><p><span>Over the years, I started to pick up on which foods caused my blood sugar to crash. The biggest culprits were cereal for breakfast and sweet tea later in the day. Every time I ate a big bowl of cereal before school (usually Frosted Mini-Wheats or Honey Nut Cheerios), I would crash around 10:30 a.m. like clockwork. Sometimes the crashes were so bad that I thought I might pass out, so I’d call my mom to check me out of school.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w" data-sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blake-Reichman-Profile_Picture.jpg 512w"></p><p><span>Experiencing low blood sugar not only made it hard to focus but was, quite frankly, a scary experience for someone who didn’t understand what was going on. After missing a few classes from these episodes, my mom decided it was time to change my diet.</span></p><p><span>I went from eating cereal in the mornings to eggs, bacon, and fruit (berries or avocado) and cut out the sweet tea (tough to do for a boy raised in Alabama). Once I made those changes, the crashes stopped, and I had energy throughout the day.</span></p><p><span>At the time, I didn’t fully understand why the switch worked, but I did understand even at a young age that consuming a bunch of carbs and sugar wasn’t good for me. Since then, I’ve become fascinated with maintaining a healthy lifestyle and finding ways to improve my health. My curiosity for seeking ways to optimize my diet is what eventually led me to put a CGM on my arm.</span></p><h2>The Challenge</h2><p><span>I first learned about the 28-day </span><a href="https://www.wearablechallenge.com/"><span>Wearable Challenge</span></a><span> from following </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares"><span>Justin Mares</span></a><span> on Twitter. I’ve followed Justin for quite a while since he knew a lot about the health-and-wellness space after founding two health food companies, </span><a href="https://www.kettleandfire.com/"><span>Kettle &amp; Fire</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://perfectketo.com/"><span>Perfect Keto</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In October, Justin shared an </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares/status/1315696415213936641"><span>interesting tweet</span></a><span> about a weight-loss challenge that only required participants to track their blood glucose with a </span><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/"><span>Levels</span></a><span> CGM. After reading the tweet, I knew this was something I had to try. Even though the challenge focused on weight loss, I enrolled immediately because I wanted to experiment with a CGM to see how my body reacts to my diet.</span></p><p><span>The challenge required me to keep my glucose levels below 120mg/dL even after a meal. For every day I went over, I’d lose $25 (talk about having skin in the game). The challenge started with a three-day grace period, so I could experiment with my diet to see how it impacted my glucose without getting penalized.</span></p><p><span>(For context, according to the</span><a href="https://www.idf.org/component/attachments/attachments.html?id=728&amp;task=download"> <span>International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines</span></a><span>, your glucose values are “normal” if they stay below 140mg/dL after meals and return to pre-meal levels within two to three hours. Since this is a challenge geared towards weight loss, the upper limit was set slightly lower.)</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/what-should-my-glucose-levels-be-ultimate-guide"><b>What should your glucose levels be? Here’s the ultimate guide to healthy blood sugar ranges</b></a></p><p><span>To help stay in the target range, each member of the challenge had access to a WhatsApp group chat to support each other. The group chat was a place for members to share what diet was working well, vent their frustrations when they failed, and provide a positive environment for motivation and encouragement. This aspect was less useful for me (I ended up muting it after a few days) because my goals were different. Still, I could see how much other members appreciated the accountability and support.</span></p><h2>What I Learned</h2><p><span>Overall, I found the challenge to be a learning experience filled with joyful moments of self-confirmation, times of utter disappointment, and a few surprises in between.</span></p><h3>The Good</h3><p><span>The best news was discovering that my typical breakfast of three eggs, bacon, and half an avocado drizzled in olive oil caused almost no glycemic response, nor did my afternoon snack of raw almonds. The app showed that these foods consistently hit a perfect score. Since I eat these foods most often, it was comforting knowing that I had a strong foundation.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png" alt="" width="400" height="600" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w" data-sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3.png 400w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-267x400.png 267w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Breakfast-3-133x200.png 133w"></p><p><span>The challenge also confirmed my belief that eating a low-carb paleo/keto-inspired diet consisting of mostly meat, vegetables, and healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, and butter/ghee) was optimal for maintaining consistent glucose levels.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Almonds-3-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>Over the past four years, I’ve made a conscious effort to cook meals that avoid simple carbs, vegetable oils, and sweeteners, and it felt really good knowing I’d been making the right choices.</span></p><h3>The Not-So-Good</h3><p><span>The foods with the most considerable impact on my blood sugar were white rice and craft beer, although I can’t say I was surprised. Unfortunately, I love both of these things (so long Chipotle burrito bowls). It was disappointing to finally have to stare down the truth instead of continuing to live in willful ignorance.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Chipotle-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><p><span>I was also disappointed to learn how much sweet potato spikes my blood sugar. I knew sweet potatoes had a lower </span><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods"><span>glycemic index (GI)</span></a><span> than regular potatoes, but they still pushed me over the limit. I plan to keep them in my diet but will be more conscious about how often I eat them.</span></p><h3>The Surprising</h3><p><span>The biggest surprise of the challenge was discovering that quality tequila (G4 Reposado) had almost no effect on my blood sugar. Tequila that is 100% agave has zero carbs because of the distillation process (an average craft IPA has around 13g of carbs). Since beer is my usual go-to if I want a drink, I was happy to learn there was a healthier substitute I already enjoyed.</span></p><p><span>I also recognize I need to be careful here. Just because I didn’t experience a glucose spike doesn’t mean I didn’t have a biological response. </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/6/1545/4632987"><span>Research suggests</span></a><span> that alcohol decreases the liver’s ability to make new glucose, so it can trigger hypoglycemia, especially if you’re fasting or in a ketogenic state.</span></p><p><b>Related article: </b><a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/alcohol-and-metabolic-fitness"><b>What does alcohol do to my glucose levels?</b></a></p><p><span>Another big surprise was discovering that my glucose levels aren’t just impacted by <em>what</em> I eat but also <em>when</em> I eat. I confirmed this because I meal prep twice a week to save time by eating the same meal multiple days in a row. (You may find that boring; I find it efficient.)</span></p><p><span>Eating the same thing for lunch and dinner on several challenge days was great for understanding how my body responds to food at different times of the day. All else being equal, my glucose spikes more after dinner than it does for lunch—sometimes by as much as 20mg/dL!</span></p><p><span>Even more surprising was noticing how little change there was from eating the same meal from day to day, but then having a large variance between lunch and dinner. I’m sure there’s a reason why, but I couldn’t tease a convincing explanation out of the data.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" data-src="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png" alt="" width="350" height="500" data-srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w" data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" srcset="https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1.png 350w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-280x400.png 280w, https://www.levelshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nov-11-1-140x200.png 140w"></p><h2>What’s Changed</h2><p><span>Since the challenge ended, I’ve made a few adjustments to my diet. I’m not one to make radical changes (like cutting out a particular food from my diet forever), but now I’m more careful when I still want to splurge. Here are some of the changes I’ve made:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>If I’m going to drink, I opt for quality spirits (neat or on the rocks) over craft beer or cocktails loaded with sugar.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’ve reconsidered the idea of a cheat day. I still plan on enjoying the occasional night of pizza and beer or tacos and margaritas, but a cheat day isn’t just a day. Now that I’m aware that the effects of an unhealthy meal can last for 2-3 days, I better make sure that the meal is worth it.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I need to avoid any sweetened beverage, no matter how “healthy.”&nbsp; Smoothies, sweetened kombucha, and sweetened coffee wrecked my glucose levels, even though they’re often touted as healthy choices. Better to eat my sweets after a hearty meal than to drink them.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>I’m now more conscious of what I order when I eat out.

        <p>Thread-local storage (TLS) provides a mechanism allocating distinct objects for different threads. It is the usual implementation for GCC extension <code>__thread</code>, C11 <code>_Thread_local</code>, and C++11 <code>thread_local</code>, which allow the use of the declared name to refer to the entity associated with the current thread. This article will describe thread-local storage on ELF platforms in detail, and touch on other related topics, such as: thread-specific data keys and Windows/macOS TLS.</p>
<p>An example usage of thread-local storage is POSIX <code>errno</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each thread has its own thread ID, scheduling priority and policy, errno value, floating point environment, thread-specific key/value bindings, and the required system resources to support a flow of control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Different threads have different <code>errno</code> copies. <code>errno</code> is typically defined as a function which returns a thread-local variable.</p>
<p>For each architecture, the authoritative ELF ABI document is the processor supplement (psABI) to the System V ABI (generic ABI). These documents usually reference <em>The ELF Handling for Thread-Local Storage</em> by Ulrich Drepper. The document, however, mixes general specifications and glibc internals.</p>
<h2 id="representation">Representation</h2>
<h3 id="assembler-behavior">Assembler behavior</h3>
<p>The compiler usually defines thread-local variables in <code>.tdata</code> and <code>.tbss</code> sections (which have the section flag <code>SHF_TLS</code>). The symbols representing thread-local variables have type <code>STT_TLS</code> (representing thread-local storage entities). In GNU as syntax, you can give <code>a</code> the type <code>STT_TLS</code> with <code>.type a, @tls_object</code>. The <code>st_value</code> value of a TLS symbols is the offset relative to the defining section.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>.section .tbss,"awT",@nobits</span><br><span>.globl a, b</span><br><span>.type a, @tls_object</span><br><span>.type b, @tls_object</span><br><span>a:</span><br><span>  .zero 4</span><br><span>  .size a, .-a</span><br><span>b:</span><br><span>  .zero 4</span><br><span>  .size b, .-b</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>In this example, <code>st_value(a)=0</code> while <code>st_value(b)=4</code>.</p>
<p>In Clang and GCC produced assembly, thread-local variables are annotated as <code>.type a, @object</code> (<code>STT_OBJECT</code>). When the assembler sees that such symbols are defined in <code>SHF_TLS</code> sections or referenced by TLS relocations, <code>STT_NOTYPE</code>/<code>STT_OBJECT</code> will be upgraded to <code>STT_TLS</code>.</p>
<p>GNU as supports an directive <code>.tls_common</code> which defines <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols. This is an obsecure feature. It is not clear whether GCC still has a code path which emits <code>.tls_common</code> directives. LLVM integrated assembler does not support <code>.tls_common</code>.</p>
<h3 id="linker-behavior">Linker behavior</h3>
<p>The linker combines <code>.tdata</code> input sections into a <code>.tdata</code> output section. <code>.tbss</code> input sections are combined into a <code>.tbss</code> output section. The two <code>SHF_TLS</code> output sections are placed into a <code>PT_TLS</code> program header.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>p_offset</code>: the file offset of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_vaddr</code>: the virtual address of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_filesz</code>: the size of the TLS initialization image</li>
<li><code>p_memsz</code>: the total size of the thread-local storage. The last <code>p_memsz-p_filesz</code> bytes will be zeroed by the dynamic loader.</li>
<li><code>p_align</code>: alignment</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>PT_TLS</code> program header is contained in a <code>PT_LOAD</code> program header. Conceptually <code>PT_TLS</code> and <code>STT_TLS</code> symbols are like in a separate address space. The dynamic loader should copy the <code>[p_vaddr,p_vaddr+p_filesz)</code> of the TLS initialization image to the corresponding static TLS block.</p>
<p>In executable and shared object files, <code>st_value</code> normally holds a virtual address. For a <code>STT_TLS</code> symbol, <code>st_value</code> holds an offset relative to the virtual address of the <code>PT_TLS</code> program header. The first byte of <code>PT_TLS</code> is referenced by the TLS symbol with <code>st_value==0</code>.</p>
<p>GNU ld treats <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols as defined in <code>.tcommon</code> sections. Its internal linker script places such sections into the output section <code>.tdata</code>. LLD does not support <code>STT_TLS SHN_COMMON</code> symbols.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-loader-behavior">Dynamic loader behavior</h3>
<p>The dynamic loader collects <code>PT_TLS</code> program headers from the main executable and immediately loaded shared objects (via transitive <code>DT_NEEDED</code>), and allocates static TLS blocks, one block for each <code>PT_TLS</code>. For each <code>PT_TLS</code>, the dynamic loader copies <code>p_filesz</code> bytes from the TLS initialization image to the TLS block and sets the trailing <code>p_memsz-p_filesz</code> bytes to zeroes.</p>
<p>For the static TLS block of the main executable, the module ID is one and the TP offset of a TLS symbol is a link-time constant. The linker and the dynamic loader share the same formula.</p>
<p>For a shared object loaded at program start, the offset from the thread pointer to its static TLS block is a fixed value at program start, albeit not a link-time constant. The offset can be referenced by a GOT dynamic relocation used by the initial-exec TLS model.</p>
<p><em>The ELF Handling for Thread-Local Storage</em> describes two TLS variants and specifies their data structures. However, only the TP offset of the static TLS block of the main executable is a hard requirement. Nevertheless, libc implementations usually place static TLS blocks together, and allocate a space for both the thread control block and the static TLS blocks.</p>
<p>For a new thread created by <code>pthread_create</code>, the static TLS blocks are usually allocated as part of the thread stack. Without a guard page between the largest address of the stack and the thread control block, this could be considered as vulnerable as stack overflow can overwrite the thread control block.</p>
<h2 id="models">Models</h2>
<h3 id="local-exec-tls-model-executable-non-preemptible">Local exec TLS model (executable &amp; non-preemptible)</h3>
<p>This is the most efficient TLS model. It applies when the TLS symbol is defined in the executable.</p>
<p>The compiler picks this model in <code>-fno-pic/-fpie</code> modes if the variable is</p>
<ul>
<li>a definition</li>
<li>or a declaration with a non-default visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first condition is obvious. The second condition is becuase a non-default visibility means the variable must be defined by another translation unit in the executable.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>_Thread_local <span>int</span> def;</span><br><span>__attribute__((visibility(<span>"hidden"</span>))) <span>extern</span> <span>thread_local</span> <span>int</span> ref;</span><br><span><span><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> </span>{ <span>return</span> def + ref; }</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span># x86-64</span><br><span>movl %fs:def@TPOFF, %eax</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>For the static TLS block of the main executable, the TP offset of a TLS symbol is a link-time constant. Here is a list of common relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_LE32</code></li>
<li>aarch64:
<ul>
<li>-mtls-size=12: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_ADD_TPREL_LO12</code></li>
<li>-mtls-size=24 (default): <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_ADD_TPREL_HI12</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_ADD_TPREL_LO12_NC</code></li>
<li>-mtls-size=32: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G1</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G0_NC</code></li>
<li>-mtls-size=48: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G2</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G1_NC</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSLE_MOVW_TPREL_G0_NC</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>i386: <code>R_386_TLS_LE</code></li>
<li>x86-64: <code>R_X86_64_TPOFF32</code></li>
<li>mips: <code>R_MIPS_TPREL_HI16</code>, <code>R_MIPS_TPREL_LO16</code></li>
<li>ppc32: <code>R_PPC_TPREL_HA</code>, <code>R_PPC_TPREL_LO</code></li>
<li>ppc64: <code>R_PPC64_TPREL_HA</code>, <code>R_PPC64_TPREL_LO</code></li>
<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_HI20</code>, <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_I</code>, <code>R_RISCV_TPREL_LO12_S</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For RISC architectures, because an instruction typically has 4 bytes and cannot encode a 32-bit offset, it usually takes two instructions to materialize a TP offset.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D93331">https://reviews.llvm.org/D93331</a>, I patched LLD to reject local-exec TLS relocations in <code>-shared</code> mode. In GNU ld, at least arm, riscv and x86's ports have the similar diagnostics, but aarch64 and ppc64 do not error.</p>
<h3 id="initial-exec-tls-model-executable-preemptible">Initial exec TLS model (executable &amp; preemptible)</h3>
<p>This model is less efficient than local exec. It applies when the TLS symbol is defined in the executable or a shared object available at program start. The shared object can be due to <code>DT_NEEDED</code> or <code>LD_PRELOAD</code>.</p>
<p>The compiler picks this model in <code>-fno-pic/-fpie</code> modes if the variable is a declaration with default visibility. The idea is that a symbol referenced by the executable must be defined by an immediately loaded shared object, instead of a dlopen loaded shared object. The linker enforces this as well by defaulting to <code>-z defs</code> for a <code>-no-pie/-pie</code> link.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>extern</span> <span>thread_local</span> <span>int</span> ref;</span><br><span><span><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>()</span> </span>{ <span>return</span> ref; }</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span># x86-64</span><br><span>movq ref@GOTTPOFF(%rip), %rax</span><br><span>movl %fs:(%rax), %eax</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Because the offset from the thread pointer to the start of a static block is fixed at program start, such an offset can be encoded by a GOT relocation. Such relocation types typically have <code>GOT</code> and <code>TPREL/TPOFF</code> in their names. Here is a list of common relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_IE32</code></li>
<li>aarch64: <code>R_AARCH64_TLSIE_ADR_GOTTPREL_PAGE21</code>, <code>R_AARCH64_TLSIE_LD64_GOTTPREL_LO12_NC</code></li>
<li>i386: <code>R_386_TLS_IE</code></li>
<li>x86-64: <code>R_X86_64_GOTTPOFF</code></li>
<li>ppc32: <code>R_PPC_GOT_TPREL16</code></li>
<li>ppc64: <code>R_PPC64_GOT_TPREL16_HA</code>, <code>R_PPC64_GOT_TPREL16_LO_DS</code></li>
<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TLS_GOT_HI20</code>, <code>R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If the TLS symbol does not satisfy initial-exec to local-exec relaxation requirements, the linker will allocate a GOT entry and emit a dynamic relocation. Here is a list of dynamic relocation types:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm: <code>R_ARM_TLS_TPOFF32</code></li>
<li>aarch64: <code>R_AARCH64_TLS_TPREL64</code></li>
<li>mips32: <code>R_MIPS_TLS_TPREL32</code></li>
<li>mips64: <code>R_MIPS_TLS_TPREL64</code></li>
<li>i386: <code>R_386_TPOFF</code></li>
<li>x86-64: <code>R_X86_64_TPOFF64</code></li>
<li>ppc32: <code>R_PPC_TPREL32</code></li>
<li>ppc64: <code>R_PPC64_TPREL64</code></li>
<li>riscv: <code>R_RISCV_TLS_TPREL64</code></li>
</ul>
<p>While they have <code>TPREL</code> or <code>TPOFF</code> in their names, these dynamic relocations have the same bitwidth as the word size. This is a good way to distinguish them from the local-exec relocation types used in object files.</p>
<p>If you add the <code>__attribute((tls_model("initial-exec")))</code> attribute, a thread-local variable can use this model in <code>-fpic</code> mode. If the object file is linked into an executable, everything is fine. If the object file is linked into a shared object, the shared object generally needs to be an immediately loaded shared object. The linker sets the <code>DF_STATIC_TLS</code> flag to annotate a shared object with initial-exec TLS relocations.</p>
<p>glibc ld.so reserves some space in static TLS blocks and allows dlopen on such a shared object if its TLS size is small. There could be an obscure reason for using such an attribute: general dynamic and local dynamic TLS models are not async-signal-safe in glibc. However, other libc implementations may not reserve additional TLS space for dlopen'ed initial-exec shared objects, e.g. musl will error.</p>
<h3 id="general-dynamic-and-local-dynamic-tls-models-dso">General dynamic and local dynamic TLS models (DSO)</h3>
<p>The two modes are used when the TLS symbol may be defined by a shared object. They do not assume the TLS symbol is backed by a static TLS block. Instead, they assume that the thread-local storage of the module may be dynamically allocated, making the models suitable for dlopen usage. The dynamically allocated TLS storage is usually referred to as dynamic TLS.</p>
<p>Each TLS symbol is …</p></div></div>

<p>Now that the bounty is complete, we must figure out what to do with this data. How do we get the most out of our investment in the data?</p>
<h2>Clean up the data we got</h2>
<p>Given the heavily keyed nature of this data, we decided early on to not accept PRs for standardization or normalization of things like party names. Because most columns are part of the primary key, any change looks like a deletion and corresponding addition to Dolt. Thus, changes like that give the corrector credit for the whole row in the bounty instead of just the cell he or she changed. We queued up a number of these types of changes and we'll execute them now that the bounty is over.</p>
<h2>Find some users</h2>
<p>We collected the best US presidential Precinct level results on the internet. Now, we want people to use it. We think potentially the data is good enough that an open data community could be bootstrapped around it. The people who use it would have incentive to finish it as new state level data is released. We will reach out to the people at <a href="http://openelections.net/">Open Elections</a> and <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Elections Lab</a> and start a conversation. If you know anyone else who could use this data, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">come let us know in our Discord</a>.</p>
<h2>Run another bounty?</h2>
<p>We're still missing 12 states and about 22% of the vote from 2020. If we want to get complete data and an open data community can't be bootstrapped, we may run another bounty in a couple months to finish the dataset. Let us know if you'd be interested in another bounty or the complete dataset.</p>

<p>We think <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/bounties">DoltHub Bounties</a> may be the fastest, cheapest way to build databases from open data. For $25,000 and 8 weeks, we were able to assemble a 1.7GB database of election results. </p>
<p>Our plan is to run at least one bounty per month for the rest of the year across a number of distinct data disciplines.

<p><a href="https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich">Rich</a> has become a popular (20K stars on GH) way of beautifying CLIs, and I'm pleased to see a number of projects using it.</p>
<p>Since Rich is mature and battle-tested now, I had considered winding-down development. Until, I saw this tweet:</p>
<h2>The Tweet</h2>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Do you want to see something really cool you can do with <a href="https://twitter.com/willmcgugan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@willmcgugan</a> 's rich library? </p><p>Checkout ghtop <a href="https://t.co/mn7oLbpw8e">https://t.co/mn7oLbpw8e</a>. It's a really fun CLI tool that demonstrates the power of rich (and other things).</p><p>Examples below 🧵👇 (1/8)</p></div>— Hamel Husain (@HamelHusain) <a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1357771218095546368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain">@HamelHusain</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward">@jeremyphoward</a> used Rich to enhance <a href="https://github.com/nat/ghtop">ghtop</a> (a repo owned by the CEO of Github, no less). Ghtop shows a realtime a stream of events from the Github platform. And it looks good! So good that I realised how much potential Rich has for these type of htop-like applications.</p>
<p>Hamel and Jeremy had to overcome a few technical hurdles to make that work. Fortunately this will no longer be required as the latest version of Rich has first-class support for full-screen interfaces via a new Layout system.</p>
<h2>Full-screen terminal interface</h2>
<p>Here's a video demonstration of a terminal interface built with Layout:</p>
<p>
<iframe width="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slrdSojCvlk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<h2>Layout API</h2>
<p>The API to create a flexible layout is surprisingly simple. You construct a <code>Layout()</code> object, then call <code>split()</code> to create sub-layouts. These sub-layouts may then be further divided. Layouts have a small number of settings which define their size relative to the terminal window. It's a simple system that can create terminal interfaces that almost resemble modern web apps.</p>

<p>A Rich layout in VSCode</p>


</figcaption>

</figure>
</div>
<h2>Finally, some code</h2>
<p>Here's how you would create a basic layout with a header, a footer, and two side-panels.</p>
<pre><code>from rich.console import Console
from rich.layout import Layout

console = Console()
layout = Layout()

# Divide the "screen" in to three parts
layout.split(
    Layout(name="header", size=3),
    Layout(ratio=1, name="main"),
    Layout(size=10, name="footer"),
)
# Divide the "main" layout in to "side" and "body"
layout["main"].split(
    Layout(name="side"),
    Layout(name="body", ratio=2),
    direction="horizontal"
)
# Divide the "side" layout in to two
layout["side"].split(Layout(), Layout())

console.print(layout)
</code></pre>
<p>Running the code above produces the following output:</p>

<p>Terminal split in to 5 sub-layouts. The boxes are placeholders, you can insert any content in their place.</p>


</figcaption>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Any renderable (text, table, progress bars etc) may be placed inside those sub-layouts.</p>
<p>We can now use the <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live.html">Live</a> class to create an application that adapts itself to the terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>from rich.live import Live
from time import sleep

with Live(layout, screen=True):
    while True:
        sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>In a real app, that do-nothing loop will be doing something useful like pulling data from the network to update contents.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layout.html">layout docs</a> for an in-depth tutorial.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I think it's clear that Rich is acquiring more TUI (text user interface) features, and I've decided not to fight it. Rich's core purpose is still to beautify CLI output, but I think there is an opportunity here for a new way to create terminal apps. Ultimately it will be less like curses and more like HTML in a browser.</p>
<p>There are a number of things to do before Rich could replace a full TUI library (keyboard and mouse input for one) but the potential is there. Stay tuned for progress.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-contest">About this contest</h3>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>

<p>I decided to try new thing at the beginning of 2019. You probably heard about competitive programming and about popular web-sites like <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">Topcoder</a>, <a href="https://www.codility.com/">Codility</a> and others. The idea is that you can try yourself in solving programming puzzles. Usually it’s not enough to just solve the puzzle, your solution must qualify for certain criterias such as algorithmic complexity and memory usage. Also on a real challenges it is improtant how fast you solved the problem.</p>

<p>Those sort of challenges usually test your problem solving skills as well as your knowledge of algorithms and data structures. It is a kind of tasks we usually see on programming job interviews. You need to write the code from scratch to a complete solution.</p>

<p>What I am starting is also a form of contest but aims at developing different set of skills. <strong>We will train to optimize already optimized code</strong>. We will learn hardware optimizations. This is briefly how it will look like: I will pick one existing benchmark of my choice and will send it to all my subscribers. You will have the time to play with the benchmark and find all performance headrooms you can find. You then send all your findings to me (modified sources/assemblies/compiler patches?/whatever speeds up the benchmark) and I check it and run on my hardware. At the end I will anounce the winners.</p>

<p>Before I explain it in more details I feel a need of writing disclaimer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is absolutely non-profit effort. I’m not looking for make any money from it or using someone’s knowledge in my own purposes. I will not use submissions to extract any intellectual property they might have. Also this is not aiming to advertise any particular software product including benchmarks/compilers. That’s why all the benchmarks and compilers I will use require to be open sourced. Neither it aims to advertise any particular HW.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this contest I try to emulate the situation in performance critical projects on the final stages. When all the functionality is delivered and tested. But before shipping the binary to the customers you were asked to tune the app to it’s peak performance. You know the hardware it will be deployed to. You have the sources in your hands and freedom to modify it (without introducing any bugs :) ). You are the build master, so you can add any compiler flags you want.</p>

<p>For the challenges that I will send I’m not looking for optimizations that fall into the category: “Oh, I just used quicksort instead of bubblesort”. Expect the benchmark to be already optimized to some degree. Your task is to tune it for particular hardware to the peak performance.</p>

<h3 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h3>

<h4 id="q0-why-the-hell-on-earth-i-should-participate-in-this-contest">Q0: <em>Why <del>the hell</del> on earth I should participate in this contest?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A0</strong>: You will learn/practice how to do optimizations for HW. This might include eliminating cache misses by inserting prefetch instructions, getting rid of <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2018/01/18/Code_alignment_issues">Code alignment issues</a>, improving performance by helping compiler to vectorize/unroll the loop better. You will learn different techniques as you go.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q1-what-benchmarks-are-taken-into-the-contest">Q1: <em>What benchmarks are taken into the contest?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A1</strong>: It will be open sourced benchmark written in C/C++. Usually several source files. It should be easy to build, require minimal dependencies. Preferably it should have some form of validation.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q2-what-is-the-machineenvironment-we-will-be-optimizing-for">Q2: <em>What is the machine/environment we will be optimizing for?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A2</strong>: Most likely it will be 64 bit Linux with Intel x86 CPU (probably Haswell architecture). For a start I will not bother with disabling CPU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_frequency_scaling">dynamic frequency scaling</a> features or setting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_affinity">thread affinity</a>. I might do this in future.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q3-what-if-i-dont-have-the-environment-you-are-using">Q3: <em>What if I don’t have the environment you are using?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A3</strong>: It doesn’t matter much. If you don’t have Intel CPU or you are on Windows/Mac, just optimize for whatever you have. I would be happy to know about optimizations that help other CPUs, operating systems, etc.
<strong>I don’t have real prizes to give, so it’s mostly practicing and learning</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q4-how-i-should-find-performance-headrooms">Q4: <em>How I should find performance headrooms?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A4</strong>: Use all of your knowledge. Start with profiling the benchmark. You can browse through posts on this blog. Additionally I will write a separate post that might help begginers.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q5-what-optimizations-are-allowed">Q5: <em>What optimizations are allowed?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A5</strong>: Good news! <strong>All the dirty tricks allowed</strong>! The goal of this contest is to learn how to squeeze as much performance as possible from the hardware using any means available. You can modify sources and insert any compiler hints like pragmas, builtins, function attributes, etc. Also you can generate assembly listing (<code>-S</code> compiler option) and modify it. Finally, you can add some compiler option that might speed up the benchmark.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q6-whats-not-allowed">Q6: <em>What’s NOT allowed</em></h4>

<p><strong>A6</strong>: 1) Do not rewrite the benchmark completely or introduce major changes in algorithms. The good judging rule is “everything interesting should be calculated in runtime”.</p>

<p>2) Do not manually parallelize the benchmark, e.g converting it from single- to multi-threaded or offload computations to the GPU. I mean, I’m glad that you can do it and I will be happy to take a look what you did, but it’s not the intent of the contest.</p>

<p>3) Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization">PGO</a> is allowed, however you can use it only for driving you optimizations, not for the submission. So, you can check how the benchmark gets better with PGO and understand why. And then make this optimization manually. Again, the purposes is practicing and learning.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q7-how-should-the-submission-look-like">Q7: <em>How should the submission look like?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A7</strong>: 1) I will not accept binaries for security reasons.</p>

<p>2) You can send patch files that I can apply to the sources of the benchmark or just assembly listing. If you did multiple optimizations please split them in separate patches. <code>git format-patch</code> is the right tool for that. This will save me a lot of time.</p>

<p>3) If you send assembly listing files please do also include diff file from the baseline (what you changed in the assembly). If you provide modified assembly listings it should be genearted only with open-sourced C/C++ compilers like gcc and clang. You can of course cheat and generate assembly with some other compiler that is better for the benchmark, but I will probably easily detect that. And it’s not about tricking, it’s about learning.</p>

<p>4) Make sure you specify clearly the compiler options if they are different from the baseline.</p>

<p>5) If you are capable of hacking compiler that’s also acceptable. You can send me patches for gcc/llvm compilers which I can apply and use for building the benchmark. Please use the top of tree revisions because it will be easier for me to apply them. We can then use it for improving our open source compilers. Also it would be very nice if you can send me textual description of all the optimizations you made.</p>

<h4 id="q8-how-i-will-test-your-solutions">Q8: <em>How I will test your solutions?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A8</strong>: I will take your sources, build them on my machine and run the benchmark. I will run your binary multiple times (depends on the running time) and <a href="http://blog.kevmod.com/2016/06/benchmarking-minimum-vs-average/">take the minimum</a>. I’m thinking about testing all the solutions on some cloud machine, but that’s not settled yet.</p>

<h4 id="q9-how-i-will-select-the-winner">Q9: <em>How I will select the winner?</em></h4>

<p><strong>A9</strong>: I will calculate your score as a ratio between execution time of the binary with your optimizations and the baseline.</p>

<p>I know there is a lot more concerns you might have. This is just a first attempt with focus on learning how to do HW optimizations. In the end I don’t have real prizes to give out. :) After each contest I will share all the findings people did, so there is a big opportunity to learn from others! I know that a number of really experienced guys read this blog, so I encourage everyone to participate. Everyone is welcome!</p>

<p>All communication (including sending benchmarks and score submissions) will happen through emails, so <strong>make sure to subscribe</strong> using the form at the bottom of the page! I am planning to start first contest in the end of February 2019.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think about it or if you have any ideas or comments. You can also vote if you like it using the buttons below.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started?</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Collect the baseline (use <code>time</code> or analogs).</li>
  <li>Find the hotspot (use <code>perf record</code>).</li>
  <li>Find performance headroom
    <ul>
      <li>Take a look at the assembly and try to guess how you can do better.</li>
      <li>Run through <a href="https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/02/09/Top-Down-performance-analysis-methodology">TMAM</a> process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Build the benchmark, run it and compare against baseline.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Do not try to understand the whole benchmark. For some people (including me) it’s crucial to understand how every peace of code works. For the purposes of optimizing it will be wasted effort. There are CPU benchmarks with thousands LOC (like <a href="http://spec.org/cpu2017/">SPEC2017</a>) it’s absoultely impossible to understand them in a reasonable time. What you need to familiarize yourself with are hotspots. That’s it. You most likely need to understand one function/loop which is not more than 100 LOC.</li>
  <li>You have specific workload for which you optimize the benchmark. You don’t need to optimize it for any other input/workload. The main principle behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design">Data-oriented design</a> is that you know the data of your application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Information presented in llvm documentation: <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Benchmarking.html">Benchmarking tips</a> migth also be helpful.</p>
