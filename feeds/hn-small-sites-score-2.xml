                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>The delivery of mouse and touch events in Qt Quick is complex, and it became clear a few years ago that we needed to refactor the event inheritance hierarchy, to have some common API for various event types, so that more of the delivery code could be shared. In Qt 5.8 we added QQuickPointerEvent and associated types, as a way of prototyping what that could look like. They are QObjects; and since then, QQuickWindow has been delivering these wrapper events that carry the original events inside. Now finally in Qt 6 we have been able to complete the QEvent refactoring, so that QQuickWindow no longer needs the wrappers. Along with that, we were able to add a few features and fix a few bugs. Many of the remaining bugs that seemed intractable in Qt 5 should at least be possible to fix later on.</p>
<!--more--><h2>Say hello to QPointerEvent and QEventPoint</h2>
<p>The inheritance hierarchy now looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1280&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png" alt="event-hierarchy-qt6" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=640&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1280&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=1920&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=2560&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=3200&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/event-hierarchy-qt6.png?width=3840&amp;name=event-hierarchy-qt6.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"><br>QPointerEvent is the new abstract type for all events that come from pointing devices (mouse, touchscreen, tablet stylus). It has the common API to be able to handle all these in a device-agnostic way. Since QTouchEvent can carry multiple touchpoints in one event, we standardized this concept: every QPointerEvent represents potentially a cluster of QEventPoint instances (even though most events only carry one point), and therefore has appropriate API: points(), point(i) and pointCount(). <br>Every QInputEvent (including QPointerEvent) carries a pointer to the QInputDevice that it came from. This allows event-handling code to respond in device-specific ways, even when handling synthetic mouse events. </p>
<p>Every QEventPoint has velocity. The Kalman filter that Qt Quick was using in Qt 5 has been moved to QtGui, so that the average velocity from the last few movements is available wherever the event is delivered. This enables velocity-sensitive behavior (such as distinguishing a slow drag from a quick flick, or responding to a particular direction of movement) regardless which device it comes from. Instantaneous velocity is generally too volatile for such purposes, but if you need it you can calculate it as <code>(globalPosition() - globalLastPosition()) / (timestamp() - lastTimestamp())</code>. </p>
<p>QSinglePointEvent is another abstract type that standardizes the position accessors that used to be separately and inconsistently implemented in QMouseEvent, QTabletEvent, QHoverEvent, QWheelEvent and a few more. They are all floating-point now. position() replaces pos() and posF(), scenePosition() replaces windowPos(), and globalPosition() replaces screenPos(). The old accessors are still there for now, but deprecated: a Qt 5 application will not encounter an SC break just because of handling QMouseEvent, for example. QEventPoint replaces QTouchEvent::TouchPoint, but there is a "using" declaration for the sake of source compatibililty. </p>
<p>I have <a href="https://github.com/ec1oud/clazy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forked clazy</a> and added a new qevent-accessors check, which might save you some trouble: it can automatically apply "fixits" to get rid of the deprecation warnings stemming from the event accessor renaming. (Yes we should upstream that change.)</p>
<h2>Device-agnostic event handling in C++</h2>
<p>In various places in Qt we can now respond to mouse, touch and tablet events (such as detecting a click or a drag), either by iterating the QEventPoints, or just responding to the first point. Here's a contrived example of how a QQuickItem subclass could do that: </p>
<pre>bool MyItem::event(QEvent *ev) override {<br>  if (ev-&gt;isPointerEvent()) {<br>    QPointerEvent *pev = static_cast&lt;QPointerEvent *&gt;(ev);<br>    for (QEventPoint &amp;point : pev-&gt;points()) {<br>      switch (point.state()) {<br>      case QEventPoint::State::Pressed:<br>        if (reactToPress(point.position()))<br>          pev-&gt;setExclusiveGrabber(point, this);<br>        break;<br>      case QEventPoint::State::Updated:<br>        ...<br>      }<br>    }<br>    return true;<br>  }<br>  return QQuickItem::event(ev);<br>}</pre>
<p>QQuickFlickable::childMouseEventFilter() works this way, for example. And that has an interesting result: </p>
<h2>Flickable handles touch now! </h2>
<p>There were many open bugs related to the fact that Qt 5's Flickable could only handle actual mouse events and synthetic mouse events. Qt only supports one mouse, one mouse position, one cursor (so far, but we're working on that...) and therefore you could not flick two Flickables with two fingers. If you touch some component inside the Flickable that is able to handle touch events, but then you drag your finger across the Flickable in the allowed direction, it uses childMouseEventFilter() to steal the grab from that component; but that involved switching from the actual touch event to a synthetic mouse event, and also remembering to deliver the following updates as synth-mouse events to Flickable. Various things went wrong. Well... those days are over, because Flickable::childMouseEventFilter() no longer cares which device the QPointerEvents come from. If you set pressDelay, it's able to withhold the actual touch press and then replay it to the items inside when the timer expires. Yes, you can now drag multiple Flickables with multiple fingers too.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=1280&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif" alt="parallel-flickables" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=640&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=1280&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=1920&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=2560&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=3200&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/parallel-flickables.gif?width=3840&amp;name=parallel-flickables.gif 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"><br>Multi-touch still doesn't work with the remaining mouse-only items like MouseArea though, because those still rely on synth-mouse events. But it can be avoided. In general: try to use Event Handlers rather than MouseArea, because (as its name indicates) it's not really intended to support anything more than mouse interaction. </p>
<p>QTabletEvents (from your Wacom stylus, Samsung S-pen, Apple Pencil etc.) are also just pointer events that carry a few more properties, and can be handled by any device-agnostic code that handles mouse and touch events. But we will keep working on improving the experience with those. We didn't add any new virtual functions in QQuickItem for them, but they will get delivered to QQuickItem::event() soon. </p>
<p>Another thing we're still working on is making Flickable behave better with laptop touchpads. A fix is coming soon. </p>
<h2>Left to your own devices</h2>
<p>Platform plugins now have responsibility to discover and register input devices, in order to fulfill the promise that every QInputEvent tells you exactly where it came from. Some of this work is already done on some of the platforms. (On others it's proving to be problematic.) You can get a list of all registered devices from QInputDevice::devices(). The qtdiag utility also shows you this list. </p>
<p>QInputDevice is a QObject, and its parent() can be another device in case there is a natural hierarchy: for example, X11 has master and slave devices, and a tablet stylus "belongs to" a particular tablet device. In other cases, the parent is simply an object within the platform plugin that owns the device for memory management purposes. </p>
<p>On the platforms where the device discovery work is not done, QInputEvent::device() is never null, but may be a generic instance taken from QInputDevice::primaryKeyboard() or QPointingDevice::primaryMouse(). Touchscreen devices are unique though; we already did it that way in Qt 5. </p>
<p>QInputDevice::seatName() correponds to the Wayland notion of a "seat": a set of devices that one user is using. There is little multi-seat support so far, but it will be improved over time. If you configure a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Multi-pointer_X" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multi-pointer X server</a>, you can see different seat names on different devices, but those names are automatically generated from xinput IDs in the xcb plugin. On Wayland compositors such as <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/sway/sway-input.5.en.html#SEAT_CONFIGURATION" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sway</a>, it's possible to give the seats arbitrary names; and we plan that Qt will eventually work with that. </p>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Standing in line with other high-end brands, <em>“Less is better”</em> has always been the one principle that we can all observe in Apple’s branding and design. From their physical store layouts to their website and products including hardware and software, Apple has always emanated a sense of luxury in their aesthetic. And that’s what makes them stand out.</p>
<!--more--><p>What standards has Apple set for the world of design? Let’s take a close look at how they do it.</p>
<h2><strong>How Apple Does Web Design</strong></h2>
<p>Do you remember the first time you went on Apple’s website to check out their new iPhone? You were probably really quickly convinced by the clean typography, smooth animation flows, and high definition product images that immersed you by filling your screen… that you wanted one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple’s web design doesn’t just function, it wows.<img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=1383&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png" alt="Apple iPad product images and descriptions clean white space and font" width="1383" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=692&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 692w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=1383&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 1383w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=2075&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 2075w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=2766&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 2766w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=3458&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 3458w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png?width=4149&amp;name=clean%20white%20space%20and%20font-min.png 4149w" sizes="(max-width: 1383px) 100vw, 1383px">(Image Source: Apple)</p>
<p>If we look at how Apple’s website has transformed over the years, we can see that minimalistic web design is one of its most consistent catches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their website focuses on clutterless single content areas that highlight one piece of content at a time with plenty of white space and wide margins. Not only is this design aesthetically pleasing, it is easy on the eyes and makes content easy to take in.</p>
<p>To make reading even lighter, Apple also uses simple headlines that show you the main idea of the paragraph without requiring you to read the paragraph.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=1488&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png" alt="Apple homepage iPhone 12 Pro product image" width="1488" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=744&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 744w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=1488&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 1488w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=2232&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 2232w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=2976&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 2976w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=3720&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 3720w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Apple%20homepage.png?width=4464&amp;name=Apple%20homepage.png 4464w" sizes="(max-width: 1488px) 100vw, 1488px">(Image Source: Apple)</p>
<p>On their homepage, it’s difficult to ignore the huge product image that appears as soon as you enter, filling your entire screen from edge to edge, immersing you in it. The reason behind this design choice is to prevent decision fatigue and give visitors room to breathe. Instead of pushing their products onto you all at once, they let you focus on one single product, one headline, and one catchy subheadline.</p>
<p>Unlike most other websites that use multiple, smaller product photos, Apple uses techniques that obey the principles of visual hierarchy. They use large images, high contrast and bold typefaces for emphasis, and maximize space around it to draw even more attention to the subject. That is why when you glance at the image above, ‘iPhone 12 Pro’ takes center stage before anything else.</p>
<h2><strong>How Apple Does Product Design</strong></h2>
<p><span>It’s no unpopular opinion that Apple products look AND feel luxurious, whether it’s the iPhone, Mac, iPad or Apple Watch. One of the most groundbreaking moments for Apple was when they launched the original Macbook Air in 2008. Their iconic </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ywa_EynjC8"><span>Envelope Ad</span></a><span> went viral because at the time, the Macbook Air was the thinnest laptop ever in the market.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>When we look at their unrivaled history of success, we can’t help but wonder: What’s been keeping Apple products ahead of the rest all these years?</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=724&amp;height=483&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg" alt="an image of iphone" width="724" height="483" srcset="https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=362&amp;height=242&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 362w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=724&amp;height=483&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 724w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=1086&amp;height=725&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 1086w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=1448&amp;height=966&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 1448w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=1810&amp;height=1208&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 1810w, https://blog.snappymob.com/hs-fs/hubfs/an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg?width=2172&amp;height=1449&amp;name=an%20image%20of%20iphone.jpg 2172w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></span></p>
<p><span>Yes, Apple definitely has a strong focus on user experience, premium quality, practical design, and even tasking users’ feedback into consideration. But ask anyone what they think stands out about Apple products, and they’ll mention one thing </span><span>—</span> <em><span>simplicity</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The book </span><em><span>Steve Jobs Biography</span></em><span> written by Walter Isaacson highlights Apple’s emphasis on simplicity:</span></p>
<p><span><em>Jobs’ belief in the power of simplicity as a design precept reached its pinnacle with the three consumer device triumphs he produced beginning in 2001: the iPod, iPhone and iPad. He immersed himself daily in the design of the original iPod and its interface.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>His main demand was <strong>“Simplify!”</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span><em>He would go over each screen and apply a rigid test: If he wanted a song or a function, he should be able to get there in three clicks. And the click should be intuitive. If he couldn’t figure out how to navigate to something, or if it took more than three clicks, he would be brutal.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>“There would be times when we’d wrack our brains on a user interface problem, and think we’d considered every option, and he would go, ‘Did you think of this?’” said Tony Fadell, the team leader.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>“He’d redefine the problem or approach, and our little problem would go away.”</em></span></p>
<p><span>This is what makes Apple’s design unique. With Jobs’ hard focus on clean, simple, and sleek, iOS had started a big design wave </span><span>that, to this day, has Android operating systems scrambling to ride it.</span></p>
<p><span>When Apple launched the iPad 2 in Silicon Valley in 2011, Jobs said:</span></p>
<p><span><em>“It is in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough - it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>Today, it’s clear that Apple designers are continuing his legacy in keeping Apple at the intersection of technology and liberal arts. This is the reason why Apple’s design is great. Their products don't just look good, they’re designed in a way that thinks about the people they’re designed for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong><span>Next Step for You</span></strong></h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><p>I really love C#. It's by far <a href="https://hjerpbakk.com/tag/csharp/">my favorite programming language</a>. And who wouldn't agree? I mean with a piffy, roll of the tounge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">Wikipedia description</a> like this, what is not to love?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Yeah, yeah", I hear you say dear reader. "I know C# is great to use if you want to write better Java apps, even so, this is the Bekk Functional advent calendar. What are you rambling about?"</p>
<p>I know you love your pure, scalable functions in <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming#Purity">Haskell</a> and your fancy web pages written in <a href="https://www.elm.christmas/2020">Elm</a>, but did you spot the magic word in the description above? It said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... <strong>functional</strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! As the late Sean Connery <a href="https://youtu.be/hKJZ9pzDMCk">said so excitedly</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://hjerpbakk.com/img/christmas/the-day-is-mine.jpeg" alt="The day is mine!"></p>
<p>C# is not only useful on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-5.0">backend</a>, while writing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/">iOS and Android apps</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-5.0">replacing JS in the browser</a> or as a <a href="https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script">scripting language</a>, it also becomes more and more functional-friendly with every new language version!</p>
<p>However, what does it mean to be a <em>functional-friendly</em> programming language?</p>
<h2>Functional advantages</h2>
<p>Enrico Buonanno argues in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-write-better-code/dp/1617293954/">Functional Programming in C#: How to write better C# code</a> that we should care about functional programming because it gives us the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power:</strong> We can get more done with less code. Functional programming raises the level of abstraction, allowing us to write high-level code while freeing us from low-level technicalities that add complexity but no value.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> A program written in the imperative style may work well in a single-threaded implementation but due to the mutable state that is in its nature, cause all sorts of bugs when concurrency comes in. Code in the functional style might offer better guarantees in concurrent scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> We spend more time maintaining and consuming existing code than writing new code, so it’s important that our code be clear and intention-revealing. As we learn to think functionally, achieving this clarity will become more natural.</li>
</ul>
<p>C# supports a lot of <a href="https://functionalprogrammingcsharp.com/functional-features-of-c-sharp">functional building blocks</a>, such as <em>function delegates</em>, <em>higher order functions</em>, <em>expressions instead of statements</em>, <em>method chaining</em>, <em>extension methods</em>, <em>yield</em>, <em>LINQ</em>, <em>tuples</em> and <em>local functions</em>. Despite all that, the core functional tenet of <em>immutability of data</em> has always been a C# pain point. Until now.</p>
<h2>Immutability in C#</h2>
<p>C# second greatest error<sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup> was to one-up Java and introduce the concept of properties as a first class language feature with the poorest defaults of all time: the default property syntax made it all too easy to create classes with mutable properties. The deed is as simple as:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="https://hjerpbakk.com/img/christmas/the-wolf.png" alt="Listen to the wolf"></p>
<p>Alas, premature aging can take its toll and we should've listened to the dog, hound, wolf or whatever, and make the <code>age</code> property immutable. It came with a cost however, amounting to a lot more work and boilerplate code. I mean, I got bored by just writing out this small example from the past:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span>age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>return</span> age<span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#expression-body-definitions">C# 6</a> made the pit of success a bit deeper by introducing read-only properties using only a <code>get</code> accessor:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct#readonly-struct">C# 7.2</a> made declaring our intent more explicit by allowing a <code>struct</code> to be marked as <code>readonly</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Person</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> age<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Age <span>=</span> age<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>uint</span></span> Age <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is all well and good, yet consider when our class or struct has multiple readonly properties and we need to construct a new copy with an updated value in one or more of them. My head hurts just by thinking about it. The boilerplate has tested my Christmas spirit, why must we endure this error prone, manual waste? A better way must exist!</p>
<h2>Records in C# 9</h2>
<p>And finally this year, at the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu3k2PJumfI">worst year ever</a>, it does! Microsoft bestowed <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9">.Net 5 and C# 9</a> upon us, giving us my most requested feature: <em>language support for immutable data types</em>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#record-types">Record types</a>!</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>record</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span><span>uint</span></span> Age<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A <code>record</code> is immutable in that none of the properties can be modified once it's been created. When we define a record type, the compiler provides several useful methods for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Methods for value-based equality comparisons</li>
<li>Override for <code>GetHashCode()</code></li>
<li>Copy and Clone members</li>
<li><code>PrintMembers</code> and <code>ToString()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like we're finally winning the war against boilerplate, and if we need to create a copy with an updated value, we can now easily use the <code>with</code> keyword:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span><span>var</span></span> me <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>37</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>Person</span> meAYearOlder <span>=</span> <span>me</span> with <span>{</span> Age <span>=</span> <span>38</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With such quality functional features in C# like <em>immutable records</em>, not even time's inevitable flowing towards my 40th birthday and usage of 24(!) year old memes can break this aging developer's Christmas spirit!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I spent a large part of 2019 working with the distributed and decentralized web, especially IPFS, also known as the “Inter-Planetary File System”. I’ve written a few articles on the topic, on how you can host a web app on IPFS, one of which even ended up on the front page of HackerNews.</p><p>For about a year, I hosted my blog and other apps through an IPFS cluster. I wrote a utility for making pinning files easier on Pinata, a third-party cloud service for IPFS. I made some small contributions to the IPFS core projects. I built some projects with it, including one that I never released–nor fully completed–that used both IPFS and Ethereum. And I even gave a talk about hosting static web apps on IPFS at Node+JS Interactive last December in Montreal.</p><p>That all changed in the Spring of 2020. I called myself out of the distributed web.</p><p>My blog and other apps I built aren’t hosted on IPFS anymore. I don’t participate in those online communities anymore. I’ve stopped writing about the distributed and researching about it. I’ve shelved all my projects that were using those technologies.</p><p>I also updated my blog posts about IPFS adding a note that my blog isn’t hosted that way anymore. More than a few people asked me why, and I always gave the same answer: a mix of technical issues and mostly personal reasons. So, I think it’s time I explain the personal reasons.</p><p>First, I need to explain why I got involved with IPFS in the first place.</p><p>When I first read about IPFS, my mind immediately saw it as an exciting new platform I could build my apps for. The premise of a fully-decentralized platform included unlimited scalability, ultra-high availability and resiliency, no single points of failure, and resistance against attacks like DDoS.</p><p>Coming from a background in which I am always thinking about SLAs, number of nines of uptime, disaster recovery, etc, IPFS sounded like a dream platform that would magically solve all my concerns. And, aside from some performance issues at times, it did. Plus, the small engineer inside me was really excited about being able to play with a new, shiny toy, that had lots of hype around it!</p><p>What happened next for me was a reckoning with the reality of what many people behind the IPFS core project and the community around it saw: the dream of a radically open, unfiltered, and by-design un-censorable platform.</p><p>I have recently opened up about my experience, over a decade ago, with building an app with good intentions but that was then misused (<a href="https://withblue.ink/2020/09/24/that-time-i-accidentally-built-a-spying-app.html"><em>That time I accidentally built a spying app</em></a>). I learned early on in my life and (pre-)professional career about the importance of ethics in software development, and I am now a proponent of the idea that just because something <em>can</em> be built, it doesn’t mean it <em>should</em> be built.</p><p>And that brings me back to why, after spending some time in the world of the decentralized web, I have called myself out, and why I think that should things like IPFS actually become mainstream, they might cause more harm than good in the world.</p><p><strong>I have seen, and I am seeing every day, the dangers of completely unrestricted speech, and I don’t want to be the one enabling that.</strong></p><p>I know that last sentence is a strong ideological statement; some might call it a <em>political</em> statement, but for me it’s more than just political, which is often used to describe extemporary beliefs.</p><p>Many of you reading this will not agree with me, and that’s fine. I’m not going to try and change your beliefs with this blog post. Rather, I’m looking to explain why, while I respect that others might have differing opinions, I stopped doing anything that would actively advance a technology whose ethics I question. To put it in other terms: your freedom of speech isn’t my obligation to enable you and give you a platform.</p><p>In short, I think that while the Internet has helped the world in countless of ways, it has also brought out the worst in people.</p><p>I do believe we need some filters on the Internet. It’s not just about stopping criminal activities, terrorism and child pornography: while I am obviously unsupportive of all them, I also think they’re not the biggest dangers coming from the Internet (yet they’re a very convenient pretext for politicians).</p><p>Instead, I think that regular people’s writings on the Internet is hurting the world on a bigger scale. And the collective sentiment is often manipulated by some “agitators” that are exploiting anonymous online speech for their own agendas: that includes online militias–for example sponsored by foreign governments–whose goal is to destabilize a society.</p><p>In the last few years, completely unregulated online speech has given rise to fake news and conspiracy theories that have actually killed people. It’s offered a megaphone to those promoting dangerous ideas like white supremacy, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other anti-LGBTQ positions, and sometimes outright Nazism. It has tilted many democracies towards right-wing populism and fascism.</p><p>All these extreme ideas have divided societies and increased social tensions. And they’re responsible for a number of acts of terrorism which caused the death of too many people.</p><p>Given our experiences so far, there’s no sign that indicates that a fully decentralized and unrestrained web would be anything but a dangerous wild west.</p><p>In fact, despite being tightly centralized and controlled, social media companies are facing significant challenges regulating what people write on their platforms, and in fact they are usually at the center of every scandal of these years. Decentralization and less control won’t be the solution to this issue, but rather the opposite.</p><p>If you believe that I’m overthinking this, and that it’s not going to be bad <em>this time</em>, I urge you to think twice.</p><p>First, there’s no indication that a new Web would be better than the previous one just on virtue of being decentralized. The same actors that are using today’s Internet to wreak havoc around the world would not disappear in the new Internet, and actually, they could be even more unrestrained.</p><p>Second, while almost everyone in the communities supporting a distributed web are good people, with good intentions, seeing some names in there is concerning to me. Regarding IPFS, advocates (at least for a while) included people like Nick Lim of BitMitigate and VanwaNet, companies responsible for rescuing, among others, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/seattles-bitmitigate-now-protecting-pro-nazi-site-daily-stormer-web-attacks/">pro-nazi website</a> The Daily Stormer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/breaking-the-law-how-8chan-or-8kun-got-briefly-back-online/">and the platform</a> 8chan, a cesspool full of Nazi propaganda, child pornography, and other hate speech. Gatherings on 8chan have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8chan#2019_shootings">blamed</a> for at least three mass shootings in 2019 alone, including the one in the <a href="https://time.com/5648479/8chan-ban-new-zealand/">mosque in Christchurch</a>, all of them motivated by racial hatred.</p><p>The first real examples of the distributed web aren’t particularly encouraging either. Among some of the most popular apps (“popular” in relative terms, of course) for the distributed web is DTube, a sort of YouTube that is built on top of IPFS. As you can expect, the website is full of questionable content, including conspiracy theories, cryptocurrency scams, weapons, RT&nbsp;International’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/26/russia-disinformation-rt-nuanced-online-ofcom-fine">Russian propaganda</a>… and of course, porn.</p><p>In essence, if it’s true that <em>a good beginning makes a good ending</em>… with such a mixed beginning, the outlook isn’t too rosy.</p><p>I understand that my opinion is somehow a minority one, and people will continue to build IPFS and other technologies part of the distributed web. There’s also a chance they might become successful and potentially get mainstream adoption–although at this stage the barrier to entry is too high for the average user.</p><p>However, I feel that it’s my responsibility to not be helping to advance this technology and the beliefs of at least some advocates in the world of the distributed web hold. If the advancement occurs, it won’t be because of my help.</p><hr><p><em>PS: The idea that freedom of speech is an absolute right that should have (almost) no limitations is not a universal one. While that right is granted to people living in all democratic countries, outside of North America it’s accepted that such right comes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/world/europe/el-paso-shooting-freedom-of-speech.html">with limitations</a>, and usually that has roots in the history of those places.</em></p><p><em>For example, in Italy where I grew up, the same constitution that grants freedom of expression (speech, press, etc) also criminalizes “apology of fascism”, or propagating the ideas of fascism; it also sets other limits on speech that is hateful or discriminatory. Other European countries have similar laws, such as the outlawing of Nazi rhetoric and symbology in Germany.</em></p></article></div>]]>

December 4, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/5 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/5">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>It is well known that prime numbers are important for cryptography, although it has not always been true. The advent of primes came with several groundbreaking papers almost 50 years ago. Pioneers in introducing asymmetric cryptography, Whit Diffie, Martin Hellman, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, used results from number theory to build key agreement, encryption, and signatures. Prime numbers hold a very special position in number theory, and this carried over to cryptography.</p>
<h2>From Primes to Crypto</h2>
<p>Cryptographic protocols are typically working <em>modulo</em> some prime <em>p</em>. This can be likened to turning the number line into a coil, such that 0, <em>p</em>, 2<em>p</em>, etc. all join at the same place. From then on, whenever we add or multiply the number such that we go beyond <em>p</em>, we can simply remove as many multiples of <em>p</em> as necessary until we come between 0 and <em>p</em> again.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that we used a composite number instead, for example 12. Then 0 and 12 are "the same" in this situation, but that also means that 3 multiplied by 4 is ... 0! One of the intuitions when working with normal numbers is that if <em>ab</em> = 0, then either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> would have to be 0. Hence, when using composite numbers, there is simply stuff that no longer works the way we’re used to. Fortunately, this is not the case when using the primes — for instance 7 — as our so-called modulus.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves.png"></p>
<p>Let’s make a rule, and let’s call it <em>m</em>. We take the coil we just made from the number line, and since we can always reduce numbers to below <em>p</em>, we label our points on this circle from 0 to <em>p</em>-1. Given two points <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on the circle, we decided that the output of the rule <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) should be the point which is represented by the product <em>ab</em>, possibly after reducing modulo <em>p</em>. It may look like a very natural rule, but it is nonetheless a rule we just agreed on. If you play around with this rule a bit, you will notice some properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <em>a</em> = 1, then <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = <em>b</em> (and the other way around).</li>
<li>For any <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> not equal to 0, <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) is never zero. So, if we removed 0 from the circle entirely, no harm would happen — the rule would still be well-defined.</li>
<li>For any nonzero <em>a</em>, there is always some <em>b</em> such that <em>m</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) = 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>These nice properties — together with a property called associativity — are the properties we need to be able to do cryptographic computations.</p>
<p>Now focus on a particular number on the circle, and let’s call it <em>g</em>. If we take <em>m</em>(<em>g</em>, <em>g</em>), or — to return to the more usual notation — <em>g²</em>, we will reach a new point on the circle. We can continue this process and compute <em>g</em>³, <em>g</em>⁴, etc. At some point, we will reach 1. All the points we have visited in this process are members of the set of numbers <em>generated</em> by <em>g</em>, and if the number of points on the coil is a large prime, then we have a very good candidate for doing cryptography, for example Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Let <em>h</em> be some number in this set generated by <em>g</em>. That means that <em>h</em> = <em>g</em>ᵉ for some exponent <em>e</em>. If it is easy to find this <em>e</em> from <em>g</em> and <em>h</em>, we would have trouble. Fortunately, it turns out that if we use <em>large enough</em> primes, then this <em>e</em> appears to be very difficult to find.</p>
<h2>From Coils to Curves</h2>
<p>Coiling up the number line is not the only way of finding suitable primitives for cryptography. Let’s make a new rule. Instead of using a circle like we did in the previous section, we consider the following equation:</p>
<p><em>y</em>² = <em>x</em>³ + <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em>, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are fixed constants.</p>
<p>If we graph this in our usual coordinate system, it may look like this curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/curves2.png"></p>
<p>We will now make a rule on how to combine two distinct points <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> on this curve. The agreed upon notation is to call this rule addition, but we will have to define what we mean by that. Programming languages often include this mental concept as operation overloading. Draw the straight line between <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>. It will intersect at a third point, say, <em>R</em>. This could have been a nice candidate for <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>, but since we are making the rules, let’s make this a bit more interesting. Draw a vertical line through <em>R</em>. It will intersect the curve on the opposite side of the <em>x</em>-axis, and we define this point as <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em>. Just as before, this is a rule we’re deciding here and now. However, this also turns out to be a very useful rule, with the same properties as before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of having the point 1 on the circle, we imagine a point infinitely far up. (Remember what you see when looking at railway tracks: parallel lines actually meet beyond the horizon, at infinity.) So, now the line intersecting <em>R</em> and <em>P</em> + <em>Q</em> is indeed also intersecting a third point: the point at infinity. This can be made precise, but requires maths from algebraic geometry, which is far beyond the scope of this blog post. This point at infinity has all the same properties as 1 had above.</li>
<li>For any point <em>S</em> on the curve, there is always a point <em>T</em> such that we get a line intersecting <em>S</em>, <em>T</em> and the point at infinity. This means that for any point <em>S</em>, we can find a point we can call -<em>S</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can test this rule interactively in a simple <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/ukhajwzs">GeoGebra demonstration</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/ec_group_law.gif"></p>
<p>We just assumed that <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> were distinct. If <em>P</em> = <em>Q</em>, then we simply use the tangent to the curve at point <em>P</em> instead, and proceed as before.</p>
<p>In particular, take a point <em>G</em>, and compute 2<em>G</em> = <em>G</em> + <em>G</em>, 3<em>G</em>, 4<em>G</em>, etc. Eventually, we reach the point at infinity, and then back to <em>G</em>. We have now spent about 1000 words of this blog post getting here, just to do the same as we did above, and what was the point? Above, we said that computing exponents are secure if the primes were large enough. It turns out that "large enough" is currently about 3072 bits, or a number with approximately 925 digits. That is somewhat strenuous even for a computer, but the elliptic curve version only requires us to work on numbers of size 256 bits, or 77 digits, which is far more efficient.</p>
<h2>Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key-Exchange</h2>
<p>The Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol is widely used today, and its instantiation using elliptic curves is ranked as the best choice in modern cryptographic protocols like TLS and SSH. The protocol is fairly simple. The public information is an elliptic curve <em>E</em> and a generator <em>G</em> for the points on this curve. One party, Alice, samples a random integer <em>a</em> and computes a point <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>G</em>. Another party, Bob, samples a random integer <em>b</em> and computes <em>B</em> = <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange the values <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, and compute the shared key <em>K</em> = <em>b</em> <em>A</em> = <em>a</em> <em>B</em> = <em>a</em> <em>b</em> <em>G</em>. As long as both <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> stay secret, even when an attacker knows <em>G</em>, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, then the key is secure.</p>
<p><img src="https://security.christmas/assets/dh.png"></p>
<p><em>Reference: <a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/go_x3dh">https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/go_x3dh</a>. Used with permission.</em></p>
<p>To achieve long-term security, to protect previous messages in the case where someone’s secret keys are leaked after the fact, Alice and Bob can do an ephemeral key-exchange every time they communicate. If <em>a</em> and <em>A</em> is Alice’s long term key pair where <em>A</em> is public to everyone, and similar for Bob, they can run the following protocol to agree upon a one-time session-key. Alice samples a random integer <em>c</em> and computes <em>C</em> = <em>c</em> <em>G</em>, and Bob samples a random integer <em>d</em> and computes <em>D</em> = <em>d</em> <em>G</em>. Then they exchange <em>C</em> and <em>D</em>, and compute the shared key as (<em>a</em> <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> <em>d</em> )<em>G</em>.</p>
<p>The interested reader can check out this <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/qJBI0_2lsGP">simple example written in Go</a>. Are you able to extend the basic protocol to the ephemeral key-exchange on behalf of Alice and Bob?</p>
<p>We finally point out that this protocol is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, and we need to also send signatures computed on the messages to ensure that the communication is authentic. Are you able to attack the protocol as described above, when signatures are not used? If you found these problems interesting, we encourage you to check out similar challenges at <a href="https://cryptohack.org/challenges/ecc/">cryptohack.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Common Curves</h2>
<p>Not all elliptic curves are suitable for cryptography. There could also be power in choosing a curve and the distinguished base point(s). Hence, implementations tend to choose among a small number of well-known curves. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/4/final">maintains a list</a> of recommended curves; P-256 is perhaps the most popular among these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among others, there is also the <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">SafeCurves</a> collection proposed by Dan Bernstein and Tanja Lange. In particular, their Curve25519 has proven to be a popular choice.</p>
<p>Elliptic curve libraries will typically have tailored support for certain curves.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<p><a name="20201204_Modern_TPMS_Sensors_Lets_try_a_DoS_attack"><b>Modern TPMS Sensors: Let's try a DoS attack</b></a></p><p>
TPMS (Tire-pressure monitoring system) sensors have been researched extensively
many years ago, they periodically transmit the tire pressure, temperature
and a unique ID which can be misused for tracking a vehicle. But there is
another aspect: modern TMPS sensors also have a receiver which is typically
used to trigger the data transmission when a new TPMS sensor is presented to
the vehicle ("learning procedure").
</p>

<p>
Here in Europe TPMS sensors usually transmit on the 433 MHz ISM band. The
receiver operates on 125 kHz, very similar to LF RFID. A simple way to make
use of the receiver is just to look for the presence of the 125 kHz carrier
and then trigger data transmission. Current sensors are usually more evolved
and use a modulated carrier which contains command packets and only if the
correct command is received data transmission is triggered.
</p>

<p>
If you already have a receiver you can do of course more than just trigger
data transmission: For example there might be support for different
commands, some sensors even allow firmware updates this way.
</p>

<p>
One such command which is typically supported is switching the sensor into
"Shipping" mode. Why would you need that? When the sensor is operating
normally it waits for motion (there is an acceleration/shock sensor inside)
and only starts periodic data transmission when the wheel is rotating. This
is used to safe battery life. When the TPMS sensor is not yet mounted in the
tire it should not react on motion, that’s why there is this "Shipping" mode.
In this mode the sensor only wakes up every few seconds and looks if there
is a 125 kHz signal, if yes it checks for a valid command, for example the
command to trigger data transmission which usually also leaves "Shipping"
mode and switches the sensor into normal operation.
</p>

<p>
This "Shipping" mode can be misused: If you can switch a TPMS sensor of a
vehicle’s wheel into "Shipping" mode the sensor will no longer transmit data
and the vehicle's tire pressure control light will go on after a while.
Just to make it clear: This warning light is annoying to the driver, it
does not affect safety of the car because the deactivated TMPS sensor has
not affected the actual tire pressure.
</p>

<p>
I have looked at a few TPMS sensors for different cars if this really works,
I choose sensors for BMW and Ford cars. Please note that most certainly
other car manufactures are affected too, mainly because there are only a
few manufactures of TPMS sensors which deliver their sensors to various
car manufactures. My choice for BMW and Ford came from the fact that I
found lots of cheap, used sensor for those cars.
</p>

<p>
Also I only looked at "OEM" sensors for BMW and Ford, which means that those
sensors are mounted by the car manufacturer. There are also so called
"Universal" sensors which are typically mounted by tire dealers, there
are some notes about them at the end of this text.
</p>

<p>
It is quite easy to build a tool for transmitting data on 125 kHz: There
is this cheap EL-50448 TMPS sensor activation tool which only transmits a
carrier without modulation. However the hardware can easily be modified
to modulate the carrier: Most of the time OOK (On-Off Keying) is used
for communication, which means that the carrier is just turned on and off.
The EL-50448 uses a power driver with an unused "enable" pin to generate
the carrier, you can use this "enable" pin to modulate the carrier. The
data rate is slow, a frequently used rate is 3900 baud.  Most of the time
Manchester encoding of the data bits is used, which means that the carrier
changes twice as much (7800 changes per second). This is nothing special
and can be done with probably any microcontroller you prefer to use. The
hardware costs for such a setup are below EUR 20, the transmission range
is about 20 centimeters.
</p>

<p>
How can you find the command to switch to Shipping" mode? Brute force by
trying all possible commands is only an option if the command is short.
The reason is that the sensor only looks for the LF 125 kHz signal every
few seconds. If the command is not longer than two bytes brute force is
possible (it takes a few days), for longer commands it is impractical.
Please note that you also have to find a way to detect if the command you
send causes a reaction of the TPMS sensor, e.g. by monitoring the power
consumption of the sensor or receiving the 433 MHz data signal (which of
course only works if the command you send causes a data transmission).
</p>

<p>
Another option is looking at those TPMS tools which tire dealers and
car repair workshops use to check TPMS sensors. Some of those tools
might support switching a TPMS sensor into "Shipping" mode.
</p>

<p>
Those are the results I found (I won't go into the details to avoid misuse):
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>BMW:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. Also if the sensor detects a
  fast pressure change (e.g. by inflating the tire) the sensor leaves
  "Shipping" mode. The command length is four bytes so brute force is no option. 

</li>

<li><b>Ford:</b>

  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "A" (the same manufacture as above for the BMW sensor) can be switched
  into "Shipping" mode, it is the same command as used by the BMW sensor
  from above. The deactivated TPMS sensor can be activated again with a
  different command.
  
  A certain sensor used in several car models from TPMS Sensor manufacturer
  "B" can be switched into "Shipping" mode. The deactivated TPMS sensor can
  be activated again with a different command. The command in this case is
  only two bytes and I tried all combinations which resulted in several more
  "interesting" commands, a few examples:


    <ul>
<li>
      It is possible to completely turn off the TPMS sensor. In this case it
      will no longer react on anything, you have to break open the sensor
      case and apply a hardware reset or disconnect the battery to reactivate
      it again.
</li>

<li>
      It is possible to switch the sensor into continuous "carrier transmit"
      mode on 433 MHz. In this mode the sensor will continuously transmit
      the 433 MHz carrier until the battery is empty or you apply a hardware
      reset (see above), it will not react on anything else. There are two
      other similar commands which transmit on the upper and lower shifted
      frequency (the sensor uses FSK modulation, Frequency Shift Keying, when
      transmitting data).
</li>
</ul>      

  Those examples show that it is basically possible to destroy this specific
  sensor by transmitting the appropriate command. Also if the sensor is in
  "carrier transmit" mode it probably disturbs the remote control car
  key fob which usually uses the same frequency as the TPMS sensor.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You have to be close to the sensor to send those LF 125 kHz signals but it
only takes a few seconds to send the signal. Using a larger antenna (which is
basically a coil) for the transmitter, e.g. large enough to fit in a suitcase,
might extend the transmission range to more than a meter. 
</p>

<p>
How can those problems be avoided? This is actually quite easy, the command
to switch into "Shipping" mode should not be allowed if the measured tire
pressure is above a certain limit, which means that the sensor is mounted in
the tire of a vehicle. This also applies to those other commands of the sensor
from manufacturer "B" which are probably some kind of factory test or developer
commands. Please note that during my tests the commands I described were
possible even when the measured tire pressure was in the range of a typical
vehicle wheel.
</p>

<p>
I contacted the car manufactures (BMW and Ford) before I published this
article, this is the experience I made:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>BMW:</b>
  The contact information for reporting security issues can be found on
  the BMW website. I had a phone call with the responsible person within
  a few days after reporting the issue. BMW already knew the problem, they
  found it during an internal review. Their latest TPMS sensors have fixed
  the issue by blocking certain commands if the tire pressure is above a
  certain limit.
</li>

<li>
  <b>Ford:</b>
  I wasn't able to find a security contact on the website of Ford Germany
  so I contacted the person responsible for "Public Relation". He promised
  to look for someone who takes care of the issue I reported, after several
  days I got a reply that it is possible to disturb the TPMS system due to
  the nature of radio transmission and that this is a known problem. I wasn't
  able to communicate directly with the responsible person and I then replied
  that the reported issue is not about disturbance but a "Denial of Service"
  and that it is even possible to destroy a certain TPMS sensor used in Ford
  cars. I didn't receive any further information about the security issue, I
  notified them again after several weeks that I am now going to publish
  the issue which was acknowledged.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some notes about those "Universal" sensors tire dealers normally use: Those
sensors are "Universal" because they can be programmed for different car
models. The main benefit for the tire dealer is that only a few different
kind of "Universal" sensors have to be on stock, it’s not necessary to have
lots of different "OEM" TPMS sensors for every possible car model lying
around. The programming of those …</p></div></td></div></div>

<h3 id="preword">Preword</h3>

<p>I often reference the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">manpages</a> when giving a development
presentation or talk, but I’ve only recently come to realize how few people are both <em>comfortable</em>
with the <code>man</code> interface and adept at discovering information through it.</p>

<p>This post is my attempt to share some of the tricks and techniques I’ve picked up over years of
reading manpages.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-recap">A Quick Recap</h2>

<p>The manpages (short for “manual pages”) are the oldest and longest-running documentation collection
on *nix, stemming back to the
<a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html">first edition of the Unix Programmer’s Manual</a>
in 1971.</p>

<p>On a modern system, the <code>man</code> command is the most common way to access the manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># access the first manpage named "time", which happens to be time(1)</span>
man <span>time</span>

<span># access a specific section's "time", in this case the C time function</span>
man 2 <span>time</span>

<span># attempt to access a nonexistent "time" in section 5</span>
man 5 <span>time</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because the manpages were originally published on paper, they were (and continue to be) typeset with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff"><code>troff</code></a> on most systems. Today, the <code>man</code> command (and other
manpage readers) invoke <code>troff</code> internally and pipe the output to the user’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_pager">pager</a> (like <code>more</code> or <code>less</code>).</p>

<p>In fact, a very simple manpage reader (which only works with section 1) can be implemented with
just three commands pipelined together:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function </span>myman <span>{</span>
    <span># `-t` and `-e`: run `tbl` and `eqn` on the input, for tables and equations</span>
    <span># `-mandoc`: use a set of troff macros specifically for manpages</span>
    <span># `-Tutf8`: output UTF-8 text rather than PostScript</span>
    <span>gunzip</span> &lt; /usr/share/man/man1/<span>"</span><span>${</span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span>.1.gz"</span> | groff <span>-t</span> <span>-e</span> <span>-mandoc</span> <span>-Tutf8</span> | less
<span>}</span>

myman gcc
myman <span>ls</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from their simplicity and adherence to the UNIX philosophy, <code>man</code> and the manpages serve a
number of important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They provide a categorization: section 1 is for system commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for library
functions, and so forth. This categorization is followed both by the system itself (which populates
several of the sections) and by programs installed by the user or package manager.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide offline documentation: <code>man</code> doesn’t require an internet connection, and can provide
much of the documentation that an internet search would yield.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They offer <em>canonical</em> information: searching for a command or function online might tell you
whether it exists, but won’t tell you the flags, arguments, or behavior specific to your system.
For example, <code>man ls</code> will tell you whether your system’s <code>ls</code> is BSD or GNU (and the differences
therebetween). The manpages (on Linux) will also tell you which feature macros you’ll need to define
in a C program in order to use a function (or a variant of a function).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, let’s move on to some techniques.</p>

<h2 id="colorized-manpages">Colorized manpages</h2>

<p>One of the simplest things you can do to enhance the readability of manpages within <code>man</code> is to
colorize the pager’s output:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/gcc_man.png" alt="A colorized version of `man gcc`"></p>

<p>In <code>less</code>, this is accomplished by setting the <code>LESS_TERMCAP_*</code> environment variables to your
preferred ANSI color codes. Here are the variables you can set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>LESS_TERMCAP_mb <span># blinking mode (not common in manpages)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_md <span># double-bright mode (used for boldface)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_me <span># exit/reset all modes</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_so <span># enter standout mode (used by the less statusbar and search results)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_se <span># exit standout mode</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_us <span># enter underline mode (used for underlined text)</span>
LESS_TERMCAP_ue <span># exit underline mode</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may be able to set others corresponding to the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/termutils/manual/termcap-1.3/html_chapter/termcap_5.html">termcap capability names</a>,
but the variables above should cover all of your manpage needs.</p>

<p>By way of example, here is the <code>bash</code> function I use to colorize my manpages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>man<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>env</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_mb</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_md</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;31m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_me</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_se</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_so</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;44;33m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_ue</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[0m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>LESS_TERMCAP_us</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\e</span><span>[1;32m"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    man <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that you don’t need to use escape sequences as above — <code>tput</code> will work just fine.</p>

<h2 id="other-sections">Other sections</h2>

<p>I mentioned some of the big sections above: 1 for system commands, 2 for system calls, and so on.</p>

<p>90% of <code>man</code> lookups will be in those three, but there are a few lesser-known sections that can also
be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 4</code> - Special files and devices</p>

    <p>On Linux, section 4 is used to document special files, usually representing some aspect of
  the machine or its peripherals. For example, <code>man 4 mem</code> will tell you how to use the
  <code>/dev/mem</code>, <code>/dev/kmem</code>, and <code>/dev/port</code> files to read from and write to the system’s main
  memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man 5</code> - Configuration files and formats</p>

    <p>You probably know the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file, but do you know how its format is specified?
  <code>man 5 shadow</code> will tell you that. Similarly, <code>man 5 deb</code> describes the <code>.deb</code> package format,
  and <code>man 5 ppm</code> lists the spec for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">PPM images</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>man Np</code> - POSIX pages</p>

    <p>These pages come in handy for contrasting POSIX behavior with the system’s behavior.</p>

    <p>Some examples:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span># compare the system ls (on Linux, GNU) to the POSIX ls behavior</span>
  man 1 <span>ls
  </span>man 1p <span>ls</span>

  <span># compare the read syscall to the POSIX read function</span>
  <span># note the categorization: POSIX read is a function, not a syscall!</span>
  man 2 <span>read
  </span>man 3p <span>read</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="searching-and-navigating">Searching and navigating</h2>

<p>Like colorization, searching is more of a general <code>less</code> feature than one specific to <code>man</code>. That
being said, <code>less</code>’s searching and navigating features can make browsing the manpages a much faster
and more pleasant experience.</p>

<p>Searches in <code>less</code> can be forwards or backwards, using the <code>/</code> and <code>?</code> commands respectively. The
search syntax is mostly POSIX ERE, but with some additions (<code>man less</code> has the details!).</p>

<p>For example, to find the first instance of “x86” in <code>man gcc</code> (watch the bottom of the screen for
the search prompt):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wc0OiKVTrTDiP4tG9bPRWtDwM.png">
</a></p>

<p>Observe that instances of the search term are highlighted with the standout colors from before.</p>

<p>Once a search term is entered, its results can be navigated via the <code>n</code> and <code>N</code> commands, which
move forwards and backwards in the results list respectively. For example, going through all
of the results for “Windows”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_n3S3wteHmbdPrtmyTSkCSVMiX.png">
</a></p>

<p>When the last result has been jumped to, the statusbar changes to “Pattern not found”. Once that
happens, as in the video above, previous results can be returned to by hitting <code>N</code>.</p>

<p>Even this can be simplified: the <code>&amp;</code> command can be used to display only lines that match the given
pattern. For example, retrieving every line that contains either “ARM” or “ABI”:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_Wh8QZ4eideLNmCMBmAkYExgEm.png">
</a></p>

<p>The effect is more dramatic when searching for the definition of a flag (in this case <code>-D</code>):</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_17Kcnb8PBNIz8JdogOFKVeDQn.png">
</a></p>

<p>These commands are just the tip of the iceberg — <code>less</code> supports searching multiple files at
once, jumping around scopes (opening and closing parentheses, braces, brackets), and marking the
current location for later return. Each of these is documented on the help screen, which you can
get to in any <code>less</code> session via the <code>h</code> command:</p>

<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/8i6kyFTbFttVTgDNbgnzyJvGB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/asc_8i6kyFTbFttVTgDNbgnzyJvGB.png">
</a></p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Before picking up these tricks (especially searching), the manpages were an item of last resort
for me: I would search the internet or ask a friend, with mixed results. I had no real idea how to
use <code>less</code>, and would just clumsily page around until I found what I was looking for. More often
than not, I would give up entirely.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the manpages (and the <code>man</code> interface) are not perfect — there’s no
hyperlinking or real cross-referencing, and the entire corpus is written in a 45+ year old
typesetting language designed for <em>physical</em> output, not display in a virtual terminal.</p>

<p>That being said, they’re a <em>fantastic</em> initial resource for pretty much anything concerning your
system — they remain up-to-date (unlike blogs and articles), they’re accurate and concise, and
they’re <em>very</em> UNIX-y (text files and pipelines!).</p>

<div>
  <p>An interesting way for getting an intuitive sense for why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability" title="Poker hand probabilities">certain hands</a> are rare in poker, I've laid out all the cards in a standard deck in a grid:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/blank_600x600.png?v=1607133617" alt="Array of Playing Cards"></p>


<p>When I first learned to play poker, it took a while before I could get an intuitive understanding of the relationships between the various poker hands. Calculating their likelihood definitely helped get a handle on how many ways for a specific hand to actually occur there were.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I think laying the hands out in a grid like this would have given me an intuitive understanding of the game much more quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Poker Hands shown geometrically</h2>
<p>So the lowest poker hand, a high card, is sometimes a rarity because there is no connection with&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/High_Card_600x600.png?v=1607134813" alt="High Card"></p>

<p>The next highest hand is a single pair which has a geometric interpretation of one column with two dots in it:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Pair_600x600.png?v=1607134853" alt="Pair"></p>

<p>Two pair has a similar flair to it, except this one has 2 vertical lines:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Two_Pair_600x600.png?v=1607134962" alt=""></p>

<p>Three of a kind is similar in spirit, but is much rarer than the two preceding hands happening once every 50 hands:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/three_of_a_kind_600x600.png?v=1607135086" alt="3 of a kind"></p>

<p>For a straight, we need 5 cards that are in order without any gaps and can look kind of like a nice scatter plot:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_600x600.png?v=1607135179" alt="Straight"></p>

<p>A flush requires all 5 cards in the hand to be in a single horizontal row, but there can gaps between them:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/flush_84512f1f-428d-4ed7-b703-9372fc3575d6_600x600.png?v=1607135233" alt="Flush"></p>

<p>A full house requires that all points be split into two lines of 3 and 2 points each:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/full_house_600x600.png?v=1607135454" alt="Full House"></p>

<p>Four of a Kind requires a vertical line that spans the entire grid with an extra point tucked away somewhere:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/4_of_a_kind_600x600.png?v=1607135655" alt="4 of a kind"></p>

<p>A straight flush is one of the tidiest hands as it requires all cards to be colinear on the same row and be immediately adjacent to each other:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/straight_flush_600x600.png?v=1607135809" alt="Straight Flush" width="600x600" height="600x600"></p>

<p>The best hand that you can get is a subset of all the straight flushes that you can get. It's just a straight flush all the way against the right side of the grid with the 5 highest cards:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Royal_Flush_600x600.png?v=1607135877" alt="Royal Flush" width="600x600" height="600x600"></p>


<p>Looking at poker this way made me realize that there are some interesting hands that we could add to the game.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Rectangle</h2>
<p>This hand is formed when you have 4 points that are <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Collinear.html" title="Mathematical Definition of colinearity">colinear</a> in both orthogonal axes (form a rectangle):&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Rectangle_600x600.png?v=1607136065" alt="Rectangle Hand"></p>

<h2>Flower</h2>
<p>This one seems like it would be complicated to spot in the wild, but in reality it's a lot like a full house. You need a Three of a Kind and the other two cards need to be the same suit as one of your 3oK cards, and just before and after it. So, maybe it is a little complicated to spot, but it certainly is an interesting idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0502/8370/8606/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-04_at_18.42.56_600x600.png?v=1607136337" alt="Flower Hand"></p>

<h2>Want More?</h2>

    <p>Overview</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>In <a href="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/gRPC-1.html" target="_blank"><span>Part 1</span></a> of
        this series, we provided a high-level overview of <span>gRPC</span>, installed the necessary software, setup the
        environment, and finally demonstrated the <span>Unary</span> RPC communication in both Go and Java.</p>
      <p>In this part, we will continue the journey to the next RPC communication pattern - <span>Server Streaming</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Server Streaming RPC</p>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of <span>Server Streaming</span> communication
        pattern:</p>
    <div id="img-outer-div"> <p><img src="https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/images/grpc-06.png" alt="Server Streaming Architecture"></p><p>Figure-6</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>In the Server Streaming RPC mode, the client sends a request to the server and the server responds with sequence (or stream)
        of messages back to the client.</p>
    <p>For the Server Streaming RPC demonstration, we will implement a fictitious Currency Rate service, where the client sends the
        'from' currency and the 'to' currency as the request and the server responds with a stream of 'rates' from different 'agents'.</p>
    <div id="para-div">
      <p>We will first demonstrate the Currency Rate service using the Go programming language.</p>
      <p>In the <span>$GOPATH</span> directory, create the project directory hierarchy by executing the following
        commands:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="cmd-div">
      <p>$ cd $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc</p>
      <p>$ mkdir -p serverstream serverstream/currencypb serverstream/server serverstream/client</p>
    </div>
    <p>The following are the contents of the file <span>currency.proto</span> located in the directory <span>
        $GOPATH/src/polarsparc.com/grpc/serverstream/currencypb</span> as shown below:</p>

    <p>The request message is defined as <span>CurrencyRateRequest</span> and the response message is defined as
        <span>CurrencyRateResponse</span>. The service interface is defined as <span>CurrencyService</span>
        with an RPC method <span>getCurrencyRate</span> that takes in a <span>CurrencyRateRequest</span>

<p><strong>Presentation: </strong><strong>Esperanto Accelerates Machine Learning With 1000+ Low-Power RISC-V Cores on a Single Chip</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Esperanto Technologies has developed a ground-breaking accelerator chip for large-scale machine learning applications employing over 1000 RISC-V cores.</li>
<li>In this talk, Esperanto provides an overview of the company’s new ET-SoC-1 chip, which features two kinds of general-purpose 64-bit RISC-V cores. The ET-Maxion, previewed at the RISC-V Summit in 2018, is a superscalar out-of-order core delivering high performance for modern operating systems and applications. The complementary ET-Minion core designed by Esperanto is a leaner, energy efficient, in-order multithreaded core with a vector/tensor accelerator unit at the heart of the massively parallel compute array.</li>
<li>The chip’s performance and efficiency is derived from a combination of factors, including the simplicity of the RISC-V instruction set, wide vector/tensor units on every ET-Minion core, a uniquely optimized memory hierarchy, state of the art process technology, and custom pipeline architecture and low-voltage circuits which enables more energy-efficient operation. The result is that Esperanto will deliver better performance per watt than legacy CPU and GPU solutions, as well as competing fixed-function designs without compromising generally purpose flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Esperanto Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Esperanto Technologies develops high-performance, energy-efficient computing solutions for Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning based on the open standard RISC-V instruction set architecture. Esperanto is headquartered in Mountain View, California with engineering sites in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas in the United States and multiple sites in Europe. Esperanto has brought together a seasoned team of experienced processor and software engineers with the goal of making RISC-V the architecture of choice for compute-intensive applications such as AI and Machine Learning. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.esperanto.ai/">https://www.esperanto.ai/</a></p>
<p><strong>About the RISC-V Summit</strong></p>
<p>The third annual RISC-V Summit will highlight the continued rapid expansion of the RISC-V ecosystem, presenting both commercial offerings and exciting open-source developments. Newcomers to RISC-V, as well as the seasoned developers who are interested in broadening their toolsets, are invited to choose from the broad range of tutorials. The comprehensive 100% virtual event will feature keynotes from industry pioneers as well as thought-provoking panel discussions.

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

December 4, 2020 | https://jake.nyc/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jake.nyc/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a web app without a framework. There are a bunch of potential advantages (no bloat! bespoke to your project!) and being able to say you built something with minimal dependencies gets you Engineer Points.</p>
<p>That is, if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>I started a new side project recently. It’s a web-based graphics editor, so it needs to be a single page app. My time spent profiling <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> for performance issues has made me a little wary of React for building interfaces that update at 60 frames per second, so I decided to avoid it. I’d go (mostly) vanilla and see how far that took me.</p>
<p>I installed <a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> and got to work. “Components” were simply functions that returned lit-html template results. A big singleton at the top of the tree held onto all the application state, stored as a global variable within that module.</p>
<p>The first hurdle came when a component needed local state. I could have lifted it to the singleton, but that would have broken the component’s encapsulation. I noticed that lit-html directives can keep state, so I decided to use them to build a tiny component library — ignoring a warning from the lit-html developers that this wasn’t a supported use case.</p>
<p>My home-brewed library worked great… until I needed to run some code when a component appeared on the screen. I started digging through lit-html documentation and issues looking for a way to detect a directive’s lifecycle, but it became clear to me that going down that path would be painful.</p>
<p>At that point, I recalled <a href="https://tomdale.net/2015/11/javascript-frameworks-and-mobile-performance/">this quote by Tom Dale</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have heard from many developers who have told me that they accepted the argument that vanilla JavaScript or microlibraries would let them write leaner, meaner, faster apps. After a year or two, however, what they found themselves with was a slower, bigger, less documented and unmaintained in-house framework with no community. As apps grow, you tend to need the abstractions that a framework offers. Either you or the community write the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. Let’s avoid that trap. What about a small framework? I’d heard a lot of good things about Svelte, and although I was slightly worried about the size of the Svelte community I figured it would be fine.</p>
<p>My migration attempt quickly ground to a halt when I wanted a parent component to apply some styles to a child component. In React, I’d pass a class name in from the parent as a <code>className</code> prop. In Svelte, that’s considered a workaround, and the actual feature is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-style-properties.md">RFC</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Maybe this is an example of <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/160.html">dangling by a trivial feature</a>. But it’s so basic a capability that I’m surprised Svelte is on version three without an officially blessed way to do it. I ran into this limitation when I created my <strong>second component</strong>. Way before I got to try out any of the cool reactivity that earns Svelte all that buzz.</p>
<p>So I changed my mind and went with React. After an hour or so, I’d finished moving everything over — and my anxiety had vanished. I stopped worrying about having most efficient component system, and picked up work on the thing I wanted to build in the first place.</p>
<p>No, React isn’t perfect. It’s optimized for apps that make network requests and then display lists of things (i.e. most apps) which isn’t really what I’m doing here<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The performance is fine now, although I expect I’ll have to optimize as my project gets more complex.</p>
<p>But React lets me stop thinking about the framework. React gets out of my way. React is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring</a>. React is actively developed. React has a giant ecosystem and a giant community. React is battle-tested on some of the most visited websites in the world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are technically better ways to build a highly interactive interface on the web, but life is too short for me to spend hours trying to figure them out. There are things I want to create, and the only way I can actually create them is to stop spending so much time on tooling.</p>
<p>For now, I’m choosing React.</p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The solution they seem to have landed on — letting the child expose CSS custom properties as props — is actually pretty cool, though I don’t like that Svelte will silently wrap your component with an extra <code>div</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Although Dan, if you read this, the <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1133341485133438982">“animation pass” mode</a> you’ve mentioned offhandedly sounds very relevant! <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

Games generally have a short-lived sales cycle so I am not expecting a huge increase in sales after this.</p>
<p>I’m writing this up to help other indie developers calibrate their expectations. You often read about the success stories because people love to read that it’s possible to make it big with a hit game, but few people bother to write up mediocre outcomes, which is the outcome of <em>most</em> game development efforts. This is called “selection bias”.</p>
<p>You can find a list of all the marketing and promotion I did below, to give you an idea of what kind of an effect you can expect from a single person doing all coding and all promotion by themselves.</p>

<p>Let’s cut to the chase.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>30</code> copies of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cx.mccormick.asterogue" rel="nofollow noopener">Asterogue for Android</a> were sold netting <code>$89 USD</code>.</li>
<li><code>18</code> copies of <a href="https://chr15m.itch.io/asterogue">Asterogue for Windows</a> were sold netting <code>$132 USD</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Total sales = <code>$221 USD</code></p>
<p>The game got a couple of five star ratings on each platform. Interestingly, the average payment for the Windows version was around $6 which is double the suggested $3 (people were able to choose any amount higher than $3).</p>
<p>The main cost making the game was my own time. If I had been charging one of my freelance clients to make this game it would have cost around <code>$5k - $10k</code> over 1.5 months of part time development at my normal hourly rate. Incidentally if you’re interested in having a game like this made, <a href="mailto:chris@mccormick.cx" rel="nofollow noopener">hit me up</a>. :)</p>

<p>It’s interesting to look at the visits to the game’s pages on each platform, and the click-through-rate of people who visited the page and then went on the buy the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Windows page on Itch saw <code>1,937</code> views with a click-through purchase rate of just under 1%.</li>
<li>The Google Play store doesn’t give raw numbers but it says the conversion rate is about 1% too.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s an implication here that if I could drive more traffic to these pages I could expect 1 out of every 100 visitors to buy the game.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of all the marketing and promotion I did while building the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mccrmx/status/1306223700199448577" rel="nofollow noopener">Kept a Twitter thread up to date with the latest changes</a> (about 1250 followers).</li>
<li><a href="https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=70875.0" rel="nofollow noopener">Posted devlogs to the TIGSource forum</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/search/?q=saturday%20sharing&amp;source=recent&amp;restrict_sr=1" rel="nofollow noopener">Participated in Saturday Sharing on /r/roguelikedev</a>.</li>
<li>I sent a couple of updates to my own email newsletter subscribers (there are 90 subscribers).</li>
<li>Some <a href="https://dev.to/chr15m" rel="nofollow noopener">dev.to posts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of everywhere I launched the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/jkt4ue/asterogue_released_today_sci_fi_pixel_graphics/" rel="nofollow noopener">Launched on /r/roguelikes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mccormick.cx/news/entries/it-s-asterogue-launch-day" rel="nofollow noopener">On my own blog</a>.</li>
<li>Emailed the <a href="https://infinitelives.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener">infinitelives mailing list</a>.</li>
<li>Emailed my own email newsletter subscribers.</li>
<li>Created a listing on <a href="http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Asterogue" rel="nofollow noopener">RogueBasin</a> and in the news section too.</li>
<li>Kenney.nl discord in #promotion</li>
<li>Roguelikes discord in #advertise-releases</li>
<li>On the local game dev discord in my city.</li>
<li>On the local web dev front-enders Slack chat in my city (the game is built with front-end web technology).</li>
</ul>
<p>After release I also wrote some blog posts here on the game’s Itch devlog and linked a couple of these to Hacker News. The post <a href="https://chr15m.itch.io/asterogue/devlog/190653/my-game-wont-sell-and-thats-ok">My game won’t sell and that’s ok</a> got 7k hits.</p>

<p>There are three main strategies I can think of to improve sales for this game and future games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kaizen. Improving the game. Fixing issues people have flagged and making quality of life improvements from player feedback.</li>
<li>Keep making more games. Compound on the interest and marketing garnered by this game. This is the strategy of <a rel="nofollow noopener">Sokpop games</a> and when I did an analysis of their collective I realized they probably didn’t make a profit until game number 8.</li>
<li>Use a 3rd party company for promotion instead of doing it myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am going to allocate time in my schedule to improve Asterogue. I got some great feedback and I want to polish those rough edges and fix all the issues people have flagged.</p>
<p>I will almost certainly make more graphically rich roguelike games in the future, because it was so much fun to do so. Thank you very much to everybody who bought the game, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I think the key is to do this without great expectations, just try to make the best games possible, and have fun doing it.</p>
<p>If you want to hear about games and other stuff I make you can follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/mccrmx" rel="nofollow noopener">on Twitter @mccrmx</a> or <a href="https://mccormick.cx/" rel="nofollow noopener">subscribe to my newsletter at mccormick.cx</a>. Thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the fall of 2007, my parents gave me an unforgettable gift for my sixteenth birthday: a first-generation iPhone.</p><p>I still clearly remember watching the keynote in which Steve Jobs announced the first Apple-branded phone a few months earlier. As a teenager attending high school in my hometown of Vicenza, Italy, I tuned into the livestream just before dinner, carefully listening to every word he said. That evening, Jobs started announcing a “widescreen iPod with touch controls”, a “revolutionary mobile phone” and a “breakthrough Internet communications device”–theatrically pausing before confessing that he was actually talking about one single device: the iPhone. Thousands of miles away from me, you could hear attendees exploding cheerfully through the live feed. Jobs went on demoing this amazing invention that, a decade later, would end up changing much more than the mobile phones market: it directly or indirectly impacted our society through mobile web, app stores, changing work-life balance, and social media.</p><p>October came, and so did the day I finally got my iPhone. I was really excited as I was the first one in my social circle with one. Every other teenager (and adult!) that saw my phone reacted in awe and with lots of curiosity. More than a few were also secretly envious, something I secretly did not mind. To add to the novelty, at the time the iPhone was only available for sale in the US.</p><p>To get an iPhone for me, my father had to ask a friend traveling to New York on a business trip to bring one back on the plane with her. That was not the end of it, however, as all phones were locked to the AT&amp;T network. In order for me to be able to use my iPhone in Italy, I had to unlock it.</p><p>That process required learning a variety of tools and techniques developed by hackers in the community, then documented in various blogs and forums. The first step was to <em>jailbreak</em> the phone, which gave you full access to the system and allowed you to run third-party apps. Then you’d have add one of those “hacking” apps to your phone, which patched the bootloader to remove the lock the US carrier had put on it. Despite sounding like a mouthful, the iPhone hacking community had worked hard on the User Experience (UX), making this entire process relatively easy for most people with basic tech skills.</p><hr><p>I really loved my shiny, new iPhone, and I was so excited about it that I was willing to accept many of its original limitations. It only supported slow 2G networks, didn’t have copy/paste, couldn’t transfer files via Bluetooth to my friends, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">famously</a> didn’t support Adobe Flash, which was ubiquitous on the web at the time.</p><p>However, there was one thing I really couldn’t stand: the Messages application could only store 1,000 texts (SMS).</p><p>That was 2007 — before the days of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc. Instant messaging was something people did on their PCs only, with things like Windows Live Messenger (née MSN Messenger) or AIM.</p><p>For a high schooler like me, text messaging was the main way I kept in touch with my friends daily (<em>what was I supposed to do, call them?</em>). With my carrier giving me a whopping 100 free texts per day (seriously, we had to pay for them), between sent and received texts it would take less than a week to reach the storage limit of 1,000.</p><p>That’s when it all started.</p><p>Because my iPhone was already “hacked” (jailbroken), as a requirement for unlocking it and use it in Italy, I had full system access already. That allowed me to c extract any document I wanted, including my phone’s text message database.</p><p>It wasn’t even a month since I got my iPhone that I had already built a small “app” running on my laptop to archive my text messages forever. I would manually extract the SMS database from my iPhone, copy it to my laptop, then use a set of scripts written in PHP (the only programming language I knew at the time) to store the messages in a local database, and finally display them using a web-based interface.</p><p>This thing I put together worked just fine for me, but I immediately realized the “business potential” of what I had just created. Just like myself, I assumed many others had the same annoyance. I could have used what I learned to help them too, and maybe make some pocket change in the process. As a matter of fact, I did consider myself an enterprising teenager.</p><p>The idea had potential, and the “app” I built for myself already provided solid foundations, so I just needed to do a bit more work to turn it into a commercially-viable project.</p><p>The biggest challenge was making the solution more accessible to others, including those who were not particularly tech-savvy. That’s when I started learning about app development for iPhone.</p><p>Famously, Apple did not want the iPhone to support third-party apps at the beginning, saying developers should build web apps instead. That policy didn’t last long, and with the iPhone OS 2 update, launched in mid-2008, the official App Store came to life: the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>However, the hacking community had already found a way to sideload apps and had even developed an “app store” called Cydia where you could find games, apps, and even mods to enhance the capabilities of the operating system itself. Cydia came preinstalled on every <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone, which meant potentially hundreds of thousands of people had access to it.</p><p>Everyone could build apps that would be published on Cydia, as long as you knew how to–something that was not remotely as easy to do as it is with today’s tools. As an enterprising teenager with quite a bit of free time on my hand during those winter afternoons and evenings, I took on that challenge.</p><hr><p>The first version of YouArchive.It came out in January 2008.</p><p>Today, you would describe YouArchive.It as a cloud service to store iPhone text messages. You could store all your messages in there, then read and search them using a web-based application.</p><p>There’s still a video left on YouTube showing the application in action (this was the third, and last, version):</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ps5ohEhO3S4" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>With YouArchive.It came an iPhone application too. Published on the Cydia app store, it allowed importing messages into the “cloud service” directly from the phone.</p><p>YouArchive.It was free to use with a limit of 80,000 text messages. Because personal communications can be sensitive, all messages were stored encrypted. With a one-time payment of just €5 (about $6), you could become a VIP, remove any limit and enjoy unlimited storage.</p><p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vTxYRljXFl3IBXGRsXOVag.png" alt="A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone"></p><figcaption>A screenshot of iTextUploader running on a first-generation iPhone</figcaption><p>For the next year and a half, YouArchive.It continued to grow organically. A few blogs and websites dedicated to iPhone “hacking” and to the underground app stores wrote about the app. Even a small radio program in the US featured it</p><p>I continued developing the app as a side project while in high school. I was also providing tech support and maintaining the infrastructure.</p><p>Listening to users' feedback, I would periodically add new features. YouArchive.It started displaying emojis as soon as the iPhone supported that (outside of Japan, it required downloading an app to enable them). Users asked for and got the ability to restore texts in another iPhone, before iCloud was available. I also implemented other privacy features such as requiring a password to open the mobile app.</p><blockquote><h3 id="what-i-didnt-realize-at-the-time-however-is-that-i-had-unknowingly-and-unwillingly-built-a-spying-tool-and-a-really-convenient-and-efficient-one">What I didn’t realize at the time, however, is that I had, unknowingly and unwillingly, built a spying tool, and a really convenient and efficient one.</h3></blockquote><p>Enough users were paying the fee to become VIP that I could cover the costs of running the service–this was before everyone was using Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, so I was renting a co-located physical server which wasn’t cheap–and keep some pocket cash. Not much, but enough to pay for some hobbies and outings with friends.</p><p>Most importantly, building YouArchive.It gave me a lot of satisfaction and the opportunity to learn a lot of things about software development, business, dealing with customers and listening to their feedback.</p><hr><p>When I finally shut the service down, in June 2010, YouArchive.It had about 32,000 registered users who stored over 76 million messages.</p><p>The first, and stated, reason for the deprecation was a technical one: YouArchive.It’s iPhone app required using private APIs, which meant it could not be published on the App Store (and it still couldn’t to this day), limiting it to <em>jailbroken</em> phones only.</p><p>The second reason however was the most important to me, even though I have not revealed it until now.</p><p>About a year before the app closed, in April 2009 I implemented a new feature that was requested by many users: the ability to upload texts automatically, in background, without user intervention. For paying “VIP” users only, the mobile app could automatically send all new text messages to YouArchive.It, as often as every 15 minutes.</p><p>Automatic upload was an incredible convenience for many users that wanted to hoard their texts like me, to keep them forever, search within them, print or export them, or just liked having a backup.</p><p>What I didn’t realize at the time, however, is that I had, unknowingly and unwillingly, built a spying tool, and a really convenient and efficient one.</p><p>Thanks to background uploads, people could install the YouArchive.It app on another person’s iPhone, set it up, maybe even hide it (something possible on a <em>jailbroken</em> iPhone), and then watch as the text messages come in, almost real-time. Jealous partners, stalkers and the likes could install this tool on an unknowing victim’s phone with relative ease.</p><p>I can’t remember how I discovered that — it might have been a support request from a user or a post in a bulletin board. I also can’t know how many people were using YouArchive.It for their own archiving rather than to spy on others. Realizing what my users were doing, however, made me feel really uncomfortable and I did not want any part of that anymore.</p><p>As a senior in high school, barely eighteen years-old, I realized for the first time how technology can have a …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The development and evolution of the Mozilla browser, from its Netscape-seeded beginnings through the Firefox releases of today, can be fascinating.  Numerous changes occurred to the software in terms of technology, features, and appearance; particularly when Mozilla and Mozilla Firefox were both in their infancy and many groundbreaking developments were made.  Much of this software was not widely seen or used when initially released, with its focus limited to enterprising testers and developers for several years.  Several releases however provided the basis for Netscape 6.x and 7.x releases that were oriented towards end users, which as an essential part of the context are also covered here.</p><p>Although I could have conceivably traced this chronology all the way back to <a href="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/nscape1.html">Netscape in 1994</a>,  I have chosen to limit my focus to the post-Netscape 4.x browser development that began from the time Netscape released its preliminary "5.0" source code on March 31, 1998 through the present day.  For consistency, I have also chosen to show the browsers running on Windows 95 (which was current at the time the original code was released) at the same screen size displaying the respective browser's "About" page when possible.</p><div>

<tbody><tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/ns404.png" alt="[Netscape Navigator 4.04 screenshot]"></td>
<td>As a point of reference, we'll begin our look back at the history of Mozilla with a screenshot of Netscape Navigator 4.04, which was current at the time when Netscape released most of the source code to its next browser release in development on March 31, 1998.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/ns50.png" alt="[Unofficial Netscape 5.0 screenshot]"></td>
<td>After the Netscape source code was released, some enterprising users attempted to compile it.  This is a screenshot of one such unofficial "Netscape 5.0" build, available for download <a href="ftp://sillydog.org/pub/misc/mozilla5.zip">here</a>.<p>
The user interface at this point was substantially the same as that of Netscape 4.x, although Netscape trademark references were changed to the codename "Mozilla" or removed altogether.</p><p>
The fire-breathing Mozilla lizard graphic used on this "About" screen was originally one of many <a href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/mozilla/">mascot graphics</a> used on Netscape's website in 1994-95, and would reappear on Mozilla later on.</p><p>
Many features are non-functional, and this happens to be the buggiest piece of software I have ever used; with frequent error dialogues and crashes.  Given circumstances such as these, perhaps it's not surprising that later in 1998 the decision was made to practically rewrite the browser from scratch...</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/geckoprev.png" alt="[Netscape Gecko Preview screenshot]"></td>
<td>There is little detailed documentation of what "Netscape 5.0" development went on throughout 1998, and due to the circumstances of the time nearly all development work was limited to inside the walls of Netscape headquarters.  (A page was once created on MozillaZine containing screenshots from this era...and it <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/alookback/">still exists</a>!)
<p>
In December 1998, however, Netscape did publicly release a developer preview based upon this development work and its new rendering engine, called NGLayout or "Gecko."  This preview was not intended as a traditional browser beta as much as a press demonstration of the new rendering technology.</p><p>
Curiously, this build produces the user agent string of "</p><tt>Mozilla/4.05 [en] (Win95; I)</tt>," leading me to wonder if Netscape created the preview by taking Navigator 4.05 and somehow grafting the new rendering engine into it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m3.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 3 screenshot]"></td>
<td>In March 1999, the first "proper" next-generation Netscape browser preview was released under the moniker of "Milestone 3" (Milestones 1 and 2 were apparently limited to internal development).<p>
A new user interface with bluish-purple toolbar buttons was introduced, and due to the open-source nature of the program Netscape trademarks were again absent.</p><p>
Interestingly, the "throbber" graphic used on this build was the same blue "N" used as an interim logo on <a href="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/nscape1.html">Netscape Navigator</a> 0.96 and <a href="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/nscape1.html">1.0</a> back in 1994.</p><p>
Although this is usually considered the first proper "Mozilla" release, there are in fact no overt references to "Mozilla" on the browser:  The start page calls it "the Gecko Browser," while the Help menu instead references "Communicator Prototype."</p><p>
These early Mozilla milestones had quite a few bugs:  This particular release has many non-functional features, and the status bar runs off the bottom of the screen at low display resolutions; as seen here.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m4.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 4 screenshot]"></td>
<td>Mozilla Milestone 4 introduced a number of developments and changes.<p>
The Netscape 1.0 throbber was replaced by a new Gecko-themed one, in which many words and phrases (including "search," "ecstatic," "together," "free," "hungry," "all for you," and "feel good") scrolled past in four directions as the browser retrieved information.</p><p>
The caption "Mozilla" was (temporarily) added to the title bar, a vestigial "Help" menu option was added, fewer links were placed on the Personal Toolbar by default, the purple-tinted Taskbar and status bar were now visible at low screen resolutions, and the sidebar—a characteristic feature of almost all subsequent Mozilla and Netscape releases—was enabled by default.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m5.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 5 screenshot]"></td>
<td>The changes in Milestone 5 were again minor, with some extra 3D definition added to the top and left edges of the toolbars and the word "Mozilla" removed from the title bar yet again.<p>
The sidebar had been visually revamped, although it was still primarily non-functional.  The sidebar panel in this screenshot rather resembles a mock-up of AOL Instant Messenger, although Don Luchini tells me he thinks it was intended to be a Resource Description Framework-based navigator at one point.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m8.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 8 screenshot]"></td>
<td>As already mentioned, these early Mozilla milestones were very buggy, and in fact I couldn't get M6 or M7 to run at all without freezing.  By the time Milestone 8 had been released to prospective testers in July 1999, most of the user interface had acquired a lavender tint, the toolbar icons were more widely spaced, and a "Translate" button had been added.<p>
The "Chat" button had been removed from the Taskbar, and text on the status bar now had 3D borders drawn around them.  Additionally, the browser no longer defaulted to an internal start page, the "Mozilla" caption reappeared on the title bar (this time for good), and the "QA" menu compiling frequently-used testing tools had made its first appearance.</p><p>
Interestingly, the Help menu still referenced the software as "Communicator Prototype" at this time.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m9.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 9 screenshot]"></td>
<td>Branding had improved slightly in Mozilla Milestone 9, with the familiar "m" throbber now in position replacing the earlier Gecko one and the Help menu now making references to only "Communicator" proper.<p>
Given away by their purple tint and "grippy" control, custom-drawn menus first appeared in the Windows and (presumably) Linux versions at this point.</p><p>
Some buttons and controls had also been changed:  The "Translate" button was removed, the 3D borders on the status bar were again omitted, the component icons moved from the right side to the left side of the Taskbar, and other elements on the Taskbar were now limited to three menus titled "Mozilla," "Shopping," and "Open Windows."</p><p>
Milestone 10 (which I was unable to run due to a crash error) is similar.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m11.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 11 screenshot]"></td>
<td>The visual changes that came to Mozilla with Milestone 11 were dramatic, at the very least.
A totally new teal and blue look with stylized round toolbar buttons was adopted, throwing normal OS-native interface conventions into the blender.  It matched Netscape's web page layout of the time, though.<p>
The sidebar was streamlined, the separate executable used to run the program was retitled from "apprunner" to "mozilla," an "About" screen (seen here) was now implemented, a "Search" button was added to the location field, and the "Shopping" menu on the Taskbar was (wisely, IMO) omitted.  The Personal Toolbar was reduced to a sliver above the main toolbar, and also duplicated the Bookmarks menu.</p><p>
By this point, virtually all remaining references to "Communicator 5.0" in the browser or directory structure had been removed.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m12.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 12 screenshot]"></td>
<td>Minor changes continued to work their way into the software in M12, with the "My Netscape" option removed from the Personal Toolbar and a custom-drawn scrollbar replacing the lingering OS-native element.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m13.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 13 screenshot]"></td>
<td>Mozilla Milestone 13 was released in January 2000 and looked almost identical to the previous release.
The Personal Toolbar and Taskbar captions were increased ever so slightly in size, and the "What's Related" sidebar panel was closed by default when first running the program:  Changes clearly on the hair-splitting side.<p>
In terms of packaging, however, Milestone 13 introduced an option of an installer to Windows and Macintosh users.  The installer screens and resulting Start Menu item (in Windows) are captioned "Mozilla Seamonkey," with "Seamonkey" being the codename for the application.</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/moz-m14.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 14 screenshot]"></td>
<td>More significant changes made their way into Mozilla M14.<p>
The cryptic text-line application runner had been removed (or at very least, rendered invisible).  The software "About" screen was redesigned and now included the famous mozilla.org star logo and user agent string (though the wrong milestone number was denoted in it!).</p><p>
There were some minor visual tweaks as well:  The drop-arrow was removed from the location field and the "Search" button moved from inside to outside it.</p><p>
<img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/mozicon14.png" alt="[Mozilla Milestone 14 application icon]">
Furthermore, the first Mozilla application icon was added (seen at right), and the old fire-breathing Mozilla lizard graphic from circa 1994 was brought back as an <a href="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/mozilla-splashold.png">application splash screen</a> retained through Mozilla 1.2.1 in 2002.
</p></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/ns6pr1.png" alt="[Netscape 6.0 Preview Release 1 screenshot]"></td>
<td>The first preview release, or formal beta, for Netscape 6.0 was released in April 2000, and with the exception of the Gecko developer preview from late 1998 this was the first Netscape-branded release since the groundbreaking of post-4.x browser development.<p>
This presented an interesting circumstance, as the previous Mozilla-branded milestones already effectively served as betas for Netscape 6.0.  This nevertheless was the first release to get extensive media attention and it introduced a number of proprietary features and other differences not in Mozilla M14; upon which it was based.</p><p>
<img src="http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/ns6icon.png" alt="[Netscape 6.0 application icon]">
Aside from the obvious presence of the Netscape …</p></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

AWS allows engineers to command and control cloud-based infrastructure, data, and other technical pieces of infrastructure without the hassle of developing entire frameworks from scratch.</p>
<p>Initially, AWS was launched to take care of online retail operations for Amazon, but it has turned into one of the most used cloud service providers.<br>
It can be essential for small, medium, and large business to keep up to date with all of the new services AWS is rolling out — as you never know what service might simplify your team’s development.</p>
<p>In this piece, we wanted to cover a few great services we’ve found useful over the past few years to help develop and deploy solutions.</p>
<h3>Cognito</h3>
<p><img data-attachment-id="806" data-permalink="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/5-aws-technologies-thatll-make-your-life-easier/png/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.theseattledataguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/unnamed-file.png?fit=499%2C207&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="499,207" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="cognito.png" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.theseattledataguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/unnamed-file.png?fit=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.theseattledataguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/unnamed-file.png?fit=207%2C207&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.theseattledataguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/unnamed-file.png?resize=499%2C207&amp;ssl=1" alt="cognito aws" width="499" height="207" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.theseattledataguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/unnamed-file.png?w=499&amp;ssl=1 499w, https://i1.wp.com/www.theseattledataguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/unnamed-file.png?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>From authentication to authorization, this technology offers complete user management for your web applications. Cognito can help you by simplifying your authentication workflow.</p>
<p>It even tracks things like user logins so you can track users who log in for security reasons.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Cognito service collects the user’s profile information into user pools, which a web application uses to configure the access to AWS resources. The data-synchronization feature allows users to access information from any device. This data can also be saved locally while offline.</p>
<p>It can also pair with authentication and authorization APIs and plugins from Facebook and Google to further make things easier for you to manage.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: The charges are based on the amount of data in the sync store and synchronization operations. With the free version, companies can save up to 10 GB data and perform 1 million operations for 1 year. Once the administer has completed this 1-year period, Cognito charges 15 cents/GB of sync storage and 15 cents/10,000 sync operations.</p>
<h3>Elastic Beanstalk</h3>

<p>Have you ever wished you could just hit deploy and see your website online without too much configuration? With the service AWS Beanstalk, you can easily deploy your web applications developed in Java, Python, .NET, PHP. and several other languages without having to spend too much time configuring servers.</p>
<p>The Elastic Beanstalk service is used to deploy and scale applications using servers such as Apache, Nginx, and IIS. In order to use this service, you just have to upload the code on AWS, and all of the deployment processes — such as autoscaling, application monitoring, and capacity provisioning and balancing — are handled automatically by beanstalk.</p>
<p>Supported platforms: Elastic Beanstalk offers a variety of platforms for developers to work with, including NodeJS, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby on Docker containers, and application servers such as Puma and Tomcat.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: The charges of running Beanstalk depend on the number of EC2 instances used to handle the web traffic and the bandwidth consumed by your application. With the free version, users can utilize one repository with 100 MB storage for a period of 12 months.</p>
<p>Afterward, plans for companies start from $50/month which offers 12 GB storage, 40 users, 10 servers, and 50 repositories. Individual freelancers can access a package for $15/ month that offers 3 GB storage with 5 users, 3 servers, and 10 repositories.</p>
<h3>EventBridge</h3>

<p>Amazon EventBridge acts as a management layer that coordinates events between different serverless modules by using an event bus with the rules-driven router.</p>
<p>The EventBridge builds over CloudWatchEvents by using the same service API as well as the same endpoint. The service provides way for seamlessly connecting data from the SaaS providers and customer applications.</p>
<p>For those who have built serverless applications, this service allows you to easily manage all your various modules.</p>
<p>Through the direct linking that EventBridge offers users can experience high availability and improved speed for the specific service. EventBrige’s easy setup includes zero coding, and it not only enhances performance but also security. It only takes up to one week of the developer’s time for its deployment. At the moment, the only concern is its limited adoption among SaaS providers.</p>
<p>Supporting platforms: About 10 SaaS partners currently support EventBridge. These include: Symantec, ZENData, SugarCRM, OneLogin, Segment, Saviynt, SignalFx, and Whispir</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong> plans: Amazon EventBridge hasn’t provided pricing information for the service online.</p>
<h3>RDS</h3>

<p>With the Amazon RDS service, you can generate dedicated instances for your database in a matter of minutes. These instances are supported by AWS’s support team — which is also capable of supporting multiple different database engines, such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.<br>
This takes away the hassle of needing to buy a new server every time you need to spin up a new instance. Need a test or dev instance? Done.<br>
The Relational Database Service (RDS) allows users to create and operate with relational databases that can be managed through any AWS management console. Moreover, using RDS allows you to access databases and files from anywhere in a very cost-effective and highly scalable manner. RDS offers high availability for primary instance — which are made synchronous with the secondary instance so you can fail over to the exact point at which a problem occurs.</p>
<p>Supporting platforms: Amazon RDS currently supports MariaDB, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and the Microsoft SQL server. Each of these database engines have their own support features.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: The free tier is valid for 12 months in which you can get 5 GB of storage, 750 RDS hours, and a 25 GB DynamoDB. Afterward, pricing is based on the services and storage you choose.</p>
<h3>CloudTrail</h3>
<p><img data-attachment-id="808" data-permalink="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/5-aws-technologies-thatll-make-your-life-easier/1_bxmgutm2almdqkyyh0iycw/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.theseattledataguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_BxMGUTM2ALMdqkYyh0Iycw.png?fit=281%2C179&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="281,179" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="1_BxMGUTM2ALMdqkYyh0Iycw" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.theseattledataguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_BxMGUTM2ALMdqkYyh0Iycw.png?fit=179%2C179&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.theseattledataguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_BxMGUTM2ALMdqkYyh0Iycw.png?fit=179%2C179&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.theseattledataguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_BxMGUTM2ALMdqkYyh0Iycw.png?resize=281%2C179&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="281" height="179" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Amazon’s CloudTrail service enables enterprises to carry out operational auditing, risk auditing, compliance, and governance for their AWS account.<br>
With this service, you can monitor and retain account activity across your entire AWS infrastructure. The overall service simplifies troubleshooting, security analysis, and resource tracking.</p>
<p>With the multiregion configuration feature, you can deliver log files into multiple regions with a single Amazon S3 bucket, which applies configuration across all regions consistently.</p>
<p>Once enabled, the CloudTrail service is always on as it records account activity upon creation. You can view/download files of the last 90 days and modify operations without having to manually set up the Amazon CloudTrail service.</p>
<p>Supporting platforms: CloudTrail supports logging events for almost all AWS services, including Alexa, Amazon API Gateway, App Mesh, Amazon Athena, AppStream 2.0, and Cloud9.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: The CloudTrail service is free of charge for 90 days — you can view, download, and filter the account activity in this time. Afterward, you can get management events at $2/100,000 events, record data events for $0.10/100,000 events, and get insights for $0.35/100,000 events’ analysis.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>AWS offers many more services as well, but the primary objective of this article was to highlight some well-known as well as lesser-known services that Amazon offers to cloud users.</p>
<p>Currently, if there is some redundant task developers need to constantly do over and over again that’s a hassle, AWS probably has a service for it.</p>

<p><em>The following is an excerpt from "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/60E52DB6-B5F7-48D8-8FC5-73A5CE8F8AF4">Big White Ghetto: Dead Broke, Stone-Cold Stupid, and High on Rage in the Dank Woolly Wilds of the "Real America"</a>" by Kevin D. Williamson.</em></p>
<p>"Dogfood—yeah, <em>d</em><em>o</em><em>g</em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>d</em>—because it looks like ground-up dog food.” He’s embarrassed to be talking about this. “Or sand, because it’s brown. Or diesel. Or killa or 9-1-1. That’s the influence of rap culture down here.” He is a young, clean-cut, Eagle Scout–ish white kid, hesitant about using the words “rap culture,” like he’s not sure if he’s allowed to say that. But he goes on, matter-of-factly. He’s been off heroin for only a few months, so the details are fresh in his mind, even if he remains a little hazy on parts of his autobiographical timeline. “The 9-1-1, they call it that because they want you to know it’s potent, that you’ll have to go to the emergency room.”</p>
<p>That’s a weird and perverse and nasty kind of advertising, but then dope-buying psychology isn’t very much like Volvo-buying psychology: Crashing is just another part of the ride. One spiteful dealer boasts about spiking his product with excessive amounts of fentanyl—a pharmaceutical analgesic used for burn victims and cancer patients—his plan being to intentionally send overdosed users to the hospital or the morgue . . . for <em>m</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>k</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em> <em>p</em><em>u</em><em>r</em><em>p</em><em>os</em><em>e</em><em>s</em>. Once the word got out about the hideous strength of his product, that killa went right out the door ricky-tick.</p>
<p>The young man explaining the current vocabulary of opiate addiction in Birmingham is barely old enough to buy a beer, and his face and voice are soft. He describes the past several years of his life: “dope-sick and stealing,” going from job to job—eight jobs in six months—robbing his employers of everything not physically nailed to the floor, alienating his family, descending. He was an addict on a mission: “You’re always chasing that first shot of dope, that first high—and the first one for me almost killed me. I was seventeen or eighteen years old, and I met a guy who had just got out of prison, doing a thirteen-year sentence for heroin possession and distribution. He was staying at the Oak Mountain Lodge, which is a nice little classic place.” (In 2013, four police officers and a drug dog had to be treated for exposure to dangerous chemicals after raiding a suspected meth lab in that hotel; the customer reviews online are decidedly mixed.) “I was <em>snorting </em>heroin when I met up with him, and set him up with my connect. He offered to shoot me up, and I wanted to do it. And I remember him looking me in the eyes and telling me, ‘If you do this, you’ll never stop, and you’ll never go back.’ And I said, ‘Let’s do it.’”</p>
<p>He doesn’t know what happened for the next several hours. When he regained consciousness, his junkie buddy’s girlfriend was worriedly ministering to him.</p>
<p>“That was first thing in the morning,” he says. “That night, I did another one.”</p>
<p>Same results. “I’d nodded out from snorting it, but there’s nothing like shooting it.”</p>
<p>He was, he says, a “pretty good junkie” for a time.</p>
<p>This particular opiate odyssey starts off in a Walgreens, something that turns out to be absolutely appropriate. I’m headed up the south coast and then inland on the heroin highway up to Atlanta, starting from the Port of Houston, which connects that city with 1,053 ports in nearly 200 countries and which in December alone welcomed the equivalent of 63,658 20-foot cargo containers of goods into the United States. There was, the feds are pretty sure, some dope squirreled away in there. In fact, all sorts of interesting stuff comes in and out of Houston. In May, U.S. Customs seized a Fast Attack Vehicle with gun mounts headed to the Netherlands. It hadn’t been ordered by the Dutch military. (Organized crime in the Netherlands is bananas: A raid in the summer of 2020 found Dutch police opening up a shipping container expecting to find it loaded with narcotics or stolen goods, but what they found instead was a dentist’s chair bolted to the floor and handcuffs hanging overhead—it was set up as a mobile torture chamber, God knows why.) I’m at Walgreens because I’ve got a long drive ahead and I’m going to be out of pocket for a bit, and I have a prescription to fill: an honest-to-goodness Schedule II Controlled Substance, in the official nomenclature, a term that covers some pretty interesting stuff, including the oxycodone and fentanyl I’ll be hearing so much about in the next few days. Some of us are going to heaven, some of us are going to hell, but all of us have to stop at Walgreens first.</p>
<p>The clerk is on the phone with a doctor’s office: “What’s your DEA number?”</p>
<p>For working-class white guys who haven’t found their way into the good jobs in the energy economy or the related manufacturing and construction booms that have reverberated throughout the oil patch, who aren’t college-bound or in possession of the skills to pay the bills, things aren’t looking so great: While much of the rest of the world gets healthier and longer-lived, the average life expectancy for white American men without college educations is declining. Angus Deaton, the Princeton economist who won the Nobel Prize in 2015, ran the numbers and found (in a study co-authored by his Princeton colleague Anne Case) that what’s killing what used to be the white working class isn’t diabetes or heart disease or the consumption of fatty foods and Big Gulps that so terrifies Michael Bloomberg, but alcohol-induced liver failure, along with overdoses of opioid prescription painkillers and heroin: Wild Turkey and hillbilly heroin, and regular old heroin, too, the use of which has increased dramatically in recent years as medical and law-enforcement authorities crack down on the wanton overprescription of oxy and related painkillers.</p>
<p>Which is to say: While we were <em>ignoring </em>criminally negligent painkiller prescriptions, we helped create a gigantic population of opioid addicts, and then, when we started paying attention, the first thing we did was take away the legal (and quasi-legal) stuff produced to exacting clinical standards by Purdue Pharma (maker of OxyContin) and others. So: lots of opiate addicts, fewer prescription opiates.</p>
<p>What was left was diesel, sand—<em>d</em><em>o</em><em>g</em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>d</em>.</p>
<p>The clerks at this Walgreens are super friendly, but the place is set up security-wise like a bank, and that’s to be expected. This particular location was knocked over by a young white man with a gun the summer before last, an addict who had been seen earlier lurking around the CVS down the road. This is how you know you’re a pretty good junkie: The robber walked in and pointed his automatic at the clerk and demanded oxy first, then a bottle of Tusinex cough syrup, and then, almost as an afterthought, the $90 in the till. Walgreens gets robbed a lot: In January, armed men stormed the Walgreens in Edina, Minnesota, and stole $8,000 worth of drugs, mainly oxy. In October, a sneaky young white kid in an Iowa State sweatshirt made off with more than $100,000 worth of drugs—again, mainly oxy and related opioid painkillers, from a Walgreens in St. Petersburg, Florida. Other Walgreens locations—in Liberty, Kansas; East Bradford, Pennsylvania; Elk Grove, California; Kaysville, Utah; Virginia Beach; New Orleans—all have been hit by armed robbers or sneak thieves over the past year or so, and there have been many more oxy thefts.</p>
<p>It won’t make the terrified clerks feel any better, but there’s poetic justice in that: In 2013, Walgreens paid the second-largest fine ever imposed under the Controlled Substances Act for being so loosey-goosey in handling oxy at its distribution center in Jupiter, Florida, that it enabled untold quantities of the stuff to reach the black market. The typical pharmacy sells 73,000 oxycodone pills a year; six Walgreens in Florida were going through more than 1 million pills a year—each. A few years before that, Purdue was fined $634.5 million for misleading the public about the addictiveness of oxycodone. Kentucky, which has been absolutely ravaged by opiate addiction, is still pursuing litigation against Purdue, and it has threatened to take its case all the way to the Supreme Court, if it comes to that.</p>
<p>Ground Zero in the opiate epidemic isn’t some exotic Taliban-managed poppy field or some cartel boss’s fortified compound: It’s right there at Walgreens, in the middle of every city and town in the country.</p>
<p>I pick up my prescription and get on my way.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, having driven past billboards advertising boudin and strip joints with early-bird lunch specials and casino after casino after sad little casino; help-wanted signs for drilling-fluid businesses and the Tiger Truck Stop (which has a twenty-four-hour Cajun café and an actual no-kidding <em>live tiger </em>in a cage out front); past Whiskey Bay and Contraband Bayou, where the pirate Jean Lafitte once stashed his booty; around the Port of New Orleans, another <em>entrepôt </em>for heroin and cocaine—it is almost as close to Cartagena as it is to New York—I arrive at a reasonably infamous New Orleans drug corner, where I inquire as discreetly as I can about the availability of prescription …</p></div></div>

            <div>
              
              <article><p>I’ve been playing with the builder patter to express test scenarios in a succinct and declarative manner. I’ve liked the outcome and feel that this design can yield to pretty good test code, so I’ll dig through this idea here. Note that, while this post and the associated code talk about Rust, <strong>the ideas presented here apply to any language</strong>. So don’t leave just because I said Rust!</p>
<hr>
<p>While Rust provides excellent facilities to execute unit and integration tests via <code>cargo test</code>, the APIs to write such tests are… extremely limited. In essence, we can tag tests functions with <code>#[test]</code> and we can then use the <code>assert*</code> family of macros plus <code>unwrap()/expect()</code> calls to validate values. But that’s about it. No fixtures. No <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit-like advanced features</a>. No <a href="https://truth.dev/">Truth-like expressive assertions</a>. No nothing.</p>
<p>These limitations, and in particular the lack of fixtures, can lead to convoluted test code. The fact is that some tests, even if they are true unit tests, require quite a bit of boilerplate: prepare fake objects with golden values, inject those into the code under test, and validate results. If we want to adhere to the principle of making each individual test case (aka each <code>#[test]</code> function) focus on a single behavior, we find ourselves with a lot of code duplication. Code duplication blurs the essence behind each test, which then makes tests harder to maintain—and hard to maintain tests is something you <em>really</em> do not want in a codebase.</p>
<p>To mitigate these limitations and keep the content of test functions focused on behavior, I’ve found myself writing helpers of the form <code>do_ok_test_for_blah()</code>. These helpers wrap the <code>blah()</code> under test and abstract away all of the uninteresting setup/teardown noise, customizing these based on input parameters.</p>
<p>The problem is that functions like <code>do_ok_test_for_blah()</code> quickly become complex. As you add more test cases, the amount of parameters to pass to these functions grows too, and the tests that used to be succinct aren’t any more. To compensate, you might add extra functions like <code>do_ok_test_for_blah_with_bleh()</code> that provide even further wrapping… but then you end up with a real mess that goes counter the original goal of simplifying the test code. Mind you, a lot of the older tests in EndBASIC suffer from this problem and it’s a pain to touch them, so I had to find a solution.</p>
<p>Of course, there are crates out there to provide extra testing facilities for Rust. But how far can we get with the simple Rust primitives? Pretty far actually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if we used the builder pattern to define the test scenario with required and optional properties, set expectations in a declarative manner, and then hid the test logic within it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to define a <em>type</em> (or <code>struct</code>, or <code>class</code>, or whatever your language of choice offers to encapsulate data) that holds all details needed to set up a test and also carries the expectations of the test. The type requires the minimum amount of parameters to run a “null” test scenario, and allows passing all other parameters in an optional manner. Lastly, a single <code>run()</code>-like function takes care of preparing the test scenario and running through it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s illustrate all these words with a trivial example.</p>
<p>Consider a simple and non-generic <code>sum_all</code> function that takes an array of <code>i32</code> values and sums them all:</p>
<div>
  
  
  <div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[cfg(test)]</span><span> </span><span>mod</span> <span>tests</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>/// Sums all input `values` and returns the total.
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>sum_all</span><span>(</span><span>values</span>: <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>i32</span><span>])</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> <span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>result</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>values</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span>result</span><span> </span><span>+=</span><span> </span><span>v</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>result</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
  
  </div>

<p>Yes, this is a simplistic function that can be trivially tested: using the builder pattern here is overkill, but hopefully you get the idea of how this helps verify more complex interfaces.</p>
<p>To test this function, we define a <code>SumAllTest</code> type to represent the builder pattern, with these properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given that <code>sum_all()</code> always returns a value, the test must always know what value to expect; therefore, we express this requirement as part of the type’s constructor.</li>
<li>The data to pass to the function is variable, though, so we make it optional via an <code>add_value()</code> method. I’ve chosen to use an accumulator method here to further illustrate how a builder might be helpful.</li>
<li>We define a <code>run()</code> method that <em>consumes the builder</em> and executes the test.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our test code looks like this:</p>
<div>
  
  
  <div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#![deny(warnings)]</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>crate</span>::<span>*</span><span>;</span><span>

  </div>

<p>The beauty of this design is that each test case is now declarative. The test case expresses, <em>in code</em>, what the test scenario looks like and what the expectations are. And given the simplicity of the calls, we can trivially express each scenario in its own test case. When we run the tests, we get what we expect:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">running 3 tests
test tests::test_sum_all_many_values ... ok
test tests::test_sum_all_no_values ... ok
test tests::test_sum_all_one_value ... ok

test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div><p>Great!</p>
<p>But before we go, there is <em>one key detail</em> I glanced over. This detail is critical to ensure that your tests always do the right thing:</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: The test builder has to be annotated with <code>#[must_use]</code>.</strong> You may want also want to accompany that with the optional <code>#[deny(warnings)]</code>.</p>
<p>You see: given the above design, it’s all too easy to forget to call <code>run()</code> on the test builder—and if you forget to do that, the test will do nothing and will always pass. That’s too risky for test code. Fortunately, by using the <code>#[must_use]</code> annotation on the builder type, the compiler will catch such problems.</p>
<p>To witness: if we remove the <code>run()</code> call from any of the tests above and try to build:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">error: unused `SumAllTest` that must be used
  --&gt; src/tests.rs:33:5
   |
33 |     SumAllTest::expect(0);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |
</code></pre></div><p>Rust fails the build and tells us that we forgot to consume the builder object. There is no way we can forget to call <code>run()</code> once we have initialized a <code>SumAllTest</code> object, so the test code will always be exercised.</p>

    <div>
      <p>PHP8 was <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php">released</a> on the
26<sup>th</sup> of November 2020. It brought a lot of interesting things,
security-wise, but also showcases a couple of (minor) missed opportunities in my
opinion.</p>
<h2 id="type-safety"><a href="#type-safety">Type safety</a></h2>
<p>I'm a big fan on relying on typing to ensure security properties,
like <a href="https://web.dev/trusted-types/">Trusted types</a> in javascript: it
shouldn't compile if it's not secure.</p>
<p>PHP8 won't try to cast string into numbers anymore, thanks to the 
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/string_to_number_comparison">Saner string to number comparisons RFC</a>,
meaning that collision with hashes starting with <code>0e</code> and the likes are finally
a thing of the past! This is a subset of Snuffleupagus' <a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#preventing-sloppy-comparisons">sloppy comparison
prevention</a> feature.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/consistent_type_errors">Consistent type errors for internal functions RFC</a>
will prevent things like <code>0 == strcmp($_GET['username'], $password)</code> bypasses,
since <code>strcmp</code> won't return <code>null</code> and spit a warning any longer,
but will throw a proper exception instead. This was also a <a href="https://externals.io/message/106522">nice opportunity</a>
for PHP to add annotations for functions parameters and return types.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/arithmetic_operator_type_checks">Stricter type checks for arithmetic/bitwise operators</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings">PHP RFC: Reclassifying engine warnings</a> RFC
are in the same spirit.</p>
<h2 id="jit"><a href="#jit">JIT</a></h2>
<p>PHP8 comes with a <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit">JIT</a> based on
<a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM</a>, bringing an RWX memory space into
PHP's memory space, into a shared allocation, meaning that its offset won't
change between different PHP8+ processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, DynASM isn't designed with processing/compilation/execution of
untrusted code in mind, and doesn't do things like constants blinding and
advanced folding to mitigate against spraying, nor random padding/nop
insertion, nor ensuring that the memory region is never both writeable <em>and</em>
executable to prevent direct code injection. This means that it's now way
easier to gain native code execution when exploiting memory corruptions,
albeit to be fair, most attackers are happy with a php code execution,
and won't push further.</p>
<p>Having a JIT comes with a lot of code complexity and maintenance burden. I'll
be without doubt a <a href="https://bugs.php.net/search.php?cmd=display&amp;order_by=ts1&amp;direction=DESC&amp;limit=30&amp;package_name[]=JIT">great source of
bugs</a>,
for a minor speed improvement on real-life workloads.</p>
<h2 id="cryptography"><a href="#cryptography">Cryptography</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>password_hash</code> now automatically generates a salt, accepting a
    user-provided one is deprecated.</li>
<li><code>crypt</code> will now fail instead of silently falling back to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C)#Traditional_DES-based_scheme">DES</a>
    when an unknown salt format was provided. The parameter is also made
    mandatory, hashing without a salt is now unsupported.</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652">RFC 5652</a> is now exposed via the OpenSSL extension.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="misc"><a href="#misc">Misc</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php">error control operator</a>, aka <code>@</code>
    won't silence fatal errors anymore, meaning that poorly written webshells will have more chances
    to leave traces in your logs.</li>
<li><code>libxml_disable_entity_loader</code> is now deprecated, even if it's not (yet) reflected in php's documentation.
    This is acceptable since PHP8 now requires at least libxml 2.9.0,
    which comes with external entity loading disabled by default.</li>
<li>Access to undefined constants will throw an error, instead of being silently
  interpreted as a string, no more <code>SALT</code> being silently converted to <code>"SALT"</code>.</li>
<li><code>create_function</code> was <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/ee16d99504f0014c3d292809da927fb622293f41">removed</a>, closing its infamous code injection vector.</li>
<li><code>array_key_exists</code> throws when passed an array/object, instead of silently
  doing nonsense.</li>
<li>The <code>e</code> modifier in <code>mb_ereg_replace</code> has been removed.</li>
<li>Metadata associated with a phar will
  <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phar_stop_autoloading_metadata">no longer be unserialized</a>,
    killing a low-hanging
    <a href="https://github.com/s-n-t/presentations/blob/master/us-18-Thomas-It's-A-PHP-Unserialization-Vulnerability-Jim-But-Not-As-We-Know-It.pdf">RCE vector</a>.</li>
<li><code>FILTER_SANITIZE_MAGIC_QUOTES</code>, <code>get_magic_quotes_gpc</code> and <code>get_magic_quotes_runtime</code> have been removed,
  people will now have to do proper sanitization instead.</li>
<li>As usual, a couple of memory safety issues were fixed,
    <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=80242">some</a>
    <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=76618">exploitable</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="missed-opportunities"><a href="#missed-opportunities">Missed opportunities</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings#undefined_variable">Undefined
variables</a>, as
opposed to cinstants, are still not an error, meaning that things like <code>solt</code>
instead of <code>salt</code> might (and will) go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Converting an <code>Array</code> to a string will only yield a <code>Warning</code> instead of an
error, albeit that now that <code>__toString</code> <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tostring_exceptions">can <em>finally</em>
throw</a>, it might hopefully change
in the near future.</p>
<p>Albeit significant <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/easy_userland_csprng">CSPRNG</a>
<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/random-function-exceptions">improvements</a> have been
merged in PHP7, PHP8 didn't seize the opportunity to keep the momentum and to
aliases <code>rand</code> and <code>mt_rand</code> to <code>random_int</code>, like
<a href="https://snuffleupagus.readthedocs.io/features.html#weak-prng-via-rand-mt-rand">Snuffleupagus</a> is doing.</p>
<p>An other missed opportunity in my opinion is that there is <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50715">still no
way</a> to disable some <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php">PHP's wrappers</a>, except via
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-unregister.php"><code>stream_wrapper_unregister</code></a>
but this can be reversed with
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-wrapper-restore.php"><code>stream_wrapper_restore</code></a>.
Wrappers are scary: the main use I've seen for the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php#wrappers.php.filter"><code>filter://</code>
one</a> is
exfiltrating data via <code>php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/some/file</code>, and is a <a href="https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/php-stream-wrappers/">decent
amount of</a>
<a href="https://lightless.me/archives/include-file-from-zip-or-phar.html">arcane</a>
<a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&amp;id=671">stuff</a> lurking in the shadows.
Providing a way to reduce this attack surface (like making streams opt-in)
would be welcome.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>I finally figured it out. I’m not an academic, I build apps. So, I wondered how I could apply Zettelkasten to my work.</p>
<p>I’m not just coding, I’m also receiving constructive user feedback. This is usually about bug reports and feature suggestions. However, sometimes I get flooded by emails and messages. There are more good features than time to build and every feature needs some serious thinking and planning. So, my role I cover here is a mix of developer and product manager.</p>
<p>I was using Jira, a project management software to collect, manage and plan feature ideas and bug reports. But it quickly grew to over 1000 items. It’s mostly useless now.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://blog.noteplan.co/static/b88a1129c49f39649645d4c849897402/774b6/jira-screenshot.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Then I started my Zettelkasten and I’m not opening Jira any more.</p>
<h2>What is Zettelkasten?</h2>
<p>German for ‘slip-box’. It’s a simple, but powerful note-taking system allowing you to build a second brain. The Zettelkasten was invented by Niklas Luhmann, a highly productive German sociologist. He published more than 70 books and 400 scholarly articles and attributed his productivity to his notes. His slip-box contained more than 90,000 notes.</p>
<p>Intentionally, the Zettelkasten fits and complements our imperfect and biased brains and I think that’s how it ‘just works’. Many good productivity principles are baked in.</p>
<h2>Here is how I translate it to my work</h2>
<p>In Luhmann’s work, Zettelkasten was used in an academic environment. Here is how I translate the academic Zettelkasten to a ‘Product Development’ Zettelkasten. On the left is Luhmann’s version and on the right mine:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Reading books and academic articles = Feedback emails</li>
<li><strong>Capture:</strong> Literature notes on books = Feedback notes</li>
<li><strong>File notes and link:</strong> Permanent Zettelkasten notes are the same for me, short, atomic ideas for features, clarifications, question, interconnected where it makes sense.</li>
<li><strong>Interim Output:</strong> Manuscript for an article or book = Feature specification document</li>
<li><strong>Final Output:</strong> Final Draft for an article or book = Written code implementing a feature</li>
</ol>
<h2>The process is largely the same</h2>
<p>Every morning, when I read my emails, I take quick notes about the content and copy/paste the link to the original email (Gmail link in my case). My notes are very short and written in my words. Sometimes the title of the note is all I need, other times I elaborate a good idea or clue I found in the email. These notes are only temporary. I store them into an inbox folder at first (as recommended by GTD), waiting to be processed later.</p>
<p><strong>It’s critical to write all notes in your words</strong> and as short as possible, don’t copy and paste the content. It’s unlikely you read the full email again and often a waste of time. But just in case, you got the link.</p>
<p>Then, on the next morning, I process all accumulated inbox notes at once. By splitting the capturing from the processing process, your brain doesn’t have to switch contexts and you can work with less effort.</p>
<p>In that process I take the inbox note, quickly evaluate if it adds anything valuable to my system and either delete it or elaborate, then file it. If I decide there is something useful in it, I create a permanent slip-box note which contains a single, atomic idea. Again it’s written in my words. I look into my network of existing notes (sometimes using the search function) to find other notes which have the same context and link them together to a chain of thoughts with branches (not unlike GitHub).</p>
<p>During that process your brain often starts to have more ideas, so I create more permanent notes as good ideas come to me.</p>
<h2>How is this useful?</h2>
<p>After some time, you build a dense network of ideas. Clusters emerge. In my case, around feature ideas. If a particular feature has many connected notes, my understanding on that feature is probably very mature. I can browse through the notes (since they have clickable links) and create a draft for a specification document.</p>
<p>Without the Zettelkasten you would have to brainstorm and rely on your fragile memory to write that spec or worse, dig up the emails and read them <em>again</em>, out of context. So, naturally you spend much more time and miss important details.</p>
<p>And finally, you write well thought through code out of that specification document. The details are based on actual user feedback have matured over time.</p>
<h2>Where I’m now</h2>
<p>Today, I have 909 notes and I have used this system for a few months. I created several slip-box folders: features, bugs, general and business. Notes can be still interconnected between the folders, it’s just easier to find related end-points this way. In general you shouldn’t restrict yourself to specific topics though.</p>

December 4, 2020 | https://brianschrader.com/archive/why-i-dont-retweet-anything/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://brianschrader.com/archive/why-i-dont-retweet-anything/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>I still read Twitter (despite my <a href="https://brianschrader.com/_drafts/retweeting/">efforts to quit entirely</a>), but I've stopped retweeting. My last retweet was on July 17th and it was of a tweet I wrote for <a href="https://adventurerscodex.com/">a company I co-own</a>. And if things continue as planned, that will be the last retweet I ever do.</p>
<h3>Why No Retweets?</h3>
<p>Retweets are Twitter's original sin. Akin to Facebook's Share, or Tumblr's Re-blog, the Retweet is what allows content on Twitter to spread virally. It allows for users to effortlessly spread false or misleading information with impunity and encourages readers to never go past the title of an article (despite <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/10/twitter-retweet-change-election.html">Twitter's admittedly laudable attempts</a> to address this issue). Retweets allow users to easily dunk on each other and act as super-spreaders of identity-reenforcing and tribalistic memes that only serve to make Twitter a worse platform.</p>
<p>Quote retweets are a little better (at least they require the user to express some opinion about the content they're spreading), but they still allow for the easy dunking that's a mainstay of the platform.</p>
<p>To their credit, Twitter has long known that the retweet button causes problems on their platform. The original designer of the feature has even said as much.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/how-the-retweet-ruined-the-internet">Chris Wetherell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We might have just handed a 4-year-old a loaded weapon,” Wetherell recalled thinking as he watched the first Twitter mob use the tool he created. “That’s what I think we actually did.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both Pine.blog and Micro.blog don't have retweets, and Manton does a great job explaining why (I used the same reasoning for Pine.blog).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><a href="https://www.manton.org/2016/11/22/fake-news-and.html">Manton Reece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have to put a little work into posting, you take it more seriously. I wonder if fake news would have spread so quickly on Facebook if it was a little more difficult to share an article before you’ve read more than the headline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting in the extra effort to actually articulate an intelligible thought helps me better understand the content myself and it helps me gauge whether or not the given post is even worth sharing. On more than one occasion, I've stopped myself from sharing something because I realized that it just wasn't all that interesting.</p>
<h3>How I (Still) Use Twitter</h3>
<p>While I still read Twitter, the vast majority of my posts are cross-posted from <a href="https://pine.blog/u/sonicrocketman">my microblog</a>. I still favorite posts (because my favorites are automatically saved to Pinboard so I can find them later), but for the most part, my interactions are read-only.</p>
<p>Because I spend most of my "social media time" either reading articles on <a href="https://pine.blog/">Pine.blog</a> or browsing <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, reading Twitter now feels like wading through a nuance-lacking, toxic cesspit rather than acccessing the real-time information platform I once knew and loved, which in turn drives me further away from the platform. I see people I follow there cooking amazing meals, telling fanciful stories, sharing hilarious memes, but all of that is drowned out by the hate and vitriol in every next post.</p>
<p>With all that said though, I do still share stuff on the Web. I just do it by writing a post.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="A sample pseudo-retweet" src="https://brianschrader.com/images/blog/pseudo-retweet.png"></p><center><small>I'd love a browser plugin that removes the Retweet button and hides all retweets. It seems like a few exist, but none that I tried worked. Presumably Twitter tries to circumvent them.</small></center>
</div>

<p>Virality is a fact of life on the Web; neither innately good nor bad. For too long we've seen it as something to be harnessed, to utilize. But a virus is incredibly difficult to control and, like with today's real-world troubles, a pandemic of memes and satire does enormous harm to our individual health and to the health of our society.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>tl;dr Pandemics are bad. Both online and in meatspace. We should limit their spread and stop retweeting.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Pine.blog will show you when someone retweets or re-posts your blog posts if you allow for Webmentions, though I'm considering letting users configure this behavior. Retweets also poison the mind of the poster, not just the reader.
</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> In an effort to be transparent, I have asked others to retweet my posts before an an attempt to gain some traction outside my bubble. I'm going to stop doing that too.

<ul>
<li>Measure performance! If you don’t measure it’s the same as doing nothing.</li>
<li>You can optimize your React performance by improving <strong>what</strong> (🤔) and <strong>which</strong> (🧙) components render.</li>
<li>
<p>🧙 To improve <strong>which</strong> component renders you can use</p>
<ul>
<li><code>React.memo</code></li>
<li><code>useCallback</code></li>
<li><code>useMemo</code></li>
<li>Make sure your props have stable references</li>
<li>Virtualization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>🤔 To improve <strong>what</strong> components render you should</p>
<ul>
<li>identify the slow components</li>
<li>simplify, use more efficient abstractions, make smaller trees, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If this got your attention read on:</p>

<p>In general computer programs can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>io-bound</strong>: spend most of their time making inputs and outputs</li>
<li><strong>cpu-bound</strong>: spend most of their time making calculations</li>
</ul>
<p>And how do these translate into Front End apps and in particular React apps?</p>
<h2 id="io-performance-problems-in-react"><a href="#io-performance-problems-in-react" aria-label="io performance problems in react permalink"></a>io performance problems in React</h2>
<ul>
<li>Browser apps can be <strong>io-bounded</strong> mostly in terms of asynchronous http calls.</li>
<li>a poor management of these network requests can slow down your app</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="potential-solutions"><a href="#potential-solutions" aria-label="potential solutions permalink"></a>Potential solutions</h3>
<p>Although this will not be the focus of this post let’s quickly cover some
important areas where solutions and improvements might be found for io-bound
problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>lazy load as much as you can.</li>
<li>careful with the initial load of assets and also backend requests.</li>
<li>reduce the amount of times you load highly static stuff (select options, configurations, etc)</li>
<li>debounce the amount of times you make certain requests.</li>
<li>parallelize request as much as possible via <code>Promise.all</code>.</li>
<li>make your critical BE endpoints more efficient (i.e. by tweaking DB accesses and such).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cpu-performance-problems-in-react"><a href="#cpu-performance-problems-in-react" aria-label="cpu performance problems in react permalink"></a>CPU performance problems in React</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This is going to be the main focus of this post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before talking about performance we need to define it in a more concrete way:</p>
<ul>
<li>browser apps are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30932870/why-doesnt-javascript-get-its-own-thread-in-common-browsers">single thread</a> programs for the most part.</li>
<li>scripting, i.e. Javascript, DOM rendering, event handling, etc; all run in the same thread.</li>
<li>if a Javascript module is slow it can block the main thread.</li>
<li>if the main thread is blocked then the UI will seem unresponsive (<strong>fps</strong> will drop).</li>
<li>unresponsive UIs are one of the worst offenders in terms of <strong>User Experience</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This all boils down to the concept of <code>fps</code> or <strong>Frames Per Second</strong>.
Responsive UIs will deliver a minimum of 30 fps or more ideally 60 fps, this means
that every frame of your app, even the more demanding code paths, should compute in <strong>30 ms or less</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your Javascript is slow it might cause “frames to be dropped” which means
computing a frame in more than 30 ms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To fully understand how this applies to React we need to understand how React works
and what React’s <strong>render and commit phase</strong> are but in short we can say that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a React component update is triggered then the <strong>entire sub tree needs to be
rendered in less than 30ms</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This becomes specially problematic when you have complex and long component structures
such as Tables, Trees and Lists and in which sometimes (for example the first time) you will
need to re render large parts of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> we should figure out which expensive interactions are dropping frames,
measure them to confirm and fix them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="react-render-and-commit-phase"><a href="#react-render-and-commit-phase" aria-label="react render and commit phase permalink"></a>React render and commit phase</h2>
<p>React works (at a high level) in two phases</p>
<p><strong>Render phase:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Happens when a component updates i.e. props or hooks changed.</li>
<li>React traverses the component sub tree rendering each child and computing the virtual DOM (VDOM) sub tree.</li>
<li>Only the “dirty” sub tree needs to be recomputed i.e. the updated component parents might not need to be re rendered.</li>
<li>This phase is proportional to the size of the sub tree being rendered.</li>
<li>This phase is also proportional to how expensive it is to compute each child component.</li>
<li>We can give React hints to make this process more efficient i.e. <code>React.memo</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commit phase:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The render phase outputs a new virtual DOM of the entire UI.</li>
<li>In the commit phase Reacts compares the new tree with the previous one (VDOM diffing).</li>
<li>React calculates the minimum DOM mutations needed to reflect the new VDOM tree.</li>
<li>React mutates the DOM.</li>
<li>Your UI is now updated.</li>
<li>This phase is pretty efficient by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole process needs to happen in less than 30 or 16 ms (30 fps and 60 fps respectively) for your UI to be considered
responsive, as you can see there’s a lot of work and that work is proportional to the size of your app.</p>
<p>We will explore ways to make mostly the <strong>Render phase</strong> more efficient but first let’s discuss
how to measure and how to find out what are the slow parts of our app and how bad they are.</p>
<h2 id="measuring"><a href="#measuring" aria-label="measuring permalink"></a>Measuring</h2>
<p>In 2020 we have pretty solid tools for measuring browser side performance, these
are the ones I use the most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome dev tool’s Performance tab.</li>
<li>React dev tool’s Performance tab.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chrome-dev-tools-performance-tab"><a href="#chrome-dev-tools-performance-tab" aria-label="chrome dev tools performance tab permalink"></a>Chrome dev tool’s Performance tab</h3>
<p>This is the most comprehensive tool, it is useful for any browser application,
it measures frames per second, records stack traces, identifies slow / hot parts of your code,
and much more. The main UI is the <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flame chart</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-chrome-performance-tab">good doc</a>
of Chrome’s Performance Tab applied to React.</p>
<h3 id="react-dev-tools-performance-tab"><a href="#react-dev-tools-performance-tab" aria-label="react dev tools performance tab permalink"></a>React dev tool’s Performance tab</h3>
<p>You need to install the <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html">React dev tool extension</a> in your browser.</p>
<p>It specializes the information in the Chrome dev tool’s Performance tab to
React. You can see the different <strong>commit phases</strong> and the Javascript code that was run in its respective
<strong>render phase</strong> through a <strong>flame chart</strong>.</p>
<p>Through this tool you can easily find out:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a component re renders</li>
<li>what props changed</li>
<li>what hooks changed i.e. state, context, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html">introductory post</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-1"><a href="#measuring-1" aria-label="measuring 1 permalink"></a>Measuring</h3>
<p>This is the <strong>methodology</strong> I like to use when measuring front end applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>identify the problem</strong>: identify page interactions that make the UI feel unresponsive.</li>
<li><strong>create a hypothesis</strong>: optionally, we might have some ideas where the problem might be.</li>
<li><strong>measure</strong>: verify the problem by measuring and looking at important metrics such as <strong>fps</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>measure</strong>: identify problematic pieces of code, optionally: validate your hypothesis.</li>
<li><strong>create a solution</strong>: apply a solution based off the previous steps</li>
<li><strong>measure the solution</strong>: validate that the problem has been resolved or alleviated by looking at the important metrics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you optimize something without measuring then you are practically doing nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There might be cases where the problem is super obvious and I won’t tell you that going straight
to fixing it is naturally bad, but most of the problems are not obvious and measuring will be
cornerstone of the performance improvement process.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you measure you can later tell your users, stakeholders and more importantly your <strong>boss
that you have improved the performance of a given area of your app by x%</strong> which is always a good
way of communicating upwards what we accomplish inside the rabbit hole.</p>
<h2 id="general-solutions-to-cpu-bound-problems-in-react-applications"><a href="#general-solutions-to-cpu-bound-problems-in-react-applications" aria-label="general solutions to cpu bound problems in react applications permalink"></a>General solutions to cpu-bound problems in React applications</h2>
<p>Now that we have measured and identified the problematic areas let’s cover
potential solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can optimize your React performance by
improving <strong>what</strong> components render and
<strong>which</strong> components render.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="-improving-what-components-render"><a href="#-improving-what-components-render" aria-label=" improving what components render permalink"></a>🤔 Improving <em>what</em> components render</h3>
<p>Identifying the slow parts of our React app will usually
point out to some particular components that are slow to render
(or that have too many instances in a single page, more on this in the <strong>which</strong> section).</p>
<p>There might be a number of reasons those components are slow, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>they do blocking calculations</li>
<li>they render large trees</li>
<li>they use expensive / non efficient libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these boil down to improving how fast your components render,
sometimes critical components cannot rely on too complicated libraries
and so you need to go back to basic and roll your own simpler implementation.</p>
<p>I have experienced something like this when using <a href="https://formik.org/">Formik</a> (which I love)
or should I say abusing Formik on several cells of every single row of a complex table.</p>
<p>You can go a long way making your components more efficient but eventually you will need
to focus on <strong>which</strong> components render:</p>
<h3 id="🧙-improving-which-components-render"><a href="#%F0%9F%A7%99-improving-which-components-render" aria-label="🧙 improving which components render permalink"></a>🧙 Improving <em>which</em> components render</h3>
<p>There are two broad categories where we can improve this aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtualization</li>
<li>Prop optimization</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="virtualization"><a href="#virtualization" aria-label="virtualization permalink"></a>Virtualization</h4>
<p>It means <strong>only render what is visible in the viewport</strong>, i.e. only render the
table rows that the user can see or the list items the user can see.</p>
<p>This is great because it can be applied to complex UIs without going through the <strong>what</strong> step,
although I recommend it; and modern libraries tend to have decent support for virtualizing
your tables and lists. A good example of this is <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized">react-virtualized</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Virtualizing means that we <strong>reduce the amount of components React needs to render in a given frame</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="props-optimization"><a href="#props-optimization" aria-label="props optimization permalink"></a>Props Optimization</h4>
<p>React tries to make your components look like pure functions but still will try to render
more times than it should.</p>
<h5 id="code-classlanguage-textreactmemocode"><a href="#code-classlanguage-textreactmemocode" aria-label="code classlanguage textreactmemocode permalink"></a><code>React.memo</code></h5>
<p>Most components in React can be <strong>memoized</strong>, which means that they do not have internal side effects
or depend on any external side effects so that we can guarantee than <strong>with the same props the component
will return the same tree</strong> (hooks, state and context are still respected though).</p>
<p>For that we can use <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo">React.memo</a>.
This tells React to skip re rendering these memoized components if their
props didn’t change.</p>
<h5 id="fake-prop-changes-code-classlanguage-textusecallbackcode"><a href="#fake-prop-changes-code-classlanguage-textusecallbackcode" aria-label="fake prop changes code classlanguage textusecallbackcode permalink"></a>Fake prop changes: <code>useCallback</code></h5>
<p>Additionally we have the problem of <strong>fake prop changes</strong> which means that although
the content of a given prop didn’t change, the reference did. The most classic example
of this is the event handler one:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>onChange</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span>input onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onChange<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>onChange</code> callback, although semantically and content wise will be the same on every render, will be
be stored in a completely separate memory direction so React will detect it as different from the previous one.</p>
<p>This is related to how <code>React.memo</code> does shallow comparison by default (although there’s no good way of
deeply comparing functions in Javascript AFAIK).</p>
<p>An easy fix for this is to use <code>useCallback</code> which was designed exactly for this:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> onChange <span>=</span> <span>useCallback</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span>input onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onChange<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h5 id="fake-prop-changes-code-classlanguage-textusememocode"><a href="#fake-prop-changes-code-classlanguage-textusememocode" aria-label="fake prop changes code classlanguage textusememocode permalink"></a>Fake prop changes: <code>useMemo</code></h5>
<p>A similar problem can rise when building complex data structures and not memoizing them
correctly before …</p></section></div>

<p>Although they might seem very similar, running and sprinting are two very different sports.</p>



<p>Running is a game of long distances. It requires steadiness and endurance. Sprinting, on the other hand, is a game of speed. It requires intensity and power.</p>



<p>Runners can’t race as fast as sprinters. And sprinters can’t last as long as runners. They are different games.</p>



<p>If audience building were a sport, it would be more like running than like sprinting.</p>



<p>You don’t build an audience in just one sprint — you need thousands of them. And if you try to sprint every day, you’ll end up burned out. It’s not sustainable.</p>



<p>You need to show up often and stay at it as long as possible. So instead of sprinting, you should try to run or even jog but at a pace you can keep up. That way it becomes sustainable.</p>



<p>When it comes to content, steadiness beats intensity. Put another way, sharing good content frequently beats sharing superb content infrequently.</p>



<p>Your content might be incredibly valuable, but if people only hear from you once in a blue moon they might not even remember who you are in the first place. They need to hear you often. They need to know you. They need to trust you.</p>



<p>Why should they give you their attention otherwise?</p>

		<p>Yesterday I faced a version control situation I rarely face.</p>

<p>It showed me that I may rely a little too much on the green light from CI tools like CircleCI and GitHub Actions when deciding whether it’s safe to merge a branch.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My colleague added new <code>expect</code> clauses to a test, plus the code to <strong>pass it</strong>.</li>
  <li>They merged this into the main branch via a PR.</li>
  <li>Later, I forked off of the main branch.</li>
  <li>I added <strong>more new clauses</strong> to the test my colleague had earlier modified.<br>I worked on it for the rest of the day.</li>
  <li>I made a <strong>pull request</strong>.</li>
  <li>Next, two colleagues reviewed my work and approved it on GitHub.<br>All the pre-merge checks on CircleCI were passing, including tests and style checks.<br>I rebased and decided to save the merge for the morning.</li>
  <li>Soon after, an error was found related to the code the first colleague had deployed.<br>They <strong>reverted</strong> the PR they had merged on Day 1.</li>
  <li>Not long after, I checked my PR again - there were no merge conflicts.<br><strong>I merged my code</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>An hour or so later, another colleague tells me that, according to CircleCI, a test I wrote was failing on the main branch. How could this be, they said? It appears to have been passing on the branch it came from!</p>

<p>What is the cause of this mysterious failure?</p>

<p>I’d recently touched that test, so I looked at the error and quickly worked out what it was: The test I’d added to was failing because one of it’s <code>expect</code> clauses relied on code which had been been reverted - it was no longer a valid expectation. GitHub didn’t run a new diff on my PR after the removal of the clause in question from the main branch; the reverted test code simply looks ‘unchanged’ in the diff, as if it had been and was still there.</p>

<p>I didn’t remove it, I didn’t rebase, and my PR ended up re-adding the recently-removed <code>expect</code> clause even though it didn’t appear to.</p>

<p>Is there a lesson to be learned here?</p>

<p>On one hand, the process is working. There was a merge error caused by the <code>git</code> equivalent of a race condition, we were told about it, and we were able to resolve it. Why bother running tests on the main branch before you deploy unless you are concerned that there is a chance they’ll fail?</p>

<p>Maybe the lesson is to keep on doing what we’re doing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the process felt like it was disrupting the order of things. Something like this is often said: “if you have a reliable QA and CI process, then if something is on the main branch it should be deployable.” And yet here was an anomalous case which suggested otherwise.</p>

<p>Perhaps, then, the lesson is that our QA and CI process isn’t robust enough. Should CI create a merged branch behind-the-scenes and run tests on <em>that</em> before allowing the branch to be merged?</p>

<p>I’m not sure. In the meantime, while I try to decide what the lesson is, I think I’ll just rebase my branches more often.</p>

<p>A Stanford dropout founder. "AI" technology. Recruits fresh out of MIT and Harvard. Skyrocketing valuations, huge paychecks, and a lightning-fast culture. All the makings of a legendary tech startup story. Was this Yahoo? Nope. Snapchat? Try again.</p>
<p>This was Trilogy Software in the 90s.</p>
<p>Although their glory has long since faded, their impact remains. Here's an incomplete list of Trilogy mafia members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elie Seidman, the CEO of Tinder</li>
<li>Cyrus Massoumi and Nick Ganju, the founders of ZocDoc. They had shared a desk together at Trilogy.</li>
<li>Henry Ward, CEO and founder of Carta</li>
<li>John Lilly, former CEO of Mozilla, investor with Greylock Partners, and founder of Reactivity (acquired by Cisco).</li>
<li>Andy Palmer, CEO of Tamr Inc., former CEO of Vertica (acquired), and major angel investor (invested in Carta in part due to his connection with Henry).</li>

<p>Crunchbase has a list of Trilogy mafia founded companies <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/trilogy-alumni-founded-companies#section-leaderboard">here</a>. There are 87 entries.</p>
<p>All in all, they are one of tech's most successful, albeit relatively unknown, "mafias". Their story is a fascinating dive into the dot-com boom tech scene, and holds lessons on recruitment and culture that founders will still find relevant today. How do tech mafias form?</p>
<h2><a name="what-was-trilogy"></a>What Was Trilogy?</h2>
<p>"Trilogy Development Group" was founded in 1989 by Joe Liemandt, a Stanford CS student who dropped out to start the company. He brought along 5 classmates to join him in Austin, Texas, where the cost of living was cheap and the taxes were lower.</p>
<p>From these humble beginnings, Trilogy became a 90s pioneer of enterprise software. Their main product was "config-price-quote" software, which allowed sales forces to accurately quote and configure complex solutions such as mainframes, central office switches, airplanes, and automobiles. In fact, their software could even identify and recommend the ideal combination of products and services for each customer. At the time, this was a game-changer for their clients.</p>
<p>They also built sales compensation software, which allowed sales leaders and HR teams to move sales commissions from spreadsheets to a software database and workflow engine. Their main clients were Fortune 500 companies, especially in the auto and airline sectors.</p>
<p>Although not the "coolest" product, Trilogy was wildly successful. By the mid 1990s they had grown to $250M in revenue, were valued at well over a billion dollars, and Joe Liemandt became the youngest self-made man to enter the Forbes 400. In 1996 he graced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2018/11/19/holy-cow-no-ones-done-this/#6700faa92927">the cover of the magazine</a>, with a net worth of $500 million.</p>
<p><img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bef0d784bbe6f78bda861c1/960x0.jpg?fit=scale" alt="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5bef0d784bbe6f78bda861c1/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"></p>
<p>During this late 90's golden age they became famous for lavish parties, furious recruiting at college campuses, and massive onboardings — at one point they onboarded 250 people at once, a 50% increase in their headcount. They even spun off a publicly traded subsidiary, an early B2B marketplace for computer parts called PCOrder.com. It was the best of times for Trilogy... until the dot-com crash. PCOrder.com's stock price fell to near 0, Trilogy's valuation fell as well, and the company never regained the same stature. By 2001, Liedmandt had fallen off the Forbes 400, and many employees left or were let go, though the company never fully shut down.</p>
<p>At the time, it was a heavy loss for the burgeoning Austin tech scene.</p>
<h2><a name="trilogy-university-birthplace-of-the-mafia"></a>Trilogy University: Birthplace of the Mafia</h2>
<p>During their golden age, Trilogy was a recruitment machine, more than tripling their headcount in under three years. Liemandt wanted top talent, but they were competing for an extremely limited pool of computer science graduates, and couldn't pay as much as the "safe", established tech players of the 90s. So, they developed a pitch that distinguished them from the competition:</p>
<p>"Rather than paying you lots of money and stock options to pound out code for eight hours a day, we'll give you a ton of responsibility right away. You can lead projects, build new products, and even start a company. Have at it! Oh yeah, and we'll spend an average of $10,000 per recruit flying you out to Austin where you can play roulette with the CEO before you decide."</p>
<p>This was key. Trilogy was selecting for big risk-takers with an entrepreneur's mindset at the top of their recruitment funnel.</p>
<p>Once these recruits (all fresh out of college) got to Austin, they were enrolled at Trilogy University. This corporate bootcamp, modeled after Marine Corps training, was possibly Trilogy's greatest innovation, and participants cite its influence as having a huge impact on their careers. It lasted 12 weeks, and during that time employees would be split into 80 different teams working in intense R&amp;D projects for Trilogy, some of which became separate companies under the Trilogy umbrella. Classes started at 8am and went to midnight. You would spend almost all your waking hours with your team, and the bonds formed here ran deep.</p>
<p>One participant, Vince Mallet, recalls: “on the second day, we were all asked to tell the most significant emotional experience of our lives.” The first month focused on this emotional bonding, and instilling the values of Trilogy: humility, teamwork, customer-obsession, and, most of all, risk-taking. Employees say the bonds formed just during this first month persisted through their time at Trilogy and beyond, even as they eventually split off into different teams or left the company.</p>
<p>In month two, recruits "have to come up with a frame-breaking great new business idea." They have to come up with an idea, create a business model for it, build the product, and develop the marketing plan. It's wasn't hypothetical either. Liemandt hand-picked the best products to launch. By month three- graduation month, most employees are picked by or matched with different teams at Trilogy and graduate from the university. Some continue to work on their project, if it was in the lucky 15% selected to go on.</p>
<p>Trilogy University lived the work hard, play hard culture. The rigorous program was tempered by luxurious amenities like company cab cards to travel anywhere in Austin for free, sponsored trips to the beach and Las Vegas, more snacks than a convenience store, and free kegs of beer every Friday. It was 90s dot-com boom excess from start to finish.</p>
<p>In this environment, it's easy to see how risk-taking fresh graduates could be transformed into creative, effective entrepreneurs with incredible bonds to their fellow Trilogy University alums — all the makings for a future tech mafia. As Trilogy declined in the early 2000s, many of these employees left to start ventures that seeded the early Austin tech scene.</p>
<h2><a name="the-trilogy-mafia-impact"></a>The Trilogy Mafia Impact</h2>
<p><em>"Liemandt knows most of the kids he's hiring are too smart to work for him — or anyone else — for long. "There are a lot of people here to learn how to start a software company," he says. "That's great." He says he'd rather get a few years of boundless entrepreneurial energy from his employees than get many years of mediocre performance."</em></p>
<p>This except from a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2018/11/19/holy-cow-no-ones-done-this/#6700faa92927">Forbes article</a> proclaiming Liemandt as "computerdom's newest magnate" foreshadows the massive impact that the team he put together at Trilogy would have. For example, Trilogy's eventual decline was Austin's gain. Trilogy introduced over a thousand entrepreneurial, creative, and techhnically skilled people to Texas, like Joshua Baer, founder of Austin technology incubator Capital Factory and Heather Brunner, CEO of WP Engine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statesman.com/article/20120901/NEWS/309012327">This article</a> from the Austin Statesman cites Trilogy's lasting influence on the city. "Austin high-tech recruiter Marc Davis, himself a Trilogy alumnus, counts more than <strong>four dozen</strong> Austin tech companies that have Trilogy veterans in top leadership roles. Among those where Trilogy veterans populate the upper ranks: HomeAway, Bazaarvoice, WhaleShark Media (RetailMeNot), <a href="http://indeed.com/">Indeed.com</a>, <a href="http://vast.com/">Vast.com</a> and Socialware."</p>
<p>Their influence extends beyond Austin. For example, Bryon Krug appears as an eager college senior at Carnegie-Mellon and a potential Trilogy recruit in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/college/man/schermerhorn332879/site/student/ic/oneman.htm">this Rolling Stone piece</a> from 1998, titled "Wooing the Geeks". He ended up joining Trilogy, then went on to found his own publishing company, and co-founded CEG Solutions in 2008, a major energy efficiency company where he still serves as president.</p>
<p>As for Trilogy's founder, Joe Liemandt? He's back on the Forbes 400, with a net worth of over $3.5 billion, thanks to his private equity investments in software companies.</p>
<p>There are some parallels between the Trilogy mafia and their more famous counterpart, the <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2007/11/13/magazines/fortune/paypal_mafia.fortune/index.htm">Paypal mafia</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both emerged at around the same time — the early 2000s, as the tech industry recovered and matured post dot-com crash.</li>
<li>In both cases, there was a mass exodus. Trilogy never got to a successful exit and started shedding employees. After PayPal's successful acquisition by eBay, the original team felt stifled under their new, more corporate bosses, and left.</li>
<li>Both companies selected for entrepreneurial people, then gave them confidence in their abilities, whether it was through Trilogy University's "build a company in a month" program or the near-bankruptcy battles fought at PayPal.</li>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, the founders encouraged tight bonds among their employees, all of whom skewed extremely young.</li>
</ul>
<p>Could this be the formula to build a new tech mafia?</p>
<p>Tech mafias are rare, and it's not obvious one has formed until years later. The first article on the success of PayPal's former employees was from 2007, 5 years after their acquisition. Spotting one is harder than finding a unicorn. In this case, you're looking for a whole herd.</p>
<p>In terms of tech mafias operating today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/silicon-valley-network-mafias.html">Uber and Airbnb have been selected as likely candidates</a>. Andrew Chen, who led Rider Growth at Uber and now is a partner at a16z, estimates that two dozen venture-backed startups have come out of Uber so far. Clearly, their alumni are already adding an extra jolt of entrepreneurial energy to the Valley, but what about outside California? Could some city be flying under the radar, in the way Austin was before Trilogy? Epic Games, for example, has …</p></div></div></div>

<p><em>With all due respect to the people arguing this one way or the other – many of whom are super intelligent. This argument is a self-defeating doom loop that can only be resolved via an act of faith.</em></p>
<h3>Introducing your Economic Apocalypse Toolkit</h3>
<p>With both Bitcoin and gold (and stonks, for that matter) at or recently off of all time highs the age old debate of whether gold is better than Bitcoin or vice versa is everywhere. I finally sat down and mapped out the <strong>Economic Apocalypse Toolkit</strong> after listening to Grant Williams and Bill Fleckenstein’s <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/lv/podcast/the-end-game-ep-12-fred-hickey/id1508585135?i=1000501094047">End Game podcast episode with Fred Hickey</a>, who writes <strong>The High Tech Strategist</strong>.</p>
<p>In it they hit on the perennial question of “gold vs Bitcoin” and Hickey laid out his objections to it. I’ve been a subscriber of The HTS for several years now and think it’s absolutely fantastic, and of course I also subscribe to <a href="https://ttmygh.com/">Grant Williams TTMYGH</a> and <a href="https://www.fleckensteincapital.com/home.aspx">Fleck’s newsletter</a> as well. All great stuff, well written, from extremely intelligent people. I do get the sense that Williams is somewhat open to Bitcoin and he <em>wants&nbsp;</em>to talk about it and explore the idea that it may be something more than the usual tropes: <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/this-time-is-different-part-i-what-bitcoin-isnt/">a ponzi, based on nothing, Tulipmania, etc</a>, but maybe he’s hesitant at prospect of taking heat for suggesting it.<span id="more-1451"></span></p>
<p>I just find the entire debate pointless because people who invest in either asset class&nbsp;<em>are doing so for the same reasons.&nbsp;</em>They are reacting to the same threat, they see the same unsustainability, they are preparing for the same End Game, if you will.</p>
<p>Given that many of the people who see the underlying issues are of a capital allocator, long term mindset, why is this being thought of in terms of either/or and not in terms of probabilities and scenarios?</p>
<p>If the job at hand is to protect one’s wealth from systemically rigged and disintegrating monetary regime, arguing for one over the other feels like trying to defend against it with only half the available toolkit. Is there a mechanic who wouldn’t be caught dead with a screwdriver in his toolbox because he can give you a list of reasons why every problem can be solved with a wrench? “Screwdrivers for suckers!”</p>
<p>The entire gold vs crypto argument goes away when one realizes that there is more overlap in the objectives of each asset than there are differences. And if you can get your own biases out of the way, then even the differences when looked at objectively seem to have uncanny parallels</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Gold</strong> has a 5,000 year track record, and has never failed to hold its value, which is quite impressive and has to count for something….<br>
<strong>Bitcoin</strong> has broken out of nowhere and taken the world by storm in an astonishingly small amount of time, which is quite impressive and has to count for something…</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is backed by nothing.<br>
<strong>Gold</strong> is just a shiny rock.</p>
<p>Without electricity, Bitcoin is useless.<br>
You can’t eat gold.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum computing</strong> will eventually destroy Bitcoin’s encryption.<br>
<strong>Asteroid mining</strong> will eventually make gold abundant and cheap.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a ponzi.<br>
What’s the definition of a gold mine? A hole in the ground with a liar standing beside it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could go on….</p>
<p>Since the future is unknowable and certainty elusive, aligning with one aspect of the above over the other has to be a choice not a fact. It’s an act of faith. So why not embrace agnosticism and make use of both sets of tools in your financial survival toolkit?</p>
<h3>The Toolkit</h3>
<p>Let’s just step briefly through some of the items in the mindmap. We have metals on one side, cryptos on the other.</p>

<div id="attachment_1452"><p><a href="https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit.png" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1452" loading="lazy" src="https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit.png" alt="" width="800" height="492" srcset="https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit.png 2074w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-300x185.png 300w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-1024x630.png 1024w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-150x92.png 150w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-768x473.png 768w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-1536x945.png 1536w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-2048x1260.png 2048w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-65x40.png 65w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-220x135.png 220w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-163x100.png 163w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-358x220.png 358w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-650x400.png 650w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-731x450.png 731w, https://outofthecave.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TheToolkit-829x510.png 829w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1452">Click for large version</p></div>
<p>On the cryptos side, I just think Bitcoin is the crypto-reserve currency and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. My preferred way to accumulate BTC is to earn it via my businesses. <a href="https://easydns.com/">easyDNS</a> has been accepting Bitcoin since 2013 and we’re <a href="https://easydns.com/landers/earn-crypto/">developing a payments service for clients</a> that will be based on <a href="https://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPayserver.</a></p>
<p>I put Litecoin and alts in there to trigger the maximalists. As per the Supersuckers song, <em>“I like it all man. (All or nothin’ I’m all in even when I’m bluffin’)”.</em></p>
<p>Ethereum is different animal, I think the Bitcoin vs Ethereum schism is every bit as fucking stupid as Gold vs Bitcoin. They do different things, and while they overlap in some aspects, that doesn’t mean there should only be one path forward.</p>
<p>The way I think about it, Bitcoin is the value, Ethereum is the execution. When I hear people dismiss Bitcoin because “there is as yet no ‘killer app’ that anybody has come up with for Bitcoin” I like to ask them “what is the killer app for the money in your wallet?”. Do you want to be able to play video games on your money? Collaborate on a document with your coworkers before you spend it? Dollars or&nbsp; euros aren’t dismissed as useless because nobody has come up with a compelling use case for them. You just spend it. <em>That’s&nbsp;</em>the use case.</p>
<p>Ethereum on the other hand, well that’s a whole different ball game. Smart contracts, DeFi, even Dao’s (despite early setbacks) will completely transform our lives. Ethereum, and other projects like it (Cardano, EOS, and even Ravencoin, which is actually a Bitcoin fork)&nbsp; are going to provide ways to code parameters and instructions around value and wealth that will be guaranteed to execute and can outrun government overreach.</p>
<p>We’re now coming out of that <a href="https://outofthecave.io/articles/welcome-to-bitcoins-trough-of-disillusionment/">“Trough of Disillusionment”</a> I wrote about back in 2018 and we have actual companies, actual businesses and ways to derive income now in crypto. We can invest in miners, in crypto based publicly traded companies, we can stake our assets or lend them and earn a return on them. Multiple income streams available here so we actually have some ability to compound whatever wealth we’ve managed to port to the crypto-economy separate from any nominal gains garnered in fiat terms.</p>
<p>And of course, with crypto we have the ability to move capital, in figurative terms, simply by thinking about it. If Actual Communism comes to your habitat and the best you can manage is to get out with your skin and some pass phrases you’ve remembered in your head, you can retrieve some of your assets wherever you come up for air (read <a href="https://amzn.to/2IghIzy">“We The Living”</a>. Take it to heart. This is the fate we seek to avoid, and large chunks of the world are barreling straight at it).</p>
<p>On the precious metals side you have your physical metals which, if all goes well, you simply keep vaulted in various places and your currency never collapses and you teach your kids that they should preserve the hoard and only use it in extreme emergencies down the road. And to teach their kids the same. You have junk silver in case there <em>is&nbsp;</em>a currency crisis and you don’t want to have to carve off a piece of a Krugerrand in order to buy some food at the market.</p>
<p>You have some gold tucked away in international vaults like <a href="http://www.bullionvaultaffiliate.com/trustable">Bullionvault</a> and <a href="https://www.goldmoney.com/w/wealthnet">Goldmoney</a>. My cousins run <a href="https://www.trustablegold.com/">TrustableGold.com</a> which rates these places.</p>
<p>All of this stuff, especially on the crypto side, has to be set up in advance, and you have to know how to navigate these systems before TSHTF. When a mob of mostly peaceful democratic socialists are tearing through your town and burning down your homes and businesses, or when the government is hanging both goldbugs and HODL-ers from lamposts, you do not want to be learning how to set up a Monero wallet and frantically converting as much as you can into it, nor do you want to be just then opening your Goldmoney account and trying to wire in some funds.</p>
<p>It has to be ready <em>now</em>, so&nbsp; when the inevitable&nbsp;<em>Financial Repressions </em>intensifies, or God forbid, the <em>Financial Tyranny</em> occurs, you can focus on executing your exit plans and coming out on the other end with enough capital and wealth to rebuild.</p>
<h3>The missing link</h3>
<p>What we really need are bridges between crypto-currencies and gold. Not metaphorical “can’t we all be friends” bridges, I mean gateways, tokenized/staked storage and transfer of precious metals. Conversion into or out of crypto from metals. This is not easy.</p>
<p>There have been attempts in the past, <a href="https://theagora.libsyn.com/gold-vs-crypto">Roger Ver, in Sal the Agorist’s recent “Gold vs Bitcoin” podcast</a> mentioned e-gold. easyDNS was the only domain registrar to accept e-gold back in the day and that’s how we amassed our physical gold which remains on our balance sheet even now. But contrary to Ver’s assertion that the government’s shutdown of E-gold speaks to gold’s inferiority to Bitcoin – that’s not entirely accurate. E-gold turned a blind eye to governance and it really was a wild west of ponzi schemes and criminal activity. Contrast with other DGCs of the day, like Pecunix or Goldmoney, the latter of which still exists. Goldmoney had far more stringent KYC and governance protocols, self-enforced, and here they are – still up and running.</p>
<p>In fact it was Goldmoney who had one of the more recent attempts at Bitcoin to vaulted gold convertability under their incarnation as Bitgold. They’ve since discontinued this precisely because of the governance hurdles.</p>
<p>I won’t trivialize how hard this is, but for people droning on about the need for a ‘killer app’, this one would probably do well.</p>
<h3>It’s all about optionality</h3>
<p>Both metals and crypto tribes look at the financial system and our legacy institutions as entering some form of breakdown and decline. Because the future is inherently unknowable, what makes more sense?</p>
<p>A) Betting on one half of a toolbox that may pay off huge in some scenarios but be worthless in others, or</p>
<p>B) Having a full toolbox that can give you some good outcomes under most imaginable circumstances?</p>
<p><strong>If you’re a goldbug</strong>, would it kill you to have a&nbsp;<em>fraction&nbsp;</em>of your liquidity in Bitcoin, knowing that from past events crypto superspikes tend to 10X or 100X or more with stubborn repetitiveness and increasing magnitude?</p>
<p><strong>If you’re into Bitcoin</strong>, buying the right gold miners now with a fraction of your capital may very well set you up with an increasingly fat, cushy dividend stream in a few years that you can use for living expenses while you continue to HODL.</p>
<p>Now there are many End Gamer luminaries out there who are invested in both even though …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div id="post-body"><p>One question I often ask potential software engineering candidates is to pinpoint the percentage of code coverage in an ideal project. Interestingly enough, many of them jump to the sky with numbers beyond 90%. They would start preaching how well-tested code is more reliable and brings more value to all stakeholders. When I ask about the current projects they work on, the reality looks a bit more down to earth.</p><p>Want to know my answer? I'd say it's <strong>around 66.7%</strong>.</p><p>The reasons for that vary, but allow me to be blunt and say that <strong>1/3 of the code every software project is irrelevant, buggy, overly complicated, or simply sucks.</strong> It has a reason to be where it is, but chances are, one year down the road, it will become a liability. Being dogmatic about tests and covering every line will only make it more difficult to get rid of it.</p><p>See, no two lines of code are equal in value and importance. Adding a new feature to an existing application affects its capabilities only marginally. However, it takes a proportionally large amount of time to develop and integrate due to the existing complexity. The bigger the complexity, the longer it takes to introduce new functionality. By the time the feature finds itself in production, it may as well be already irrelevant.</p><blockquote>The only sure-fire way to improve code coverage (and by that keep software relevant) is to identify and remove the unnecessary code.</blockquote><p>How do you identify irrelevant code? Don't search for it. Instead, let it reveal itself to you. One dimension of software that few teams make good use of, is its history. Git is a great analysis tool. Start using it not only to prevent future problems but also, to understand where and how often certain parts of the code change over time.</p><p>Chances are, you will find pieces of code that have undergone fewer changes than the rest in long periods. Those are the pillars of your application - the 2/3s that <strong>must be well-tested</strong>.</p><p>You will also find others where changes occur more or less every week. Ask yourselves whether those are still relevant, both from a technical and business perspective. Adding tests for the sake of coverage would have the opposite effect of increasing the code quality. In a perfectly-design software project, the part that is allowed to change most often is the configuration. A simple analysis of the code change frequency would show whether that is the case. If it isn't, try separating the moving parts from the core logic. If this is not feasible either, most probably those portions of the code don't belong to the codebase anyway. Turning them into interchangeable scripts (even stored in a separate repository) is one way of tackling them in their own right.</p><p>Let's not get too much into technical details. I have already alluded to the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill">Adam Tornhill</a> on code analysis in a previous post of mine:</p><figure><a href="https://preslav.me/2020/03/01/use-the-git-history/"><div><p>Use the Git History to Identify Pain Points in Any Project</p><p>Have you heard of Adam Tornhill [https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill]’s work?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>When COVID hit the first time, we lost 80% of our little independent coworking space revenue within a month 😱.</p><p>The math were pretty simple: 30% of our revenue come from the venue booking for events, 40% from sponsorship, 10% from our own events &amp; 20% from actual coworking membership. With no event, we don't only loose the revenue from this channel but also the value creation we are selling to sponsors: traffic and exposure. So all others channels are getting impacted 💥.</p><p>After a month of tears and cry, I realised that this was not a threat: it was actually a surge to upgrade our model. The way events are done and value creation perceived will never be the same again. And we better embrace it now!<br>So we turned one of our meeting room into a fully equipped studio and started promoting hybrid events to companies.</p><p>At the beginning, very few got the point: "Why would I need you when I can simply do a Facebook live on my own". Then they eventually realised that there is 99 ways to do a shitty online event 💩. And finally, when they saw the quality and engagement of our own hybrid event, it was WAY easier to sign some deals.</p><p>Quickly, hybrid events became a major part of our revenue. What so interesting is that it became an asset to leverage the existing sponsorship deals we signed pre covid. In deed we will never get the level attention we have today. Meanwhile, most companies social media are cruelly missing high quality content. Thanks to that sponsorship, they were able to deliver value added &amp; relevant content to their audience without having to create it.</p><p>Smaller content creators and individuals were also interested by the value creation: a plug and play space where they could create live content in the best possible condition without having to manage the technical parts.</p><p>Today, our revenue is mainly driven by content creation needs. Podcast, videocast, live events, interview, it really looks like more and more people understood that quality has a cost but also a return on investment and they are willing to pay for it.</p><p>Based on our successful execution, we got the attention of bigger companies and had the honor to co-create <a href="https://www.antistud.io/" target="_blank">https://www.antistud.io</a>, a series a coworking coffee in France turned into production ready spaces.</p><p>To put some context, our coworking space (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/lespot.coworking.guadeloupe" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/lespot.coworking.guadeloupe</a>) is based in Guadeloupe, a tiny island in the Caribbean. So you can imagine how proud we are to start from there something that is creating value for a way bigger company.</p><p>➡ The take away for you: Where ever you are, what ever is the size of what you're doing, keep in mind that in the internet world, it can be seen by anyone and inspire. So make sure you turn your valuable work into an asset by documenting it. I know, the process is often tiring but if you are doing is creating value for others, the magic of the internet karma powered by your intention will create some magic for you !</p><p>🔗 Our coworking: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lespot.coworking.guadeloupe/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/lespot.coworking.guadeloupe/</a><br>🔗 The coworking cafe startup Anticafé: <a href="https://anticafe.eu/" target="_blank">https://anticafe.eu</a><br>🔗 Our co-creation with Anticafé: <a href="https://www.antistud.io/" target="_blank">https://www.antistud.io/</a></p><p>‍</p></div></div><div id="signup"><p>💌 &nbsp;No pressure...</p><div><h2>Come, be a little crazy too</h2><p>Subscribe to our newsletter.

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It was only when I recently heard someone else say, “git stash is scary” that I realized it was top of my list of fears too. It just usually feels like there’s a chance I’ll just lose all of my in progress work to the depths of stashes and never be able to get the right incantation of <code>git</code> commands to reincarnate my code.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-git-stash-do">What does git stash do?</h3>

<p>Let me backtrack a minute! I haven’t yet explained what <code>git stash</code> even does. On the most basic level, <code>git stash</code> is one way to store in progress work in <code>git</code> for subsequent access, leaving behind a clean working directory.</p>

<p><em>Meta-note</em>: this post will be easiest to follow along if you open up a terminal and play around with <code>git stash</code> as you’re reading! The lack of syntax highlighting makes it a little tricky to see git additions / deletions. You can play around with any git repo you have, or clone <a href="https://github.com/githubtraining/hellogitworld">this hello world one</a> locally to work in a complete sandbox!</p>

<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>

<p>Stashes are more easily understood as a basic last in, first out stack.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> (equivalent to <code>git stash</code> when used with no arguments) will push any local changes onto the stash and leave a clean working directory.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit

<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

nothing to commit, working tree clean

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a plethora of arguments we can pass to <code>git stash push</code>. The ones I find most helpful are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-m &lt;message&gt;</code> saves the stash with a message, can be helpful for our future selves</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-m</span> <span>"description"</span>
Saved working directory and index state On main: description
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-p</code> patches changes (used like <code>git add -p</code>), allowing us to select which hunks to add to the stash. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Detailed-Unified.html">Hunks</a> are areas where two files differ. Git will partition files into hunks for us!</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-p</span>
....
Details about the hunk
....
<span>(</span>1/1<span>)</span> Stash this hunk <span>[</span>y,n,q,a,d,e,?]?
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-u</code> includes untracked files in the stash. Without this flag, a file that <code>git</code> had never seen before would not be included in a stash</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>touch </span>new-file
<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Untracked files:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include <span>in </span>what will be committed<span>)</span>
	new-file

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> to track<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-u</span>
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-k</code> keeps the files (or hunks) which were staged. Without this option, when we apply a stash, nothing will be staged. More on applying in the next section!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessing-the-stash">Accessing the stash</h3>

<p>Okay, we can now push changes onto the stash. But…. they’re still the stash abyss if we have no way of accessing them.</p>

<p><code>git stash list</code> shows us what is on the stash:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the <code>-m</code> message flag from earlier will be incredibly helpful. The first item in my stash had a message (<code>Clear description of these changes</code>), the second did not.</p>

<p>Okay, okay. We can now <em>see</em> what’s on the stash. But how do we access anything on the stash? Or remove it from the stash?</p>

<p><code>git stash show</code> will show us the difference between the top item on the stash, and our current working directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to reference a different set of changes on the stash, and not the most recent one, we can use the stash index of those changes. As we can see above, each item on the stash has an index, and can be referred to by <code>stash@{index}</code></p>

<p>So, to see the set of changes in the next item on our stack, we can run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
 README.md | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>, 1 deletion<span>(</span>-<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Neat, so we now know how to get the differences and look at what’s in the stash. But to actually access what’s on the stash, we’ll need <code>git stash apply [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. It similarly can take an argument with the stash index to reference something later in the stash. If no argument is provided, it will default to the most recent set of changes we put in the stash (the ones at <code>stash@{0}</code>)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash apply stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="removing-from-the-stash">Removing from the stash</h4>

<p>However, <code>git stash apply</code> will not <em>remove</em> the changes from the stash. If we look at the stash now, we’ll see it’s the same as it was:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to remove a set of changes from the stash, we can use <code>git stash drop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash drop stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>
Dropped refs/stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span> <span>(</span>b09812812eb27de2cb49bfd02aba43889362b6de<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that the set of changes at <code>stash@{0}</code> are now no longer on the stash, and the set of changes which were at <code>stash@{1}</code> are now at <code>stash@{0}</code>.</p>

<p>If we want to <code>apply</code> and <code>drop</code> a set of changes, we can conveniently use <code>git stash pop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. <code>pop</code> will only also <code>drop</code> if there’s no merge conflict.</p>

<p>To clear the stash completely, we can run <code>git stash clear</code>. This is the <em>actual</em> scary command which will cause us to lose any work in progress that you had stashed. Only run <code>git stash clear</code> if you never again want to access what is currently on the stash.</p>

<h3 id="why-stash">Why stash?</h3>

<p>So we’ve learned how to use <code>git stash</code>, but still haven’t covered <em>why</em> to use it. Stashing is intended to be a quick and easy way to get to a clean working state while not losing in progress work. And it is! Both quick, and now hopefully easy!</p>

<p>One example of when I might use <code>git stash</code> is if I’m in progress on some changes, but realize I want to amend a prior commit. I can stash the changes, amend the commit, and then apply the stash to get back to where I was.</p>

<p>Another is if I am trying to experiment with a few different ways to solve a problem, and want small, quick examples down each solution path. I might create stashes with all of my examples, and then pick the best and pursue that set of changes in a branch structure.</p>

<p>Additionally, stashing is especially helpful because it is branch agnostic. That is to say, if we switch branches, our stash will remain the same. This means stashing can also be a convenient way to carry changes through different branches.</p>

<h3 id="when-not-to-stash">When not to stash</h3>

<p>Equally import to why stash is when <em>not</em> to use it.</p>

<p>Stashing was built for convenience, and is not intended to be a permanent way to save work; that’s what branches and commits are for. Stashing also only works locally, you can’t push stashes to a repo or have others pull them down.</p>

<h3 id="branches-from-stash">Branches from stash</h3>

<p>Speaking of branches, another fun feature of stashes is that we can create a branch directly from a stash. This is done using <code>git stash branch &lt;branch_name&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;]</code> This will also drop the changes from the stash, equivalent to a <code>git stash pop</code> not a <code>git stash apply</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash branch new-branch
Switched to a new branch <span>'new-branch'</span>
On branch new-branch
Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
Dropped refs/stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span> <span>(</span>d6a804a40c0b477d8e3be27939310ff677f45670<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash</code> operates on a LIFO stack of sets of changes</li>
  <li><code>git stash list</code> shows what’s on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> pushes to the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash apply</code> access changes on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash drop</code> removes changes from the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash pop</code> does an <code>apply</code> and a <code>drop</code></li>
  <li>These default to the most recent item on the stash, to reference another one use <code>stash@{index}</code> where you can determine the index from <code>git stash list</code></li>
  <li>Some of these have flags which make them more convenient, including: <code>-m</code> message, <code>-p</code> patch, <code>-u</code> include untracked files, <code>-k</code> keep staged changes staged</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully you, too, can now add <code>git stash</code> to the list of fears you’ve conquered!</p>

<p>For further reading on stashing, take a look at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash">git stash docs</a>. For further reading on <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/topics/fear-quotes">conquering fears</a>, here is a favorite quote of mine, “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie">Marie Curie</a></p>

<br/>
December 4, 2020 | https://fable.io/blog/Announcing-Nagareyama-4.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fable.io/blog/Announcing-Nagareyama-4.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today is the day, Fable 3 Nagareyama is officially released! Does this mean the latest version is bug-free? Probably not, but at least the install command is shorter. We have also tested the release candidates in many projects and managed to fix all the outstanding issues so if you find a problem when upgrading your Fable 2 project you may even consider yourself lucky (also, please report).</p>
<p>First things first, I have to acknowledge all the people that have contributed to this release: from Don Syme himself to ncave, our mysterious contributor, and all the early-users that have helped polish this release. Very importantly, the teachers too that take care of my children in difficult times so I can focus on programming. The fact that so many people can collaborate together to put a project like Fable forward still feels like magic to me and I can only say a big THANK YOU to you all. I'm also very happy this is coincidental with the release of F# 5, as incredibly smart people are putting a lot of effort to make the development experience with the language really pleasant. Quoting Krzysztof Cieślak, what a great time to be an F# developer!</p>
<p>How can you try Fable 3, you say? This is it:</p>
<pre><code>dotnet tool install fable
dotnet fable src</code></pre><p>(Change "src" with the path to your project.) It's that easy, type <code>dotnet fable --help</code> to see more options. Of course you still need extra tooling to bundle the JS code, spin off a development server, etc. If you're upgrading an app using Webpack, please <a href="https://github.com/MangelMaxime/fulma-demo/pull/43">check this PR for reference</a>.</p>
<p>Let's quickly go through the highlights of Nagareyama:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's Fable v3. Three is bigger than two, that's already a win.</li>
<li>There are no breaking changes, your Fable 2 project should compile as is with Nagareyama (you may need to update some libraries).</li>
<li>It's a dotnet tool, following suit with most F# project. Remember when Fable, Paket and Fake had each their own way to be downloaded and version-managed? Those days are happily gone!</li>
<li>It removes the inter-process communication with JS, greatly simplifying Fable usage and development.</li>
<li>The previous point together with other fixes have improved the compilation speed by a big deal. Expect it to be at least cut in half in most cases!</li>
<li>Fable is not tightly coupled with a specific bundler anymore like Webpack so you can use any tool you like! (Webpack is still a great choice.)</li>
<li>A lot of effort has been also put to prettify the generated code, making it more readable and easier to debug if needed.</li>
<li>Nagareyama can accept plugins by library authors. Zaid is already using this feature to make it much simpler to <a href="https://youtu.be/a6Ct3CM_lj4?t=860">write React components compatible with JS tooling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check the <a href="https://fable.io/blog/Announcing-Nagareyama-3.html">previous posts</a> for more details.</p>


<p>So what are you waiting for? Give Nagareyama a try and let the world know if it goes well... and let us know (privately) if it doesn't 😅 Have fun!</p>

<p><strong>Version 4.0 of TerminusDB - the Star’s End Release</strong> * - is a big step forward in solidifying and extending the functionality of TerminusDB and TerminusHub.</p>

<p><a href="https://terminusdb.com/">TerminusDB</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb">open source</a>, revision control graph database designed for distributed collaboration. TerminusDB allows you to push, pull, time-travel and merge data, much in the way that is possible with code in Git.</p>

<p>With this release TerminusDB takes a significant step towards our vision of a general-purpose tool for data &amp; content management and collaboration.</p>

<p>TerminusDB 4.0 extends the revision control features to allow greater visibility and reproducability by allowing you to look inside individual commits to see what changes were made. Provenance, lineage, and compliance are increasingly essential in the management of data and content.</p>

<p>The <em>major</em> additional features are:</p>

<h3 id="model-building-tool">Model Building Tool</h3>

<p>The database ships with an integrated visual schema building tool. It allows users to build complex data models using point and click tooling. This makes building models significantly quicker, more efficient, and inclusive of a broader range of people by lowering the technical bar for the application of business rules to your data.</p>

<p>It lets you visually design knowledge graphs in the same way they are presented to business users. We have tried to make the tool easy to use, while preserving the ability to model the most complex domains.</p>

<p>Like everything in TerminusDB, the models are versioned so you can make changes in testing and if it breaks your database, you can easily roll back to an earlier working version. This <strong>collaborative knowledge graph design and implementation functionality</strong> does not exist elsewhere.</p>

<p>You can currently share your models/schemas through TerminusHub - the next step is to make modelling and collaboration even easier by providing data-libraries on TerminusHub, including schema.org but also basic standard models for common domains such as CRM, accounting, and inventory. Users can then generate and share models with collaborators or the broader public.</p>

<h3 id="document-editor">Document Editor</h3>

<p>TerminusDB 4.0 has full surfability, clickability and editability of database documents through the console. It is a wiki or catalogue of all your data that you can edit in place. You don’t have to write code or execute a query, just edit the document directly. If you have a collaborative project, this is a useful approach to building and curating data assets.</p>

<p>The documents link to associated documents delivering a linked data application. You can filter documents, you can find the document you want using search, you can create a new document in the interface - it is a <strong>general-purpose tool for managing your data</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of the TerminusDB content management system, which we will be expanding over the coming months - next step is to provide web accessibility to TerminusHub databases and then a publisher API to provide the ability to publish the results of any query as a static content set.</p>

<h3 id="csv-manager">CSV Manager</h3>

<p>With a single click, you can now build a database from a CSV or a group of CSVs. You can easily use TerminusDB and TerminusHub as a place to version and collaborate when working with CSV data. This will be especially useful with fast changing data as frequently used in machine learning and data science projects.</p>

<p>We have tried to make it as simple as possible for users to interact with the CSV tooling. You can view and edit CSVs directly in the document viewer. You can also add CSVs from this interface. No need to write code.</p>

<p>The database automatically spots if the CSV is already in the database and will just add the delta. There is an append mode that just adds the data that is not there and an update mode that updates the entire CSV.</p>

<p><strong>Manage your CSVs and other data via TerminusDB and Hub.</strong></p>

<h3 id="command-line-interface">Command Line Interface</h3>

<p>We are excited to launch the TerminusDB CLI. You can connect to TerminusDB with a Git-like CLI to run queries or use the revision control features.</p>

<p>You can create databases and branches, you can list databases/branches, you can query in the command line and you can load CSVs. You also get full error reporting in the CLI. Use the CLI to import a CSV, commit changes and push the changes to TerminusHub.</p>

<p>The CLI will continue to develop and add new operations. We will make it easier to execute queries directly from the CLI. We’re also planning to launch CLIs for the JavaScript and Python clients.</p>

<p>TerminusDB is a big step towards our ambition to be a complete decentralized data and content management system that is accessible to all.</p>

<p><strong>END</strong></p>

<p>* Star’s End is a reference to the mysterious location of the Second Foundation in the Asimov series of novels. The home of the First Foundation was Terminus.</p>

                    Let's look at a type-directed approach for implementing
                    image processing applications on FPGAs. This approach will
                    enable us to statically verify a design's throughput. If you
                    like this post, check out my PLDI 2020 paper <a href="https://aetherling.org/">Aetherling</a>, which
                    provides a formal definition of the types and uses them
                    to make trade-offs automatically during the FPGA design process.

                    <!--target audience: someone at google who already knows its hard to make stuff fast, not hardware person, knows that apple and google are doing custom hardware (maybe), interested in design choices apple/google would have to make-->
                    <p>
                        Hardware designs on FPGAs offer a different set of
                        performance trade-offs compared to software running on a
                        CPU. Greater parallelism can be achieved on an FPGA by
                        allocating more resources, like adders and multipliers.
                        This is unlike a CPU with a fixed number of cores and
                        vector lanes per cores. However, FPGA have limited
                        resources, so trade-offs must be made between
                        parallelism (or throughput) and resource utilization. In
                        this blog post, we're going to look at the
                        throughput-resource utilization trade-offs for FPGA
                        implementations of image processing operations like
                        image blurring. There are many ways to blur images on an
                        FPGA. Some designs have higher throughput, and others
                        require fewer resources. I'm going to demonstrate a type
                        system for expressing designs with different
                        throughput-resource tradeoffs that enables you to
                        statically determine a design's throughput.

                            (See below for a refresher on the types of resources
                            available on an FPGA.)

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Before we get to the type system, let's look at a few
                        different ways to blur an image on an FPGA. These
                        designs will have different throughout-resources
                        trade-offs. The below video shows one design that
                        processes one pixel per clock cycle. It does so by
                        streaming over the input pixels, accepting one at a
                        time, storing two prior input pixels in registers, and
                        computing the average of the current input and the prior
                        two.
                    </p>

                    

                    <p>
                        Design a in the image below shows the same one pixel per
                        clock design as the above animation. Designs b and c
                        show two other implementations with different
                        throughput-resource utilization trade-offs. Design b
                        processes two elements per clock, doubling the
                        throughput relative to design a and the animation above.
                        Design b requires double the adders and dividers
                        compared to design a in order to achieve this
                        throughput. Design c saves on adders but can only
                        process one pixel every third clock cycle.

                                    every third clock.  For simplicity, these
                                    designs only do a blur on a 1D image.

                        You could write up all these different designs in
                        Verilog. Assuming you wrote correct code, they would
                        synthesize to a bitstream, run on an FPGA, and provide
                        the expected throughput. But, it would be challenging to
                        statically verify that the designs achieved the correct
                        performance.

                        </a>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Now that we've seen some different designs, we're ready
                        for the types that encode their throughputs. Since we're
                        building application-specific hardware, we can encode
                        the throughput of the designs down to the clock cycle
                        without complex performance issues common in software
                        like multi-threading. I'm going to introduce these types
                        using a simpler example than blur: <code>map
                        add10</code>. This code adds 10 to each element in an
                        input sequence. When implementing a map on an FPGA,
                        there are two basic implementations. The first
                        implementation, <code>map_s add10</code> (or
                        <code>map</code> in space), is fully parallel and
                        duplicates <code>add10</code>. If the <code>map_s</code>
                        is applied to a sequence of four elements, then four
                        elements arrive on one clock cycle, <code>map_s</code>
                        adds 10 to every element, and the four elements depart
                        on the same clock cycle. The second implementation,
                        <code>map_t add10</code> (or <code>map</code> in time),
                        is fully sequential and requires only one copy of the
                        <code>add10</code> circuit. The four input elements
                        arrive on four separate clocks and <code>map_t</code>
                        adds 10 to one element at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The types of <code>map_s</code> and <code>map_t</code>
                        encode their throughputs. <code>map_s add10 :: SSeq 4
                        int -&gt; SSeq 4 int</code> is a function on two space
                        sequences. Each space sequence (<code>SSeq 4 int</code>)
                        encodes both the length of the sequence and that all the
                        elements occur on the same clock cycle. The type
                        signature of <code>map_s add10</code> encodes it's a
                        function which accepts four <code>int</code>s on one
                        clock and emits them on one clock. This is a throughput
                        of four <code>int</code>s per clock. <code>map_t add10 :: TSeq 4 0
                        int -&gt; TSeq 4 0 int</code> is a function on two time
                        sequences. Each time sequence (<code>TSeq 4 0 int</code>)
                        encodes that all the elements elements occur on different clocks, one after another. The type
                        signature of <code>map_t add10</code> encodes it's a
                        function which accepts four <code>int</code>s on separate
                        clocks and emits them on separate clocks. This is a throughput
                        of one <code>int</code> per clock. The fully sequential
                        throughput, like the fully parallel one for <code>map_s
                        add10</code>, is easily expressed using the space-time
                        types.

                        The prior <code>map</code> examples only had fully
                        parallel or sequential throughputs. We need to support
                        other types of throughputs in order to handle all of the
                        image blur designs. We can nest and modify the

        <section>
            <div><p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/?resellerType=home">Raspberry Pi Zero</a> and original Raspberry Pi both have a 32-bit ARM architecture which many projects have dropped support for. So when I saw that <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/4530">containerd recently merged a fix</a> for building containerd on armv6, started to think what I could do with it.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, a user of the <a href="http://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd project</a> which runs very well on VPSes, RPi 3 and RPi4 asked me whether it could work on the Zero and I told him it was not practical or worth his time. After all, an RPi4 with 2GB of RAM, 4 Cores and much faster I/O is only 25GBP/EUR/USD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd is OpenFaaS</a>, but for a single node, and designed for those who don't want to pay for and manage an entire Kubernetes cluster, GitOps, service-mesh, and IngressController just to deploy a few simple functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My past experiences told me that it would be a challenge to get the zero working. It has such a paltry amount of memory available and its I/O is really slow. Still, sometimes it's fun to do things that we shouldn't. Had I been <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">"nerd sniped"</a>?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/homepage-9df4b/static/1dfa03d09c1f3e446e8d936dfb92267f/8924f/6b0defdbbf40792b64159ab8169d97162c380b2c_raspberry-pi-zero-1-1755x1080.jpg" width="60%">
&gt; The RPi Zero originally released in 2015.
</p><p>In this post I'll show you what you need to do to deploy functions through the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">OpenFaaS CLI</a> and be able to invoke them, including multi-arch builds. At the end of the post I'll explain what the limitations are and whether we should leave the Raspberry Pi Zero with those fond memories we have of it when it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">released in 2015</a>, 5 years ago.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walk-through</h2>
<h3 id="prereqs">Pre-reqs</h3>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
<li>Ethernet adapter and USB &lt;&gt; USB A micro shim</li>
<li>16-32GB class 10 SD card</li>
<li>MicroUSB power adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>Flash the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card, and then create an <code>ssh</code> file in the <code>/boot/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Power up the Raspberry Pi and ssh to it with <code>ssh pi@raspberrypi.local</code>.</p>
<h3 id="installgo">Install go</h3>
<p>You can install Go from a package manager, but the version is likely to be rather old. Fortunately the Go team still ship a binary for armv6:</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH="armv6l"
echo "Downloading Go"

curl -SLsf https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.15.linux-$ARCH.tar.gz --output /tmp/go.tgz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/go/
sudo tar -xvf /tmp/go.tgz -C /usr/local/go/ --strip-components=1

export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin/
</code></pre>
<p>You now have Go installed, run <code>go version</code> to see it working.</p>
<h3 id="buildcontainerd">Build containerd</h3>
<p>faasd uses containerd rather than Docker, but there are no official binaries for any of the ARM CPUs, so we have to build them from source.</p>
<p>For armv7 and ARM64, you can use my repo <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm">alexellis/containerd-arm</a>. It's my hope to see ARM support upstreamed, but having spoken on several occasions to the containerd team, it seems very unlikely that we will see this happen.</p>
<p>On my first attempt of building I got the following error:</p>
<pre><code>+ bin/containerd
# github.com/containerd/containerd/cmd/containerd
/usr/local/go/pkg/tool/linux_arm/link: running gcc failed: fork/exec /usr/bin/gcc: cannot allocate memory
make: *** [Makefile:188: bin/containerd] Error 2
</code></pre>
<p>The RPi Zero and the largest RPi 1 only has 512MB of RAM and I slowly watched the RAM being eaten up with <code>watch -n "free -h"</code>.. I should have remembered this.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had the battle scars and knew what I had to do:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1M &amp;&amp;\
  sudo mkswap /swapfile &amp;&amp; \
  sudo swapon /swapfile
</code></pre>
<p>This creates 1GB of swap, on the SD card.. which already has terrible I/O, but it may just work.</p>
<p>The other trick you may have seen me talk about is adding <code>gpu_mem=16</code> to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>. It seems pointless changing the split on an 8GB RPi4, but for our RPi Zero, we need every MB we can get.</p>
<p>Second time lucky?</p>
<p>No. It failed again due to some missing libraries. I reminded myself to read <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/BUILDING.md#build-containerd">BUILDING.md</a> from the containerd repo. After adding libseccomp and a few other packages, it started to move along again.</p>
<pre><code>make
+ bin/ctr
+ bin/containerd
+ bin/containerd-stress
+ bin/containerd-shim
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v1
+ bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2
+ binaries
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if it was 10 minutes or over an hour, but it was slow progress.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>sudo make install</code> and copied the systemd unit file into place with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp containerd.service /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service
sudo systemctl enable containerd
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't want to start containerd at this time, to save on memory for the next task.</p>
<h3 id="buildfaasd">Build faasd</h3>
<p>The faasd Makefile needed a patch because it was set to cross-compile to armv7, but we needed armv6.</p>
<pre><code>.PHONY: dist
dist:
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -mod=vendor -ldflags $(LDFLAGS) -a -installsuffix cgo -o bin/faasd-armhf
</code></pre>
<p>This took so long to build on the zero that I gave up and built it on my Intel NUC. Fortunately Go is very good as cross-compiling, especially when linking into C/C++ libraries is disabled with <code>CGO_ENABLED=0</code>.</p>
<p>I then ran <code>scp</code> to copy the binary to the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp faasd-armhf /usr/local/bin/faasd
cd go/src/github.com/openfaas/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>The final step was to install faasd which creates two systemd unit files:</p>
<ul>
<li>faasd - for the OpenFaaS core services</li>
<li>faasd-provider - for the provider that supports CRUD and Invoke operations</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/faasd-install.jpg" alt="faasd-install"></p>
<h3 id="unexpectedissues">Unexpected issues</h3>
<p>I tried to log in with <code>faas-cli login</code>, but it didn't work. I saw a number of errors in the logs <code>sudo systemctl journalctl -u faasd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Dec 03 23:18:49 zero-dns default:basic-auth-plugin[13218]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
Dec 03 23:18:50 zero-dns containerd[12169]: time="2020-12-03T23:18:50.338589900Z" level=info msg="starting signal loop" namespace=default path=/run/containerd/io.containerd.runtime.v2.task/default/gateway pid=13324
Dec 03 23:18:52 zero-dns default:gateway[13335]: standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "exec format error"
</code></pre>
<p>It turned out that out of nats, prometheus, and the openfaas gateway, the openfaas basic-auth plugin only nats was available for armv6. It seems that projects really have moved on and left armv6 behind.</p>
<h3 id="thenihadanidea">Then I had an idea</h3>
<p>What if we didn't run the whole OpenFaaS stack at all, but just the <code>faasd-provider</code>? It would allow this tiny device to support all the CRUD operations on functions, and invocations, but nothing more.</p>
<p>The provider seemed to be running well, and responding to <code>faas-cli</code> commands:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/provider.png" alt="provider"></p>
<p>We'd lose the queue and async invocations, lose the UI, lose the metrics, but we could still deploy functions and invoke them.</p>
<p>It was already very late by this point so I decided to sleep on it.</p>
<h3 id="inthemorning">In the morning</h3>
<p>I powered up the RPi zero and tried deploying a container directly to the faasd endpoint, and it worked.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/12/deploy.jpg" alt="deploy"></p>
<p>Now, I had to make a few changes. Rather than building with the OpenFaaS watchdog in the container, I just used a Dockerfile and a plain Go HTTP server.</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up with:</p>
<p>Dockerfile</p>
<pre><code>FROM --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM:-linux/amd64} golang:1.13-alpine3.11 as build

<p>handler.go</p>
<pre><code>package main

	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	s := &amp;http.Server{
		Addr:           fmt.Sprintf(":%d", 8080),
		MaxHeaderBytes: 1 &lt;&lt; 20, // Max header of 1MB
	}

	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.Write([]byte("Hello world"))
	})

    handler: ./http
    image: alexellis2/http:0.1.4
    build_args:
      GO111MODULE: on
</code></pre>
<p>I ran this on my PC with the following:</p>
<pre><code>export OPENFAAS_URL=http://192.168.0.81:8081
faas-cli publish --platform linux/arm/v6

faas-cli deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Using the PC means we can cross-compile the Go HTTP server and push a multi-arch image to the container registry. The new <code>faas-cli publish</code> command comes in handy for this and can accept a list of architectures.</p>
<p>The <code>deploy</code> command talks to the remote machine over REST and tells it to deploy a function. The server-side handler <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/pkg/provider/handlers/deploy.go">deploy.go</a> pulls the image into containerd and starts executing it as a container.</p>
<h3 id="onemorething">One more thing</h3>
<p>When I say that it worked. I should clarify that I'd forgotten to deploy CNI - the networking layer required for faasd and containerd.</p>
<p>I saw this error by running the following:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Not that long ago, <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/DEV.md">I'd documented all the steps required for a manual installation</a>, but somehow forgot this was needed.</p>
<pre><code>export ARCH=arm
export CNI_VERSION=v0.8.5

sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/${CNI_VERSION}/cni-plugins-linux-${ARCH}-${CNI_VERSION}.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin

# Make a config folder for CNI definitions
sudo mkdir -p /etc/cni/net.d

# Make an initial loopback configuration
sudo sh -c 'cat &gt;/etc/cni/net.d/99-loopback.conf &lt;&lt;-EOF
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "type": "loopback"
}
EOF'
</code></pre>
<p>Just changing "ARCH" to "arm" was enough to make it work. So the CNI project are still <a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/blob/master/.travis.yml">building the plugins against armv6</a> for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="finalattempt">Final attempt</h3>
<p>Then it was a case of simply running <code>faas-cli deploy</code> again, and finally, it actually worked.</p>
<p>An initial benchmark with <code>hey</code> identified that the …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

				<p>We make plant-based cheese, so why would our main target market be vegetarians, who of course do eat cheese from animals?</p><p>The reason is the same why we started Yeti in the first place: We want to make animals obsolete in food production. Therefore, we need to convince people who otherwise do eat dairy-based cheese to eat Yeti instead. For every gram of plant-based cheese they eat instead of dairy-based, we come a small step closer to our mission.</p><p>Of course, that doesn't mean we're unhappy when vegans eat our products - not at all. However, it's much easier to convince people who are already on a plant-based diet to buy our cheese. In order to convince vegetarians or omnivores, our cheese needs to be as good as or better than cheese from animals. Therefore, clearly focusing efforts on non-vegans sets a high bar for our cheeses and forces us to make excellent products. This is the goal we set for ourselves.</p><p>Now, you might ask yourself why we target vegetarians specifically and not also omnivores. The reason is a practical one: We believe that it's easier to reach and convince vegetarians, because we've been vegetarians for a long time before going 100% plant-based and cheese was what was holding us back. If you talk to any vegetarian, I'd wager that a vast majority of them will tell you that cheese is the reason that they're not vegan.</p><p>Or, put differently, we know that a big problem in the vegatarian market is the absence of great plant-based cheese. A clearly defined problem makes it easier for us to reach our customers effectively and get them try our cheese.</p>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Just before the 2020 general election, a friend on Twitter paraphrased a famous quote that says, “if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.” And later, another friend on Whatsapp said, “you have to take a side. Not taking a side, in the face of what we are seeing, is actually taking sides.” The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-may-have-won-the-election-but-the-deep-partisan-divide-in-america-remains/"><span>narrow margin</span></a> of victory suggests such anecdotes may be shared by a large portion of the population.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>Many journalists also <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/11/01/americas-press-and-the-asymmetric-war-for-truth/"><span>struggle</span></a> with the issue of taking sides. Most were trained to write in an objective manner and keep their opinions out of the story. But this style has lately been accused of having the “<a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/07/16/how-objectivity-in-journalism-became-a-matter-of-opinion"><span>view from nowhere</span></a>” (i.e., reporting information on “both sides” and possibly implying false equivalence when one side is obviously right). Perhaps it is no surprise that the <a href="https://www.rand.org/news/press/2019/05/14.html"><span>level of opinionatedness</span></a> has gone up in journalism.</p>
<p>For individuals in the general public who want to be well informed, what are the implications of increasing partisanship in our communities and rising opinionatedness in the news? Should we remain loyal to our favorite news sources or challenge our perspectives by reading information we disagree with?&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a fundamental level, can you remain unbiased when reading the news?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/us-political-polarization-crop.gif" alt="Political Polarization"></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/10/05/the-partisan-divide-on-political-values-grows-even-wider/" rel="noopener">Pew Research</a></p>
<h3>Multiple perspectives crucial to combating partisanship</h3>
<p>While many readers want unbiased news, a basic truth is that everyone is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/12/psychology-of-group-reasoning-versus-individual"><span>subject to biases</span></a>. While some reporters and news sources claim these biases explicitly, others are less aware and may frame facts and arguments in a way they feel is truthful yet remains colored by their own experiences and beliefs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of pervasive bias, a rising level of opinionatedness in journalism is not necessarily cause for alarm and reinforces a core precept of reading the news: that no single article or source will present all the facts and arguments for an issue. Hence the importance of reading multiple perspectives, ideally across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this practice is more common in the history of news consumption than we think. In the days of print news, many households received multiple dailies, often representing different political viewpoints.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>False equivalence concerns may be overstated</h3>
<p>When reading multiple perspectives, we must challenge ourselves to think critically. Here are some questions to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What facts are presented and are any left out?</li>
<li>What’s the history of this issue and are there trends in the data presented?</li>
<li>What can we learn from other countries/locations that can inform our understanding?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>When provided with all of the facts and varying viewpoints, and some time to think things through, most readers are equipped to draw accurate conclusions. Veteran journalists such as <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1329599947503767552?s=20"><span>Matt Taibbi</span></a> recommend empowering readers to be independent thinkers as a best practice. It also means that worries about false equivalency may be overstated because people can judge for themselves if they believe the evidence supporting one side even if the other side was presented in as much detail.</p>
<p>As an aside, this is how we conduct jury trials — we assume that a panel of average citizens, presented with the facts arguing for and against a conviction, will reach the <a href="https://theconversation.com/all-about-juries-why-do-we-actually-need-them-and-can-they-get-it-wrong-112703"><span>right conclusion</span></a> most of the time. So why not expect the same of our society when it comes to reading the news?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Bias is OK, empathy is better</h3>
<p>Just as all writers are biased, so too are all readers. Reading the news doesn’t require us to put aside our biases or opinions. Rather, reading the news is a way to get the facts and arguments for and against an issue so that whatever opinions you hold are grounded in the facts.</p>
<p>Finally, by reading multiple perspectives, even if your opinions and biases don’t change, you may develop empathy for people who have viewpoints different than yours. A more empathetic society is something to strive for in a world that seems increasingly divided.</p></span>

December 4, 2020 | https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/vaccel_v2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/vaccel_v2/">archive.org</a>

<p>In our <a href="https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/vaccel/">previous post</a> we spoke about the potential solutions for
deploying serverless offerings with hardware acceleration support. With the
increasing adoption of the serverless and FaaS paradigms, providers will need
to offer some form of hardware acceleration semantics.</p>

<p>For some time now, Amazon has <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1179">identifed</a> this as a “compelling use
case” for their AWS Firecracker hypervisor which powers the Amazon Lambda
service. What is more, they identify traditional techniques for GPU support in
VMs such as GPU passthrough comes with limitations and significantly increases
the attack surface of the hypervisor.</p>

<p>As an alternative to passing through the accelerator device inside the guest,
paravirtual interfaces can expose hardware acceleration capabilities inside
the VM with minimal overhead and offering a simple user interface for
offloading code to the host for acceleration.</p>

<p>In fact, such interfaces already exist. <code>virtio-crypto</code> is an example, where
the guest VM uses a simple crypto API while the actual computation is
offloaded, through the paravirtual driver, to the host.</p>

<p>We believe that the same paradigm can be applied to any kind of computation
that can benefit from acceleration. Whether that is crypto operations, Machine
Learning or linear algebra operators, the workflow from the point of view of
the developer these days is the same; You will use a framework such as
cryptodev, Jetson Inference or the BLAS library, to write your applications and
you will not deal with the low-level complexities of the actual accelerator.
Moreover, that workflow should not be different whether your application runs
on baremetal or inside a VM.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post we present  <em>vAccel</em>, an acceleration framework that
enables <strong>portable</strong> and <strong>hardware agnostic</strong> acceleration for cloud
and edge applications.</p>

<h2 id="vaccel-design">vAccel design</h2>

<p>In simple terms, vAccel is an accleration API. It offers support for a set of
operators that commonly use hardware acceleration to increase performance,
such as machine learning and linear algebra operators.</p>

<p>The API is implemented by <em>VaccelRT</em> a thin and efficient runtime system that links
against the user application and is responsible for dispatching operations to
the relevant hardware accelerators. The interaction with the hardware itself is
mediated by plugins which implement the API for the specific hardware
accelerator.</p>

<p>This design is driven by our requirements for high degree of portability, an
application that consumes the vAccel API can run without modification or even
re-compilation to any platform for which there is suitable back-end plugin.</p>

<p>In fact, this opens up the way to enable the vAccel API inside a VM guest. The missing
bits are a virtio driver that implements the vAccel API and a backend plugin that
speaks with the virtio device. Once you have this components in place, you can
run your existing vAccel application inside a VM, just by using the virtio-plugin at
runtime.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cloudkernels.net/static/vaccel_v2/vaccelrt.png#center" alt="vAccel runtime" title="VaccelRT"></p>

<h2 id="vaccel-support-in-aws-firecracker">vAccel support in AWS Firecracker</h2>

<p>Once we implemented the frontend vAccel-virtio driver and virtio plugin for VaccelRT,
we need a hypervisor to test this on. We already showed, in the previous post some
initial vAccel results with QEMU as the target hypervisor. In this post, we will focus
on AWS Firecracker.</p>

<p>AWS Firecracker has been designed having in mind really small boot times and small attack
surface, which makes it a compelling choice for cloud and edge deployments.
Moreover, it powers up Lambda, Amazon’s serverless platform, which we see as a
paradigm for which vAccel’s hardware abstraction level is a perfect fit.</p>

<p>AWS Firecracker already implements virtio backend drivers for net, block and vsock. That
was good news for us, we have all the required virtio machinery. All we had to do, was
add a new device for vAccel and link the hypervisor with VaccelRT.</p>

<p>The last bit required us to create the necessary Rust bindings for calling C from AWS Firecracker
which is written in Rust. This was actually a good exercise for us, since we plan to anyway
provide bindings for the vAccel API in more high-level languages.</p>

<p>With all the components in place our stack looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cloudkernels.net/static/vaccel_v2/vaccele2e.png#center" alt="vAccel VM execution" title="vaccel-e2e"></p>

<p>The user application is consumes the vAccel API and links against VaccelRT. Inside the VM
the application uses the vAccel-virtio backend plugin. When a vAccel function is called, the
plugin will offload the request to <code>/dev/accel</code> device which is the interface of the virtio
driver. Next, the virtio driver will forward the request to the vAccel-enabled AWS Firecracker
instance which will the host-residing VaccelRT. Finally, in the host side, VaccelRT will use
one of the available plugins, to execute the operation on the hardware accelerator.</p>

<p>But how does this perform?</p>

<p>We first grabbed a copy of jetson-inference, a rich repo full of ML inference models and example applications based on TensorRT. We patched it to be able to run on an x86 GPU (we had an NVIDIA RTX 2060 SUPER handy), and we built the vAccelRT backend for an image classification operation. To compare vAccel on AWS firecracker we patched the example imagenet-console application to properly calculate the time of execution and to account for more than 1 iteration. The average execution time for image classification on two sets of Image files (set “*_0.jpg” and “*_1.jpg) are shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cloudkernels.net/static/vaccel_v2/vaccel_bf_0.png#center" alt="vAccel VM execution" title="vaccel-bf-0"></p>

<p>The set above is sorted by the overhead percentage (GUEST vs HOST), while the set below, is sorted by Image size (in KB). One thing to note is that on all cases, the overhead of running an image classification operation in the guest compared to the host is less than 5%.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cloudkernels.net/static/vaccel_v2/vaccel_bf_1.png#center" alt="vAccel VM execution" title="vaccel-bf-1"></p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h2>

<p>So, are you brave (or curious) enough to try it out yourself ? Full disclosure, vAccel is WiP, in terms of software development terms, the project should be considered in a pre-alpha phase. However, since we think the idea is useful, there might be someone willing to try it out. So here we go:</p>

<p>TL;DR
The easy way to try vAccel on AWS Firecracker is to run the docker container bundled with all necessary libraries/tools etc. The only prerequisite is [Docker][<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime">https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime</a>] &amp; nvidia-container-runtime[<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime">https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime</a>] installed.</p>

<p>To fire a VM up try running:</p>

<pre><code>docker run -e LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib -e VACCEL_BACKENDS=/usr/local/lib/libvaccel-jetson.so --rm -it --gpus all --privileged nubificus/jetson-runtime
</code></pre>

<p>Now what the above command does is the following:
- sets up a couple of env vars to let the container know where to find the necessary libraries
- runs in a privileged mode so that /dev/kvm is available to the container instance (we need to boot a VM in there ;))
- provides access to the GPU from the container.</p>

<p>The entrypoint for the above container image (<code>nubificus/jetson-runtime</code>) simply starts a firecracker VM with a pre-built kernel &amp; rootfs.img, available <a href="https://github.com/nubificus/fc-x86-guest-build">here</a>. This repository contains the dockerfile from which these binaries have been produced. You can download ready-made binaries from the <a href="https://github.com/nubificus/fc-x86-guest-build/releases/latest">releases</a> page.</p>

<p>If (for any reason) you want to try out jetson-inference, without the AWS Firecracker VM boot, then just run the container with /bin/bash as an entrypoint, using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>docker run --network=host --rm -it --gpus all --privileged -v nubificus/jetson-runtime /bin/bash
</code></pre>

<h3 id="host">Host</h3>

<p>The current available version of vAccelRT supports the jetson-inference plugin. Adding a new plugin is as easy as linking with vAccelRT and writing the glue code in the plugin directory – more information should be available in the coming weeks!</p>

<p>To use this plugin, the Host machine should have an NVIDIA GPU (supporting CUDA), the relevant drivers installed, as well as <a href="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference">jetson-inference</a> installed.</p>

<p>The next step is to build &amp; install <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/vaccelrt">vAccelRT</a>, the glue that ties everything together. You can build it from source, or just install the binaries available from the <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/vaccelrt/releases/latest">releases</a> page. Make sure you specify <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to the folder where libvaccel.so is located, as well as to choose the necessary backend by setting <code>VACCEL_BACKENDS</code> to <code>libvaccel-jetson.so</code>.</p>

<pre><code>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
export VACCEL_BACKENDS=/usr/local/lib/libvaccel-jetson.so
</code></pre>

<h3 id="vm">VM</h3>

<p>To run a vAccel-enabled VM, we need four basic components:</p>

<ul>
<li>the AWS firecracker VMM (with the vAccel backend patch) <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker">github</a> <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker/releases/latest">releases</a></li>
<li>a firecracker guest Linux kernel supporting modules + the virtio-accel module <a href="https://github.com/nubificus/fc-x86-guest-build">github</a> <a href="https://github.com/nubificus/fc-x86-guest-build/releases/latest">releases</a></li>
<li>the vAccel runtime system (vAccelRT) for the Host and the guest <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/vaccelrt">github</a> <a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/vaccelrt/releases/latest">releases</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To facilitate the process of packing all these software components, we include links to binaries built from the respective github repositories.</p>

<p>Grab, or build <code>vmlinux</code> &amp; the <code>rootfs.img</code> from the links above, and use a template config for firecracker like the following:</p>

<pre><code>{
	"boot-source": {
		"kernel_image_path": "vmlinux",
		"boot_args": "console=ttyS0 reboot=k panic=1 pci=off loglevel=0 root=/dev/vda quiet"
	},
	"drives": [
		{
			"drive_id": "rootfs",
			"path_on_host": "rootfs.img",
			"is_root_device": true,
			"is_read_only": false
		}
	],
	"network-interfaces": [
	{
		"iface_id": "eth0",
		"guest_mac": "AA:FC:00:00:00:01",
		"host_dev_name": "tap"
	}
	],
	"crypto": {
		"crypto_dev_id": "vaccel0",
		"host_crypto_dev": "/dev/vaccel0"
	},
	"machine-config": {
		"vcpu_count": 1,
		"mem_size_mib": 1024,
		"ht_enabled": false
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure vmlinux, rootfs.img are in the same directory as the invocation of the firecracker command. Also, ensure that you have set <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>VACCEL_BACKENDS</code> correctly, and that you’ve downloaded the ML networks needed for inference. This step can be done using <a href="https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/tools/download-models.sh">this script</a>. Just get this script and run:</p>

<pre><code>./download-models.sh NO
</code></pre>

<p>and the models will be placed by default at <code>../data/networks</code>. Change the path in the script if you need to. For the AWS Firecracker backend to work, we need the models in the same directory as the invocation of the firecracker binary, in a folder called networks.</p>

<p>Now, we’re ready to fire up our VM:</p>

<pre><code>firecracker --api-sock …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>While researching <a href="https://actualbudget.com/blog/cursed-caching-curious">a curious caching bug</a>, I got inspired to take another look at how Actual stores data locally on the web. There's some history I need to explain. Years ago, Actual was only going to be a desktop app. That means <em>all</em> of your data is stored locally. No server.</p><p>Then I realized how important mobile is, and that most people don't want to worry about losing their data if they drop their computer in the ocean. A syncing engine was born, and desktop and mobile apps have happily synced their data ever since. A copy is kept on a server so users can login and easily view their data, and if they worry about privacy they can enable <a href="https://actualbudget.com/docs/overview/syncing-across-devices/#end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption</a>.</p><p>In the last year I grew jealous of web apps. Look at how easily they can deploy… how quickly they can drop users right into the app. No install required. Here I am asking users to download an 80MB file just to run the app. That download absolutely kills conversion rates, and makes the login flow, support, a/b testing and <em>everything</em> much harder.</p><p>I love desktop apps because you have access to much better tech (like native sqlite3), the app is super fast (no network calls), and the user owns their data. However, I can't ignore that the benefits of the web <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/09/05/desktop-aps-versus-web-apps/">dwarfs these advantages</a>.</p><p>I started thinking about a web version of Actual. After some hacking, <a href="https://app.actualbudget.com/">I got it working</a> without changing the architecture. That means all your data is still stored locally in the browser, and there are no network calls. It's a completely 100% "local" app in the browser [0].</p><p>I haven't marketed the web version much because it hasn't been tested enough, and it needs improvements like lazy loading code to make it load faster. The biggest thing I'm worried about is the data storage layer. Since <strong>all your data is local</strong>, if something goes wrong there you could potentially lose data. And we're really stressing the browser's persistant db by storing everything in it.</p><p>To be clear: <strong>we are not deprecating the desktop version</strong>. However in the future the web version will be the primary platform, with the choice to download the desktop version if desired.</p><p>The way it works a bit unusual. Here's a high-level overview:</p><ul><li>Actual uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite3</a>. This is a hard requirement. The app runs tons of complex SQL queries to aggregate financial data and it's so good at doing it. Queries are easy to express and run super fast.</li><li>On desktop and mobile, native sqlite3 is used. The web does not support sqlite3, however. To get around this, Actual uses a <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">wasm version</a> of sqlite3 and creates an in-memory db.</li><li>The obvious problem is persistence. When you make changes, we need to persist them somewhere so when the user reloads they don't lose their data. Luckily we are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type#State-based_CRDTs">state-based CRDT's</a> and all updates come through as a list of "messages". If you are online, these messages get synced to our server so when you reload, all your data should sync up.</li><li>It's not ideal to require a big sync every time you open the app though. Also, if you are offline there shouldn't be any chance of losing data. To solve this, Actual persists each message into IndexedDB. When the app opens, it applies all messages from the local IndexedDB to get up-to-date.</li><li>It's <em>still</em> not ideal to require applying any messages on load. It won't scale - if you use the app for months you'll accumulate tens of thousands of messages. IndexedDB would grow indefinitely and loading the app would get slower. To solve this, when the stored messages crosses a threshold it flushes the entire sqlite3 db to IndexedDB and clears all the messages.</li><li>That means both a binary representation of the sqlite3 db and a list of messages is persisted in IndexedDB. On load, the app creates the in-memory sqlite3 db from the snapshot and applies any remaining messages from IDB.</li></ul><p>Turns out this is similar to how a <a href="https://sqlite.org/wal.html">write-ahead log</a> works.</p><p>I was worried about the reliability of IndexedDB. Reading the docs it seems like browsers might delete databases as needed, but in practice this doesn't seem to happen [1]. It's probably a much bigger problem on mobile where memory is scarce, but I don't mess with the mobile web (use a native app instead). I was also worried about hitting the limit of IDB storage, but as explained next that hasn't been a problem.</p><p>This technique started as an experiment, but it has worked surprisingly well. I have 5 years worth of data in Actual, and the size of the sqlite3 db is 9.7MB. The threshold of the messages table is around 50KB, so in total I'm storing ~10MB in IndexedDB for a user who's been around for 5 years. It's not even close to hitting the IndexedDB max storage limit, which these days is at least 500MB.</p><p>While it has worked so far, I want to be 100% confident in this approach. I've been digging deep into how each browser stores IndexedDB data on disk and discovered a couple improvements I can make. I was going to write about them in this post, but I ended up writing more about the overall approach. In the next post I'll dig deep into how IndexedDB works across browsers.</p><p>[0] While I didn't talk about it in this post, this also means that the entire app runs in the browser. The "backend" runs in a background worker thread and everything happens locally.</p><p>[1] If the local data does somehow get corrupted or deleted, it's not a <em>huge</em> deal. All changes are still sent off and stored on a server (which is how all other devices get synced). If something goes wrong, the app can re-download your data from the server. The only case where you'd lose data is if you were offline and lost your local data, which is to be expected.</p></div></div></div>]]>

December 4, 2020 | https://dotink.co/posts/histools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dotink.co/posts/histools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

        <p>Today I made <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/histools"><strong>Histools</strong></a>, a small set of tools for visualizing browser history data from Apple’s Safari browser. It renders a heatmap of pages visited on Safari over time, alongside a searchable, sorted list of pages I’ve visited most often with mini-heatmaps for each URL.</p>
<p><img src="https://dotink.co/img/histools.png" alt="Histools screenshot"></p>
<p>Histools is built on my homebrew tech stack: Ink for the analysis script and server and the Torus UI library for the interactive visualizations. If you want to run Histools over your own Safari history file, you can find the how-to’s in the GitHub readme linked here. In the rest of this post, I want to explore how Safari stores its history entries on disk.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/histools">See Histools on GitHub →</a></p>
<h2 id="inspecting-safaris-history-database">Inspecting Safari’s history database</h2>
<p>Histools works by transforming history data from the database into a format that can be usefully visualized on a heatmap. In macOS Catalina, Safari keeps history in a simple SQLite3 database, at <code>~/Library/Safari/History.db</code>. So the first step for me was to copy this database file out to a safe location, and open the sqlite shell to look at the database schema.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite History.db ".schema"
</code></pre><p>This returns us all of the table definitions, which you can also check out <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/histools/blob/main/meta/History.schema.sql">here</a>. For the sake of looking at history, we’re only really concerned with two tables: <code>history_items</code> and <code>history_visits</code>. Here’s what those tables looks like.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE history_items
(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY autoincrement,
    url text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    domain_expansion text NULL,
    visit_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    daily_visit_counts BLOB NOT NULL,
    weekly_visit_counts BLOB NULL,
    autocomplete_triggers BLOB NULL,
    should_recompute_derived_visit_counts INTEGER NOT NULL,
    visit_count_score                     INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE history_visits
(
    id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY autoincrement,
    history_item INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES history_items(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    visit_time REAL NOT NULL,
    title text NULL,
    load_successful boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    http_non_get    boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    synthesized     boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    redirect_source INTEGER NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES history_visits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    redirect_destination INTEGER NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES history_visits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    origin     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    generation INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    attributes INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    score      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
</code></pre><p>Safari stores new history entries in two different formats, one for efficiently looking through <em>distinct</em> history entries, and one for recording visits, with timestamp information. Namely, <code>history_items</code> stores distinct history entries by their URL, and <code>history_visits</code> stores information Safari expects to change with every visit, like the timestamp, load success state, and (curiously) the page title.</p>
<p>From this schema, we can also see that each history visit points to exactly one history item – there can be one or more visits to the same URL. On each visit, Safari will add a new history visit entry and increment some aggregate information for the corresponding history item, like the total <code>visit_count</code>.</p>
<p>Like any good exploration, the answer to one question also opens up many others. What are the <code>score</code>s next to each page? What’s a <code>synthesized</code> visit? What are <code>autocomplete_triggers</code> used for? I haven’t had a chance to dive into those yet, because there’s also plenty of fun to be had playing around with the Histools visualization itself. From the heatmap, I can see when I go to sleep each day and when I wake up in the morning (or the few times I was woken up overnight). I can see when my homework was due, when I was researching certain topics, and so on and on and on.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to spinning up Histools from time to time to get another perspective on how I’ve been using the Web in my life.</p>

  <strong>﻿By Mikko Haapoja and Stephan Leroux</strong>

<p>
  2020 Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) is over, and another BFCM Globe has
  shipped. We’re extremely proud of the globe, it focused on realism,
  performance, and the impact our merchants have on the world.
</p>

<p>
  We knew we had a tall task in front of us this year, building something that
  could represent orders from our one million merchants in just two months. Not
  only that, we wanted to ship a data visualization for our merchants so they
  could have a similar experience to the BFCM globe every day in their Live
  View.
</p>

  <figcaption>Prototypes for the 2020 BFCM Globe and Live View. **</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  With tight timelines and an ambitious initiative, we immediately jumped into
  prototypes with three.js and planned our architecture.
</p>

<p>
  As we planned this project, we converged architecturally on the idea of
  layers. Each layer is similar to a React component where state is minimally
  shared with the rest of the application, and each layer encapsulates its own
  functionality. This allowed for code reuse and flexibility to build both the
  Live View Globe, BFCM Globe, and beyond.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D56O11Y46o0?playlist=D56O11Y46o0&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

</figure>
<p>
  When realism is key, it’s always best to lean on fantastic artists, and that’s
  where
  <a href="https://twitter.com/byrondelgado" target="_blank" title="Byron Delgado on Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Byron Delgado</a>
  came in. We hoped that Byron would be able to use the 3D modeling tools he’s
  used to, and then we would incorporate his 3D models into our experience. This
  is where the <code>EarthRealistic</code> layer comes in.
</p>
<figure>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4oeDV4rNQo?playlist=N4oeDV4rNQo&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
  <figcaption>
    <code>EarthRealistic</code> layer from the 2020 BFCM Globe. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  <code>EarthRealistic</code> uses a technique called physically based
  rendering, which most modern 3D modeling software supports. In three.js,
  physically based rendering is implemented via the
  <code>MeshPhysicalMaterial</code> or
  <code>MeshStandardMaterial</code> materials.
</p>
<p>
  To achieve realistic lighting, <code>EarthRealistic</code> is lit by a 32bit
  EXR Environment Map. By using a 32bit EXR, it means we can have smooth image
  based lighting. Image based lighting is a technique where a “360 sphere” is
  created around the 3D scene, and pixels in that image are used to calculate
  how bright Triangles on 3D models should be. This allows for complex lighting
  setups without much effort from an artist. Traditionally images on the web
  such as JPGs and PNGs have a color depth of 8bits. If we were to use these
  formats and 8bit color depth, our globe lighting would have had horrible
  gradient banding, missing realism entirely.
</p>

<p>
  Once we converged on physically based rendering and image based lighting,
  building the carbon offset layer became clearer. Literally!
</p>

<p>
  Bubbles have an interesting phenomenon where they can be almost opaque at a
  certain angle and light intensity but in other areas completely transparent.
  To achieve this look, we created a custom material based on
  MeshStandardMaterial that reads in an Environment Map and simulates the bubble
  lighting phenomenon. The following is the easiest way to achieve this with
  three.js:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a custom Material class that extends off of MeshStandardMaterial.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a custom Vertex or Fragment Shader and define any Uniforms for that
    Shader Program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Override
    <code>onBeforeCompile(shader: Shader, _renderer: WebGLRenderer): void&nbsp;</code>on your custom Material and pass the custom Vertex or Fragment Shader and
    uniforms via the Shader instance.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Here’s our implementation of the above for the Carbon Offset Shield Material:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShopifyEng/5e8bfa0de5630779ad7350c7a73cb650" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ShieldMaterial.ts</a>

    - Abstraction on top of MeshStandardMaterial
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShopifyEng/cc1679cfb054f85c8689037e5d168f68" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">shield.frag</a>
    - Custom Fragment shaders that make MeshStandardMaterial look like a bubble
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Let’s look at the above, starting with our Fragment shader. In shield.frag
  lines 94-97
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  These two lines are all that are needed to achieve a bubble effect in a
  fragment shader.
</p>
<p>
  To calculate the <code>brightness</code> of an rgb pixel, you calculate the
  length or magnitude of the pixel using the GLSL length function. In three.js
  shaders, <code>outgoingLight</code> is an RGB <code>vec3</code> representing
  the outgoing light or pixel to be rendered.
</p>
<p>
  If you remember from earlier, the bubble’s brightness determines how
  transparent or opaque it should appear.&nbsp; After calculating brightness, we can
  set the outgoing pixel’s alpha based on the brightness calculation. Here we
  use the GLSL <code>mix</code> function to go between the expected alpha of the
  pixel defined by <code>diffuseColor.a</code> and a new custom uniform defined
  as <code>maxOpacity</code>. By having the concept of min or expected opacity
  and max opacity, Byron and other artists can tweak visuals to their exact
  liking.
</p>
<p>
  If you look at our shield.frag file, it may seem daunting! What on earth is
  all of this code?&nbsp; three.js materials handle a lot of functionality, so it’s
  best to make small additions and not modify existing code. three.js materials
  all have their own shaders defined in the
  <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib/" target="_blank" title="ShaderLib folder in three.js repo" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ShaderLib folder</a>. To extend a three.js material, you can grab the original material shader
  code from the <code>src/renderers/shaders/ShaderLib/</code> folder in the
  three.js repo and perform any custom calculations before setting
  <code>gl_FragColor</code>. An easier option to access three.js shader code is
  to simply <code>console.log</code> the <code>shader.fragmentShader</code> or
  <code>shader.vertexShader</code> strings, which are exposed in the
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> function:
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> runs immediately before the Shader Program is
  created on the GPU. Here you can override shaders and uniforms.
  CustomMeshStandardMaterial.ts is an abstraction we wrote to make creating
  custom materials easier. It overrides the
  <code>onBeforeCompile</code> function and manages uniforms while your
  application runs via the
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShopifyEng/5a0c15b0c83ed00b66267b93994714cf#file-custommeshstandardmaterial-ts-L51" target="_blank" title="setCustomUniform in CustomMeshStandardMaterial.ts" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>setCustomUniform</code></a>
  and

  functions. You can see this in action in our custom Shield Material when
  getting and setting <code>maxOpacity</code>:

<h2>Using Particles to Display Orders</h2>

    Displaying orders on Shopify from across the world using particles. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  One of the BFCM globe’s main features is the ability to view orders happening
  in real-time from our merchants and their buyers worldwide. Given Shopify’s
  scale and amount of orders happening during BFCM, it’s challenging to visually
  represent all of the orders happening at any given time. We wanted to find a
  way to showcase the sheer volume of orders our merchants receive over this
  time in both a visually compelling and performant way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In the past, we used visual “arcs” to display the connection between a buyer’s
  and a merchant’s location.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="The BFCM Globe from 2018 showing orders using visual arcs." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/old-globe.jpg?v=1607052787" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/old-globe.jpg?v=1607052787">
  <figcaption>
    The BFCM Globe from 2018 showing orders using visual arcs.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  With thousands of orders happening every minute, using arcs alone to represent
  every order quickly became a visual mess along with a heavy decrease in
  framerate. One solution was to cap the number of arcs we display, but this
  would only allow us to display a small fraction of the orders we were
  processing. Instead, we investigated using a particle-based solution to help
  fill the gap.
</p>
<p>With particles, we wanted to see if we could:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Handle thousands of orders at any given time on screen.</li>
  <li>Maintain 60 frames per second on low-end devices.</li>
  <li>
    Have the ability to customize style and animations per order, such as
    visualizing local and international orders.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  From the start, we figured that rendering geometry per an order wouldn't scale
  well if we wanted to have thousands of orders on screen. Particles appear on
  the globe as highlights, so they don’t necessarily need to have a 3D
  perspective. Rather than using triangles for each particle, we began our
  investigation using three.js <code>Points</code> as a start, which allowed us
  to draw using dots instead. Next, we needed an efficient way to store data for
  each particle we wanted to render. Using <code>BufferGeometry</code>, we
  assigned custom attributes that contained all the information we needed for
  each particle/order.
</p>
<figure>
  
</figure>
<p>
  To render the points and make use of our attributes, we created a
  <code>ShaderMaterial</code>, and custom vertex and fragment shaders. Most of
  the magic for rendering and animating the particles happens inside the vertex
  shader. Each particle defined in the attributes we pass to our
  <code>BufferGeometry</code> goes through a series of steps and
  transformations.
</p>
<p>
  First, each particle has a starting and ending location described using
  latitude and longitude. Since we want the particle to travel along the surface
  and not through it, we use a geo interpolation function on our coordinates to
  find a path that goes along the surface.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="A photo of a globe with an order represented as a particle traveling from New York City to London. The vertex shader uses each location’s latitude and longitude and determines the path it needs to travel." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-1.jpg?v=1607053616" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-1.jpg?v=1607053616">

    The vertex shader uses each location’s latitude and longitude and determines
    the path it needs to travel. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Next, to give the particle height along its path, we use high school geometry,
  a parabola equation based on time to alter the straight path to a curve.
</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="A photo of a globe with particles that follow a curved path away from the earth’s surface using a parabola equation to determine its height." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-2.jpg?v=1607053702" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/particle-diagram-2.jpg?v=1607053702">
  <figcaption>
    Particles follow a curved path away from the earth’s surface using a
    parabola equation to determine its height. **
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  To render the particle to make it look 3D in its travels, we combine our
  height and projected path data then convert it to a vector position our shader
  uses as it’s <code>gl_Position</code>. With our particle now knowing where it
  needs to go, using a <code>time</code> uniform, we drive animations for other
  changes such as size and color. At the end of the vertex shader, we pass the
  position and point size to render onto the fragment shader that combines the
  calculated color and alpha at the time for each particle.

<p>I’m starting at a new company on Monday so I’ve been panic-reading management and leadership books. I’ve boiled a lot of that advice down into this week by week plan.</p>



<p><em>Important caveat: “plans are useless, but planning is indispensable” and all that. Stay flexible, shift things around as needed, don’t hold off on something that needs to happen just because it’s not in the plan, blah blah blah.</em></p>



<p><strong>Week 1</strong>: Find someone, anyone, and grab a 30 minute call with them. Here’s the agenda (stolen from <a href="https://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start">this post</a>):</p>



<ul><li>“Tell me everything you think I should know.” – 25 minutes</li><li>“What are the biggest challenges the team has right now?” – 3 minutes</li><li>“Who else should I talk to?” – 2 minutes</li></ul>



<p>Next, repeat that process with all of the names you get from that last question, and <em>keep repeating with every name you get until you run out of new names</em>. That should get you a nice jump start on knowledge transfer. You may even find a few easy problems to solve for quick wins.</p>



<p><strong>Weeks 1-3</strong>: Listen in on regular meetings and ask lots of questions. Don’t shy away from asking for clarification on things asynchronously after the meeting is over. And remember, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/17/stop-trying-to-be-impressive-start-trying-to-be-warm/">be warm, not impressive</a>.</p>



<p>Don’t start 1-1s yet, and don’t try to do anything useful. Your goal for weeks 1-3 is to meet as many people as you can and learn as much as you can.</p>



<p>Also, sometime in weeks 1-3, start asking about any <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">shared measurable goals</a> for the team. How do you know if you’re succeeding? How is your impact being measured? Do those measures exist? If they don’t exist, then we’ll come back to this in a few weeks.</p>



<p><strong>Week 3</strong>: Send an email or a group chat message about starting 1-1s and list some available times so that people can choose the times that are best for them. Mention the format you plan to use so they can prep.</p>



<p><strong>Week 4</strong>: Start having weekly 1-1s. You won’t be giving any feedback in these 1-1s (or elsewhere) for a few more weeks. So for now your job is to get to know your directs and to support them however they need.</p>



<p><strong>Week 8</strong>: If the team already has measurable goals related to impact and business outcomes, then skip this step. Otherwise, now is the time to start figuring out what those goals should be. I talked about this in “<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">The 2 responsibilities of a&nbsp;manager</a>.”</p>



<p><strong>Week 12</strong>: Now that you have 3 months under your belt, fill out <a href="https://gist.github.com/mikecrittenden/faf2e60282912a809f1aac1423116268">the assessment at the end of “The Five Dysfunctions of a Team”</a>. That should give you a sense of which, if any, dysfunctions to focus on.</p>



<p>Also, start giving positive feedback. Send an email or group message letting people know that you’re going to start this, and tell them about <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/26/5-second-feedback/">the format it’ll follow</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Weeks 12-20</strong>: Give only positive feedback, early and often. To start, aim to give 1 piece of positive feedback to someone everyday, then increase it from there. Build up to a steady stream.</p>



<p><strong>Week 20</strong>: Now that you hopefully have earned some trust, you can start also giving negative feedback. Let your reports know ahead of time that it’s coming so they won’t be caught off guard. And remember, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/27/future-focused-feedback/">don’t debate the past</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Week 30</strong>: By now you’ve been giving feedback for a while, so you should have a good sense of where to add <a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/2009/07/coaching-model-revised">more formal coaching</a>. Set goals with your reports and talk through a granular step by step plan for achieving it.</p>



<p>And just like that, you’re more than half a year in. You’re on your own from here. Good luck!</p>

But lets go one step further...</p><p>Being granted permission to send an email to a persons inbox <strong>should be treated as a privilege</strong>, and we should respect their right to easily deny us that permission at any time and for any reason.</p><p>This means we must provide an unsubscribe link within each email that is accessible to the recipient, this link should ideally unsubscribe in <em>one-click</em> and not require any additional steps.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote>Being granted permission to send an email to a persons inbox should be treated as a privilege</blockquote><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The best way to do this is to provide an "unsubscribe" link in the email body. This should be clear and purposeful by;</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Using clear language
<ul>
<li>"Click here to unsubscribe" is good</li>

<ul>
<li>Make your unsubscribe link obvious</li>
<li>Keep the contrast ratio high - eg don't use light grey text on a white background. This is not cool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If possible, it's also good to provide a machine-readable <code>List-Unsubscribe</code> header with every email (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2369.txt">RFC 2369</a>). This allows automated tools to help your recipients unsubscribe. The URL in the List-Unsubscribe can be the same as the one you use in your unsubscribe link in the email body.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>List-Unsubscribe:

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In case this doesn't go without saying, if a recipient unsubscribes from your mailing list then you should not send them any more emails from that address!</p><p>P.S. Recently I've seen more mailing lists including an unsubscribe link at the top of the email as well as at the bottom. This seems like a great idea.</p><p>There should be no doubt why someone is receiving your email, or how frequently they should expect it. It sucks to receive an email but not know why.</p><p>I understand that recipients may forget that they signed up for your service or to receive your newsletter (especially if it is not sent frequently), so make the intent of the email clear at the start. For example, by leading the content with the sentence "You are receiving this email because you signed up for an account on example.com".</p><p>Newsletter creators, if you sent emails on a schedule then let your recipient know when they will receive your next email.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/12/image.png"><figcaption>Here's how we manage this in some of our recurring emails</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>There's also an email header for this as well, the <code>List-Help</code> header.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Probably the most controversial point I need to make - emails should not contain spy-pixels/pixel-trackers or any other mechanism that measures open-rates.</p><p>I know it's nice to see how many people are opening your emails, but since this tracking can be done without the consent of the recipient, it should be considered a violation of privacy. Requiring recipients to disable images in their email client in order to not be tracked is <strong>not </strong>acceptable.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png"><figcaption>Read tracking can be crazy intrusive (image courtesy of the SuperHuman exposé last year)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If you wish to see if recipients are engaging with your emails, then provide actionable elements for them. For example, clicking a link in the email is easily measurable, shows engagement, and is less intrusive.</p><p>Ideally, I think it would be nice to return to mainly plaintext emails, with a few embedded images here and there. Embedded images don't have to be fetched from an external server, and thus can't be used for tracking purposes. I <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesIvings/status/1334796362416877569">tweeted some info</a> on how to embed images recently if you want more info on this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>I think these 4 points cover most shady email practices, a good start!</p><p>None of this is governed by any specific law, but a bunch of it probably falls under either CAN-SPAM or GDPR email regulations. </p><p>That said, governments have been consistently slow to react with regards to protecting online privacy and barely enforce any protections they have managed to pass. So I think the best way forward is encourage email senders to act ethically, and as consumers, point out ethical violations and not do business with those who do not meet our standards wherever possible.</p><p>There's a long way to go in this space, and I want to explore it in the open with as much feedback as possible. My first draft of an <em>Ethical Email Manifesto</em> that we will be following at my company is <a href="https://github.com/leavemealone-app/ethical-email-manifesto">public on GitHub</a> and open to contributions.</p><p>If you want to support this movement and tell the world you're an "ethical email sender", then <a href="https://github.com/leavemealone-app/ethical-email-manifesto/issues">open an issue</a> and we'll add your company as a signatory to the document ❤</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Agree (or disagree) with me about any of this?

<div id="sites-canvas-main-content">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div><div dir="ltr"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am widely credited as the inventor of the &lt;blink&gt; tag. &nbsp; For those of you who are relatively new to the Web, the &lt;blink&gt; tag is an HTML command that causes text to blink, and many, many people find its behavior to be extremely annoying. &nbsp;&nbsp; I won't deny the invention, but there is a bit more to the story than is widely known.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in 1994 I was a founding engineer at Netscape, prior to that I had written the Lynx browser, which predated all of the other popular browsers at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynx had been and still is a text only browser and is commonly used in a console window on UNIX machines.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Netscape we were building software that used a graphical user interface and could express vastly more text styles and layouts as well as images and other media.&nbsp;&nbsp; We spent a lot of time thinking about the future of the web and new technologies that would enable new classes of documents, applications and uses. &nbsp;&nbsp; A few examples of those thoughts were, HTML Tables, SSL for secure communications, Plugins for extensions, and JavaScript to enable dynamic HTML.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime in late summer I took a break with some of the other engineers and went to a local bar on Castro street in Mountain View.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bar was the St. James Infirmary and it had a 30 foot wonder woman statue inside among other interesting things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point in the evening I mentioned that it was sad that Lynx was not going to be able to display many of the HTML extensions&nbsp; that we were proposing,&nbsp; I also pointed out that the only text style that Lynx could exploit given its environment was blinking text.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a pretty good laugh at the thought of blinking text, and talked about blinking this and that and how absurd the whole thing would be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evening progressed pretty normally from there, with a fair amount more drinking and me meeting the girl who would later become my first wife. </p><p>&nbsp; Saturday morning rolled around and I headed into the office only to find what else but, blinking text.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was on the screen blinking in all its glory, and in the browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How could this be, you might ask?&nbsp;&nbsp; It turns out that one of the engineers liked my idea so much that he left the bar sometime past midnight, returned to the office and implemented the blink tag overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was still there in the morning and quite proud of it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time there were 3 versions of the browser that ran on UNIX, Windows and Mac operating systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a short 12 hours the blinking was constrained only to the UNIX version, but it didn't take long for the blinking to spread to Windows and then the Mac version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember thinking that this would be a pretty harmless easter egg, that no one would really use it, but I was very wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we released Netscape Navigator 1.0 we did not document the blink functionality in any way, and for a while all was quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then somewhere, somehow the arcane knowledge of blinking leaked into the real world and suddenly everything was blinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look here", "buy this", "check this out", all blinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Large advertisements blinking in all their glory.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a lot like Las Vegas, except it was on my screen, with no way of turning it off. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, much was said, most of it in the form of flaming posts to various discussion boards, and the &lt;blink&gt; tag will probably be remembered as the most hated of all HTML tags.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to publicly state that at no time did I actually write code or even seriously advocate for the &lt;blink&gt; tag.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that I put forth the initial inspiration, but it really was merely a thought experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not going to name any names of the people who coded the dastardly deed, if they wish to step forward, they will need to do it themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, the thing that I am truly sad about, is that Lynx never did get to blink.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also sad to report that the St James Infirmary burned to the ground in 1997, it was a great place to hang out and will be missed.<br></p><p>&lt;blink&gt; on,</p><p>:lou<br></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>How many of our greatest minds have we lost?</p>
<p>From The Dream Machine (p50) on John Atanasoff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He was determined to build a computing machine… But with all his teaching responsibilities, he’d had very little time to focus on the problem.</strong> Finally, however, on a bitterly cold winter night in late 1937, he just couldn’t take it anymore; he had to get away to concentrate. So he jumped into his car in Ames, Iowa, and drove east through the subzero temperature at more than eighty miles per hour. Almost three hours later, after he crossed the Mississippi River into Illinois, he stopped at a roadhouse to warm up. And there, somewhere between his first and second bourbons, he conceived four crucial ideas to make him computer work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incredible! Atanasoff was busy, but finally got down to doing the thing he really loved, the world recognized his genius, and he was given all the resources he needed to complete his work.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what would have happened in any reasonable society. Instead, we’re told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atanasoff didn’t develop his invention any further, as it happened. Soon after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, he went to the Naval Ordinance Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where he supervised the counting testing of mines. <strong>He never returned to computing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who knows what else he could have given us? Instead, his entire lifetime produces one brief period of real scientific producitivity, bookended by teaching responsibilities and war.</p>
<p>Once you start looking, these stories are everwhere. Here’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix">The Daemon, the Gnu and the Penguin</a> on the invention of Unix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In August 1969, Ken Thompson’s wife Bonnie took their year-old son on a trip to California to show off to their families. As a temporary bachelor, Ken had time to work. “I allocated a week each to the operating system, the shell, the editor and the assembler [he told me]… and during the month she was gone, it was totally rewritten in a form that looked like an operating system”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is a greatly exaggerated myth, but how terrifying would it be if that was true? Is it possible that Thompson was burdened by responsibilities his entire life, and then in a brief moment of freedom did some of the most important work anyone has ever done?</p>
<p>And then from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers#Wilbur">Wikipedia</a>, on Wilbur Wright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, “<strong>When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad</strong>, but it is always easier to deal with things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why on earth not? Why couldn’t Wilbur Wright, now admired as one of history’s greatest investors, find time to continue his most important work? The story continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters… He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would “come home white”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then finally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After returning to Dayton in early May 1912, worn down in mind and body, he fell ill again and was diagnosed with typhoid fever. He lingered on, his symptoms relapsing and remitting for many days. Wilbur died, at age 45, at the Wright family home on May 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were some of the most brilliant minds we had, and they were each nearly unable to fulfil even a tiny fraction of their potential. We should ask how much more each of them could have accomplished, but also how much we’ve lost from would-be inventors unable to find even a month of genuine free time with which to pursue their dreams. And of course, how many have been effectively barred from research by poverty or discrimination.</p>
<p>What hits me hardest is not the material loss, but the squandering of human spirit. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/115154289">Bret Victor once explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that a dog has to be allowed the full free expression of its entire range of capabilities. Sticking him in a cage or constraining his range of experience, you’re not letting him do all the things that dogs can do. And this is exactly what we’ve done to ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the stories above strike me not even as tragedies, but as something more inhumane.</p>
<p>My greatest fear is that intelligent life will arrive on earth. It won’t be an invasion, or colonization, or anything horrible. They’ll just sit us down, and ask about the lives of our heroes.</p>
<p>We’ll proudly tell them about this guy Wilbur Wright. How he and his brother invented a machine to fly in the sky as gods. We’ll tell them about our culture of research and innovation, and how Wilbur, self-taught engineer from Ohio, changed the entire world.</p>
<p>And then we’ll have to explain how gruesomely we murdered him.</p>
<p>Not with sticks and stones, but with a barrage of patent lawsuits. We will have to tell the aliens how we used this great system of socially legitimate torture to slowly wear him down over the years.</p>
<p>We will tell them how in the end, poor brilliant Wilbur became old and tired and incapable of producing anything beautiful ever again.</p>
<p>I do not think they will forgive us. I am not sure we should forgive ourselves.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>See Also</strong><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://guzey.com/patronage-and-research-labs/">Reviving Patronage and Revolutionary Industrial Research</a></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Yes, I understand that Wilbur also sued people. I’m not claiming that he was a good person. My point is that in a humane world, no part of this story would even be possible.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every day I get up, I find it hard to keep up the momentum. Things don't happen as I expected. When I publish a piece of content, I expect many people would consume it. But it doesn't. Although it's fun to create content and express my creativity, I'm sometimes frustrated because it doesn't get any engagement.</p>
<p>I have to motivate myself to keep going. I have watched an anime series recently. It's Run with the Wind. The series is about a group of 10 college students who are trying to take part in a marathon contest. They don't have any experience in running and have to run 5km in 16 minutes to meet the qualification. After all, they meet the qualification and take part in the contest. They get in the top 10.</p>
<p>There are many inspiring quotes in the series. I rewatch it 3 times and will watch one more time. These quotes help to motivate me. I find myself in the series. I am doing what I like and happy with it. But I can't be happy all the time. My process is not always linear. </p>
<p>To motivate myself, I choose to consume other creator's content. I read blogs and books, watch videos and anime. While consuming content, I can have new ideas for my content. It also inspires me to keep going because if they can, me too.</p>

<p>For authors, deciding between Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP is not always a straightforward answer. </p>



<p>I’ve been a huge advocate of Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) for several years now, and most of my books are published on that platform. </p>



<p>However, I decided to self publish my latest book on Gumroad, and I wanted to share my thoughts about which one I think is best for authors.</p>



<p>I have also gathered some insights from other authors who have used one or both platforms.</p>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Quick Summary</h2>



<p>This is a <em>really </em>long post (3,900+ words, which will take you around 17 minutes to read), so here’s the TL;DR version if you don’t have a lot of time:</p>



<p>Both Amazon and Gumroad have some advantages and disadvantages for authors. And what works best depends on your objective and on your current situation.</p>



<p>If you want to <strong>maximize profits</strong>, already have a <strong>fairly large audience</strong>, and <strong>have the time and energy</strong> to direct traffic to your book, then <strong>Gumroad </strong>is the best option for you.</p>



<p>If you care more about <strong>brand value</strong>, have a <strong>smaller audience</strong>, and want to <strong>rely more on organic traffic/ reach</strong> for readers to find your book, then <strong>Amazon KDP</strong> is the best option for you.</p>



<p>You can, of course, publish on both platforms at the same time, but there are some considerations that you have to factor in.</p>



<p>Here are some more details about the advantages and disadvantages of each, and which one wins in each category.</p>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Fees &amp; Royalties</h2>



<p>Let’s start with a foundational question. What are the fees you have to pay and royalties (i.e. profit margins) you get on each platform?</p>



<h3>Amazon KDP</h3>



<p>With Amazon, you can publish your book for free (i.e. there are no listing fees), and there are no monthly fees. Your royalties fall between <strong>35%</strong> and <strong>70%</strong>, depending on the book’s price point. </p>



<p>If you list your book’s price between <strong>$2.99</strong> and <strong>$9.99</strong>, then you’ll get a <strong>70%</strong> royalty (i.e., your profit is 70% of the book’s price point).</p>



<p>However, if you list your book’s price between<strong> $0.99 </strong>(lowest price allowed) and <strong>$2.99 </strong>or between<strong> $9.99</strong> and <strong>$200.00</strong> (highest price allowed), then you’ll get a <strong>35%</strong> royalty (i.e., you only get paid 35% of the book’s price point).</p>



<p>In other words, Amazon tries to incentivize you to price your book between <strong>$2.99 and $9.99</strong> because that’s a sweet spot for sales. </p>



<p><em>Note: This applies to the ebook (i.e. Kindle) version of your book’s price point. The paperback version on Amazon has a different royalty structure.</em><br></p>



<h3>Gumroad</h3>



<p>With Gumroad, you have two options to publish your book. You can do it for free (i.e. no monthly fees), or you can upgrade to a premium account that costs you $10 per month (or $108 per year).</p>



<p>Upgrading to a premium account gives you a few advantages that you can read about <a href="https://gumroad.com/features/pricing">here</a>.</p>



<p>In terms of fees, you pay an <strong>8.5% + $0.30</strong> fee per sale on the free account, and <strong>3.5% + $0.30</strong> fee per sale on the premium account.</p>



<p>In other words, your royalty will be between approximately <strong>91% and 96%</strong> of your book’s price point (which is much higher than Amazon’s <strong>35% to 70%</strong>). </p>



<p>So Gumroad definitely wins here.</p>



<p>Another important factor that plays in Gumroad’s favor is “price anchoring.” Given that Amazon persuades authors to price their book between $2.99 and $9.99, most books are listed within that range, which makes it’s very hard to justify selling a $47 Kindle ebook.</p>



<p>Gumroad doesn’t have that problem.</p>



<h4><strong>Winner</strong>: <strong>Gumroad</strong></h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: eBook Formats</h2>



<p>When you submit your ebook to Amazon, you have to meet their specific guidelines because Amazon converts your book into their proprietary ebook file format. You can format your book using Microsoft Word or by using Amazon’s own tool called “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Create/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18292298011">Kindle Create</a>.” </p>



<p>You can also submit other formats, such as PDF, but those end up causing some formatting challenges when they’re converted to Kindle-specific files.</p>



<p>The way your readers read your Kindle book is either on a Kindle device (e.g., a Kindle Fire Tablet or a Kindle Paperwhite) or on a free Kindle app installed on any other device (e.g., iPhone, iPad, Android phone, computer, etc.). </p>



<p>When you submit your ebook to Gumroad, you basically upload whatever file format your readers will end up downloading. You can also upload multiple files of the same book.</p>



<p>For example, you might want to offer your book in PDF format only.  Or you might want to offer it in PDF, MOBI, ePUB, and HTML. Gumroad basically acts as a document repository and you can upload the same files that you want your customers to view.</p>



<p><em>Note: If you want your Gumroad customers to be able to read your book on their Kindle devices, then make sure you upload the Kindle-friendly MOBI version of your book.</em></p>



<p>Gumroad wins in this category because of the file format flexibility. </p>



<p>For example, I’m writing a new book about <a href="https://www.thecouchmanager.com/home-office-book-launch">how to design a home office</a> and because it’s picture heavy (and the layout needs tweaking) the best format that will work for me is PDF.</p>



<p>And because I wouldn’t be able to do replicate that layout in Amazon without some serious design challenges, I’ll be selling that book exclusively on Gumroad.</p>



<h4>Winner: Gumroad</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Paperback Copies</h2>



<p>Most authors want to (and probably should) sell paperback copies of their book. That’s because some readers still prefer to hold physical copies of books, and it would be a mistake to ignore that potential revenue stream.</p>



<p>Here’s a recent screenshot of revenue from my books. Notice the difference between the ebook and paperback royalties.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="871" height="290" src="https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt="Amazon ebook royalty vs. paperback royalty" srcset="https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png 871w, https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-300x100.png 300w, https://www.writerontheside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-768x256.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px"></figure>



<p>With Amazon, creating a paperback version of your book is very simple. You’ll need to convert your manuscript to a print-ready file (easy to do within Amazon KDP) and then upload a print-ready cover (that you’ll need to have designed).</p>



<p>After you publish, Amazon then simply prints your book as soon as someone orders it (called POD, which stands for print-on-demand) and ships it to them. So you don’t have to worry about inventory or paying for print copies upfront.</p>



<p>Gumroad unfortunately does not provide any of those print-on-demand capabilities, which means that you will not be able to sell any paperback copies of your book.</p>



<p>The only potential alternative is to do this manually by pre-printing copies of your book yourself and then physically sell &amp; ship them when someone makes an order (not very practical, and not very cheap). </p>



<h4>Winner: Amazon KDP</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Organic Reach</h2>



<p>Organic reach is about how people find your book and how effectively each platform recommends it. </p>



<p>With Amazon, over <strong>95%</strong> of my book sales come from organic sales. In other words, it’s mostly from Amazon’s own algorithm. I don’t get a lot of sales from my own efforts of directing people to buy my books. </p>



<p><em>Note: Amazon does not disclose any data about statistics or traffic sources, so I couldn’t give you exact numbers. However, I do track my own sales channels through affiliate links to my books, and that’s why I can estimate organic sales at around 95%.</em></p>



<p>With Gumroad, it’s almost the exact opposite. For sales of my last book, only around <strong>7%</strong> of the sales came in from Gumroad’s organic reach, and <strong>93%</strong> came from my own direct efforts, so I have to do a lot more marketing to sell those books. </p>



<p>So for me, Amazon wins because of three reasons. </p>



<p>First, I can depend a bit more on sales as passive income and I don’t have to constantly market my books.</p>



<p>Second, the volume of readers and traffic on Amazon is much higher than the volume on Gumroad.</p>



<p>Third, Amazon has a sophisticated search algorithm that recommends books to readers based on recent events or on their search/ purchase history.</p>



<p>And all three factors converged for me during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>I wrote a book around 6 years ago (called “<em><a href="https://amzn.to/2EAeP7I">Influencing Virtual Teams</a></em>“) and it was making around $200 a month. Then, during the pandemic, there was a sudden spike in interest about remote work, and the book ended up making 10X that amount in a couple of those months. </p>



<p>Although Amazon wins in this category, I do have to give Gumroad two advantages here. First, they are open about their sales sources, so I can get much better statistics. And second, I made over <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/final-results-3294usd-in-30-days-from-the-book-part-9/">$3,294 in sales in one month</a> from one book, so the higher price-point of the book could pay off for you.</p>



<h4>Winner: Amazon KDP</h4>







<h2>Gumroad vs. Amazon KDP: Reader Emails</h2>



<p>An essential feature for authors is the ability to collect emails from their customers. There are many reasons why, but in summary, it’s to be able to stay in touch with readers and build a relationship with them so you can sell other books (or products/ services) down the line. </p>



<p>Amazon does not give authors the capability to view any of those email addresses. In fact, authors have absolutely no visibility about who their customers are. There is a workaround, where authors can offer customers a freebie in exchange for their email address, but that takes <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/how-to-collect-email-addresses-from-readers/">a bit of effort to set up</a>, and you’ll still not capture 100% of your customers.</p>



<p>Gumroad not only gives you your customers’ information (including email addresses), but it also allows you to communicate with them through Gumroad’s email messaging system directly. You can even export those email addresses and import them into your email management system (such as <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/aweber" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWeber</a>) if you’d like to. So it’s a no brainer that Gumroad wins here.</p>











<h2>Gumroad vs Amazon KDP: Listing Your Book for Free</h2>



<p>Some authors like the idea of offering one or more of their books for free to help them with branding and even making <a href="https://www.writerontheside.com/ep-025-getting-200x-more-downloads-by-offering-your-book-for-free/">money indirectly</a>. </p>



<p>With Amazon, you can list your book for free on a limited basis only (for 5 days every 90 day period if you’re enrolled in <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/select" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KDP Select</a>).  You can also list it as a “Permanently Free” book, but that’s not a simple process.</p>



<p>However, if you are able to list your book for free on Amazon, you’ll get the advantage of the high volume of traffic. I listed one of my books …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he Indiranagar 100-Feet Road is the commercial heart of India’s technology capital Bangalore, lined with international brand stores, bars, restaurants, and food courts. Owning retail space here, alongside consumer giant Reliance Digital and German footwear brand Puma, is a marker of success for brands breaking into mainstream consciousness. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi’s two-story, 6,000-square-foot flagship store is right at the heart of the district. Behind its saffron frontage is a showcase for its as-yet-unlaunched handsets, televisions, laptops, fitness bands, e-scooters, and water purifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, the store had a complete facelift. A new logo was put on the front of the building that read: “Made In India.” By August, the interior had been decorated with tricolored balloons in the green, white, and orange of the Indian flag. Along the walls, a company timeline showed the history of Xiaomi’s manufacturing operations in India. Mentions of the company’s heritage — it was founded in Beijing in 2010 — disappeared. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/xiaomi-puts-up-made-in-india-banner-outside-stores-to-counter-boycott-china-campaign-1692633-2020-06-25">Hundreds</a> of the company’s stores across the country underwent the same transformation. “Super proud to share that majority of our TVs are #MadeInIndia! We employ thousands of team members across our India factories #ProudIndian,” <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1276052185638252544?s=20">tweeted</a> Manu Kumar Jain, the India head of Xiaomi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anti-China sentiment had already been rising in India’s heartlands before a skirmish in June in a disputed Himalayan border region left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Nationalists started <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bharat-mata-and-chinese-tvs-a-tale-of-boycotting-goods-from-china">smashing</a> Chinese-made televisions; one minister called for shutting down <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/restaurants-and-hotels-that-sell-chinese-food-should-be-shut-down-union-minister-ramdas-athawale/videoshow/76442910.cms">Chinese restaurants</a>. A few weeks after the skirmish, the Indian government banned TikTok, along with hundreds of Chinese apps, and, in August, passed an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55642551-f6e8-4f9d-b5ba-a12d2fc26ef9">unofficial</a> order to phase out dependence on Chinese telecom equipment, including 5G networks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a special appearance on television encouraging Indians to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmx92Q_kQ4">“vocal” in their support for “local” products</a>, creating the #vocalforlocal slogan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chinese smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi — who made up 81% of the Indian market — were left in a precarious position after the clash. Right-wing groups gathered outside Oppo’s factory in the outskirts of Delhi and <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/jun/20/anti-china-demonstration-held-outside-oppo-factory-in-greater-noida-32-protesters-booked-2159224.html">burnt effigies of Xi Jinping</a>, as they demanded that the plant be closed. Some companies battened down the hatches, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/chinese-brands-endorsers-may-go-slow-on-promotions-some-pull-out-ads-some-plan-to-play-up-make-in-india-credentials/articleshow/76429828.cms?from=mdr">suspending their prime-time advertising campaigns</a>. Vivo <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ipl-title-sponsor-vivo-pulls-out-of-tournament-this-year-amid-row-2274036">pulled out</a> as the title sponsor of the country’s biggest sporting event, the Indian Premier League cricket competition, after an aggressive campaign against it on social media. Stray protests took place outside some Xiaomi stores, as threats of vandalism loomed large and mobile shipments from China were <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/smartphone-makers-in-panic-mode-over-stranded-shipments/76536342">stalled for manual inspection at Indian ports</a>.</p>



<p>But while other Chinese brands retreated from the limelight, Xiaomi pursued a unique — and potentially high-risk — strategy: It presented itself as not being Chinese after all, but Indian. Jain, its figurehead in India, took to television, newspapers, and social media to talk up the company’s all-Indian local leadership team and the thousands of jobs it had created in manufacturing and retail. “We are more Indian than anyone else,” Jain told <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1274316181235568645?lang=en">CNBC-TV18</a>. The company even donated money to the families of soldiers “<a href="https://www.mi.com/in/service/support/crpffund.html">martyred</a>” in Kashmir.</p>



<p>Jain has proven adept in using social media and his own personal brand to launder Xiaomi’s origins. But the company faces growing pressure in an unstable political environment. Narendra Modi’s government is once again proclaiming its desire to bring manufacturing back to India, offering <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-10/india-mulls-23-billion-package-to-lure-global-manufacturers?sref=QYWxDQ1o">lavish incentives</a> for export-led manufacturers, which may help once-moribund local phone brands. Xiaomi has indeed moved some of its production onshore, but the core components of its devices are still made in China. With the country’s nationalist surge unlikely to end soon, Jain and Xiaomi will eventually have to face up to the question: How Indian is Indian enough?</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Jain, 39, “is</strong> the Indian middle-class dream personified,” in the words of a former colleague. As a child, he lived in Meerut in northern India, alongside 150 members of his extended family, in an isolated housing compound inside a military quarters built by his great grandfather. “I had never even been exposed to the outside world,” Jain says.</p>



<p>After studying at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology and at the Indian Institute of Management business school, he joined the global consulting firm McKinsey.</p>



<p>Jain’s early career in technology was successful but low profile. He quit McKinsey in 2012 to launch e-commerce portal Jabong.com, which was sold to SoftBank-backed (now Walmart-owned) rival Flipkart for $70 million in 2016. By then, Jain had already moved on to <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/Jabong%E2%80%99s-former-MD-switches-attention-to-wearable-smart-devices/article20718785.ece#">start a short-lived wearables company</a>. In 2014, he became Xiaomi India’s first hire, recruited by Hugo Barra, the former Android executive who had been tasked with expanding Xiaomi outside China.</p>



<p>At the time, the market was dominated by Samsung and by Indian brands, such as Micromax, Karbonn, and Lava, whose model was to import unbranded Chinese products and sell them as their own. “There was no R&amp;D team, no product team, and no product design. They would basically just buy those products and sell them here,” says Jain.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s entry was not just about cutting out the middleman. In China, Xiaomi, along with Oppo and Vivo, had evolved beyond their origins in cheap but unreliable products and were now designing and producing higher-quality but affordable devices that were well adapted to a market like India, where disposable income was increasing in step with demand for mobile data.</p>



<p>Jain began his tenure at Xiaomi with a big gamble. In 2014, only 6% of Indian retail sales happened through e-commerce, but Jain launched Xiaomi as an online-only brand, replicating an approach that had worked in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Most people said, You are going to fail. You are going to be a disaster,” he said during a 2017 TED Talk. “Most smartphone brands until then focused on building large distribution networks, and we didn’t do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To drum up interest, the company organized flash sales and made sure the phones sold out quickly, to enhance their perceived popularity, a technique known as “hunger marketing.” They spent relatively little on advertising, instead relying on their users to become evangelists for the brand.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s phones seemed to hit a sweet spot of pricing and specifications. “Their phones were undercutting basically every other device on the market by half,” says Harish Jonalaggada, Asia editor at mobile review portal Android Central. The company launched phones for $180, with high specs like 64GB storage and 4GB RAM that were previously seen on only devices over $400.</p>



<p>The rush of orders for the launch of the Mi 3 model crashed the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart in the summer of 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Xiaomi’s success wasn’t just about its hardware. Under Jain’s leadership, the company tailored its Android-based operating system, MIUI, to the local market. One feature, Smart SMS, identifies the cluttered text messages that Indian Railways sends to its customers and extracts booking information, turning it into a ticket-like document. Xiaomi was the first company in India to incorporate a popular “dual app” feature that allows users to run duplicate versions of the same app — such as WhatsApp — on the same phone.</p>



<p>As online channels exploded in popularity and started to become saturated, Xiaomi shifted direction. In 2017, the company dramatically expanded its physical retail presence, pushing deep into rural areas. In October 2018, it set a mark recognized by the Guinness World Records by opening <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-opens-over-500-retail-stores-in-a-single-day-in-rural-india-1950375">500 stores</a> in a day. “One of the reasons Xiaomi has done well is — from both a product perspective and channel perspective — they made decisions unique to the India market,” says a Shanghai-based financial analyst covering Xiaomi who requested to remain anonymous, citing geopolitical tensions. In September, Xiaomi piloted its unique <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-mi-store-on-wheels-mobile-stores-moving-trucks-launch-india-villages-watch-xiaomi-2298745">Mi Store on Wheels</a>, a van that sells everything from trimmers to phones throughout the hinterlands of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sensitivity to the local market is in no small part due to the unusual autonomy that Jain has had in running Xiaomi in India. The Indian operations of Oppo and Vivo are both run by Chinese nationals. “Chinese companies are often very inward-looking and wouldn’t devolve the power in the same way Xiaomi has,” the analyst says.</p>

<p>That unusual autonomy stems from the relationship that Jain has built with Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s founder and CEO, a self-confessed acolyte of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jain says that, when he and Jun first met, “both of us were wearing black T-shirts and denim jeans. It was cool.”</p>



<p>One former employee, who worked closely with Jain while setting up the India operations, told <em>Rest of World</em>: “Over a period of time when Xiaomi India was growing, Manu was able to earn Jun’s trust, which is actually very hard. … Manu’s bets on the Indian market proved him right. And so, after a while, the CEO decided to just let Manu make his own decisions, which is very rare.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2019, Xiaomi was the largest smartphone brand in India, shifting 100 million units, according to data from the International Data Corporation. The company has expanded beyond mobile and offers everything from luggage to beard trimmers. Its rise came at the cost of Indian brands, whose market share fell from close to 50% to just 13% by the end of 2018, according to market intelligence firm Counterpoint Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jun and Jain share a love of the limelight. Jun is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/business/global/in-china-an-empire-built-by-aping-apple.html">social media celebrity</a> in China, posting mobile teasers and specifications to his 5 million …</p></div></div>

  <p>Although governed by simple physical laws, power grids are among the most complex human-made systems.
The main source of the complexity is the large number of components of the power systems that interact with each other: one needs to maintain a balance between power injections and withdrawals while satisfying certain physical, economic, and environmental conditions.
For instance, a central task of daily planning and operations of electricity grid operators<sup id="fnref:Tong04" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Tong04">1</a></sup> is to dispatch generation in order to meet demand at minimum cost, while respecting reliability and security constraints.
These tasks require solving a challenging constrained optimization problem, often referred to as some form of optimal power flow (OPF).<sup id="fnref:Cain12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Cain12">2</a></sup></p>

<div><p>In a series of two blog posts, we are going to discuss the basics of power flow and optimal power flow problems.
In this first post, we focus on the most important component of OPF: the power flow (PF) equations.
For this, first we introduce some basic definitions of power grids and AC circuits, then we define the power flow problem.
</p></div>

<h2 id="power-grids-as-graphs">Power grids as graphs</h2>

<p>Power grids are networks that include two main components: buses that represent important locations of the grid (e.g. generation points, load points, substations) and transmission (or distribution) lines that connect these buses.
It is pretty straightforward, therefore, to look at power grid networks as graphs: buses and transmission lines can be represented by nodes and edges of a corresponding graph.
There are two equivalent graph models that can be used to derive the basic power flow equations<sup id="fnref:Low14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Low14">3</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>directed graph representation (left panel of Figure 2): \(\mathbb{G}_{D}(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E})\);</li>
  <li>undirected graph representation (right panel of Figure 2): \(\mathbb{G}_{U}(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E} \cup \mathcal{E}^{R})\),</li>
</ul>

<div><p>where \(\mathcal{N}\), \(\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}\) and \(\mathcal{E}^{R} \subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}\) denote the set of nodes (buses), and the forward and reverse orientations of directed edges (branches) of the graph, respectively.
</p></div>

<h2 id="complex-power-in-ac-circuits">Complex power in AC circuits</h2>

<p>Power can be transmitted more efficiently at high voltages as high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage">voltage</a> (or equivalently, low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current">current</a>) reduces the loss of power due to its dissipation on transmission lines.
Power grids generally use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current">alternating current</a> (AC) since the AC voltage can be altered (from high to low) easily via transformers.
Therefore, we start with some notation and definitions for AC circuits.</p>

<p>The most important characteristics of AC circuits is that, unlike in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current">direct current</a> (DC) circuits, the currents and voltages are not constant in time: both their <em>magnitude</em> and <em>direction</em> vary periodically.
Because of several technical reasons (like low losses and disturbances), power generators use sinusoidal alternating quantities that can be straightforwardly modeled by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number%7D%7Bcomplex%20numbers">complex numbers</a>.</p>

<p>We will consistently use capital and small letters to denote complex and real-valued quantities, respectively.
For instance, let us consider two buses, \(i, j \in \mathcal{N}\), that are directly connected by a transmission line \((i, j) \in \mathcal{E}\).
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power">complex power</a> flowing from bus \(i\) to bus \(j\) is denoted by \(S_{ij}\) and it can be decomposed into its active (\(p_{ij}\)) and reactive (\(q_{ij}\)) components:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = p_{ij} + \mathrm{j}q_{ij},
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>where \(\mathrm{j} = \sqrt{-1}\).
The complex power flow can be expressed as the product of the complex voltage at bus \(i\), \(V_{i}\) and the complex conjugate of the current flowing between the buses, \(I_{ij}^{*}\):</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = V_{i}I_{ij}^{*},
\label{power_flow}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>It is well known that transmission lines have power losses due to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance">resistance</a> (\(r_{ij}\)), which is a measure of the opposition to the flow of the current.
For AC-circuits, a dynamic effect caused by the line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_reactance">reactance</a> (\(x_{ij}\)) also plays a role.
Unlike resistance, reactance does not cause any loss of power but has a delayed effect by storing and later returning power to the circuit.
The effect of resistance and reactance together can be represented by a single complex quantity, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance">impedance</a>: \(Z_{ij} = r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}\). 
Another useful complex quantity is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admittance">admittance</a>, which is the reciprocal of the impedance: \(Y_{ij} = \frac{1}{Z_{ij}}\).
Similarly to the impedance, the admittance can be also decomposed into its real, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance">conductance</a> (\(g_{ij}\)), and imaginary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptance">susceptance</a> (\(b_{ij}\)), components: \(Y_{ij} = g_{ij} + \mathrm{j}b_{ij}\).</p>

<p>Therefore, the current can be written as a function of the line voltage drop and the admittance between the two buses, which is an alternative form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law">Ohm’s law</a>:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
I_{ij} = Y_{ij}(V_{i} - V_{j}).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Replacing the above expression for the current in the power flow equation (eq. \(\ref{power_flow}\)), we get</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = Y_{ij}^{*}V_{i}V_{i}^{*} - Y_{ij}^{*}V_{i}V_{j}^{*} = Y_{ij}^{*} \left( |V_{i}|^{2} - V_{i}V_{j}^{*} \right).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>The above power flow equation can be expressed by using the polar form of voltage, i.e. \(V_{i} = v_{i}e^{\mathrm{j} \delta_{i}} = v_{i}(\cos\delta_{i} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{i})\) (where \(v_{i}\) and \(\delta_{i}\) are the voltage magnitude and angle of bus \(i\), respectively), and the admittance components:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{ij} = \left(g_{ij} - \mathrm{j}b_{ij}\right) \left(v_{i}^{2} - v_{i}v_{j}\left(\cos\delta_{ij} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{ij}\right)\right),
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>where for brevity we introduced the voltage angle difference \(\delta_{ij} = \delta_{i} - \delta_{j}\).
Similarly, using a simple algebraic identity of \(g_{ij} - \mathrm{j}b_{ij} = \frac{g_{ij}^{2} + b_{ij}^{2}}{g_{ij} + \mathrm{j}b_{ij}} = \frac{|Y_{ij}|^{2}}{Y_{ij}} = \frac{Z_{ij}}{|Z_{ij}|^{2}} = \frac{r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}}\), the impedance components-based expression has the following form:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
    S_{ij} = \frac{r_{ij} + \mathrm{j}x_{ij}}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i}v_{j}\left(\cos\delta_{ij} + \mathrm{j}\sin\delta_{ij}\right)\right).
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Finally, the corresponding real equations can be written as</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        p_{ij} &amp; = g_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) - b_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \\
        q_{ij} &amp; = b_{ij} \left( -v_{i}^{2} + v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) - g_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right), \\
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\label{power_flow_y}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>and</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
\left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        p_{ij} &amp; = \frac{1}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left[ r_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) + x_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \right] \\
        q_{ij} &amp; = \frac{1}{r_{ij}^{2} + x_{ij}^{2}} \left[ x_{ij} \left( v_{i}^{2} - v_{i} v_{j} \cos\delta_{ij} \right) + r_{ij} \left( v_{i} v_{j} \sin\delta_{ij} \right) \right]. \\
    \end{aligned}
\right.
\label{power_flow_z}
\end{equation}\]

</p><h2 id="power-flow-models">Power flow models</h2>

<p>In the previous section we presented the power flow between two connected buses and established a relationship between complex power flow and complex voltages.
In power flow problems, the entire power grid is considered and the task is to calculate certain quantities based on some other specified ones.
There are two equivalent power flow models depending on the graph model used: the bus injection model (based on the undirected graph representation) and the branch flow model (based on the directed graph representation).
First, we introduce the basic formulations.
Then, we show the most widely used technique to solve power flow problems.
Finally, we extend the basic equations and derive more sophisticated models including additional components for real power grids.</p>

<h3 id="bus-injection-model">Bus injection model</h3>

<p>The bus injection model (BIM) uses the undirected graph model of the power grid, \(\mathbb{G}_{U}\).
For each bus \(i\), we denote by \(\mathcal{N}_{i} \subset \mathcal{N}\) the set of buses directly connected to bus \(i\).
Also, for each bus we introduce the following quantities<sup id="fnref:Low14:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Low14">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:Wood14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:Wood14">4</a></sup> (Figure 3):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\): generated power flowing into bus \(i\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\): demand power or load flowing out of the bus \(i\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}\): net power injection at bus \(i\), i.e. \(S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}} - S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\).</li>
  <li>\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}}\): transmitted power flowing between bus \(i\) and its adjacent buses.
</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/power_quantities.png" alt="...">
Figure 3. Power balance and quantities of a bus connected to three adjacent buses and including a single generator and a single load.</p>

<p><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellegen/%27s_theorem">Tellegen’s theorem</a> establishes a simple relationship between these power quantities:</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}} - S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}} \ \ \ \ \forall i \in \mathcal{N}.
\label{power_balance}
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Eq. \(\ref{power_balance}\) expresses the law of conservation of power (energy): the power injected (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\)) to bus \(i\) must be equal to the power going out from the bus, i.e. the sum of the withdrawn (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\)) and transmitted power (\(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}}\)).
In the most basic model, a bus can represent either a generator (i.e. \(S_{i} = S_{i}^{\mathrm{gen}}\)) or a load (i.e. \(S_{i} = -S_{i}^{\mathrm{load}}\)).
For a given bus, the transmitted power can be obtained simply as a sum of the powers flowing in to and out from the bus, \(S_{i}^{\mathrm{trans}} = \sum \limits_{j \in …</p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Mannequin.js</strong> is a simple library of an articulated mannequin figure. The shape of the figure
and its movements are done purely in JavaScript. The graphics is implemented in
<a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>. Click on an image to open a live demo.</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-posture.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-posture.jpg" width="150"></a>

<p>This is the fourth incarnation of the mannequin figure. The first one was implemented
in Elica. The second one was implemented in C/C++ and OpenGL. The third one
was implemented in JS/Three.js and is a direct predecessor of the current mannequin.js.
Since its first incarnation, mannequin.js is used in the course <em>Fundamentals of Computer Graphics</em> for Computer Sciences undergraduate students from the
<a href="https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en">Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics</a>
at <a href="https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng">Sofia University</a>.</p>

<p>Mannequin.js is licensed under <strong>GPL-3.0</strong>.</p>

<p>Three.js is included in this repository to safeguard against incompatibilities with future versions. Three.js is not a part of mannequin.js.</p>



<p>The <strong>mannequin.js</strong> library is provided as a JavaScript file that has to
be include along with three.js.</p>

<h3 id="minimal-program">Minimal program</h3>

<p>Here is a minimal program that creates a male figure in the browser (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-minimal.html">live example</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script</span> <span>src=</span><span>"three.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script</span> <span>src=</span><span>"mannequin.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
      createScene();
      var man = new Male();
    <span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The helper function <code>createScene()</code> provides a default set-up of the scene and its elements, like lighting, camera, ground, etc. Another helper function, <code>animate(t)</code> is responsible for defining figures’ postures at moment <em>t</em>. If the set-up is done with a custom function, then it should also manage the animation loop by itself.</p>

<h3 id="figure-types">Figure types</h3>

<p>Mannequin figures are created as instances of classes <code>Male()</code>, <code>Female()</code> or <code>Child()</code> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-figure-types.html">live example</a>):</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-figure-types.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-figure-types.jpg"></a></p>

    <span>:</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These three classes have a common predecessor – the class <code>Mannequin(feminine,height)</code>, where <em>feminine</em> is boolean and defines whether the shape is feminine or masculine, and the second parameter is a number for relative height (adults have height 1).</p>



<p>All types of figures have the same structure of joints. For example, the right arm of a figure is accessed by <code>r_arm</code>. Left and right body parts are in respect to the figure, not to the viewer (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body-parts.html">live example</a>):</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body-parts.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-body-parts.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Each body part has rotation methods that turn it around a pivot point.
The first parameter <em>angle</em> of the methods is the angle of rotation in degrees,
so 180 is half turn and 360 is full turn. Negative angles are allowed and
they represent turning in the opposite direction. Some methods have an optional
second parameter for <em>direction</em> of motion, which could be the constant <code>LEFT</code> or
<code>RIGHT</code>.</p>

<h3 id="central-body-parts">Central body parts</h3>

<p>The central body parts are the ones which have single instances - <em>head</em>, <em>neck</em>, <em>torso</em>, <em>pelvis</em> and the body as a whole. To move the whole <strong>body</strong> use methods <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> of the figure (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-body.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>head</strong> supports similar methods: <em>nod</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-head.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.head.nod ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.turn ( angle, dir )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.head.tilt ( angle, dir )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>torso</strong> has the same methods as the whole body: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-torso.html">live example</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.torso.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.torso.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Although the <strong>neck</strong> is a separate part of the body, it is not controlled individually. Instead, a part of the head motion is distributed over the neck. Similarly, the <strong>pelvis</strong> is not controlled individually. Instead, the whole body is controlled by bending, turning and tilting.</p>

<h3 id="upper-limbs">Upper limbs</h3>

<p>The upper limbs are symmetrical body parts: <em>arm</em>, <em>elbow</em>, <em>wrist</em> and <em>fingers</em>.</p>

<p>Both <strong>arms</strong> support methods <em>raise</em>, <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-arm1.html">live example</a>). The following list refers to the right arm, however, the same methods are available for the right hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.raise ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.straddle ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.straddle ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_arm.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If the <em>direction</em> parameter is omitted, then the default motions of <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> are symmetrical. For example, the left arm is straddled to the left, while the right arm is straddled to the right (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-arm2.html">live example</a>).</p>

<p>The motion of the <strong>elbow</strong> is only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-elbow.html">live example</a>). Negative values for <em>angle</em> result in unnatural elbow position.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_elbow.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>wrists</strong> have the same methods as the torso: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-wrist.html">live example</a>), but similar to the arms, the directions are symmetrical, if <em>direction</em> is not set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_wrist.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The last body parts of the upper limbs are the <strong>fingers</strong>. They can only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-fingers.html">live example</a>), however, they are composed of two segments and the bending angle is distributed over both of them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_fingers.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lower-limbs">Lower limbs</h3>

<p>The lower limbs are symmetrical body parts: <em>leg</em>, <em>knee</em> and <em>ankle</em>.</p>

<p>Both <strong>legs</strong> support methods <em>raise</em>, <em>straddle</em> and <em>turn</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-leg.html">live example</a>). Straddling and turning are symmetrical if <em>direction</em> is not set.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.raise ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.straddle ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.straddle ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_leg.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The motion of the <strong>knee</strong> is only <em>bend</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-knee.html">live example</a>). Negative values for <em>angle</em> result in unnatural knee position.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_knee.bend ( angle )</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>ankles</strong> have the same methods as the wrists: <em>bend</em>, <em>turn</em> and <em>tilt</em> (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-ankle.html">live example</a>), but similar to the legs, the directions are symmetrical, if <em>direction</em> is not set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.bend ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.turn ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.turn ( angle, direction )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.tilt ( angle )</code></li>
  <li><code>figure.r_ankle.tilt ( angle, direction )</code></li>
</ul>



<p>The posture of a figure is defined by a setting the rotations of body parts. The order of rotations is fixed independent on the order of rotations in the user program (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-order.html">live example</a>). For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>nod</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>produces the same posture as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>);</span>
<span>figure</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>nod</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sometimes this might lead to unexpected results, especially if the user assumes an order of rotations that is different from what mannequin.js uses. This might happen when a body part is rotated around 3 or 2 axes.</p>

<h3 id="static-posture">Static posture</h3>

<p>The static posture defines the position of body part that do not change. By default, when a figure is created, its body parts are set to the default posture. This version of mannequin.js does not provide posture editor, so all rotations has to be defined programmatically.</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-posture.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-posture.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes it is better to define the figure step by step. Tai Chi Chuan posture (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-posture.html">live example</a>) could start by defining the whole body position:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// overall body position</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>7.7</span><span>;</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>LEFT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>

<span>// torso and head</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>15</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>torso</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>head</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>70</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the orientation of the legs can be set:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// right leg</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>85</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_leg</span><span>.</span><span>straddle</span><span>(</span><span>40</span><span>,</span><span>LEFT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_knee</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>35</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>,</span><span>RIGHT</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>15</span><span>);</span>

<span>// left leg</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_leg</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_knee</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>25</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_ankle</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, the arms are fixed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// left arm</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>40</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_arm</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>60</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_elbow</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>155</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_wrist</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>l_fingers</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>

<span>// right arm</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>raise</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>tilt</span><span>(</span><span>70</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_arm</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_elbow</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>40</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_wrist</span><span>.</span><span>turn</span><span>(</span><span>30</span><span>);</span>
<span>man</span><span>.</span><span>r_fingers</span><span>.</span><span>bend</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dynamic-posture">Dynamic posture</h3>

<p>The dynamic posture – i.e. a posture that changes over time – is set with the same methods that are used for static posture. Mannequin.js defines an empty function <code>animate(t)</code>, which is called in the animation loop once for each frame. All changes of a posture should be defined inside this function (<a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-dynamic.html">live example</a>). The parameter <em>t</em> is the time, measured in tenths of seconds. This function is set up in <code>createScene()</code>. If <em>createScene</em> and <em>animate</em> are not used, then the animation loop should be managed manually.</p>

<p><a href="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/example-dynamic.html"><img src="https://boytchev.github.io/mannequin.js/examples/snapshots/example-dynamic.jpg"></a></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To make the animation loop faster, all constant rotations should be defined outside <em>animate</em>. Also, if a rotation changing in the loop, there is no need to set it up outside the loop.</p>



<p>Apart for moving body parts, the current version of mannequin.js provides basic functionality for additional modification or accessing the figure.</p>

<h3 id="custom-colors">Custom colors</h3>

<p>By default, all figures use a predefined set of global colors for body parts. Global colors are stored in <code>Mannequin.colors</code> array as six <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Color">Three.js colors</a> or lowercase <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">HTML/CSS color names</a> in specific order – head, shoes, pelvis, joints, limbs and torso:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Mannequin</span><span>.</span><span>colors</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a web app without a framework. There are a bunch of potential advantages (no bloat! bespoke to your project!) and being able to say you built something with minimal dependencies gets you Engineer Points.</p>
<p>That is, if you can pull it off.</p>
<p>I started a new side project recently. It’s a web-based graphics editor, so it needs to be a single page app. My time spent profiling <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> for performance issues has made me a little wary of React for building interfaces that update at 60 frames per second, so I decided to avoid it. I’d go (mostly) vanilla and see how far that took me.</p>
<p>I installed <a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> and got to work. “Components” were simply functions that returned lit-html template results. A big singleton at the top of the tree held onto all the application state, stored as a global variable within that module.</p>
<p>The first hurdle came when a component needed local state. I could have lifted it to the singleton, but that would have broken the component’s encapsulation. I noticed that lit-html directives can keep state, so I decided to use them to build a tiny component library — ignoring a warning from the lit-html developers that this wasn’t a supported use case.</p>
<p>My home-brewed library worked great… until I needed to run some code when a component appeared on the screen. I started digging through lit-html documentation and issues looking for a way to detect a directive’s lifecycle, but it became clear to me that going down that path would be painful.</p>
<p>At that point, I recalled <a href="https://tomdale.net/2015/11/javascript-frameworks-and-mobile-performance/">this quote by Tom Dale</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have heard from many developers who have told me that they accepted the argument that vanilla JavaScript or microlibraries would let them write leaner, meaner, faster apps. After a year or two, however, what they found themselves with was a slower, bigger, less documented and unmaintained in-house framework with no community. As apps grow, you tend to need the abstractions that a framework offers. Either you or the community write the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. Let’s avoid that trap. What about a small framework? I’d heard a lot of good things about Svelte, and although I was slightly worried about the size of the Svelte community I figured it would be fine.</p>
<p>My migration attempt quickly ground to a halt when I wanted a parent component to apply some styles to a child component. In React, I’d pass a class name in from the parent as a <code>className</code> prop. In Svelte, that’s considered a workaround, and the actual feature is the subject of an <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0000-style-properties.md">RFC</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Maybe this is an example of <a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/160.html">dangling by a trivial feature</a>. But it’s so basic a capability that I’m surprised Svelte is on version three without an officially blessed way to do it. I ran into this limitation when I created my <strong>second component</strong>. Way before I got to try out any of the cool reactivity that earns Svelte all that buzz.</p>
<p>So I changed my mind and went with React. After an hour or so, I’d finished moving everything over — and my anxiety had vanished. I stopped worrying about having most efficient component system, and picked up work on the thing I wanted to build in the first place.</p>
<p>No, React isn’t perfect. It’s optimized for apps that make network requests and then display lists of things (i.e. most apps) which isn’t really what I’m doing here<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The performance is fine now, although I expect I’ll have to optimize as my project gets more complex.</p>
<p>But React lets me stop thinking about the framework. React gets out of my way. React is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring</a>. React is actively developed. React has a giant ecosystem and a giant community. React is battle-tested on some of the most visited websites in the world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are technically better ways to build a highly interactive interface on the web, but life is too short for me to spend hours trying to figure them out. There are things I want to create, and the only way I can actually create them is to stop spending so much time on tooling.</p>
<p>For now, I’m choosing React.</p>

<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The solution they seem to have landed on — letting the child expose CSS custom properties as props — is actually pretty cool, though I don’t like that Svelte will silently wrap your component with an extra <code>div</code>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Although Dan, if you read this, the <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1133341485133438982">“animation pass” mode</a> you’ve mentioned offhandedly sounds very relevant! <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p><span><p>Predicting protein folding is a massive problem with huge potential to help us understand disease. It’s been stuck in a rut for the past 50 years, but one team of researchers has come out of nowhere and claims to have solved the problem. But have they?</p></span>
</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">Clinical Need</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>Proteins are made up of amino acids. Getting the amino acid sequence for a protein is pretty easy these days. But going from this sequence to the 3-dimensional shape of the protein is really hard.</p><p>For decades, researchers have worked out protein structures using slow and expensive techniques such as <sample>x-ray crystallography</sample>. So far we’ve only solved about 170,000 proteins using these approaches. Yet more than 200 million proteins have been discovered across all forms of life 😳</p><p>Being able to predict a protein’s shape based on its amino acid sequence would be a game changer. We could design drugs faster by targeting proteins more effectively. But computer-based predictions haven’t been accurate enough to be useful. Until now…</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>X-ray crystallography uses the diffraction of x-rays to work out the shape of a protein. The pictures are murky and there's a lot of guesswork involved!</p>

</div>
</section>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">What did they do?</h3>
<div><p>The team created a deep learning pipeline for predicting protein shape from its amino acid sequence.</p><p>They entered this neural network into the “Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction” (CASP) competition. Teams are given amino acids sequences for ~100 proteins with unknown structures and asked to predict protein shape. The predictions are given a score from 0-100. Slow techniques (like x-ray crystallography) score above 90.</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">How did the model work?</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>The first version of their model (AlphaFold) performs the following stages:</p><p>First, it looks for similar sequence fragments to the protein of interest from a large protein sequence database. This helps identify features of the protein at interest. An <sample>autoencoder</sample> predicts which protein shape the sequence fragment most likely represents.</p><p>These features are then fed into a convolutional neural network which predicts the distances between different parts of the protein sequence. Predicting distances enables it to also predict contact points.</p><p>Then, using the predicted distances and contact points, the model considers all the possible shapes of the protein and identifies the most likely one.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>This is a type of neural network that compresses data into a bottleneck of it's most important features, and measures it's performance by reconstructing that bottleneck back up to size. It's an in depth topic worth <a href="https://www.jeremyjordan.me/autoencoders/#:~:text=Autoencoders%20are%20an%20unsupervised%20learning,representation%20of%20the%20original%20input.">reading more on</a></p>

<p>With the updated model (AlphaFold-2) they made some changes. They haven't released a paper yet (only an abstract), but from what we can tell they used an <sample>attention-based deep learning</sample> to fit over the whole shape of the protein, not just the fragments.</p>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>Instead of working over the whole sequence at once, this method allows the learning to 'attend' to subsections individually. This is a bit like trying to translate a long german word- instead of trying to decode the whole word, you break it into sub-words and see how they match, then put it all together.</p>

<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">How did the model perform?</h3>
<div><p><img alt="Animated Protein" height="450" src="https://explainthispaper.s3.amazonaws.com/images/protein.width-800.png" width="800"></p><p>From the start of the competition in 1994 up to 2016, CASP scores had been around 40. The first time DeepMind entered, they scored up to 60. This year- AlphaFold scored an average of 92.4, smashing the threshold of 90/100!</p><p>In fact, the organisers of the competition thought that DeepMind had been cheating, so they set them a special challenge- a membrane protein from an ancient species of <i>archaea</i>. For 10 years with no success, research teams tried every trick in the book to get an x-ray crystal structure of the protein.</p><p>AlphaFold had no problem, returning an image of a three part protein with two helical arms. In hindsight, this structure fit the x-ray crystallography data perfectly, effectively going beyond the limitations of current human research.</p></div>
<h3 grey-text="" text-darken-4="">So what?</h3>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>This is a thorny problem that researchers and pharmaceutical companies have been working on for 50+ years. This model could predict the shape of proteins without unreliable experimental measurements. This would mean faster development of a wide range of drugs, from cancer drugs that better target proteins for cell replication, to antibiotics that target surface receptors of microbes.</p><p>What’s more, this model was cheap to train- just weeks on quite a <sample>small cluster of servers</sample></p><p>It's worth saying that this isn't the whole picture of protein folding- this still doesn't inform how proteins change shape in the presence of other molecules (like oxygen near haemoglobin). These are also the crystallised protein forms rather than the true 'in vivo' structures, so there may be some errors in translation, but that remains to be seen.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>Using Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing#pricing_calculator">pricing calculator</a> and the details from the blog post, this could be trained for around $21,000. In the grand scheme of biology and pharmaceuticals, this is pennies!<br></p>

<p>Making a social media account with a pseudonym or artist/brand name is easy. And it’s enough is most use cases to protect your identity as the next George Orwell. There are plenty of people using pseudonyms all over Facebook/Instagram/Twitter/Linkedin/TikTok/Snapchat/Reddit/… But the vast majority of those are anything but anonymous and can easily be traced to their real identity by your local cops, random people within the OSINT<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> (Open-Source Intelligence) community and trolls<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> on 4chan<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is a good thing as most criminals/trolls are not really tech savvy and will be identified with ease. But this is also a bad thing as most political dissidents, human rights activists and whistleblowers can also be tracked rather easily.</p>

<p>This updated guide aims to provide introduction to various tracking techniques, id verification techniques and guidance to creating and maintaining anonymous identities online including social media accounts safely.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect yourself from the NSA, the FSB, Mark Zuckerberg or the Mossad if they’re out to find you? Probably not … Mossad will be doing “Mossad things” <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> and will probably find you no matter how hard to try to hide<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You have to consider your threat model<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> before going further.</p>

<p>Will this guide help you protect your privacy from OSINT researchers like Belingcat<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> , Doxing<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> trolls on 4chan<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> and others that have no access to the NSA toolbox? More likely. Tho I wouldn’t be so sure about 4chan.</p>

<p>It’s also important to understand this guide is the humble result of years of experience and testing from a single individual (myself) and that many of those systems that aim to prevent anonymity are opaque closed-source systems. Most of those guidelines are guessed based on experience. These experiences take a lot of time and resources and are unfortunately far from being scientific. <strong>Your mileage may vary.</strong></p>

<p>You might think this guide has no legitimate use but there are many<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> such as:</p>

<p><strong>This guide will (for the moment) not recommend using MacOS due to the latest Big Sur update which forces “unblockable” telemetry</strong><sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16">16</a></sup> <strong>and because MacOS doesn’t offer MAC address randomization.</strong></p>



<p>There are many ways you can be tracked besides browser cookies and ads, your e-mail and your phone number. And if you think only the Mossad or the NSA/FSB can find you, you would be terribly wrong.</p>

<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the many ways you can be de-anonymized:</p>

<h2 id="your-ip-address">Your IP address:</h2>

<p>Your IP address<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> is the most known and obvious way you can be tracked. That IP is the IP you’re using at the source. This is where you connect to the internet. That IP is usually provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) (xDSL, Mobile, Cable, Fiber, Cafe, Bar, Friend, Neighbor). Most countries have data retention regulations<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> which mandates keeping logs of who is using what IP at a certain time/date for up to several years or indefinitely. Your ISP can tell a third party that you were using a specific IP at a specific date and time, years after the fact. If that IP (the origin one) leaks at any point for any reason, it can be used to track down you directly. In many countries, you won’t be able to have internet access without providing some form of identification to the provider (address, ID, real name, e-mail …).</p>

<p>Useless to say that most platforms (such as social networks) will also keep (sometimes indefinitely) the IP addresses you used to sign-up but also those you used to sign-in.</p>

<p>For those reasons, we’ll need to not use that origin IP (the one tied to your identification) or hide it as much as we can through a combination of various means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using a public WIFI service (free).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using an anonymous VPN service<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19">19</a></sup> (paid by cash).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the Tor Anonymity Network<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20">20</a></sup> (free).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All those will be explained later in this guide.</p>

<h2 id="your-dns-requests">Your DNS requests:</h2>

<p>DNS stands for “Domain Name System”<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21">21</a></sup> and is a service used by your browser (and other apps) to find the IP addresses of a service. It’s pretty much a huge “contact list” (phone book for older people) that works like asking it a name and it returns the number to call. Except it returns an IP instead.</p>

<p>Every time your browser wants to access a certain service such as Google through <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com</a>. Your Browser (Chrome or Firefox) will query a DNS service to find the IP addresses of the Google web servers.</p>

<p>Usually the DNS service is provided by your ISP and automatically configured by the network you’re connecting to. This DNS service could also be subject to data retention regulations or will just keep logs for other reasons (data collection for advertising purposes for instance). Therefore this ISP will be capable of …</p></section></div></div>

But there’s one thing no one likes dealing with: taxes. Even when you have <a href="https://pulseblueprint.com/careers/entrepreneurship/freelance-contract-clauses-every-freelancer-should-use/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iron-clad freelance contracts</a>, taxes can be a nuisance at best and overly complicated and time consuming at worst. One platform – Bonsai – is aiming to fix that.</p><p>Bonsai, a freelance business management platform boasting over 250,000 users, has just launched a new <a href="https://www.hellobonsai.com/self-employment-tax-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelance tax calculator</a> for US-based freelancers. The calculator provides an estimate of how much tax you might end up owing based on: your state, filing status, income levels, and business expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve freelanced for many years, and self-employment taxes were always an area of confusion,” said Bonsai’s Head of Marketing, Madhav Bhandari, in an interview with <a href="https://aithority.com/news/bonsais-freelance-tax-hub-is-free-and-public-for-everyone-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIThority</a>.</p><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GmMCVhDxoFe_WEDJKuqqQlyvamAdCBjYwS4px3EgcdElItJpY46cLhNS-KdaTeNsJnEoJUsxNBWbOj2e25DYV_Bg9jsXykP2RHCyoX0y8It2zxtXdG-Ah7YXoUQYgPqI7a7tEgBs" alt="Bonsai self employment tax calculator" data-old-src="//pulseblueprint.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"><figcaption>Source: <em>Bonsai Freelance Tax Calculator</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Helping freelancers with self-employment taxes</h2><p>In most states – and most countries outside of the US – freelancers are lumped in with “self-employed individuals.” This means they have to register their businesses as self-employed and handle taxes as such. Thankfully, this means access to all the same deductions as small businesses. Unfortunately, the web of deductions is incredibly complex. What supports you can access depends on both your state and your city, as different municipalities offer different support.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing that every freelancer can leverage to reduce their tax bill, though, is business expenses. Whenever you spend money legitimately to run your business, you can deduct that expense against your taxes. This web can also get complicated, so Bonsai launched a <a href="https://www.hellobonsai.com/self-employment-tax-deductions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">library of common self-employment tax deductions</a>. At the top of the page, you’ll see a list of things that almost every freelancer can deduct. These range from set up expenses to ongoing subscriptions. At the bottom, you’ll see a list of types of freelancers – from makeup artists to software engineers – linking out to the common deductions for each type of work.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/b-2xmtEMndeM-ASxgzNaFRDiKLR2d42ctCJRXDJBXge_GUoFMEj8K3YzuiIRCnqtBy3yjNktGtXzYbF0kMqAdY0PZEZNaLb7Klvc-2-l5xmCDRGppf0Nik893Hq5-9BsRa4jVUIX" alt="image of Bonsai's tax deductions by career type" data-old-src="//pulseblueprint.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"><figcaption>Source: <em>Bonsai Tax Deductions Information Hub</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Avoiding the pitfalls of freelancing</h2><p>According to one study, a common <a href="https://pulseblueprint.com/news/biggest-challenges-freelancers-face-skynova-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">challenge freelancers face</a> is not saving or withholding for taxes. Ideally, once you have a ballpark figure of how much tax you will need to pay, you can also begin to save so you don’t have a surprise bill.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the other key challenges freelancers face revolve around payment. Freelancers say they have trouble ensuring on-time payment and many send invoices late or don’t have contracts before starting work. All of these challenges are also ones Bonsai says they can help with through their paid platform. However, you don’t want to pay for a platform to get this benefit.

<p>Learning is a heavily misunderstood&nbsp;concept.</p>



<p>As a&nbsp;paradigm&nbsp;example of&nbsp;deep work,&nbsp;we understand that, when reading, directing your full attention to the material at hand is essential.&nbsp;Graspingcomplex information is hard.</p>



<p>But this is only half the battle.</p>



<p>After some string of words hits your retina and has made its way to your brain, you’re&nbsp;not done.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;cruel&nbsp;irony,&nbsp;these hours of&nbsp;deep work&nbsp;often cause&nbsp;flow&nbsp;states&nbsp;and the feeling that ‘you’ve had a good day’ and learned a&nbsp;shitload&nbsp;of new stuff.</p>



<p>But for many reading&nbsp;episodes&nbsp;this feeling is&nbsp;deceptive.&nbsp;There is anineliminable&nbsp;aspect to learning that takes place&nbsp;<em>after&nbsp;</em>the&nbsp;glorious&nbsp;flow state.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;other half of the battle is&nbsp;to&nbsp;transfer the newly acquired intelligence from your working memory to your&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;understanding and&nbsp;integrate&nbsp;it into your standing stack of mental models.</p>



<p>If you don’t&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;this, your learning&nbsp;gains&nbsp;are only a&nbsp;fraction&nbsp;of what they could have been.</p>



<p>In this article,&nbsp;I’m going to breakdown how to win the battle and the war — how to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;these traps and organize your reading habit for a maximalReturn On Investment (ROI)&nbsp;on reading hours.</p>



<p>This is what we’ll cover:</p>

<p>Warning: this is a very&nbsp;nerdy&nbsp;post.</p>



<h3 id="1b1d">Meta-Learning</h3>



<p>Meta-learning&nbsp;is knowing how to learn.&nbsp;It is one of the most important skills to learn, yet few people know how to do to it.</p>



<p>Reading and writing is what I do for a living, and, interestingly, a lot of non-imaginary&nbsp;friends have been asking me how I learn.&nbsp;This is special, becausemost of the times when people don’t know how to do something, they go&nbsp;togreat&nbsp;lengths&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>to notice their&nbsp;deficiency.</p>



<p>Could it be that many students turned ‘knowledge workers’ have the&nbsp;naggingfeeling that something is missing in their skillset because they were never taught&nbsp;meta-learning?</p>



<p>This is not their fault, but a&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-understanding-project/schools-dont-support-personal-development-they-distort-it-7e1c227eb01d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack in our education system</a>.</p>



<p>As Adam Robinson observed on the&nbsp;<a href="https://fs.blog/adam-robinson-pt2/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Farnam Street&nbsp;</em>podcast</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“<strong>No one ever shows us how to learn, ever</strong>.&nbsp;Nowhere in school.&nbsp;For example, imagine, Shane, [Shane is the host of the FS podcast] in French class, French 101, your first French class, your teacher said,&nbsp;“Everyone, you’re going to have to learn a lot of vocabulary in this class so before I teach you any words I’m going to teach you a way to remember vocabulary.”&nbsp;They never do that.&nbsp;They just go, “We’re going to have a quiz on these 30 words on Monday.&nbsp;Good luck.”&nbsp;But they don’t teach us how to learn actually, or remember things.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This is&nbsp;weird, because,&nbsp;in today’s high-information world,&nbsp;people need the ability to&nbsp;<em>make sense of</em>&nbsp;complexity and to&nbsp;<em>combine</em>&nbsp;many bits of data into a broad picture of the world.</p>



<p>Merely&nbsp;<em>acquiring</em>information is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>(yet) learning.</p>



<p>Learning itself is a skill, and knowing how to do it well is an incredibly valuable advantage.</p>



<p>We take this is for granted, but how to do this is&nbsp;far from&nbsp;obvious&nbsp;and doesn’t get taught in the curriculum.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="1d70">Learning is a&nbsp;two-step&nbsp;process</h3>



<p>So, how do we learn?</p>



<p>Before we attempt to answer the question,&nbsp;let’s get clear&nbsp;on what a&nbsp;satisfactoryanswer needs to get us.&nbsp;What does it&nbsp;<em>mean&nbsp;</em>to learn?&nbsp;When have you learned something?</p>



<p>In the introduction, I stated that&nbsp;just studying the information isn’t enough(no matter how intense your focus was).&nbsp;Learning has&nbsp;two phases — not one.</p>



<ol><li>Read/listen&nbsp;the damn thing</li><li>Process and&nbsp;recall&nbsp;what you’ve just ‘learned’</li></ol>



<p>A lot has been said about the first phase — about deep work, concentration, blocking out&nbsp;distractions, and so&nbsp;forth.&nbsp;This makes sense:&nbsp;if you’re checking Facebook all the time,&nbsp;your mind is not ‘there’, and you might as well not have spent your afternoon ’reading’ this book.</p>



<p>This is all great and I‘m a big fan, but in the&nbsp;meantime, we’re ignoring step two.</p>



<p>If you don’t spend time revisiting and grappling with the book either,&nbsp;<em>the same applies</em> — you might as well not have read it.&nbsp;In the long run, there is no difference between skipping the first or the second stage (except whether you passed that French test in high school back in 2019…).</p>



<p>After you’ve killed Cersei, you’ve still got the&nbsp;White Walkers to deal with.&nbsp;If you don’t, you lose either way.</p>



<p>That is why students who&nbsp;binge-study&nbsp;the night before the exam quite literally forget everything two days later:&nbsp;while all these&nbsp;lame&nbsp;French words were still in their short-term memory,&nbsp;allowing them to pass the test,&nbsp;the information never&nbsp;transitioned&nbsp;to their long-term understanding — and so, sooner or later, it&nbsp;evaporated.</p>



<p>To learn,&nbsp;you need to transfer the newly acquired intelligence from&nbsp;your working memory to your long-term understanding.</p>



<p><strong>The jump from short-term memory to long-term understanding doesn’t happen automatically.</strong><strong>The default mode, after you close your books for the day, is not&nbsp;</strong><strong>retainment</strong><strong>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<em>forgetting</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>This learning guide&nbsp;is not about&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-understanding-project/why-you-dont-need-to-read-those-productivity-guides-347fe02cc196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to do generic deep work</a>.&nbsp;It explains how to maximize the ROI on hours spent reading,&nbsp;<em>assuming</em>&nbsp;you did them ‘deep work style’.</p>



<h3 id="9181">Remembering the right&nbsp;things</h3>



<p>First, I need to discuss a common&nbsp;objection&nbsp;that denies phase two of learning matters.&nbsp;If you have no&nbsp;quibble&nbsp;with memorization, and doing the required effort, you can skip this section.</p>



<p>“But Mr. Maarten,” the protest goes, “you mention ‘processing’ and ‘remembering’ into my ‘long-term understanding’, but isn’t memorizing pointless?&nbsp;My Google Assistant can look everything up and also is smarter than me, says my Google Assistant.”</p>



<p>Indeed,&nbsp;Albert Einstein is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-polymath-project/studying-history-is-more-important-than-ever-in-todays-economy-c99fde4be7d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed</a>&nbsp;to have said:&nbsp;“Never&nbsp;memorize&nbsp;what you can look up in a book”.&nbsp;In Einstein’s days, books were&nbsp;unequaled&nbsp;as a source of information.&nbsp;We, on the other hand, live in an age where nearly everything can be accessed through the magic vehicle of internet.&nbsp;Following Einstein’s logic, then,&nbsp;<em>nothing&nbsp;</em>is worth memorizing anymore, because&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;can be looked up.</p>



<p>But, of course, that is probably not what old Albert was getting at.</p>



<p>Most likely,&nbsp;the advice he wanted to&nbsp;dispense&nbsp;was that&nbsp;you should not waste your time by committing unimportant details to memory.&nbsp;Rather,&nbsp;your&nbsp;focus should be on understanding the bigger picture — on&nbsp;how things relate to each other.</p>



<p>This reminds me of Elon Musk’s&nbsp;approach to learning.&nbsp;He&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recommends</a>viewing knowledge as a tree:</p>



<blockquote><p>Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.</p></blockquote>



<p>To ‘learn’, we need to do more than merely feeding ourselves new information.&nbsp;Expanding our intelligence requires&nbsp;<em>connecting</em>&nbsp;new materials to what we already knew&nbsp;(the second phase of learning).&nbsp;That, in turn, requires something to connect&nbsp;<em>to.</em></p>



<p>There’s no adding branches without a solid trunk.</p>



<p>The very possibility of genuine insight requires a memorized base.&nbsp;Without it, data you consume will not be added to your tree of knowledge.&nbsp;Instead, they will float in the air for a couple of weeks or so, before being taken away by the wind.</p>



<p>Knowledge, gone.&nbsp;Time, wasted.</p>



<p>What I’m saying is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>that we should&nbsp;devise&nbsp;techniques which enable us torecite&nbsp;everything we’ve learned.&nbsp;That’s why we’re not talking about, for example,&nbsp;retaining&nbsp;the date of the French revolution.</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;you&nbsp;<em>should&nbsp;</em>learn by heart the lessons it tells you about how the world works&nbsp;and update your representation of reality&nbsp;accordingly.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;other words,&nbsp;you should use it to&nbsp;inform&nbsp;your&nbsp;unconscious — the&nbsp;sum&nbsp;of your mental models.</p>



<h3 id="7b89">Enter: Mental&nbsp;models</h3>



<p>I’ve long been skeptical about mental models since (1) they’re all the rage now and (2) no one seems to be able to explain in concrete terms what they are. A dangerous combination.</p>



<p>It turned out my doubt was due to ignorance on my part.</p>



<p>A mental model,&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;tells us, is</p>



<blockquote><p>An explanation of someone’s thought process about how something works in the real world.&nbsp;<strong>It is a representation of the surrounding world</strong>, the relationships between its various parts and a person’s intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences.</p></blockquote>



<p>Every problem and situation is just another ‘one of those’ — another one of a certain type.&nbsp;Figuring out what type it is and reflecting on principles for handling that type of issue will help you do a better job.</p>



<p>On the conscious level, mental models allow us to ‘fit’ different possible interpretations onto reality to see if it is ‘one of those’.</p>



<p>For example,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Hanlon’s Razor</a>&nbsp;one should&nbsp;“never attribute tomalice&nbsp;that which is adequately explained by carelessness”.&nbsp;When your coworker hands you crappy slides for the presentation you have to give in five minutes — what’s going on here?</p>



<p>Which ‘one of those’ do we have here?</p>



<p>You can see&nbsp;how different mental models in our heads will cause us to reach different conclusions about the correct interpretation of the situation.</p>



<p>A mental model is a mental, simplified&nbsp;depiction&nbsp;of how something works.They are how we order complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason.&nbsp;They help us filter, organize and understand.</p>



<p>For instance, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Pareto distribution</a>,&nbsp;“for many events,&nbsp;roughly 80% of the …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><div data-elementor-type="wp-post" data-elementor-id="8833" data-elementor-settings="[]"><div><div><section data-id="3d1c630" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="739a184" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="7afbc26" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><b>TL;DR:</b></p><blockquote><p><span>EKS Distro = kops + Kubernetes fixes + aws-iam-authenticator</span></p></blockquote><p><span>AWS has recently launched </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-amazon-eks-distro/"><span>EKS Distro</span></a><span>, the Kubernetes distribution that powers its managed Kubernetes offer, called Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). This means that customers no longer have to choose between EKS (as a managed service) and some other Kubernetes setup. Instead, they can choose between EKS as a service managed by AWS or managed by themselves. The application hosted on top won’t observe any difference.</span></p><p><span>Being big fans of Kubernetes distributions, to the point where we open-sourced our own </span><a href="https://compliantkubernetes.io/"><span>Compliant Kubernetes</span></a><span>, we took EKS Distro for a spin.</span></p><p><span>For those unfamiliar with the term, a distribution is to Kubernetes just like a distribution is to Linux. As the saying goes, Kubernetes is a powerful engine, but you need to build a car around it. In other words, a Kubernetes distribution is Kubernetes with a chosen configuration and a chosen set of addons. For example, Kubernetes is </span><a href="https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/news/252487963/Kubernetes-security-defaults-prompt-upstream-dilemma"><span>not secure by default, nor by itself</span></a><span>. Hence, a security-focused Kubernetes distribution will configure Kubernetes with restrictive PodSecurityPolicies and add intrusion detection addons.</span></p><p><span>Specifically, a Kubernetes distribution consists of three parts:</span></p><ol><li><span>A procedure — either code or documentation — to create </span><b>infrastructure</b><span> necessary for a Kubernetes cluster, such as virtual machines, load balancers, network security policies, DNS records, etc. The distribution may impose a certain base operating system (OS) image or may cater to a large variety of base images.</span></li><li><span>A procedure to </span><b>bootstrap</b><span> Kubernetes control plane components onto the control plane and worker nodes, in particular the apiserver, scheduler, kubelets and controller manager. Most distributions come with a cloud integration. This means that Kubernetes Services of type LoadBalancer and PersistentVolumeClaims automatically work.</span></li><li><span>A procedure to set up </span><b>addons</b><span>, such as Ingress controllers, certificate managers, intrusion detection, custom authentication, to name a few.</span></li></ol><p><span>EKS Distro launched with a </span><a href="https://distro.eks.amazonaws.com/"><span>healthy documentation and code</span></a><span>. You have several ways of using it:</span></p><ul><li><b>Build it from scratch</b><span>: The documentation and code are sufficient to build EKS Distro from scratch, specifically, the container images that make up the Kubernetes control plane components.</span></li><li><b>Start EKS-D</b><span>: If you don’t need to customize control plane images, then you can use the pre-build images by AWS from their public container registry.</span></li></ul><p><span>Our next observation is related to the level of automation of EKS Distro. Let’s take an automation scale with a few levels:</span></p><ol><li><span>Prose-only documentation.</span></li><li><span>Documentation with copy-paste-able code snippets.</span></li><li><span>Command that does everything.</span></li><li><span>API that does everything.</span></li></ol><p><span>EKS Distro is level 2: It focuses on providing a lot of documentation and copy-paste-able. code snippets. However, if you are the “TL;DR” type, EKS Distro will disappoint you. </span><b>You need to carefully read the prose to understand how to use the next code snippet.</b><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While this could be seen as a weakness, we find it a strength. Instead of pre-baking and imposing many decisions on the user, </span><b>EKS Distro is rather un-opinionated</b><span>. It allows the user to control which decisions to take at each step, while at the same time offering “it just works” defaults.</span></p><p><span>Next observation: </span><b>EKS Distro is built on top of </b><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops"><b>kops</b></a><span>. Comparing kops and </span><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray"><span>kubespray</span></a><span> — the two dominant open source Kubernetes cluster life-cycle managers — deserves its own article. For now, suffice to say that, correctly setting up EKS Distro requires a fair knowledge of kops for things like setting up AWS IAM roles and the DNS stack accordingly. Even small mistakes with kops — e.g., not setting up the DNS stack correctly — will make you unsuccessful with deploying EKS Distro. On the upside, if you are already familiar with kops, EKS Distro will feel like a fairly thin and unobtrusive layer on top.</span></p><p><span>As said before, EKS Distro is a fairly thin layer on top of kops. It basically adds three things:</span></p><ol><li><span>A bit of automation on top of kops.</span></li><li><span>A few fixes for Kubernetes.</span></li><li><span>The AWS IAM authenticator.</span></li></ol><p><span>Let us focus on the last two.</span></p><p><span>The control plane images </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backporting"><span>backport</span></a><span> a few Kubernetes fixes that are critical for EKS Distro. These fixes are available in the main branch of the Kubernetes project, however, backporting them allows AWS to provide these without waiting for a new Kubernetes release.</span></p><p><span>The AWS IAM authentication enables authentication with the Kubernetes cluster using AWS credentials. This does make sense for users who want to leverate AWS IAM roles for everything, including on-prem Kubernetes clusters. However, for users who aim for a cloud-agnostic strategy, </span><a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex"><span>OpenID</span></a><span> is a more portable Kubernetes authentication solution.</span></p><p><span>Have I already mentioned how thin EKS Distro is? We were surprised to discover that it does not include an Ingress controller, a certificate manager or a log forwarded. Truly un-opinionated!</span></p><p><span>While the ride was pretty smooth, we did bump into a few minor issues:</span></p><ol><li><span>EKS Distro assumes the us-west-2 region in several places. Fortunately, due to its light packaging, fixing the scripts to deploy in my favorite region, eu-north-1, was a no-brainer.</span></li><li><span>EKS Distro blocked the first time I tried it out, due to my laptop being entropy starved and /dev/random being stuck. A simple change, to take randomness from /dev/urandom fixed the problem. In fact, our </span><a href="https://github.com/aws/eks-distro/commit/c1225ea8482db2c69da6b554e280a0365504f590"><span>Pull Request (PR)</span></a><span> was merged within hours. So another point goes to EKS Distro for being very welcoming.</span></li></ol><p><span>Good:</span></p><ul><li><span>Un-opinionated, thin, easy to modify for one’s own needs.</span></li><li><span>Based on kops and will feel familiar to existing kops users.</span></li><li><span>Comes with AWS IAM authentication.</span></li></ul><p><span>Bad:</span></p><ul><li><span>“No battery included, not even removable ones”. EKS Distro has no Ingress controller, no certificate manager, no log forwarder.</span></li><li><span>Minor gotchas, but overall a smooth ride.</span></li></ul><p><span>Ugly:</span></p><ul><li><span>Nothing really. A great AWS project, as expected.</span></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today we are going to explore five big hacks that took place in 2020. First we'll cover two hacks that targeted Norwegian companies Sykehuspartner and NHH. Then we'll take a look at a hack that targeted the Danish company ISS. To wrap things up we'll cover what is probably the two most high profile hacks of 2020: the Twitter phish and the CWT ransom.</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Sykehuspartner</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hyMVdWh/Skjermbilde-2020-11-20-kl-07-30-21.png" alt="Sykehuspartner logo" title="Sykehuspartner"></p>
<p>Sykehuspartner deliver IT, HR, project and logistics services to all hospitals in the Norwegian health region Helse Sør-Øst (Health South East). It manages vital IT systems for the hospitals, both clinical and administrative applications, as well as infrastructure and networks.</p>
<p>On august 22 2020 several of Sykehuspartners applications became the target of an unknown malicious actor. Only one hospital (Sykehuset Innlandet) was targeted in this attack. Not much is known by the type and scope of the attack, except for what type of data might possibly have been stolen. The potentially stolen data might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about the deceased</li>
<li>Health information about patients from research projects</li>
<li>Personal information about employees</li>
<li>Name and social security number (fødselsnummer) of students</li>
</ul>
<p>From reports about the incident, we know that 25 patients and several employees have been notified of personal information having been stolen. Following the attack, the hospital has carried out a forced password change for all employees.</p>

</ul>
<h2>NHH</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/sjQnhNF/imageedit-10-3684463812.png" alt="NHH logo" title="NHH logo"></p>
<p>In august this year, Norges handelshøgskole (NHH, English: Norwegian School of Economics), experienced a data heist. The school is one of the leading business schools in Europe and is located in the city of Bergen. </p>
<p>Usernames and passwords of both students and employees was compromised. The break in was discovered when the stolen credentials were uploaded to a “hacker” forum. The attack targeted a known vulnerability in an old version of the VPN service called Pulse Secure. An updated version that patches this vulnerability has been available since April 2019. But NHH is decommissioning the service and has thus been neglecting to update it. All students and employees were asked to change their passwords after the incident.</p>

</ul>
<h2>ISS</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XDJVmgQ/imageedit-12-3910494650.png" alt="ISS logo" title="ISS logo"></p>
<p>In the middle of February this year, ISS was hit by a ransomware attack. ISS is a global facility services company, founded in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company has 450,000 employees.</p>
<p>The ransomware was a massive malware attack across IT-systems and networks. Immediately after the attack was discovered, IT-access was removed to isolate the indicent. As reported by the company. Regardless of the actions taken, the company had to write down and change big parts of the IT-infrastructure. It is estimated that the attack will cost the company between 750 and 1340 million Norwegian kroner (NOK).</p>
<p>It was reported that customer data was not stolen.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>Twitter, you know, the social media platform? Yes, that one. In July this year, it was hit with a phishing campaign that was used to target high-profile individuals, like Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Twitter stated that "This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems".</p>
<p>The phish was used to get access to certain high-profile accounts. The compromised accounts were used to promote a bitcoin scam.</p>

</ul>
<h2>CWT</h2>
<p>CWT is a travel management company that manages business travel, meetings and so on. The 27 of July this year, the company was hit by a massive ransomware attack that knocked 30,000 computers offline. The hackers claimed to have stolen two terabytes of files, including financial reports, security documents and employees’ personal data. CWT paid $4.5 million to the hackers to restore their systems. </p>
<p>One of the fascinating things about this hack was that the negotiation chat, where the company and the hackers met to talk, was left open to the public after the negotiations ended. This gives us a never before seen insight into how the negotiations between hacker and hacked works. As many others have noted after the chat became public, it is rarely advised to actually pay the hackers like CWT did. This is, of course, because of the precedence it sets and that the chance of getting scamed is very high.</p>

</ul>

<p>This is of course not a complete list of all the major hacks that were reported in 2020. It sure has been a very active year in this regard. As you can see, there are many ways of being vulnerable on the internet. If you want to better understand how to prevent some of these things happening to you, take a look at the previous three posts:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
I got involved in wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASpencerk&amp;action=history&amp;year=2006&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter=">very early</a>.

It was one of the most revealing things in my life, watching it being laughed at, to become the center of, and authority of, human knowledge.

It was obvious that it was working. The lag of this was 5 years or more.

Wikipedia was an experiment that proved itself, when every graph was going up and to the right.

Some of the graphs are now going down.

</p><p>Wikipedia's Markup language:</p><p>
One of the central design decisions in wikipedia is that <span>all information</span> is stored in an editable document.
This poses a huge amount of challenges for caching and scaling wikipedia. It's not a database, that you can run a script on.

Worse though, is that all of it's content is buried in this ad-hoc, impenetrable, opaque, and mostly <i>un-parsable</i> format.

If wikipedia had used <i>markdown</i>, <i>html</i>, or some <i>standardised format</i>, any parser would flip-it into other future formats.

Wikipedia's custom language is just <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia/blob/master/README.md">clearly insane</a>, undocumented, hopeless.
There's a team <span>(of great people!)</span> at wikimedia <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/parsoid/">constantly working on it</a>, and unable to make any backwards-incompatible changes. I imagine their lives are hard.
People are creating weird new syntax concepts all the time.

Here's the markup for the <b>first sentence</b> of the Albert Einstein wikipedia article:
<img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/albert-einstein.jpg">

The first wikimedia parser was called <a href="https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/">mwparserfromhell</a>. DBPedia, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/LOD_Cloud_2014-08.svg">the center of the semantic web</a>, after years of work, has only ever offered limited parsing from categories and infoboxes.
Much of the early-years at <b>Freebase</b> were spent trying, with limited-success, at parsing wikipedia.
I've spent <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia/graphs/commit-activity">years</a> trying to parse it myself.
I'm a shitty programmer. <i>WolframAlpha</i>, and many other serious companies are using my parser,
       which is <span>down right hilarious</span>.

<img id="rtl" src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/rtl.jpg"></p><p>yes, arabic editors must write it in right-to-left, <a href="https://youtu.be/OCQd02hORJQ">somehow</a>.</p><p>

It's hard to describe how much of a serious problem this is.
Wikipedia's content is never going to go anywhere, or be used by anything.

Wikipedia may slowly die-off - like myspace, or geocities - but it's information will not go on.

Play-around in the official wikipedia android app. Many pages are unreadable.
There is a good-deal of <i>clearfix</i>, and <span>table-span</span> logic, mushed right into the syntax.
Most developers will not touch this kind of stuff.

There will be no move to a wikipedia 2.

</p><p>Static copies of dynamic content</p><p>
The contents of the english wikipedia dump are as follows, (as of Jan 2019):
</p><p>
of the <b>14m</b> records in the wikipedia dump, only <b>5.5m</b> (40%) are public-facing articles.

   <span>Yup.</span>
This does not include deleted pages, or old versions, either.


<b>Redirects:</b>
A computer-science 101 problem is to implement a fuzzy string matching. There's usually a section in the textbook about it:
</p><div>
<p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/clr.jpg"></p><p>oh yes, right here in chapter 34.</p><p>
there are <b>8,550,441</b> redirects in wikipedia.
They are mostly typos, or case-changes, and are mostly created by hand, every day.

<span>and what happens to a redirect when a page gets deleted, or merged, or spli - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot">Yup</a>.</span>
</p></div>

<p><b>Talk pages:</b>
Wikipedia has 35m registered users. When a user joins, a bot will often send them a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Welcome">{{welcome}}</a> template.
Sometimes nice users will do it themselves. It looks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kj_aviator">like this</a>.

   - when this happens, this creates a new user page, with <b>a copy of this text</b> each time.

There are millions of examples of this in the dump. The same text, verbatim over and over.

The same process happens with <b>'Wikiprojects'</b>. Bots go around adding templates, by creating a talk page, and adding a template to it.

The same process happens with <i>deleted pages, fair-use warnings, and some bot edits</i>. Each time an edit happens, a new page is created, and boilerplate text gets thrown into it.
Resulting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:XTC_discography">this</a>:

So let's get things straight:
in <b>1993</b>, a small japanese game company created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen">this videogame</a>:
</p><p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/thunder.jpg">
</p><p>
• In <b>2008</b>, a wikipedia user created the article with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen&amp;oldid=205879125">two sentences and a link</a>.

• In the past 10 years since, the page has been edited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen&amp;oldid=205879125">26 times by bots</a>.

• this created a Talk page filled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:A-Rank_Thunder_Tanjouhen">11 automated sentences</a>.

A huge bulk of the wikipedia database is this boilerplate text. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:764_Gedania">this asteroid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:NS3_(HCV)">this virus</a>, or this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Oceania_Judo_Union">judo club</a>.

... and remember, if we wanted to change this text, we'd have to go and edit each of these pages - and because this syntax is so nuts, <b>bots have a hard time</b> making even simple stylistic changes, without ruining a whole page.

oh, so what happens to these auto-generated talk pages when a page is deleted, merged, or spli- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:578_Happelia">yup</a>

<b id="automation">Automated articles:</b>
There is a lot of disagreement about how much of wikipedia is generated by bots, and if this matters.
There's no way of knowing. Any boring-themed article with a few sentences, a reference, and an infobox probably won't get deleted.
So nothing's stopping you from spitting-out articles from a <b>database of enzymes</b>, or <b>college rugby players</b>, or season statistics for defunct sports teams.

</p><p>
I have nothing against bots, I have nothing against the long-tail, but I think automated article-creation is responsible for a good amount of the wikipedia's claimed growth, over the past few years.
We need to be up-front about this, if we're talking about the health of the project.

Here's the distribution of words in english wikipedia, by the size of articles:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>ok hey,</span> I don't mind that the wm developers didn't develop a fancy search index, in 2001.
That's fine.
Nobody could have predicted the success and scale of wikipedia early on.
</p><p>
What angers me though
         - <i>and it should anger you</i> -
is that these problems has not been fixed in the <b>18 years</b> since.

God damn them.

Well-meaning people are wasting their time on this <span>everyday</span>.

Any <i>startup job-interview</i> asks questions about implementing a system like this.
Any CS grad can create a lucene index, to handle typos.
Some of it is complicated. Some of it is basic competence.

<span>It's annoying to whine</span>,
     but at some point, we're right to be angry at wikipedia.

            that it cannot find 2nd gear,
     when the rest of the world is zipping-along.
</p>
</div>

<p>Wikidata</p><p>
In 2007 Danny Hillis raised $57 million dollars,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/metawebtechnologies#section-overview">[1]</a> bought-out the <b>entire</b> MIT semantic-web group,
hired 50~ employees, (including <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-giannandrea/">this person</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toby-Segaran/e/B001I9RQVS">this person</a>, <a href="http://davidhuynh.net/">this person</a>) and got an office in the mission.

They reconciled all of wikipedia, the entire musicbrainz database, the entire open-library database, the tvdb database, and all of wordnet.
They signed a (massive) deal to import <b>all collections of the stanford library</b>.<a href="https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub152/stanford-linked-data-workshop/">[2]</a>

They hit <b>high-90%</b> classification of all <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/44818.pdf"><b>50 million</b></a> entities (wikipedia has 5m)
They were evaluated at very-high 90's accuracy by several third-parties.

Facebook, Bing, Amazon, and Google all began using its data in nearly real-time in their search products.

This was one of the largest and most ambitious software projects in history.

In 2010 freebase was bought for a whack of money, and then killed-off by google.
When google announced they would be shutting down the API, they offered to import all of this data to a new wikimedia project called <span>wikidata</span>.

Wikidata was 4-or-5 Lua developers, in Germany, on a few research grants.

</p><p>and they said no. 😐</p><p>

so they said this data didn't meet it's guidelines regarding sourced data.

    <i>... aren't you pulling information <b>from wikipedia</b> blindly?</i>

    <i>... what about your (~60%) unreferenced facts?</i>

    <i>... aren't you <b>multiplying vandalism</b> from multi-lingual wikipedias?</i>

    <i>... how do you use, or verify references?</i>

They built a tool to <b>hand-transfer each freebase fact</b>, which if you have a calculator, may seem funny.
<span>(at 10 people clicking full-time, would have taken 10 million years)</span>

8 years later, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a> remains tiny, buggy, unused, and worse - <i>majority unreferenced</i>.
I mean, they're pulling their data from wikipedia, which gets vandalized almost every minute!

It's accomplished very-little from its 5-year plan. They write academic papers.
They still don't really offer a rest api.
       ...creating new types or properties is I think, possible? or it's supposed to be...

It's got few of the safeguards, momentum, features, and ambition that Freebase had a full decade ago.
If wikidata was a company, it would not exist anymore, and you wouldn't have heard of it.

But Wikimedia places <b>banner-ads</b> on <span>hours of eye-blistering user-created content</span>,
begging children, students, and poor-people for money.
and they choose to be this petty, pithy and behind-the-times.

</p><p>Category-system</p><p>
It's a beautiful idea, to classify information with category-scheme, <a href="https://humane.computer/review-the-science-of-managing-our-digital-stuff/">until it falls-apart</a>.

<a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html"><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/shirky-category.jpg"></a>
Wikipedia has many-thousands of categories. They <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dump_reports/Category_cycles">loop-around</a> all-over the place.

</p><p>
People:
    → Musicians
        → Singers
              → American_Idol
                  → Books_about_American_Idol
</p><p>
or worse:
</p><p><span>Albanian language</span>:
    → Albanian-speaking countries and territories
      → Kosovo (region)
        → Kosovo
          → Kosovar society
            → Languages of Kosovo
              → <span>Albanian language</span>
</p><p>
if you're ever too-cheerful, and wanting to feel depressed, have a visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/Today">Categories for deletion/Today</a>,
where you'll see precious human-life spent debating whether <b>'Category:Goth'</b> should exist, if it is a genre of music, if it's is a fashion-style, etc.

Work is being ravenously deleted all the time. You'll get sad thinking about it.

</p><p>Templates</p>
<div>
  <p>what about all this stuff →</p>
  <p><img src="http://blog.spencermounta.in/2019/wikipedias-in-trouble/assets/infobox.png">
</p></div><p>
You're right.

Wikipedia has good structured-data in <b>infoboxes, lists, tables, citations, etc</b>.

The issue is, as of Feb 2019, Wikipedia has <b>634,755 different kinds of templates</b> (see this <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/spencer-scratch/allTemplates-2018-10-26.tsv">21mb download</a>).

Yes, there are all different.

Yes, there are <span>templates-within-templates-with-escaping-with-escaping</span>.

Even if you parse them perfectly, how do you know that for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:HorseDeathYear">Template:HorseDeathYear</a>, the third parameter is the <b>birth date of the horse</b>, and the fourth is the birth-month?

see, for example:

• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:16-Team_bracket_templates">Tennis Brackets vs Table Tennis Brackets</a>

• '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Birth_date_and_age">Birth_date_and_age</a>' vs '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Birth-date_and_age">Birth-date_and_age</a>'.

• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Trapezoidnotation">a template for a Trapezoid unicode symbol</a>
It's just a straight-up mess.

If you're thinking, <i>gee wikipedia editors must feel exhausted and stupid</i> - you're right.

<p>Live image of ascender’s taking off from the lander. Photo: CNSA</p><p>The Chinese national flag shines an even brighter red from moon, and from now on it will be a grand reminder for stargazers from all over the world of the excitement and inspiration we felt from Apollo missions more than half a century ago.</p><p>Having packed samples of soil and rocks from the Earth's only natural satellite within 19 hours after its smooth soft landing, the ascender of the Chinese spacecraft using the lander as a launch pad, took off from the moon surface, according to the China National Space Administration Thursday evening.</p><p>The Chinese space agency said in a statement the CNSA sent to the Global Times on Thursday evening, the Chang'e-5 ascender has successfully taken off from the lunar surface with soil and rock samples, and sent to the lunar orbiter some 15 kilometers away with the 3,000-newton thrust engine.&nbsp;</p><p>Right before the lift-off of Chang'e-5's ascender from lunar surface, the lander vehicle of the Chinese spacecraft unfolded the five-star red national flag, a genuine one made from fabrics, marking a first in the country's aerospace history.</p><p>The probe's successful launch from the lunar surface, as some observers believe, marks the completion of probably the most challenging step in the mission.</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-03/4239fa1e-7448-4bb3-aa85-a3f2c1a3bf08.jpeg"></center>
<p>Flags on the moon Infographic: GT</p><p>"This is the first attempt in China's aerospace history to lift off from a celestial body other than Earth," chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine Wang Ya'nan said. "The launch is a major test, in that the vehicle had to rely entirely on automatic maneuvers without any ground command."</p><p>Wang explained to the Global Times that the launch from the moon could not afford any time delay. "If the probe receives a command from the Earth to help it control the separation, altitude and speed, there will be at least one second delay, which will put the process in great danger."</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-04/dcc27158-a339-47cd-911b-ab2c6000a08c.jpg"></center>
<p>Photo: CNSA</p><p>Another factor that posed a challenge to the lunar takeoff is that the lander-ascender combination might sit on a slope, which would bring uncertainty to the probe's altitude and position. It means that the probe must ensure its own altitude is precise enough to enter the designated orbit through automatic decision-making, according to a statement sent to the Global Times from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC.)</p><p>Chinese researchers have conducted numerous ground simulations to verify the takeoff, but the particularities of the lunar environment have made the verifications difficult, the CASC said.&nbsp;</p><p>The rendezvous and docking, if successful, could be of great value to other deep-space or even manned missions in the future, the significance of which would be no less than the Apollo mission, once the name card of human lunar exploration activities during the Cold War, Chinese analysts said.</p><p>"It will be a milestone for China's aerospace development," Song Zhongping, an aerospace expert and TV commentator, said, calling it "a foresighted practice that lays a technological foundation for future deep-space explorations."</p><p>It will also verify the viability of manned lunar landing missions, and even the construction of a lunar research base, or Mars missions, he told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-03/7efca0cc-975e-491f-8f76-05cb5b7bbfe6.jpg"></center>

The re-entry capsule will then carry the lunar sample and bring them to a designated site in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region by mid-December.</p><center><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-04/2c167277-3ccb-4a13-8984-c8fcb52b8d88.jpeg"></center>

<p>Chang'e-5 lunar probe carries out automatic sample collecting work on moon surface. Photo: CNSA</p><p><strong>Flag mission accomplished&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong><br>More stylish than previous Chang'e landing missions, the lander of Chang'e-5 displayed the five-star red national flag, made of genuine fabric, on the moon.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chinese national flag made its moon debut in December 2013 during the country's first lunar landing mission of Chang'e-3, and it was recorded in pictures from the spacecraft's lander and its rover Yutu-1 took for each other.</p><p>Chang'e-4 lander and rover Yutu-2 brought China's national flag to the dark side of the moon, as the Chinese spacecraft made a historic landing in the unvisited region in January 2019.</p><p>The flags that Chang'e-3 and -4 carried were in the form of the craft's coatings, rather than an actual flag. Chinese space technological development has allowed it to take a step forward in the Chang'e-5 mission, the third consecutive safe soft landing on the moon in seven years.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chang'e-5 flag presentation system was developed by China Space Sanjiang Group under the State-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, better known as the CASIC.</p><p>To ensure a complete and smooth unfolding of the flag, the system adopted a secondary rod-type structure, which is applied in solar panel extending for satellites and other types of spacecraft, CASIC developers told the Global Times on Thursday.</p><center>
</center><p>The system weight has been controlled at around one kilogram, and all connecting parts of the system have been given special protection, such as coldness-resistance measures, to help overcome unfavorable lunar surface conditions, including a drastic temperature difference on the moon ranging from 150 C to minus 150 C, Li Yunfeng, the project leader, said in a statement the CASIC company sent to the Global Times.</p><p>"An ordinary national flag on Earth would not survive the severe lunar environment," so the research team also spent more than a year selecting the proper materials to make sure the eventual flag would be strong enough, survive under extreme coldness and heat and capable of showing the fine colors of the national flag and remain so forever, said Cheng Chang, another leading member of the developer team.</p><p>The national flag, 2,000 millimeters wide and 900 millimeter tall, represents cutting-edge technology, they said.</p><p>How to preserve its original color and shape are the two most crucial questions in designing a national flag that must survive more than 380,000 kilometers away from Earth, under extreme temperatures and radiation during its journey, Wang Ya'nan told the Global Times.&nbsp;</p><p>To get a sense of how difficult the task it is, five of the six flags (except for the one Apollo 11 placed on the moon) brought to the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s during six US crewed moon landings, have been bleached white due to decades-long solar radiation, although they are reportedly still standing and casting shadows.</p><p>Many reports say the Apollo 11 flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during lift-off.</p><p>The Soviet Union was the first country to imprint its national symbol on the moon, with a football-sized metal ball, carved with its national flag, full of explosives, smashing to the lunar ground in the Luna 2 mission in 1959.</p><p>Compared to such a method, China has a more advanced approach, which also greatly increased the complexity of the design, Wang noted.</p><center><strong><img src="https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-12-01/bb881cd5-4e1a-4040-8160-b364db57d633.jpeg"></strong></center>

"But China is about to showcase our own national flag as well, which I believe is a recognition of the achievements and breakthroughs that we have made, which will be the most valuable thing."</p><p>Some readers have left comments under images and video of the Chang'e-5 landing published on the Global Times twitter account in recent days, saying they would not be convinced and acknowledge China's achievements until the lander takes an actual photo of the American flag planted by the previous Apollo mission.&nbsp;</p><p>"Is it an original video, or a TikTok post taken in the Gobi desert," one Twitter user wrote. "Where is the lunar dust while landing," another asked.</p><p>The landing was closely followed by space agencies from all over the world, and the European Space Agency, Russia's Roscosmos and …</p></div></div></div>

<p>If you swung by my Twitter profile in the last week, you probably saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/olflh5jfvk5clb15p5z9.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the precise causes of me being locked out, but I have several abnormal usage factors that probably put me on the high end of Twitter's bot risk system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I currently live in Singapore but am primarily active during US hours and have a US Phone Number</li>
  <li>I post about 30 tweets a day, probably on the high end of most Twitter users. (30 sounds like a lot, but it's mostly replies, and I maybe post 2-3 actual top tweets a day)</li>
  <li>I switch between and manage three different accounts (<a href="https://twitter.com/Coding_Career">Coding Career</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SvelteSociety">Svelte Society</a>) multiple times a day</li>
  <li>As far as I know I have not been reported on, but I do have people that strongly dislike me and they may have used the report button against me. Can't rule that out as a factor.</li>
  <li>Anecdotally <a href="https://twitter.com/b2m9/status/1295748479713779712?s=20">some IPs seem more risky</a> than others - I also use a VPN for work which probably shows me jumping across multiple countries in a single day, which is certainly suspicious on the face of it</li>
  <li>I have also noticed I get verification checks more often when I use scheduled tweets.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you clicked through my scary profile you also saw this:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/6xjg8jxiwgidwffvwsnu.png" alt="Alt Text">
</p>
<p>I swear that I haven't mass unfollowed everybody! Most people see this and assume that I used some script to mass unfollow everyone and therefore got flagged as a bot. <strong>The reality is the exact opposite</strong> - I got flagged as a bot, and by default Twitter temporarily removes all follows.</p>
<p>It will be restored once I regain my Twitter account (I've filed a support ticket and am trying to reach out to friends at Twitter for help), but this is the exact user experience I wanted to talk about for this post.</p>
<p>First, a quick detour for a personal anecdote.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee"><a href="#aside-my-time-as-a-cuban-detainee">Aside: My Time As A Cuban Detainee</a></h2>
  <p>A long time ago I visited Havana with some college friends. Right after landing we headed into a restaurant, all our luggage in tow. After we were done eating, I stood up and turned around - only to find all my luggage gone! Someone had stolen it while we were eating. The restaurant staff of course swore up and down that they had not seen who had taken it.</p>
  <p>Losing all your luggage on day 1 of a weeklong trip sucks, but what is worse is that <strong>my passport was in my luggage</strong>. I needed it to head back to the US at the end of my trip.</p>
  <p>If you've never lost a passport while traveling before, it's a quick trip to bureaucratic hell. If your country has an embassy where you are traveling, you can usually get it reissued in the embassy. But we were in <em>Cuba</em> - and my country had no embassy here. We reported my case to the authorities, but they had no idea what to do. I was an edge case. Worse still, because I said I had come from the US and couldn't produce any papers to prove my identity, I was detained at the police headquarters for questioning on suspicion of being a spy. (<em>I was never really at any risk - being Asian and speaking poor Spanish, I would have made for a pretty lousy spy</em>).</p>
  <p>There was a lot to figure out over the ensuing <em>month</em> of my ordeal - money, lodging, language barriers, administrative hurdles. My family and friends hit the panic button for me and my case reached the ears of both Arlen Specter on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and George Yeo, the Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister. We eventually worked it out, but every night for 4 weeks I would wander up and down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malec%C3%B3n,_Havana">the Malecón</a>, listening to the crashing waves, not knowing when I could ever leave the country. If I could swim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southernmost_point_buoy">the 90 miles to Key West</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_feet,_dry_feet_policy">dry my feet</a>, I might theoretically make it back to the US on my own.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3i8nh2cgaoj3jlrl9ecm.jpg" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>But most of all, I thought a lot about <strong>the humanity of having a piece of paper be more important than the human it represents</strong>. I could be physically standing in front of the immigration officer with a lie detector test on and steadfastly stating all manner of provable personal detail, and they would not let me through unless I had a small piece of paper the size of my hand.</p>
  <p>We do this a lot - passports, voter registration cards, national ID systems, licenses, and insurance proofs - mostly because some humans are untrustworthy and try to exploit the system.</p>
  <p>But we often fail to design for people who are innocent and simply don't fit the system in some way.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human"><a href="#the-consequences-of-not-being-provably-human">The Consequences of Not Being Provably Human</a></h2>
  <p>Twitter has a way in which they expect you to verify you are human - you should get a call or text message with a code, that you then enter to prove humanity. This is what I normally get (about once every 1-2 months), and I can receive text messages from Twitter, so I can usually prove humanity with no issue.</p>
  <p>This time, for some reason, I am on a code path that doesn't offer a text message option, and Twitter somehow doesn't make international US number calls, leading to this infinite loop that I think is a bug:</p>
  
  <p>As a result of this unfortunate design:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My friends think I mass unfollowed them, because Twitter temporarily reduced my follow count to 0</li>
    <li>People who DM me think I am ignoring them, because Twitter doesn't inform them that I am currently locked out</li>
    <li>None of my past tweets show up at all in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aswyx&amp;src=typed_query">Twitter search</a>, which is problematic because I <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1245281982797373441?lang=en">use Twitter as a Second Brain</a>. If you read any of my blogposts, you will see that the rich link density of my references mainly come from taking notes in public over an extended period of time.</li>
    <li>I was unable to engage in the normal personal and professional activity I would do during Black Friday and AWS Re:invent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I've filed a support ticket with Twitter, but you can imagine that support for a 330 million user service isn't very responsive. People who have been through this tell me the only way to resolve it is to hit up a Twitter employee to get past the masses of unrelated and less urgent support issues.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="humans-proving-humanity-to-machines"><a href="#humans-proving-humanity-to-machines">Humans Proving Humanity To Machines</a></h2>
  <p>In the grand scheme of things, I know this is minor. I've actually taken it as a welcome social media detox, which I usually take voluntarily in December anyways. But when it's not on my terms, I lose the ability to manage the personal and professional relationships I've painstakingly built up over the past 3-4 years.</p>
  <p>Above all, I think there's an <em>indignity</em> in humans having to prove to machines that they are human, and the error resolution mechanism is to send a ticket to a faceless and unresponsive support email, and the only real way to get around it is again to re-establish human connections.</p>
  <p>I think more about all the other ways that we as software developers and designers fail to honor the dignity of humans trying to interact with the systems we create.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence">In 2014</a>, Google pitted one of its machine learning algorithms against humans in solving the most distorted text CAPTCHAs: the computer got the test right 99.8 percent of the time, while the humans got a mere 33 percent. It doesn't impact everyone equally - if you as a sighted, able bodied user struggle with CAPTCHAs, imagine the elderly or differently abled. Most services do not offer any alternative resolution when you cannot prove you are human. This is a problem when your service has essentially killed off the offline alternative and is essential for their basic needs.</p>
  <p>In Eric Meyer's <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/25/designing-for-crisis-design-for-real-life/">Designing for Crisis</a>, he describes how an inaccessible hospital website nearly risked the life of his daughter. I shudder to think how it might be made worse by perfectly well meaning software engineers who don't think about the humanity of the failure path. Imagine if you had to log in to something to save your child's life, and it presented you with a CAPTCHA you couldn't pass.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today I want to give you an introduction to the programming language Elixir, some of its features and why you might want to check it out!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>The basics</h2>
<p>First things first: Elixir is a concurrent functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. It is inspired by many different languages where Ruby and Erlang are most obvious ones based on the syntax.</p>
<p>Elixir is a <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/elixir-in-the-type-system-quadrant/">strong, dynamically typed language</a>. This puts it in the same category as Ruby and Python and it has optional functionality for compile time type checking as well.Elixirs data structures are immutable, but variables can be reassigned/rebound. <sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup> This was a bit strange for me in that I got started with FP through Elm where there are no variables, just constants.</p>
<p>Elixir inherits a lot its data structures and related syntax from Erlang which in many ways is its biggest influence. <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2013/08/08/elixir-design-goals/">Elixir Design Goals</a> describes the relation to Erlang like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elixir is meant to be compatible with the Erlang VM and the existing ecosystem. When we talk about Erlang, we can break it into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A functional programming language, called Erlang</li>
<li>A set of design principles, called OTP (Open Telecom Plaform)</li>
<li>The Erlang Virtual Machine, referred to as EVM or BEAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Elixir runs in the same virtual machine and is compatible with OTP. Not only that, all the tools and libraries available in the Erlang ecosystem are also available in Elixir, simply because there is no conversion cost from calling Erlang from Elixir and vice-versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great feature of Elixir that we will talk more about later.</p>
<p>As for other inspirations Elixir has docstrings from Python, polymorphism and protocols from Clojure, macros and meta-programming from different Lisps, just to name a few. <sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>As I said, Elixir is a concurrent functional programming language. For the functional part it means that Elixir mainly uses functions and modules for code structure and has other features that are associated with functional languages. We'll talk about the concurrent part later. </p>
<p>A hello world example in Elixir might look something like this:</p>
<div data-language="elixir"><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> HelloWorld
  <span>def</span> hello_world <span>do</span>
    IO<span>.</span>puts<span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define a module with a function that simply writes "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
<h2>Killer applications</h2>
<p>Many programming languages has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application">"killer apps"</a>; libraries, frameworks and use cases, that in themself are enough to justify the transition to the language or try it out. For Ruby it was the web framework Ruby on Rails and in many ways Elixir has its own Rails: Phoenix.</p>
<h3>Phoenix web framework</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> is inspired by Rails (the team originally behind Elixir was previously a Ruby shop) and was an early addition to the Elixir community. The creators of Phoenix has learned from years of Rails development and made their own opinions in addition to the natural changes needed when going from an object oriented language to a functional language.
Compared to Rails Phoenix has with the help of the Erlang VM great performance. Some of you might have heard about Phoenix' amazing <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/the-road-to-2-million-websocket-connections">2 million simultaneous web sockets</a> benchmark!</p>
<h3>The Nerves Project</h3>
<p>Another interesting project in the Elixir ecosystem is the embedded/IoT project <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. Nerves makes it possible to use Elixir code to create embedded system where previously you would have had to use a low level language like C. This does not stop you from bringing your own code (like C, C++, Python, Rust, and more) while using Nerves as a platform for your IoT project.
The project web site says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nerves is a complete IoT platform and infrastructure for you to build and deploy maintainable embedded systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The BEAM and OTP</h2>
<p>When talking about the advantages of Elixir it is hard to not talk about the advantages of Erlang and its virtual machine, the BEAM (Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine). It is in many ways the biggest selling point for Elixir. We are now talking about the concurrent part of Elixir. Erlang and the BEAM has shown its resiliency over many years, exemplified in giving Ericsson 9 nines (99.9999999%) availability in their AXD301 switch.<sup><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></sup> It is known for its "let it break" philosophy and self-healing properties and by being compatible with Erlang, Elixir inherits a lot of these traits.</p>
<p>Elixirs creator, Jose Valim, attributes one of the motivational factors for the creation of Elixir to the rise of multi-core CPUs and the need to utilize these. Ruby and other languages with a global interperter lock (GIL) limits this, but the Erlang VM and the tools and design prinsiples of OTP have proven to be a great choice for creating concurrent, performant and resilient applications.</p>
<h3>Everything is a process</h3>
<p>Everything in the BEAM is a process. These are not OS processes, but lightweight processes which can be cheaply spawned and killed. In his PhD thesis the co-inventor of Erlang, Joe Armstrong, summarized Erlangs principles regarding processes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything is a process.</li>
<li>Processes are strongly isolated.</li>
<li>Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.</li>
<li>Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.</li>
<li>Processes have unique names.</li>
<li>If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.</li>
<li>Processes share no resources.</li>
<li>Error handling is non-local.</li>
<li>Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidenote: For some this may sound vaguely familiar. Some object oriented languages has had similar principles, but instead of processes they are applied to objects. Smalltalk is reported to be one of the inspirations to Erlang and it is fun to think about Erlang being a functional language but still be more object oriented than some object oriented languages. This is of course not the case as the definition of OOP has changed over time and Erlang is a functional language, but it is fun to ponder the similarities. 😄 Back to the main story! 😅</p>
<p>These unique principles for processes where they communicate through messages lays a great foundation for creating concurrent application, but there is one more piece to the puzzle: OTP.</p>
<h3>OTP - The Open Telecom Platform</h3>
<p>As with so many other parts of this article OTP is a big topic and could be a separate article, but I'll try make it short! Today the name is a bit strange but it was created by Ericsson for their telephone switches in the 80s and 90s so in that context in makes more sense.</p>
<p>OTP is an integral part of many Erlang applications. In essence OTP is a set of design principles and standards including tools and libraries to make it easier to create applications that adheres to them.<sup><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup></sup> </p>
<p>Since Elixir is compatible with OTP we can leverage these principles and technologies that has been battle tested in high-pressure and critical applications for decades!</p>
<h2>The take-away</h2>
<p>Luckily you don't need to understand or know much about Erlang, BEAM and OTP.
Without deep knowledge of these topics you can still reap the benefits of highly performing web applications and resilient IoT applications. It would certainly help but it is not a prerequisite. This is the great thing about Elixir: it is an approachable language with battle tested underpinnings! 💪</p>
<p>It might not be your idea of a perfect language. It is not mine either, but that does not stop me from using the great tools at my disposal. If you are all into Haskell or the likes it might not be something you would use and that is OK. Whatever your preferences are you might now know a little more about Elixir and Erlang and some more knowledge is always a good thing. 😄</p>
<p>If you would like to check Elixir out I recommend checking out <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">the official Getting started guide</a> or the interactive guide <a href="https://try-elixir.herokuapp.com/">Try Elixir</a> and then trying out a project with Phoenix or Nerves. Hands-on experience is always better than something you read on the internet! 🤓</p>
<p>Psst! By the way: there are other languages that run on the BEAM. <a href="https://lfe.io/">Lisp variants</a> and lately some work on <a href="https://gleam.run/">strong statically compiled ML-like languges</a> if you are into that!</p>

<p>I’ve used Google Fonts in prototypes and in 10M+ MAU products. It’s incredibly easy to get started with and provides an amazing font discovery. That’s also why it’s currently still used on over <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Google-Font-API">42M websites</a>!</p>
<p>This convenience has its price: Performance. Many <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/fast-google-fonts-with-cloudflare-workers/">have</a> <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d">already</a> <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/blog/web-font-performance#disadvantages-of-web-fonts">pointed</a> <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/self-hosted-fonts-vs-google-fonts-api/">out</a> the cost of multiple requests. If you want the remaining speed boost, then you’re best off downloading your used Google Fonts and self-host them.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. In fact it’s been advocated already for years. Even Google themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv-l3-tJgGk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=24m58s">advised others to self-host fonts</a> in their Google I/O ‘18 talk about web performance.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-fonts-vs-google-fonts">Self-hosting fonts vs Google Fonts</h2>
<p>By nature Google Fonts, even with all its font and CSS optimisations, can’t be faster than self-hosted fonts.</p>
<p>Sia wrote <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d">a great post</a> where she compared the performance between Google Fonts and self-hosted fonts without the impact of a CDN.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-performance-argument">The old performance argument</h2>
<p>So if the bottom-line performance is in self-hosting fonts’ favour: What was the argument that convinced us developers that Google Fonts is at least as performing as the self-host approach?</p>
<p>Google Fonts was designed to be distributed on a global CDN and reap the caching benefits from it. Users request fonts via said CDN. Chances are that they have downloaded the font resources at an earlier point already from a different site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[…] Our cross-site caching is designed so that you only need to load a font once, with any website, and we’ll use that same cached font on any other website that uses Google Fonts.”</p>
<p>— <a href="https://fonts.google.com/about">https://fonts.google.com/about</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="invalidating-the-old-performance-argument">Invalidating the old performance argument</h2>
<p>Since Chrome v86, released October 2020, cross-site resources like fonts can’t be shared on the same CDN anymore. This is due to the partitioned browser cache (Safari has had this for years already).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">this Google post</a> they explain what the partitioned browser cache is. It got only introduced to prevent a possible cross-site tracking mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="cache-partitioning-in-other-browsers">Cache partitioning in other browsers</h2>
<p>Safari really cares about privacy. It circumvented this very cross-site tracking attack for years already. Then finally comes Chrome. Other browsers that are based off Chromium, still need to signal or implement the feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Chrome</strong>: since v86 (October 2020)</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Safari</strong>: since 2013</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Firefox</strong>: planning to implement</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Edge</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Opera</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Brave</strong>: most likely soon</li>
<li>🚫 <strong>Vivaldi</strong>: most likely soon</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Google Fonts resources will be redownloaded for every website, regardless it being cached on the CDN. Self-host your fonts for better performance. The old performance argument is not valid anymore.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking this post out!</p>

<h3>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, we <a href="https://www.hkemploymentlaw.com/blog/confidentiality-agreements-can-be-unenforceable-covenants-not-to-compete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogged</a> about how a recent California appellate court decision effectively rendered an employee confidentiality agreement as an unenforceable covenant not to compete.</p>
<p>In a similar decision, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1852.ERRATA.11-20-2020_1689000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Whitewater West Indus., Ltd. v. Alleshouse</em></a>, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 36394, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently reversed a U.S. district court decision and held that under California law, an invention assignment provision signed by an employee that assigned to the employer patents developed after employment had ceased and without use of the employer’s trade secrets or confidential information violated California’s strong public policy against restraints on trade/covenants not to compete embodied in Section 16600 of the California Business and Professions Code.</p>
<p>In reaching this decision, the federal Court of Appeals rejected the argument that Section 2870(a) of the California Labor Code permits such invention assignments.</p>
<p>Section 16600 of the Business and Professions Code provides that “<em>Except as provided in this chapter, every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.</em>” There are statutory exceptions in sections 16601, 16602, and 16602.5 for restraint on trade/noncompete provisions relating to sales of businesses, dissolutions of partnerships or dissociations of a partner from a partnership, and a dissolution of a limited liability company or a termination of a member’s interest in a limited liability company, but not for noncompete provisions against former employees.</p>
<p>Section 2870(a) of the Labor Code provides that:</p>
<p><em>(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either:</em></p>
<p><em>(1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or</em><br>
<em>(2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.</em></p>
<p>In this case, while employed by Wave Loch, Inc., Richard Alleshouse had entered into an agreement with Wave Loch that contained the following assignment provisions:</p>
<p><em>a. Assignment: In consideration of compensation paid by Company, Employee agrees that all right, title and interest in all inventions, improvements, developments, trade-secret, copyrightable or patentable material that Employee conceives or hereafter may make or conceive, whether solely or jointly with others:</em><br>
<em>(a) with the use of Company’s time, materials, or facilities; or</em><br>
<em>(b) resulting from or suggested by Employee’s work for Company; or</em><br>
<em>(c) in any way connected to any subject matter within the existing or contemplated business of Company</em><br>
<em>shall automatically be deemed to become the property of Company as soon as made or conceived, and Employee agrees to assign to Company, its successors, assigns, or nominees, all of Employee’s rights and interests in said inventions, improvements, and developments in all countries worldwide. Employee’s obligation to assign the rights to such inventions shall survive the discontinuance or termination of this Agreement for any reason.</em></p>
<p>After Alleshouse had ceased being employed by Wave Loch, he and another party filed for and eventually were awarded three patents. Wave Loch’s successor in interest then filed suit, claiming that the invention assignment agreement had been breached by Alleshouse and that the patents should be assigned to Wave Loch’s successor. The district court agreed, and held that the agreement was valid under California law.</p>
<p>In overturning that decision, the Court of Appeals noted that the parties in the case agreed that the patented inventions had not been conceived until after Alleshouse had left Wave Loch’s employment and that no trade secrets or confidential information of Wave Loch had been used. The Court of Appeals reasoned that to give effect to the assignment provisions—which were unlimited in time and geography and would apply to a post-employment invention that was merely “suggested by” his work for Wave Loch—would significantly impair Alleshouse’s ability to work in his chosen profession.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals then determined that the assignment provisions in Section 2870(a) of the Labor Code only applied to inventions conceived during employment. To hold otherwise, “to authoriz[e] temporally unlimited assignment requirements through its exceptions, would produce a conflict with what we think is otherwise the clear prohibition of §16600 on agreements like the one at issue here.”</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals decision is another timely reminder that courts will not enforce overbroad clauses in agreements with employees that, although not explicitly prohibiting competition, have the practical effect of doing so.</p>

<h2>Why Loom?</h2>
<p>In 1998, it was amazing that the Sun Java Web Server (the precursor of Tomcat) ran each request in a separate thread, and not an OS process. It was able to serve thousands of concurrent requests this way! Nowadays, that’s not so amazing. Each thread takes up a significant amount of memory, and you can’t have millions of threads on a typical server.</p>
<p>That’s why the modern mantra of server-side programming is: “Never block!” Instead, you specify what should happen once the data is available.</p>
<p>This asynchronous programming style is great for servers, allowing them to handily support millions of concurrent requests. It isn’t so great for programmers.</p>
<p>Here is an asynchronous request with the <code>HttpClient</code> API:</p>
<pre>HttpClient.newBuilder()
   .build()
   .sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
   .thenAccept(response -&gt; . . .);
   .thenApply(. . .);
   .exceptionally(. . .);
</pre>
<p>What we would normally achieve with statements is now encoded as method calls. If we loved this style of programming, we would not have statements in our programming language and merrily code in Lisp.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, code tagged as “async” is rewritten into method calls like the ones that you’ve just seen. But that means you can only call async methods from other async methods, and your API splits into a sync and an async part, forcing you to duplicate functionality.</p>

<p>Project Loom takes its guidance from languages such as Erlang and Go, attacking the root of the problem by making blocking very cheap. You run tasks in “virtual threads”, a nearly unlimited resource that is mapped into actual “carrier” threads. When a virtual thread blocks, it is “parked” and another virtual thread runs on the carrier thread. The name is supposed to remind you of virtual memory that is mapped to actual RAM.</p>
<p>Before you complain about the name, remember that naming is hard. The Loom team previously tried “fiber”, but it is already used elsewhere with a slightly different meaning. And “lightweight” or “new” thread might look foolish when something lighter-weight or newer comes along.</p>
<p>After experimenting with separate classes for OS threads and virtual threads, they ended up deciding to use a single class for both—the familiar <code>java.lang.Thread</code>—in order to ease migration.</p>
<p>Of course, good old <code>java.lang.Thread</code>, which has been around for 25 years, ever since Java 1.0, has its share of cruft. Awkward cancellation, thread groups, priorities, depreceated methods <code>stop</code>,<code>suspend</code>, <code>resume</code>. The Loom team felt that these liabilities were minor since most programmers never explicitly use the <code>Thread</code> API but launch tasks with an <code>ExecutorService</code>. (Of course, the same argument would support coming up with a cleaner virtual thread API instead.)</p>
<p>If you have been around for a very long time, you may remember that early versions of Java had “green threads” that were mapped to an OS thread. However, there is a crucial difference. When a green thread blocked, its carrier thread was also blocked, preventing all other green threads from making progress.</p>

<p>You can download binaries of Project Loom at <a href="http://jdk.java.net/loom/">http://jdk.java.net/loom/</a>. They are updated regularly.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, a virtual thread is an object of the <code>Thread</code> class. Here are three ways of producing fibers. First, there is a new factory method that constructs and starts a virtual thread:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.startVirtualThread(runnable);
  // <cite>Note that the thread is already started</cite></pre>
<p>This is good for demos, tutorials or quick-and-dirty experiments in JShell.</p>
<p>For more customization, there is a builder API:</p>
<pre>Thread thread = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .build();</pre>
<p>However, as you have been told for many years now, it is better to use an executor service than to manually construct <code>Thread</code> instances. The static method <code>Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor()</code> provides one. (The existing executor services are not useful for virtual threads. It would be counterproductive to pool them!)</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
exec.submit(runnable1);
exec.submit(runnable2);
</pre>
<p>As with the other factory methods in the <code>Executors</code> class, you can optionally supply a <code>ThreadFactory</code>. And the new <code>Thread.Builder</code> class has an easy way to provide a factory, instead of a single instance:</p>
<pre>ThreadFactory factory = Thread.builder()
   .virtual()
   .name(taskname)
   .task(runnable)
   .<b>factory()</b>;

ExecutorService exec = Executors.newThreadExecutor(factory);
</pre>
<p>Let’s try this out. As a first test, we just sleep in each task.</p>
<pre>import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Test {
   public static int DELAY = 10_000;
   public static int NTASKS = 1_000_000;

   public static void run(Object obj) {
      try {
         Thread.sleep((int) (DELAY * Math.random()));
      } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
         ex.printStackTrace();
      }
      System.out.println(obj);
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor();
      for (int i = 1; i &lt;= NTASKS; i++) {
         String taskname = "task-" + i;
         exec.submit(() -&gt; run(taskname));
      }
      exec.close();
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Run the program and it just works. Then try using OS threads—change to <code>Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</code> or <code>Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NTASKS)</code>. The program will run out of memory; on my laptop, after about 25,000 threads.</p>
<p>Ok, but in practice, you don’t want to sleep, but do useful work. Consider a program adapted from one of <a href="https://www.javaspecialists.eu/about/heinz/">Heinz Kabutz</a>‘ puzzlers, The program fetches a daily image, from Dilbert or Wikimedia. It consists of classes <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> and <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-07-27/dailyImages/ImageInfo.java"><code>ImageInfo</code></a>. The code is an impenetrable maze of twisty passages, all alike (i.e. helper functions yielding completable futures).</p>
<p>With virtual threads, simply read web contents synchronously. It blocks, but we don’t care. All the complexity goes away. The control flow is simple and comprehensible.</p>
<pre>exec.submit(() -&gt; {
    String pageURL = info.getUrlForDate(date);
    String page = getSync(pageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    String imageURL = info.findImage(page).getImagePath();
    byte[] image = getSync(imageURL, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofByteArray());
    info.setImageData(image);
    process(info);
    return null;
});</pre>
<p>Here is the simplified <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/dailyImages/ImageProcessor.java"><code>ImageProcessor</code></a> code.</p>
<p><b>Pro tip: </b>The statement <code>return null;</code> makes the lambda into a <code>Callable</code> instead of a <code>Runnable</code>, so that you don’t have to catch checked exceptions 😜</p>
<p>Try this out with something you care about. Call web services and make database connections, without worrying about callbacks. When blocking is cheap, a whole lot of accidental complexity goes away. Of course, to use this in a web app framework, you’ll have to wait for your framework provider to run your code in virtual threads.</p>
<h2>Structured Concurrency</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">this highly recommended article</a> (from which the images below are taken), Nathaniel Smith proposes structured forms of concurrency. Here is his central argument. Launching a task in a new thread is really no better than programming with GOTO, i.e. harmful:</p>
<pre>new Thread(runnable).start();</pre>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/sequential-and-go-to-schematic.svg" alt=".svg" width="38%"></p>
<p>When multiple threads run without coordination, it’s spaghetti code all over again. In the 1960s, structured programming replaced <code>goto</code> with branches, loops, and functions:</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/control-schematics.svg" alt=".svg" width="42%"></p>
<p>When you look at a line of code, you know how the program got there.</p>
<p>Structured concurrency does the same for concurrent tasks. We should know, from reading the program text, when they all finish.</p>
<p><img src="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2019-12-05/nursery-schematic-unlabeled.svg" alt=".svg" width="30%"></p>
<p>That way we can control the resources that the tasks use, and we know when it is time to move on.</p>
<p>In Loom, the <code>ExecutorService</code> implements this basic construct. <code>ExecutorService</code> has a <code>close</code> method that blocks until all of its virtual threads have completed. (I used this method in the first sample program to keep <code>main</code> alive until all virtual threads are done. In the past, you had to call the <code>awaitTermination</code> method instead.)</p>
<p>Conveniently, <code>ExecutorService</code> implements the <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface, so that you can just use a <code>try</code>-with-resources statement:</p>
<pre>try (ExecutorService exec = Executor.newVirtualThreadExecutor()) {
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; NTASKS; i++) {
      exec.schedule(() -&gt; run(i));
   }
} // <cite>Blocks until all threads completed</cite>
</pre>
<p>I wrote a simple web crawler as a demonstration of virtual threads—here is the <a href="http://horstmann.com/unblog/2020-12-05/Crawler.java"><code>Crawler</code></a> class. In my first attempt, I fired off a new virtual thread for each URL in a page. If I had wanted to become Google, I could have let my crawler run forever. But I wanted to go no more than 3 hops from the starting point. With “fire and forget”, there is no way of knowing when the recursion is done.</p>
<p>Instead, for each page, I make a new executor service and wait for completion. That way, the whole program completes when all pages have been crawled.</p>
<p>This seems a lot of blocking. But in Loom, blocking is cheap, so we shouldn’t worry about that.</p>
<p>We are used to having one executor service as thread pool for all our tasks. But in Loom, you are encouraged to use a separate executor service for each task set.</p>
<h2>Deadlines</h2>
<p>When crawling the web, you are likely to encounter dead links. Reading from one should time out eventually, but it can take surprisingly long.</p>
<p>The standard remedy is, of course, to provide a timeout. Loom prefers deadlines to timeouts, so you specify</p>
<pre>ExecutorService exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadExecutor().withDeadline(
   Instant.now().plus(30, ChronoUnit.SECONDS))
</pre>
<p>Why deadlines? In general, timeouts compose poorly. Suppose you have to accomplish two sequential tasks with an overall timeout of 10 seconds. You don’t want to give each of the tasks a timeout of 5 seconds. After all, if one takes 6 seconds and the other 3 seconds, you still come in under the finish line. To get the timeout of the second task, you’d have to measure the duration of the first task and subtract that from the overall timeout. With deadlines, it is much simpler. Each task gets the same deadline.</p>
<p>The call <code>exec.close()</code> blocks until all virtual threads have completed or the …</p></div></div>

One of them is the ability to suppress emitting <code>.locals init</code> flag.

This instructs the JIT to generate a prolog to set all local variables to their default value. This is safer as you cannot use uninitialized memory. You can validate this behavior using unsafe code. The following method constantly prints "0" to the console as the JIT initializes the variable <code>i</code> to its default value.</p><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DemoZeroing</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

It just usually feels like there’s a chance I’ll just lose all of my in progress work to the depths of stashes and never be able to get the right incantation of <code>git</code> commands to reincarnate my code.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-git-stash-do">What does git stash do?</h3>

<p>Let me backtrack a minute! I haven’t yet explained what <code>git stash</code> even does. On the most basic level, <code>git stash</code> is one way to store in progress work in <code>git</code> for subsequent access, leaving behind a clean working directory.</p>

<p><em>Meta-note</em>: this post will be easiest to follow along if you open up a terminal and play around with <code>git stash</code> as you’re reading! The lack of syntax highlighting makes it a little tricky to see git additions / deletions. You can play around with any git repo you have, or clone <a href="https://github.com/githubtraining/hellogitworld">this hello world one</a> locally to work in a complete sandbox!</p>

<h3 id="stacks">Stacks</h3>

<p>Stashes are more easily understood as a basic last in, first out stack.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> (equivalent to <code>git stash</code> when used with no arguments) will push any local changes onto the stash and leave a clean working directory.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit

<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

nothing to commit, working tree clean

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are a plethora of arguments we can pass to <code>git stash push</code>. The ones I find most helpful are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-m &lt;message&gt;</code> saves the stash with a message, can be helpful for our future selves</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-m</span> <span>"description"</span>
Saved working directory and index state On main: description
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-p</code> patches changes (used like <code>git add -p</code>), allowing us to select which hunks to add to the stash. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Detailed-Unified.html">Hunks</a> are areas where two files differ. Git will partition files into hunks for us!</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-p</span>
....
Details about the hunk
....
<span>(</span>1/1<span>)</span> Stash this hunk <span>[</span>y,n,q,a,d,e,?]?
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-u</code> includes untracked files in the stash. Without this flag, a file that <code>git</code> had never seen before would not be included in a stash</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>touch </span>new-file
<span>$ </span>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Untracked files:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include <span>in </span>what will be committed<span>)</span>
	new-file

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> to track<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash push <span>-u</span>
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>-k</code> keeps the files (or hunks) which were staged. Without this option, when we apply a stash, nothing will be staged. More on applying in the next section!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessing-the-stash">Accessing the stash</h3>

<p>Okay, we can now push changes onto the stash. But…. they’re still the stash abyss if we have no way of accessing them.</p>

<p><code>git stash list</code> shows us what is on the stash:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the <code>-m</code> message flag from earlier will be incredibly helpful. The first item in my stash had a message (<code>Clear description of these changes</code>), the second did not.</p>

<p>Okay, okay. We can now <em>see</em> what’s on the stash. But how do we access anything on the stash? Or remove it from the stash?</p>

<p><code>git stash show</code> will show us the difference between the top item on the stash, and our current working directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we want to reference a different set of changes on the stash, and not the most recent one, we can use the stash index of those changes. As we can see above, each item on the stash has an index, and can be referred to by <code>stash@{index}</code></p>

<p>So, to see the set of changes in the next item on our stack, we can run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash show stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
 README.md | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion<span>(</span>+<span>)</span>, 1 deletion<span>(</span>-<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Neat, so we now know how to get the differences and look at what’s in the stash. But to actually access what’s on the stash, we’ll need <code>git stash apply [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. It similarly can take an argument with the stash index to reference something later in the stash. If no argument is provided, it will default to the most recent set of changes we put in the stash (the ones at <code>stash@{0}</code>)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash apply stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>
On branch main
Your branch is up to <span>date </span>with <span>'origin/main'</span><span>.</span>

Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="removing-from-the-stash">Removing from the stash</h4>

<p>However, <code>git stash apply</code> will not <em>remove</em> the changes from the stash. If we look at the stash now, we’ll see it’s the same as it was:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: On main: Clear description of these changes
stash@<span>{</span>1<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to remove a set of changes from the stash, we can use <code>git stash drop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash drop stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>
Dropped refs/stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span> <span>(</span>b09812812eb27de2cb49bfd02aba43889362b6de<span>)</span>

<span>$ </span>git stash list
stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span>: WIP on main: 6ab43aa Initial commit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that the set of changes at <code>stash@{0}</code> are now no longer on the stash, and the set of changes which were at <code>stash@{1}</code> are now at <code>stash@{0}</code>.</p>

<p>If we want to <code>apply</code> and <code>drop</code> a set of changes, we can conveniently use <code>git stash pop [&lt;stash&gt;]</code>. <code>pop</code> will only also <code>drop</code> if there’s no merge conflict.</p>

<p>To clear the stash completely, we can run <code>git stash clear</code>. This is the <em>actual</em> scary command which will cause us to lose any work in progress that you had stashed. Only run <code>git stash clear</code> if you never again want to access what is currently on the stash.</p>

<h3 id="why-stash">Why stash?</h3>

<p>So we’ve learned how to use <code>git stash</code>, but still haven’t covered <em>why</em> to use it. Stashing is intended to be a quick and easy way to get to a clean working state while not losing in progress work. And it is! Both quick, and now hopefully easy!</p>

<p>One example of when I might use <code>git stash</code> is if I’m in progress on some changes, but realize I want to amend a prior commit. I can stash the changes, amend the commit, and then apply the stash to get back to where I was.</p>

<p>Another is if I am trying to experiment with a few different ways to solve a problem, and want small, quick examples down each solution path. I might create stashes with all of my examples, and then pick the best and pursue that set of changes in a branch structure.</p>

<p>Additionally, stashing is especially helpful because it is branch agnostic. That is to say, if we switch branches, our stash will remain the same. This means stashing can also be a convenient way to carry changes through different branches.</p>

<h3 id="when-not-to-stash">When not to stash</h3>

<p>Equally import to why stash is when <em>not</em> to use it.</p>

<p>Stashing was built for convenience, and is not intended to be a permanent way to save work; that’s what branches and commits are for. Stashing also only works locally, you can’t push stashes to a repo or have others pull them down.</p>

<h3 id="branches-from-stash">Branches from stash</h3>

<p>Speaking of branches, another fun feature of stashes is that we can create a branch directly from a stash. This is done using <code>git stash branch &lt;branch_name&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;]</code> This will also drop the changes from the stash, equivalent to a <code>git stash pop</code> not a <code>git stash apply</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git stash branch new-branch
Switched to a new branch <span>'new-branch'</span>
On branch new-branch
Changes not staged <span>for </span>commit:
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to update what will be committed<span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>use <span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to discard changes <span>in </span>working directory<span>)</span>
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
Dropped refs/stash@<span>{</span>0<span>}</span> <span>(</span>d6a804a40c0b477d8e3be27939310ff677f45670<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>git stash</code> operates on a LIFO stack of sets of changes</li>
  <li><code>git stash list</code> shows what’s on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash push</code> pushes to the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash apply</code> access changes on the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash drop</code> removes changes from the stash</li>
  <li><code>git stash pop</code> does an <code>apply</code> and a <code>drop</code></li>
  <li>These default to the most recent item on the stash, to reference another one use <code>stash@{index}</code> where you can determine the index from <code>git stash list</code></li>
  <li>Some of these have flags which make them more convenient, including: <code>-m</code> message, <code>-p</code> patch, <code>-u</code> include untracked files, <code>-k</code> keep staged changes staged</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully you, too, can now add <code>git stash</code> to the list of fears you’ve conquered!</p>

<p>For further reading on stashing, take a look at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash">git stash docs</a>. For further reading on <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/topics/fear-quotes">conquering fears</a>, here is a favorite quote of mine, “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie">Marie Curie</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Ah, it’s again this magical time of the year - the Advent!
When I was little I associated it mostly with advent candy boxes
with a different candy for each day of the Advent, but these days
I mostly associate this period with the famous <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As much as I love solving puzzles, I’ve realized lately that probably
it’s not the best use of my limited free time. Last year I opted to do
an <a href="http://metaredux.com/posts/2019/12/01/meta-advent-2019.html">blogging challenge</a>, instead of the Advent of Code, and this
year I’m challenging myself to contribute something (meaningful) to my <a href="http://metaredux.com/projects">open-source
projects</a> every day from the 1st of December to Christmas.
Fun times ahead!</p>

<p>Today is the 3rd of December already, so I guess I have to report what I’ve done so far.</p>

<h2 id="dec-1">Dec 1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Shipped <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.5.0">RuboCop 1.5</a></li>
  <li>Lots of improvements to the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/">Clojure Style Guide</a>
    <ul>
      <li>New sections on <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#guiding-principles">guiding principles</a> and <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#a-note-about-consistency">consistency</a></li>
      <li>Documented the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#sources-of-inspiration">sources of inspiration</a></li>
      <li>Added lots of new code examples (e.g. <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#comments">here</a>)</li>
      <li>Fixed many headings that had broken wording after the automated conversion to the current structure last year (each guideline now has a title, and the titles were auto-generated from the old permalinks associated with the guidelines)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to gradually clean up the backlog for improvements of the style guide in the months to come. I’ll also mention here that I wouldn’t mind
some volunteers willing to help document the best practices for working with <code>cljc</code> and <code>clojure.spec</code>.</p>

<h2 id="dec-2">Dec 2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Shipped <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.5.1">RuboCop 1.5.1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">Projectile</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Groomed the backlog (replied to some tickets, closed some tickets that were addressed/irrelevant, added tags to everything else)</li>
      <li>Merged a few outstanding PRs (see the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bugs-fixed">changelog</a> for details)</li>
      <li>Lots of improvements to the documentation site
        <ul>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/usage.html">Usage</a> page (better basic setup instructions, plus coverage of the mighty but elusive Projectile Commander)</li>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/projects.html">Projects</a> page (in particular, you’ll find there a lot of information about the mythical and mystical <code>projectile-project-root-functions</code>)</li>
          <li>Improved <a href="https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/configuration.html">Configuration</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It always feels great to revisit Projectile, as it’s both the first open-source project I ever created and the project I use more than anything else.</p>

<h2 id="dec-3-today">Dec 3 (today)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>More work on Projectile’s documentation and grooming the backlog</li>
  <li>Preparing for another RuboCop bug-fix release (1.5.2 might land later today)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>

<p>So, what’s next?
My main priorities for the Advent of OSS are currently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Polish the Clojure Style Guide</li>
  <li>Ship CIDER 1.0</li>
  <li>Ship Emacs Prelude 1.1</li>
  <li>Clean up Projectile’s backlog</li>
</ul>

<p>I probably won’t be able to achieve them all, but I’ve been told it’s good to be ambitious. If someone wants to help me out, be my guest.
My projects have plenty of tickets tagged with <code>Good First Issue</code> that you might try tackling.</p>

<p>I’ll try to post some updates here every few days, both to keep it
up-to-date with my progress and to keep myself honest. That’s all from
me for now. Keep hacking!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> In the time-honored tradition of the Advent, I’m inviting all of you to join my on the Christmas OSS adventure and see how far are you willing
to go! It will be fun!</p>

<p>The Eysturoyartunnilin (or Eysturoy Tunnel, earlier known as Skálafjarðartunnilin) is a large infrastructure project which connects the island of Streymoy to the island of Eysturoy through a sub-sea road tunnel under the Tangafjørður sound in the Faroe Islands. It also crosses the southern part of Skálafjørður and connects the towns of Runavík on the eastern side and Strendur on the western side of the fjord. Altogether, the three-branch sub-sea tunnel measures 11.24 kilometres (6.8 miles) long, including an underwater roundabout. Construction costs are estimated to be around a billion DKK. It will open for traffic in December 2020.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Postgres database is rich with features well beyond that of any other
database. However, most developers do not know the extent to which they can
leverage the features in Postgres to completely express their application
business logic in the database.</p>
<p>Often developers may find themselves re-implementing authentication and
authorization in their apps, when Postgres comes with application level security
features out of the box. Or perhaps developers may rewrite basic insert
functions with some extra app logic where that too may be handled in the
database.</p>
<p>This reimplementation of features that come with Postgres is not just an
inefficient way to spend developer resources, but may also result in an
interface that is slower than if the logic was implemented in Postgres itself.
PostGraphile aims to make developers more efficient and their APIs faster by
packaging the repeatable work in one open source project that encourages
community contributions.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will walk through the Postgres schema design for a forum
application with users who can login and write forum posts. While we will
discuss how you can use the schema we create with PostGraphile, this article
should be useful for anyone designing a Postgres schema.</p>
<p>If you haven't installed PostGraphile already, you can follow our
<a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/quick-start-guide/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get PostGraphile up and
running.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-your-schemas"><a href="#setting-up-your-schemas" aria-label="setting up your schemas permalink"></a>Setting Up Your Schemas</h4>
<p>All of our database objects will go into one or two custom Postgres schemas. A
schema is essentially a namespace, it allows you to create tables with the same
name like <code>a.person</code> and <code>b.person</code>.</p>
<p>You can name your schema anything, we recommend naming your schema after your
app. This way if you are working on multiple apps in the same database (this
might only realistically happen in development), you can easily query the
databases of the different apps. We are going to create two schemas:
<code>forum_example</code>, and <code>forum_example_private</code>. To create these schemas we use the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createschema.html"><code>CREATE SCHEMA</code></a>
command.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>schema</span> forum_example<span>;</span>
<span>create</span> <span>schema</span> forum_example_private<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You could create more or less schemas, it is all up to you and how you want to
structure your database. We decided to create two schemas. One of which,
<code>forum_example</code>, is meant to hold data users can see, whereas
<code>forum_example_private</code> will never be directly accessible to users.</p>
<p>Theoretically we want a user to be able to log in directly to our Postgres
database, and only be able to create, read, update, and delete data for their
user all within SQL. This is a mindshift from how we traditionally use a SQL
database. Normally, we assume whoever is querying the database has full
visibility into the system as the only one with database access is our
application. In this tutorial, we want to restrict access at the database level.
Don’t worry though! Postgres is very secure about this, users will have no more
permissions than that which you explicitly grant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When starting PostGraphile, you will want to use the name of the
schema you created with the <code>--schema</code> option, like so:
<code>postgraphile --schema forum_example</code>. Also, don’t forget to add the <code>--watch</code>
flag, with watch mode enabled PostGraphile will update your API as we add
tables and types throughout this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-person-table"><a href="#the-person-table" aria-label="the person table permalink"></a>The Person Table</h4>
<p>Now we are going to create the tables in our database which will correspond to
our users. We will do this by running the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html"><code>CREATE TABLE</code></a>
command. Here is the definition for our person table:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id               <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
  first_name       <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span> <span>check</span> <span>(</span>char_length<span>(</span>first_name<span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>80</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  last_name        <span>text</span> <span>check</span> <span>(</span>char_length<span>(</span>last_name<span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>80</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  about            <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  created_at       <span>timestamp</span> <span>default</span> <span>now</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have created a table with <code>id</code>, <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code>, <code>about</code>, and
<code>created_at</code> columns (we will add an <code>updated_at</code> column later). Let’s break
down exactly what each line in this command does, we will only do this once. If
you already understand, you can skip ahead.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>create table forum_example.person</code>: This tells Postgres that we are
creating a table in the <code>forum_example</code> schema named <code>person</code>. This table
will represent all of our forum’s users.</li>
<li><code>id serial primary key</code>: This line establishes an auto-incrementing id field
which is always guaranteed to be unique. The first person we create will
have an id of 1, the second user will have an id of 2, and so on. The
<code>primary key</code> bit is also very important. PostGraphile will use the
<code>primary key</code> of a table in many places to uniquely identify an object,
including the globally unique id field.</li>
<li><code>first_name text not null check (char_length(first_name) &lt; 80)</code>: We want all
of our users to enter their first name and last name seperately, so this
column definition will create a column named <code>first_name</code>, of type <code>text</code>,
that is required (<code>not null</code>), and that must be less than 80 characters long
(<code>check (char_length(first_name) &lt; 80)</code>).
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-constraints.html">Check constraints</a>
are a very powerful feature in Postgres for data validation.</li>
<li><code>last_name text check (char_length(last_name) &lt; 80)</code>: This is very similar
to our column definition for <code>first_name</code>, except it is missing <code>not null</code>.
This means that unlike the <code>first_name</code> column, <code>last_name</code> is not required.</li>
<li><code>about text</code>: We want users to be able to express themselves! So they get to
write a mini forum post which will go on their profile page.</li>
<li><code>created_at timestamp default now()</code>: This final column definition will
provide us with some extra meta-information about their user. If not
specified explicitly, the <code>created_at</code> timestamp will default to the time
the row was inserted.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s our person table! Pretty simple, right?</p>
<p>The syntax and features of the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html"><code>CREATE TABLE</code></a>
command are fairly easy to learn and understand. Creating tables is the easiest,
but also the most fundamental part of your schema design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We prefer singular identifers like <code>forum_example.person</code> over
<code>forum_example.people</code> because when you create a table, it is like you are
creating a class in a statically typed language. Classes have singular names
like “Person” while collections will often have plural names like “People.”
Table as a class is a better analogy than table as a collection because
Postgres itself will internally call tables “classes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In case you don’t like serial id of our table above, an alternative
to the <code>serial</code> primary key is UUIDs. To use UUIDs you would just need to add
the popular UUID extension, <code>uuid-ossp</code>, in your database setup, and specify a
default in your table creation. Like so:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> extension <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>exists</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id uuid <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>default</span> uuid_generate_v1mc<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively you could use fully random UUIDs:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> extension <span>if</span> <span>not</span> <span>exists</span> <span>"pgcrypto"</span><span>;</span>

<span>create</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>(</span>
  id uuid <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>default</span> gen_random_uuid<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are pros and cons to both approaches, choose what works best for your
application!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="table-documentation"><a href="#table-documentation" aria-label="table documentation permalink"></a>Table Documentation</h4>
<p>Now that we have created our table, we want to document it within the Postgres
database. By adding comments to our table and its columns using the Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-comment.html"><code>COMMENT</code></a>
command, we will allow tools like PostGraphile to display rich domain specific
documentation.</p>
<p>To add comments, just see the SQL below:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>table</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person <span>is</span> <span>'A user of the forum.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>id <span>is</span> <span>'The primary unique identifier for the person.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>first_name <span>is</span> <span>'The person’s first name.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>last_name <span>is</span> <span>'The person’s last name.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>about <span>is</span> <span>'A short description about the user, written by the user.'</span><span>;</span>
<span>comment</span> <span>on</span> <span>column</span> forum_example<span>.</span>person<span>.</span>created_at <span>is</span> <span>'The time this person was created.'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Incredibly simple, yet also incredibly powerful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Feel free to write your comments in Markdown! Most tools, including
GraphiQL which PostGraphile uses, will render your comments with the
appropriate styles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this we have completed our person table, now let’s create a table for our
forum posts.</p>
<h4 id="the-post-table"><a href="#the-post-table" aria-label="the post table permalink"></a>The Post Table</h4>
<p>The users of our forum will want to be able to create posts. That’s the entire
reason we have a forum after all. To create the post table we go through a very
similar process as creating our <code>forum_example.person</code> table, but first we want
to create a type we will use in one of the columns. See the SQL below:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>type</span> forum_example<span>.</span>post_topic <span>as</span> <span>enum</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>'discussion'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'inspiration'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'help'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'showcase'</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Postgres
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtype.html"><code>CREATE TYPE</code></a>
command will let you create a custom type in your database which will allow you
to do some really cool things. You can create a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rowtypes.html">composite type</a>
which is basically a typed object in GraphQL terms, you can create a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rangetypes.html">range type</a>
which represents exactly what you might think, or you can create an
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-enum.html">enum type</a>
which is what we did here.</p>
<p>Enum types are a static set of values, you <em>must</em> use one of the string values
that make up the enum in any column of the enum’s type. Having this type is
useful for us, because we want our forum posts to have one, or none, topics so
user’s may easily see what a post is about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> PostGraphile implements custom handling for user-defined types. An
enum type like that defined above will be turned into a GraphQL enum that
looks like:</p>
<div data-language="graphql"><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>PostTopic</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>DISCUSSION</span>
  <span>INSPIRATION</span>
  <span>HELP</span>
  <span>SHOWCASE</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also create custom composite types which will turn into GraphQL object
types with PostGraphile.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>type</span> my_schema<span>.</span>my_type <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  foo <span>integer</span><span>,</span>
  bar <span>integer</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Would become the following GraphQL type:</p>
<div data-language="graphql"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>MyType</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>foo</span><span>:</span> Int
  <span>bar</span><span>:</span> Int
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it is time to actually create our post table:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> …</code></pre></div></div></div>

file on my desktop. And at the end of the day, I would delete that file and
start over again the next day. Inspired by the minimalism of <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>,
I created a similar system to manage my own notes.</p><p>Keep reading for more details or skip to the code: <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">github.com/hachibu/note.sh</a>.</p><h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4><p>As I mentioned before, I used to keep a single notes file on my desktop, and I
would delete it everyday. I would use this notes file to keep track of random
thoughts and details related to my work and personal life. My notes file might
contain code snippets from work, inspirational quotes, or it might have my
latest and greatest open-source software idea, or maybe even the beginning of a
new blog post. Anyway, I loved the simplicity of it, and I didn’t want any more
apps, databases or logins in my life.</p><p>But it wasn’t until I started using <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo-txt-cli</a>
that I considered writing a script to manage my own notes. The brilliant part
about <code>todo-txt-cli</code> is that it’s just text files stored in my Dropbox and a
small shell script to interface with those files.</p><p>Inspired by the minimalism of <code>todo-txt-cli</code>, I built <a href="https://github.com/hachibu/note.sh">note.sh</a>.
In total, the entire project consists of 1 Bash script, 1 environment variable
to configure the notes directory and 1 symlink to install it to your
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory.</p><h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4><p>The way it works is that every time I run the script, it opens the note for that
day in my editor of choice. For example, if today was December 2, 2020 then the
script would open a file named <code>2020-12-02.md</code> in the notes directory.</p><p>I use Vim as my editor, and I have my notes stored on Dropbox so I can access
them on all of my computers. So, my shell RC file looks like this.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>export</span> <span>EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>"vim"</span>
<span>export</span> <span>NOTE_DIR</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/Dropbox/Notes"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And my Dropbox directory looks like this.</p><p><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/how-i-manage-my-random-daily-notes/images/dropbox-screenshot.png" alt="Dropbox Screenshot"></p><p>For searching, the script accepts a pattern and runs a recursive grep over the
notes directory. I chose grep because I use this script on both Mac and Linux,
and I wanted the script to be as portable as possible.</p><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>I’ve been using this script for several months across several computers, and I
still love it. I don’t search as often as I thought I would, but it’s comforting
to know it’s all there if I need it. I also ended up creating an alias for my
script so all I need to type is the letter <code>n</code> to run the script.</p><p>In the future, I’d like to add a test suite to the code base, figure out how
to create a Homebrew formula, and add archiving for older notes.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the first part of a three part (II, III) look at the Dothraki, the fictional horse-borne nomads of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> / <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series and the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that they are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up to scrutiny.  This is something that I have been suggesting I would get to since (checks notes),<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/04/new-acquisitions-that-dothraki-charge/"> May.  Of Last Year.</a>  So it is about time we actually get to it.</p>



<p>The plan is for this series to run in three parts.  Part I (this part) will discuss how the Dothraki <em>look</em> in the setting.  Part II will look at broader questions of social organization and culture (I am nearly certain this is one of those cases where there will be a IIa and a IIb, but my hope for brevity springs eternal).  Part III will look at military culture.  In all three parts I am going to use both the books and the show – noting where they diverge – in part because the heaviest characterization the Dothraki got in the show was when Martin was still significantly involved with it (meaning that large parts of it likely still reflect his vision), but also because the show is how the vast majority of people experience this particular fiction.  Both the original text and the show derived from it deserve to have their vision discussed.</p>



<p>As always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>First, a <strong>content warning for this series</strong>: this is discussing <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> which features a lot of content which is not G-rated.  More to the point, it is a discussion of what – I will argue – Martin presents as one of, if not the most brutal and sexually violent society in that setting.  And that means those themes are going to come up here (less in this essay, but more in the other parts); we are going to remain serious and adult about those things of course, but they will be a part of this analysis nonetheless.  If that is not for you, by all means feel free to check out for a few weeks.</p>



<p>Before we get into the main point, <strong>I want to note that I am going to reference my series on the <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/01/17/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-i-war-at-the-dawn-of-civilization/">Fremen Mirage</a> <em>a lot</em> here</strong>, because there is a lot of Fremen stuff going on with how Dothraki society is depicted.  As a result, it may be useful to go back and read those, but just to recap, we may define the Fremen Mirage this way:</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/21/collections-the-fremen-mirage-interlude-ways-of-the-fremen/"><strong>The Fremen Mirage is a literary trope, <em>unconnected to historical reality</em>, which presents societies as a contrast between unsophisticated, but morally pure, hyper-masculine and militarily effective ‘strong men’ societies honed by ‘hard times’ (that is, the Fremen of the term) and a sophisticated but effeminate and decadent ‘weak men’ societies weakened by ‘good times,’ frequently with an implicit assertion of the superior worth of the former.</strong></a></p>



<p>Next, a note on citation here from the books.  My understanding is that different printings of the books have different pagination, which seems to be why the Wiki of Ice and Fire cites by chapter numbers (except that the chapters of the books, as printed, <em>aren’t numbered</em> in the print editions I’ve seen, making this classical-style citation extremely cumbersome and inexact).  I am going to cite by the page numbers of my edition, which is the 2011 Bantam Books Trade Paperback Edition (the box set).  Hopefully that will be enough.</p>



<p>Finally, a note on my expertise here.  <strong>I am not a scholar of either the peoples of the Eurasian Steppe or the American Great Plains</strong>.  The former group does intrude into my period and study, as steppe nomads, in the form of Scythians, Sarmatians and Huns did interact (sometimes peacefully, sometimes violently) with the broader Mediterranean world.  Consequently, my knowledge of steppe peoples tend to be better that my knowledge of the Native American peoples of the Great Plains, but I have tried, within the limits of time and availability, to do my research. <strong> I actually think, in a strange sense, this is useful, because my own initial unfamiliarity with the topic has demonstrated to me just how <em>basic</em> the level of research and reading necessary to avoid the failures of this depiction are</strong>.  You do not, in turns out, need to be an experienced scholar on the topic; just a few books and a couple of emails is enough to already radically improve on what we see and read in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, much less the absolute <em>mess </em>of what we see in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>.</p>



<p>Writing this has been tricky.  I am well aware that both of these broad cultural groups (that is, Steppe peoples and Plains Native Americans) are often represented in popular culture only in the form of inaccurate and demeaning stereotypes.  I do not want to be just another link in that chain of poor understanding.  I have thus tried to root my argument here, wherever possible, in either the writings of specialist scholars (there will be more of that next week as we get into subsistence patterns, warfare, etc.) or primary evidence, particularly in terms of <em>period photographs</em>, when it comes to clothing and dress.  With luck I have not erred overmuch.</p>

<h2>…But, Why?</h2>



<p>But before we get into the issue proper, it is important to clear away the standard objections, both why subject <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (and its spin-off properties) to critical analysis at all and also why, if we are going to do that, we are going to focus squarely in on the Dothraki.  The answer to the first is something that we’ve rehearsed a number of times, but bears restating: for most of its readers (and the watchers of <em>A Game of Thrones</em>), <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> will be their primary exposure to the idea of the Middle Ages.  This is particularly true because of the reputation that the series has for being ‘<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/28/new-acquisitions-not-how-it-was-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-i/">how it really was</a>,’ a reputation that George R.R. Martin has consciously cultivated (as with his classic complaint of <a href="https://youtu.be/p-VxvKoDFIw">‘what was Aragorn’s tax policy’</a> – there is a rich irony that, had Martin understood rulership in the Middle Ages better, he would have understood why Aragorn’s tax policy was less important).  Martin has been quite open that he “<a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">draw[s] inspiration from history</a>” and that fact has long been a selling point of the series over more obviously fantastical kinds of medieval-themed high fantasy as well as a <a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/06/03/george-rr-martin-thrones-violence-women/">response to some of the series’ more controversial moments</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Naturally, that cloak of verisimilitude has tended to intensify the degree to which elements of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is taken by its readers and viewers as representative of the Middle Ages more generally.</strong>  And of course as I have noted in the (quite recent) past,<strong> <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/">fiction is often how the public conceptualizes the past and that concept of the past shapes the decisions we make in the present</a></strong>.  In the case of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> in particular, this vision of the past is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/">particularly worth interrogating</a> because it serves as the basis for a<a href="https://youtu.be/ek2O6bVAIQQ"> parable on power and violence</a>.</p>



<p>But <em>even if it didn’t</em>, it would still be worth discussing these aspects of the universe of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, because that is what we are supposed to do with cultural products, with <em>literature</em>.  <strong>I am sometimes baffled that the very fans who insist that their particular loves be treated seriously, as <em>art</em> are the same fans who react with frustration if one then sets out to interrogate those same genres the way one would interrogate serious art or literature</strong>.  This is it, after all!  This is what you (we, really) wanted!  A (quite unimpressive, I’ll grant you) ivory tower academic is taking this genre seriously and subjecting it to serious criticism!  Isn’t that what emerging genres often hope for, to be taken seriously as ‘high’ literature?</p>



<p><strong>And of course we should take it seriously.</strong>  And here I want to speak briefly to the purpose of these sorts of endeavors, <strong>because the goal here is not to force anyone to dislike <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></strong>.   We’re not here to ‘cancel’ <em>ASOIF</em> any more than we were going to ‘cancel’ <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/11/20/miscellanea-my-thoughts-on-assassins-creed-valhalla/"><em>AC:Valhalla</em> two weeks ago</a> (a game I continue to play, I might add).  Instead, discussing cultural products like this is a form of inoculation against their potentially negative aspects, because once a reader knows that, for instance, the depiction of a given culture in a work of fiction has relatively little to do with any real world culture, they can compartmentalize that to the fiction itself; <strong>it loses its power to mislead</strong> <strong>and so may be enjoyed in safety, as it were</strong>.  And there are good things in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and in the first six or so seasons of <em>Game of Thrones</em>; but we also need to be honest about the failings.</p>



<p>(Of course, more broadly, doing this as a practice exercise is a key part of building up that skill – what we may term ‘critical reading’ – more generally, rendering the alert reader more resistant to this sort of thing, both in its unintended form (as, I suspect, in this case) or  in its more dangerous<em> intended form</em>.  Put another way, developing critical reading skills is one important way to make one’s self a harder target for misinformation, including historical misinformation.)</p>



<h2>A Dash of Pure Fantasy</h2>



<p>Alright, so <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is worth looking at closely.  So why <em>this</em> part of the fiction?  It comes down to something <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">George R.R. Martin wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p>One day, I started wondering if it would be possible to parse <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/namespaces">Clojure namespace</a> forms and generate a dependency graph of the various namespaces used in a real-world Clojure project. While that was the original motivation, I ended up down the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars">Raku grammar</a> rabbit hole, and had an enjoyable time learning how to use them. I’m glad you’re joining me in reliving that journey.</p>



<h2><a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#background"></a>Background<a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#grammars"></a></h2>



<h3>Grammars</h3>



<p>Informally speaking, grammars can be thought of as a set of rules that describe a language. With these rules, one can meaningfully parse (to make sense of, or deconstruct into its grammatical components) a piece of text. It turns out that this is a common task in computing. We need to frequently translate programs from one language to another. This is the job of a compiler. Before being able to translate it, the compiler needs to know whether the original program is even valid, according to the language’s grammar.</p>



<p>While we have explained in theory what grammars are, Raku grammars help us model abstract grammars as a programming construct (the <code>grammar</code> keyword and its adjacent helpers) using which we can perform parsing tasks. It is <em>important</em> to understand this distinction.</p>



<p>First class <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/grammars">grammars</a> are considered one of the revolutionary features of Raku. Normally, you’d find grammars as a library or a standalone tool, but Raku has embraced it wholesale, and has a powerful implementation of grammars which makes light work of most parsing tasks.<a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#clojure"></a></p>



<h3>Clojure</h3>



<p><a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is a modern lisp, and happens to be the language I use in <code>$DAYJOB</code>. At the top of most Clojure files, there is a namespace form importing various internal and external namespaces. This way we can neatly organize our project into many separate files, rather than having to put them all into one big file. We are shortly going to design a grammar that can parse these namespace forms.</p>



<h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#grammartracer"></a>Grammar::Tracer</h3>



<p><a href="https://github.com/jnthn/grammar-debugger">Grammar::Tracer</a> is helpful in figuring out where your grammar fails to match, and is invaluable in debugging. Make sure you do <code>zef install Grammar::Tracer</code> before running the code examples.</p>



<h2><a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#lets-start-cookin"></a>Let’s start cookin’</h2>



<h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#a-trivial-example"></a>A trivial example</h3>



<p>A Clojure namespace is a Lisp form, which as expected starts with an open paren and ends with a close paren. Let’s write a grammar for one of the simplest Clojure forms, the empty list.</p>



<pre>()</pre>



<pre><code>grammar EmptyLispForm {
    token TOP { &lt;lparen&gt; &lt;rparen&gt; }

    token lparen { '(' }
    token rparen { ')' }
}</code></pre>



<p>This is one of the simplest possible grammars we can write. Parsing always starts with the <code>TOP</code> token, and recurses into the various component tokens from there. We just have two such tokens <code>lparen</code> and <code>rparen</code> which are used to denote the left and right parens. Play around with <a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/e988e1ed9609daffaf1849c2527af51d">trivial.raku</a> to see how we can parse this.</p>



<h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#warmup-slaying-a-cliched-interview-question-using-raku-grammars"></a>Warmup: Slaying a cliched interview question using Raku grammars</h3>



<p>Q: Write a program that checks that parentheses are balanced.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<pre>() ;; balanced
(()) ;; balanced
(()(())) ;; balanced
(()(((()))) ;; unbalanced</pre>



<pre>grammar BalancedParens {
    token TOP { &lt;balanced-paren&gt; }

    token balanced-paren { &lt;lparen&gt; &lt;balanced-paren&gt;* &lt;rparen&gt; }

    token lparen { '(' }
    token rparen { ')' }
}</pre>



<p>It’s likely I’ve made this more wordy than necessary, but that’s still only <em>six</em> rather-readable lines.</p>



<p>Now, under time pressure which seems more likely? Coding up a stack and fiddling with corner cases or using grammars with the awesomeness of <code>Grammar::Tracer</code> to quickly hack out a declarative solution.</p>



<p>It turns out, that we have just tackled one of the trickiest aspects of writing a real-world grammar, and that is dealing with nested structures. As programmers we know that when we see nested structures, we know we will have to deal with recursion in some form.</p>



<p>You can play around with <a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/fad8108cb6daeaf8043d92a40eb29276">balanced-parens.raku</a> program on the console, and observe how the grammar is parsed.</p>



<p>Note: It turns out there is a <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Tilde_for_nesting_structures">better</a> way to parse nested structures, but this is fine for now.<a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#parsing-our-first-namespace-form"></a></p>



<h3>Parsing our first namespace form</h3>



<p>Let’s try to parse this simple namespace declaration:</p>



<pre><code>;; 1   3
   |   |
;; (ns my-own.fancy.namespace)
    |                        |
;;  2                        4</code></pre>



<p>While this is easy, it is going to be an important building block in tackling more complicated namespace forms. Let’s break this down into its four component <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Lexeme">lexemes</a>. We can see the open and close parens, we see <code>ns</code>, the namespace <code>my-own.fancy.namespace</code> and finally the close paren. That’s it! Let’s tackle these individual pieces using a grammar.</p>



<pre>grammar SimpleNs {
    token TOP { &lt;simple-ns&gt; }

    #                  1        2            3         4
    #                  |        |            |         |
    token simple-ns { &lt;lparen&gt; &lt;ns-keyword&gt; &lt;ns-name&gt; &lt;rparen&gt; }

    token ns-keyword { 'ns' }
    token ns-name { &lt;.ns-name-component&gt;+ % '.' }
    token ns-name-component { ( &lt;.alnum&gt; | '-' )+ }

    token lparen { '(' }
    token rparen { ')' }
}</pre>



<p>Over here we can see that we have translated this into a simple Raku grammar. You could argue that defining <code>simple-ns</code> is not even required, we could have just put it in <code>TOP</code> directly, but anyway.</p>



<p>We will need to deal a little with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regexes</a> here. In the various flavours of regexes, <code>+</code> usually means one or more. <code>|</code> has a slightly different meaning from what you’re expecting, but you can check the regex <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes">documentation</a> for all the details on the difference between <code>|</code> and <code>||</code>. Loosely speaking, we are saying that a <em>namespace component</em>, i.e. the thing between two dots, is made up of one or more alphanumneric characters or hyphens. Now, if there is a rule saying a namespace has to start with an alphabetic character, and not a number, the grammar will become a little more complex, but this is a pedagogic example, so we’ll not be too pedantic.</p>



<p>I expect eagle-eyed readers to point out a few things:</p>



<ol><li>Where is <code>&lt;.alnum&gt;</code> being defined, and why does it have a dot before it?</li></ol>



<p><code>alnum</code> is predefined. The reason it has a <code>.</code> before it is so that we are not interested in capturing each letter; it’s too low level. We are interested in capturing a top-level token like <code>ns-name</code> instead, and not each individual character. Play around with the code examples by adding and removing a dot from various tokens and see the difference in <code>Grammar::Tracer</code>‘s output.</p>



<ol start="2"><li>What does <code>%</code> mean?</li></ol>



<p>This is a very useful convenience to describe patterns where something is interspersed between a bunch of other things. For example, we can have a namespace like <code>foo.bar.baz</code> or we could have an IPv4 address <code>192.168.0.1</code> where integers are separated by dots.</p>



<pre>token ns-name { &lt;.ns-name-component&gt;+ % '.' }</pre>



<p>This means that <code>ns-name</code> is made up of at least one <code>ns-name-component</code>‘s (denoted by the <code>+</code>) and separated by a <code>.</code> (denoted by <code>%</code>).</p>



<p>Okay, so this should work I guess? Let’s see what happens when we run the code!</p>



<p>No, that didn’t work. As <code>Grammar::Tracer</code> helpfully tells us, we did not account for the space after <code>ns</code>. In traditional compiler theory, there is a process of tokenisation, where some lightweight regexes are used to separate the program into its component lexemes and discard all the extraneous spaces before the parser takes over. However, here we will not do that, and we’ll deal with it in the grammar itself. Now, it could be argued whether that is a good decision, but that’s another discussion. Let’s add some allowance for whitespace and see what happens. While building the full Clojure NS grammar, I got myself into a position where I liberally used to sprinkle <code>&lt;.ws&gt;*</code> indicating zero or more whitespace characters in places where I felt that we should allow optional whitespace, as you would expect in a real-world program.</p>



<pre>token simple-ns { &lt;lparen&gt; &lt;ns-keyword&gt; &lt;.ws&gt; &lt;ns-name&gt; &lt;rparen&gt; }</pre>



<p>With that tiny addition, we are now able to parse the simple namespace form. You can play around with <a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/0820b9ecfdb011a9b73aedfb4ba349d1">simple-ns.raku</a>.<a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#lets-make-our-lives-a-little-more-difficult"></a></p>



<h3>Let’s make our lives a little more difficult</h3>



<p>Okay, now we are getting the hang of this, so let’s see a namespace form which is a little more <a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/3debbe6190eb1c8f5325ae2640840db4">realistic</a>.</p>



<pre>(ns my-amazing.module.core
  (:require [another-library.json.module :as json]
            [yet-another.http.library :as http]))</pre>



<p>This is a realistic namespace form which we shall parse by adding support for the <code>:require</code> form where other libraries are imported and given a short nickname.</p>



<p>Can this be done? You bet!</p>



<pre>grammar RealisticNs {
    token TOP { &lt;realistic-ns&gt; }

    token realistic-ns { &lt;lparen&gt;
                           &lt;ns-keyword&gt; &lt;.ws&gt; &lt;ns-name&gt; &lt;.ws&gt;
                           &lt;require-form&gt;
                         &lt;rparen&gt; }

    token ns-keyword { 'ns' }

    token ns-name { &lt;.ns-name-component&gt;+ % '.' }
    token ns-name-component { ( &lt;.alnum&gt; | '-' )+ }

    token require-form { &lt;lparen&gt;
                           &lt;require-keyword&gt; &lt;ws&gt;? &lt;ns-imports&gt;
                         &lt;rparen&gt; }

    token require-keyword { ':require' }

    token ns-imports { &lt;ns-import&gt;+ % &lt;.ws&gt; }

    token ns-import { &lt;lsquare&gt;
                        &lt;ns-name&gt; &lt;.ws&gt; ':as' &lt;.ws&gt; &lt;ns-nickname&gt;
                      &lt;rsquare&gt; }

    token ns-nickname { &lt;.alnum&gt;+ }

    token lsquare { '[' }
    token rsquare { ']' }
    
    token lparen { '(' }
    token rparen { ')' }
}</pre>



<p>Nothing too scary as yet. We can see how the grammar evolves. At the top level, in <code>realistic-ns</code> we have added an extra token called <code>&lt;require-form&gt;</code> and we flesh out the details later. We can manage complexity in this manner, so that we have the ability to zoom in and out of the details as necessary.<a href="https://gist.github.com/samebchase/8d37f7d961ecc981e9ab9a5d36763dd5#using-the-parsed-data"></a></p>



<h3>Using the parsed data</h3>



<p>Now that we have been able to parse the data, we need to make use of what we’ve parsed. This is where <em>Actions</em> come into the picture.</p>



<p>When we do <code>RealisticNs.parse(...)</code>, that returns a <code>Match</code> object corresponding to the <code>RealisticNs</code> grammar. While we can query that object to get the pieces of data that we require, it is less cumbersome to use <em>Actions</em> to build up the data we are actually interested in.</p>



<p>Given, a namespace, we want to extract out:</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Thanks to a conversation I had with <a href="https://twitter.com/jackzerby">Jack Zerby</a> at Gumroad, I now feel confident asking designers to create a user interface, graphic, visual identity, or any other design artifact and have become much more productive at communicating and delegating design tasks. This is essential because my design skills are non-existent. Fortunately, design skills don’t matter in creating a spec, design thinking does. These are my notes from that&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with speccing software or anything else may realize that the advice I’m conveying here matches both your use case and the general case. That, in fact, is the insight that I was missing before the conversation. I already knew how to spec a design, I just needed the right&nbsp;words.</p>
<h3>Step-by-Step&nbsp;Spec</h3>
<p>If you write a spec with all of this information, your designer should have everything they need to get&nbsp;started.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Specify context and&nbsp;canvas</h4>
<p>The canvas is the size and nature of the space the designer has to work in. For graphics, it is the literal dimensions, for software, it is the range of screens that a user might interface with the design from. Web vs mobile is also a canvas&nbsp;question.</p>
<p>Context is what else is nearby. This can mean other aspects of the application as a whole, or it can mean where the user is in a certain process when they encounter the design. If you are asking for a graphic to use on Twitter, that is part of the context, and is very different than asking for a graphic to use on a physical billboard in ways that just the size of the canvas doesn’t fully&nbsp;convey.</p>
<h4>Step 2: List the&nbsp;ingredients</h4>
<p>What actually goes in the design? What information needs to be conveyed? What actions does the user have access to? Be complete, if you don’t list it, the designer won’t know to include&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>An existing stylesheet, illustration, library, or other asset is also an ingredient in the&nbsp;design.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the right number of ingredients for your canvas and context. The more skilled your designer, the more range you get on this, but only to a certain&nbsp;limit.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Identify patterns and&nbsp;hierarchies</h4>
<p>Tell your designer which elements and ingredients are the most important. When you tell your designer the relative importance of the various aspects they use their tools to communicate that importance to the&nbsp;user. </p>
<p>Work with patterns of information within the hierarchy while avoiding identical sections blurring together. Information should match and rhyme, not repeat. But, without a pattern, the design will present friction to the&nbsp;user.</p>
<p>You can communicate hierarchy in words. Lists, especially nested lists, are important here. Order matters, especially in something that can be scrolled&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>If you communicate hierarchy in pictures, don’t go any higher fidelity than a <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04">fat marker sketch</a>. Otherwise, you’ll artificially limit your designer early in the&nbsp;process.</p>
<h4>Step 4: Set&nbsp;tone</h4>
<p>Asking to communicate emotions, impressions, and themes is okay, even good. “X but not Y” is a powerful pattern for doing so, like “minimalist but not empty” or “whimsical but not frivolous.” The more evocative your description, the&nbsp;better.</p>
<h4>Step 5: Send and&nbsp;iterate</h4>
<p>Everything in the spec should be written to avoid friction with the designer. Every time they have to ask you what you mean or you go back and forth on an aspect of your spec, that adds friction to the design process. The faster the turnaround, the more specific your request should be. Specify how many iterations your project merits or your timeline&nbsp;allows.</p>
<p>Design iterations alternate between wide and deep. A “wide” iteration yields several versions of the requested design as a whole. A “deep” iteration takes a chosen design from the wide iteration and comes up with variations on the&nbsp;theme.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://daniel-lange.com/categories/17-Strategy"><img title="Strategy: Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value. (Marechal Ferdinand Foch, Professor of Strategy, Ecole Superieure de Guerre)" alt="Strategy" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/strategy.serendipityThumb.jpg"></a></p><p>The Linux Foundation has published its <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf">annual report</a> today. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838871">calls it glossy</a> and yeah, boy, it is shiny.</p>

<p>So shiny that people that work in the publishing industry immediately see this has been produced with the Adobe toolchain which - unfortunately - is one of the big suites of software not yet available for Linux.</p>

<p>Checking the PDF file metadata reveals the keywords "open source, open standards, open hardware, open data". That is what the Linux Foundation is about. Good stuff.</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:667 --><img width="552" height="676" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-cover.jpg" title="Mouseovers are for xkcd!" alt="Linux Foundation annual report 2020 cover"></p>

<p>The PDF producer meta data for the annual report PDF has been set to "Linux kernel 0.12.1 for Workgroups" and the PDF creator meta data element to "Sharp Zaurus XR-5000 (Maemo5) Edition". Somebody thought to better hide the real data and had some tongue-in-cheek ideas. Kudos.</p>

<p>But nicer would have been to use Open Source software to produce the report, not?</p>

<p>Running <code>strings 2020-Linux-Foundation-Annual-Report_113020.pdf | grep Adobe | wc -l</code> gives us 1229 lines and confirms the suspicion of the toolchain.</p>

<p>A stale <code>/Title (Annual Report 2020) /Producer (macOS Version 10.15.7 \(Build 19H15\) Quartz PDFContext)</code> has been forgotten in the document to tell us about the platform.</p>

<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, the Linux Foundation 2020 annual report has been produced on a Mac.</p>

<p>Running Adobe Creative Cloud on MacOS Catalina 10.15.7.</p>

<p>Which is proprietary software. Its kernel (and some userland pieces) are based on BSD. Not Linux.</p>

<hr>

<p>The image on the front page also struck me as a bit odd ... using a ballpoint pen on the laptop screen?</p>

<p>Unbranded laptop.
Unbranded cup in the foreground.</p>

<p>Kid in the background <em>not</em> paying attention to his tablet.</p>

<p>All of that cries stock image so loud it hurts.</p>

<p>Google currently finds ~560 uses of the picture and any <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Do-I-need-to-credit-Shutterstock-the-artist-when-I-use-Images-or-Footage">editorial use</a> nicely tells us that it is © <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/g/draganagordic">Dragana Gordic / Shutterstock</a>.</p>

<p>The image is "Smiling mom working at home with her child on the sofa while writing an email. Young woman working from home, while in quarantine isolation during the Covid-19 health crisis".</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8683629/Staff-working-home-nearly-extra-hour-day-research-shows-send-emails.html">Daily Mail</a> for a wonderful example of the working mum in context. I hope, if her laptop had been powered on, it would have run Linux. I mean, what else would still run on an old white MacBook with an Intel "Core 2 Duo" processor from 2008?</p>

<p><!-- s9ymdb:668 --><img width="504" height="742" src="https://daniel-lange.com/uploads/entries/DailyMail-screenshot-stock-image.png" title="O.k., here you go: Shiny, too!" alt="Daily Mail screenshot of the same stock image used"></p>

                </div><div id="extended">
        <p>Bonus round:</p>

<p>The Ethernet port, the USB ports and the headset connector are on the left side of the MacBook. The Daily Mail got it right.</p>

<p>Mirroring images is usually not a good idea. To Linux Foundation's defense ... similar pictures are available <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/busy-young-woman-son-home-shot-1680921679">already mirrored on Shutterstuck</a> next to the <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/de/image-photo/smiling-mom-working-home-her-child-1680923362">correctly oriented picture</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For me, perfection is that I don't want to have any errors in what I do. It's hard and exhausted to keep everything perfect. When I publish a piece of content, I want it to be perfect. But I always feel something was wrong and afraid someone would point out the error. After all, I just make a little modification and leave it behind because it's wasting time.</p>
<p>I have so much content I want to create. I don't want to stick with a piece of content for too long. When I start creating another piece of content, I try to avoid previous mistakes. I also try something new in it. The joy of creating content is you can try something new and see if it works.</p>
<p>This is the issue that makes me hesitate to create content. I want my content to be useful to my audiences. I also want to create as much content as possible. After trying some ways, I think I should prioritize the quantity rather than quality. Because I can improve my content by creating more. </p>
<p>Now, perfection for me is not the result of a piece of content. It's a process in which I try, modify, and improve pieces by pieces. If I satisfy with a blog post or video, I just publish it and create another. When I find a mistake, I will fix it.</p>

                    We propose pixelNeRF, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neural scene representation conditioned on
                    one or few input images.
                    The existing approach for
                    constructing neural radiance fields&nbsp;<a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf">[Mildenhall et al. 2020]</a>
                    involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time.
                    We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings
                    by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one).

                    Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision.
                    We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories.
                    We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes and real scenes from the DTU dataset. In all cases, pixelNeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for novel view synthesis and single image 3D reconstruction.

                <p>
                    Using multiview image supervision, we train a single pixelNeRF to 13 largest object categories
                    in ShapeNet in order to perform novel-view synthesis on unseen objects.
                    Our approach operates in <strong>view-space</strong>—as opposed to canonical—and requires <strong>no test-time optimization</strong>.
                    Nevertheless, in terms of image metrics, we significantly outperform existing methods quantitatively, as shown in the paper.

                <p>
                    Since our method requires <strong>neither canonical space nor object-level information such as masks</strong>,
                    it can represent scenes with multiple objects, where a canonical space is unavailable,
                    without modification.
                    Our method can also <strong>seemlessly integrate multiple views</strong> at test-time to obtain better results.
                    SRN performs extremely poorly here due to the lack of a consistent canonical space.

                <p>
                    We show that our method can also conduct wide-baseline view synthesis on more complex real scenes from the <a href="http://roboimagedata.compute.dtu.dk/?page_id=36">DTU MVS</a> dataset,
                    producing reasonable results when given only 1-3 views at inference time.
                    Moreover, it is feed-forward without requiring test-time optimization for each scene.

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

With a diverse cast of internationally-based characters, Facebook users will decide what each contestant of the show will do in the game, how …</p></blockquote></div></div>

        <p>Seeing the ampersand for the first time in Elixir I wanted to dig deep into what it meant. The first <code>&amp;</code> effectively either gets a reference to the original function or starts an anonymous function. Any ampersand after the first that references the positional argument passed to it. You could use this to write very concise anonymous functions. </p><p>Here's a couple of examples:</p><pre><code>messages = ["One", "Two"]

no_capture_operator = fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg, label: 'no_capture_operator')
  %{itemValue: msg}
end
# no_capture_operator: "One"
# no_capture_operator: "Two"

messages |&gt; Enum.map(no_capture_operator)

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;%{itemValue: &amp;1})

IO.inspect(new_messages)
# [%{itemValue: "One"}, %{itemValue: "Two"}]

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.map(fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg)
  %{itemValue: msg}
end)
# "One"
# "Two"

IO.inspect(new_messages, label: "new_messages =")
# new_messages =: [%{itemValue: "One"}, %{itemValue: "Two"}]

message_func = fn msg -&gt;
  IO.inspect(msg)
  %{itemValue: msg}
end

messages |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;message_func.(&amp;1))
# "One"
# "Two"

# the enum tuples have zero-based indexes, hence the + 1
message_with_odd_even = &amp;%{itemValue: &amp;1, type: (if rem(&amp;2 + 1, 2) === 0, do: "even", else: "odd")}

msg_tuple = {"One", 0}

IO.inspect(message_with_odd_even.(elem(msg_tuple, 0), elem(msg_tuple, 1)))
# %{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}

IO.inspect(message_with_odd_even.("One", 0))
# %{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}

new_messages = messages |&gt; Enum.with_index |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;message_with_odd_even.(elem(&amp;1, 0), elem(&amp;1, 1)))

IO.inspect(new_messages, label: 'new_messages 2 =')
# new_messages 2 =: [%{itemValue: "One", type: "odd"}, %{itemValue: "Two", type: "even"}]

messages |&gt; Enum.each(&amp;IO.inspect(&amp;1, label: "label for " &lt;&gt; &amp;1))
# label for One: "One"
# label for Two: "Two"

          <p><em>My personal workflow for terminal-based coding, writing, research, and more!</em></p>

<p>Hello everyone!
It has been quite sometime since I last posted!
Suffice it to say, I have been immensely busy the past year but I am happy to say I am able to resurrect this blog! <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>I have thoroughly grown into my own workflow for programming, research, and writing.
Today, I am happy to be able to share it with you!</p>

<p>If you prefer to watch a video describing most of this entire process, here is an overview of my workflow from one of my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thecedarprince">live streams</a>.
It does not go as in-depth as this document but should serve as a strong complement to this post. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2SLZQQfMF8E"><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/workflow_youtube_vid.jpg" alt=""></a></p>



<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> as my terminal, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> and <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> as my shell and plugin manager respectively, <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> as my multiplexer, <a href="https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd">lsd</a> as my list command with fun icons, <a href="https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans">Fantasque Sans Mono</a> as my typeface font, <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">neovim</a> for my editor, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> paired with <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> for speedy and interactive file finding, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> an enhanced <code>cat</code> with a git diff gutter, <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc">pandoc</a> for writing in markdown and LaTeX and outputting the piece to whatever file type I want, <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/setting-up-zotero/">Zotero</a> for managing my collection on scientific literature, <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">ranger</a> as a terminal-based file explorer, and <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib">gruvbox-dark</a> as my general color palette.</p>

<p>Here are gists to the relevant config files I use to modify my interface and user experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>neovim</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7b9b51af4c146880f17c39407815b594">init.vim</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Alacritty</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/7743091bd8743a7568b718f30bf707c2">.alacritty.yml</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>tmux</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/07f6f8f79b1451ec436ff8dee236ccdd">.tmux.conf</a>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>zsh</strong>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/TheCedarPrince/77afe2674803d965a0f5abd108337040">.zshrc</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a picture of what that looks like altogether:</p>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/workflow_layout.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="my-workflow-in-action-boom">My Workflow in Action <img title=":boom:" alt=":boom:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a5.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<p>The following sections describe in broad strokes my workflow.
I mention some plugins that I use and are provided in my config files.
If you want to learn more about them, I encourage you to read through my config files or search for them.</p>

<h3 id="floating-terminals">Floating Terminals</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/float_term.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Floating terminals are immensely powerful and I love them!
This enables me to quickly pull up a terminal and do some changes without having to split tmux panes or get out of vim.
Furthermore, what is awesome is that you can use it as a sort of <code>vim-slime</code> tool to send lines of code to the floating terminal.
This is a great feature as it uses your last used floating terminal for its target - therefore, if you switch between projects a lot, just switch your floating terminal accordingly.
No need to keep opening and closing REPL sessions and such!</p>

<h3 id="persistent-working-sessions-via-tmux">Persistent Working Sessions via tmux</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/tmux_restore.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Though it is a little hard to see, I closed my terminal completely.
Oh no!
All my paneling and windows have disappeared! 
I’ll have to spend valuable time getting my workflow set back up… Or do I?</p>

<p>tmux can actually remember all these layouts with the plugins, <code>resurrect</code> and <code>continuum</code>. 
This is great for when your computer unexpectedly dies or crashes as everything is backed up at regular intervals you define!
Furthermore, pairing the (neo)vim plugin, <code>obsession</code>, allows tmux to also automatically recover vim layouts and sessions as well.
You will never have to worry about losing your terminal workflow again!</p>

<h3 id="mouse-mode">Mouse Mode</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/mouse_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>tmux and (neo)vim also support mouse mode and interactivity!
I can quickly jump all over the place with my mouse or easily resize any opened pane.</p>

<h3 id="interactive-file-finding">Interactive File Finding</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_fzf.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I integrated the powerful file finding tool, <code>fzf</code>, with <code>ripgrep</code> to quickly find files I am looking to use. 
Then, in my (neo)vim configuration file, I merged these two together into one function that I can easily call while editing files in (neo)vim. 
find files I search for and pandoc to enable citations in pandoc, markdown, or TeX files.</p>

<h3 id="terminal-based-file-explorer">Terminal-Based File Explorer</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/ranger_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Furthermore, I also use the great tool, <code>ranger</code>, which allows me to have a terminal based file explorer.
It’s nice as it pops up in its own window and does not actually directly interfere with any of the background files being edited. 
It even has image preview capabilities!</p>

<h3 id="citation-engine--live-preview">Citation Engine &amp; Live Preview</h3>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/citation_mode.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>As a researcher, this part gets me immensely excited!
While I am writing, I can actively insert citation keys into whatever I am working on via <code>vim-pandoc</code>.
With my config file, you will have to specify where your own .bib file exists.
Furthermore, <code>markdown-preview</code> allows me to preview my markdown in a web browser and <code>vim-latex-live-preview</code> allows me to view my current TeX files in a pdf viewer – works for subfiles too! 
This works for whenever I write TeX files or markdown files which makes writing a breeze!</p>

<p>If any of this section is confusing, I strongly encourage you to read my article on <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/personal-research-management/">Knowledge Management</a>.</p>



<p>These are parts of my workflow that I used to use.
They have been retired for a variety of reasons but all in an effort to improve my workflow.
I have kept these around in case anyone finds it useful!</p>

<h3 id="vim-slime-for-rapid-evaluation">Vim-Slime for Rapid Evaluation</h3>

<p><strong>Rationale for deprecation:</strong> I used to use <code>vim-slime</code> but deprecated it from my workflow because of the flexibility of floating terminals.
Not only could I use floating terminals to send code, I could also quickly flip through terminals in one button press.</p>

<p><img src="http://jacobzelko.com/assets/vim_slime.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Here, I target my Julia REPL in a tmux panel and use the <code>vim-slime</code> plugin to send code from my Julia script opened in neovim to the Julia REPL for rapid evaluation. 
This config works for any time you want to target a window.
This also works for code chunks such as functions or loops!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope you found my workflow and toolchain interesting!
My dream would be for this workflow to serve as inspiration for your own workflow.
Make it your own and all the best!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a written version of a talk that I gave at <a href="https://wafflejs.com/">WaffleJS</a> in February, which itself was an expansion of a <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1187782634623000576">Twitter conversation</a> from October.</em></p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Math education" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.jpg"></picture></p><p>Okay, so it starts with my delayed math education. As part of my Computer Science program, I had access to world-class math professors, access that I mostly wasted. I didn’t like math: the topics were so removed from practice, and I was already frustrated by the highly theoretical, and – I thought at the time and mostly still do – out-of-touch CS program.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few years after graduating, I got the hunger for math. Seeing how I could apply just a little bit of math knowledge to great effect in my work &amp; hobbies had me inspired. But I had no clear way of learning it.</p><p>So I <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/06/26/simple-statistics.html">started Simple Statistics in 2012</a> as a way to learn math, and ever since then, I’ve expanded and maintained the project. It now includes a lot of different algorithms, is one of the most ‘starred’ JavaScript math projects, and presumably is used by people.</p><p>But I started it in 2012. In tech years that’s a really long time ago. Between then and now, there have been 8 LTS releases of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>. JavaScript and its environments have radically changed. 2012 was before the introduction of React or the first commit to Babel.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Time passing" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.jpg"></picture></p><p>So what I noticed over the years was that tests kept breaking when I updated Node. I’d have a test like:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>t</span><span>.</span><span>equal</span><span>(</span><span>ss</span><span>.</span><span>gamma</span><span>(</span><span>11.54</span><span>),</span> <span>13098426.039156161</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>That would work in Node v10 and break in Node v12. And this is not some complex method: gamma is implemented with arithmetic, Math.pow, Math.sqrt, and Math.sin.</p><h3 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h3><p>So I know what you might be thinking: arithmetic. JavaScript, on Twitter, gets a lot of heat for this behavior:</p><div><div><pre><code>0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
</code></pre></div></div><p>As I wrote in <a href="https://macwright.com/2017/07/29/javascript-wats-dissected.html#numbers-are-weird">JavaScript wats, dissected</a>, this is the behavior of every popular programming language, even stodgy pedantic ones like Haskell. Floating point arithmetic might be weird, but it’s very consistent and well-specified: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> specification is rigorously implemented. So it’s not arithmetic: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication are pretty set in stone.</p><h3 id="math">Math</h3><p>What it was, was Math. In particular, all of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">the methods that come after <code>Math.</code></a></p><p>Methods like Math.sin, Math.cos, Math.exp, Math.pow, Math.tan: <a href="https://macwright.com/2013/03/05/math-for-pictures.html">essential ingredients for geometry</a> and basic computation. I started isolating changes in basic function behavior between versions. For example:</p><p>Calculating Math.tanh(0.1)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 4
0.09966799462495590234
// Node 6
0.09966799462495581907
</code></pre></div></div><p>Calculating Math.pow(1/3, 3)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 10
0.03703703703703703498
// Node 12
0.03703703703703702804
</code></pre></div></div><p>To make matters worse, it’s not just Node’s behavior that’s changing: so are browsers and other places you use JavaScript.</p><p>So this led to the question: <strong>what is math?</strong></p><svg fill="none" viewBox="0 0 1105 572" width="100%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h1105v572H0z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M551.933 460.719c92.311 0

coordinates on the rim, and that they’ll draw little squigglies if plotted on X &amp; Y. Actually <em>deriving</em> those methods is what you’ll learn in advanced classes, but the method that you use - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> - relies on an <em>infinite</em> series, which would be rather laborious for a computer to solve.</p><blockquote><p>“There is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. IEEE 754-2008, the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.”</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sine&amp;oldid=939445047#Software_implementations">Wikipedia</a></p><p>Computers use a variety of different estimations and algorithms to do math, things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a> and various cheating algorithms and lookup tables. This heterogeny explains all of the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=fastmath">‘fastmath’</a> libraries you can find on GitHub: there’s more than one way to implement Math.sin. Famously, Quake III Arena used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fast_inverse_square_root&amp;oldid=940101226">faster replacement for the inverse square root method</a> in order to speed up rendering.</p><p>So math is implemented as algorithms, and there are multiple common algorithms –&nbsp;and variations of those algorithms –&nbsp;used in practice.</p><p>Instead of telling implementations to pick an algorithm, the JavaScript specification grants them a <em>lot</em> of wiggle room in terms of how they implement these basic functions.</p><blockquote><p>The behaviour of the functions acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, atan2, cbrt, cos, cosh, exp, expm1, hypot, log,log1p, log2, log10, pow, random, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, and tanh is not precisely specified here except to require specific results for certain argument values that represent boundary cases of interest.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-function-properties-of-the-math-object">ECMA-262, 10th edition, section 20.2.2 aka “JavaScript”</a></p><p>I don’t know the inner workings of the standards committees, but I imagine they wanted to make sure that just in case Intel or AMD introduce super-fast new math instructions in a new processor, JavaScript wouldn’t have a compatibility crisis.</p><p>Because there are a lot of JavaScript interpreters that are commonly used, because JavaScript is often used via web browsers and there still is some competition between web browsers, and because even popular JavaScript implementations are under pressure to evolve quickly to be the most performant…&nbsp;because of all that, this matters. You actually will encounter, on a regular basis, differences in math.</p><p>This doesn’t matter as much in other interpreted languages, because they tend to have ‘canonical’ interpreters: most of the time you use the Python interpreter of the Python language.</p><h3 id="where-math-happens">Where math happens</h3><p>Next let’s zoom into <em>where</em> these math implementations live. See, in JavaScript, there are three places where basic math can happen:</p><ol><li>The CPU</li><li>The language interpreter (the C++ and C code that underlies JavaScript implementations)</li><li>In software itself, as a library</li></ol><p><strong>1: The CPU</strong></p><p>This was my first guess: I assumed that since CPUs implement arithmetic, they might implement some higher-level math. It turns out that CPUs do have instructions to do trigonometry and other operations, but they’re rarely invoked. The CPU (x86) implementation of sine doesn’t get much love because it’s not reliably faster than an implementation in software (using arithmetic operations on the CPU), nor as accurate.</p><p>Intel also bears some blame for <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/">overstating the accuracy of their trigonometric operations</a> by many magnitudes. That kind of mistake is especially tragic because, unlike software, you can’t patch chips.</p><p><strong>2: The language interpreter</strong></p><p>This is how most of the implementations do it, and they implement math in a variety of ways.</p><ul><li>V8 &amp; SpiderMonkey use (slightly different) ports of the <a href="https://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/">fdlibm</a> library for most operations. It has been passed down through the generations, originally written at Sun Microsystems.</li><li>JavaScriptCore (Safari) uses cmath for most operations.</li><li>Internet Explorer used some cmath, but <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore/blob/d86452259dd534718b7eb9ce024ed35aefd33036/lib/Runtime/Library/MathLibrary.cpp#L1028-L1047">also used some assembly instructions and actually <em>did</em> use CPU-provided trig methods</a> when it was compiled for CPUs that had them.</li></ul><p>Historically, all of these implementations have shifted: V8 used to use a homegrown solution for math, and then used <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/ff7975aa8d1ff6f0904f0f5112d17ea819466983/src/math.js">a port of fdlibm to JavaScript</a>, before finally settling on fdlibm in C.</p><h3 id="why-this-is-an-issue">Why this is an issue</h3><p>Here’s why this is a problem: it chips away at JavaScript’s ability to give consistent results to any problem including mathematics. And that especially hits <em>data science</em>. I want JavaScript to be a contender for data science in the browser, and – amongst some other issues, like number types and a confounding lack of a commonly-used data-frames library –&nbsp;an inability to produce replicable results means adding more crisis to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">replication crisis</a> in the sciences.</p><h3 id="the-third-way">The third way</h3><p>There is a way out that we can use today. <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">stdlib</a> is a JavaScript library that reimplements higher-level math using arithmetic alone. Arithmetic is fully-specified and standard, so the results that stdlib gives you are also fully consistent, across all the platforms.</p><p>This comes at the cost of complexity and speed: stdlib isn’t consistently as fast as built-in methods, and you’ll need to require a library ‘just’ to compute sine.</p><p>But in the wider view, this is pretty normal! WebAssembly, for example, doesn’t give you higher-level math methods at all and recommends you include a math implementation in your modules themselves:</p><blockquote><p>“WebAssembly doesn’t include its own math functions like sin, cos, exp, pow, and so on. WebAssembly’s strategy for such functions is to allow them to be implemented as library routines in WebAssembly itself (note that x86’s sin and cos instructions are slow and imprecise and are generally avoided these days anyway).”</p></blockquote><p>And this is the way that compiled languages have always worked: when you compile a C program, the methods you import from <code>math.h</code> are included in the compiled binary.</p><h3 id="using-an-epsilon">Using an epsilon</h3><p>If you don’t want to include stdlib to do math but you do want to test math-heavy code, you’ll probably have to do what simple-statistics does right now: use an epsilon. Of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epsilon&amp;oldid=938802001#Symbol">5+ uses of epsilon in math</a>, the one I’m referring to is “an arbitrarily small positive quantity”. It’s a tiny number. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/blob/727eaed049af4f788fb2299e5c8263573618e78c/src/epsilon.js#L35">simple-statistics’s implementation</a>: the number 0.0001.</p><p>You then compare <code>Math.abs(result - expected) &lt; epsilon</code> to make sure you got within range of the desired value, with a little bit of wiggle room.</p><h3 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The moral of the story</h3><p>Here’s where I was a little short on time in person and have some room to expand.</p><p><em>First, what’s under the hood is rarely what you expect.</em> Our current tech stack is heavily optimized and a lot of optimizations are really just dirty tricks. For example, the number of hardware instructions it takes to solve <code>Math.sin</code> varies based on the input, because there are lots of special cases. When you get to more complex cases, like ‘sorting an array’, there are often multiple algorithms that the interpreter chooses between in order to give you your final result. Basically, the cost of anything you do in an interpreted language is variable.</p><p><em>Second, don’t trust the system too much.</em> What I was seeing between Node versions really <em>should</em> have been a bug in the testing library, or something in my code, or maybe in simple-statistics itself. But in this case, digging deeper revealed that what I was seeing was exactly what you don’t expect: a glitch in the language itself.</p></div></div>

<p><em>“Combining Slack with Salesforce Customer 360 will be transformative for customers and the industry. The combination will create <strong>the operating system for the new way to work</strong>, uniquely enabling companies to grow and succeed in the all-digital world.”</em> (<a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx">link</a> – has the “operating system for x” analogy/strategy ever worked?)</p>



<p><em>“We’re going to help them to <strong>just</strong> <strong>redefine the entire industry</strong>,” Benioff said of Slack during a conference call with analysts. “When the moment and the opportunity arises, you have to look and ask yourself, are you strong? Can you do something like this? Or are you weak? Or is it a moment where you just don’t have the swagger?”</em> (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-benioff-escalates-microsoft-rivalry-050100329.html">link</a> – too little swagger likely the least of their problems…)</p>



<p><em>“What this is all about is <strong>the value of the social enterprise</strong>,” Benioff said on a call with analysts after the announcement, “And creating this incredible idea that you have <strong>this amazing hub of productivity, of collaboration and integration and applications</strong> <strong>that now leverage all this amazing data</strong>.”</em> (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-marc-benioff-acquiring-slack-brings-collaboration-vision-to-life-2020-12">link</a> – “x but for the enterprise” has a decidedly mixed record, but we’re long past the window when copying and pasting “social” into the enterprise might have seemed like an unequivocally positive thing)</p>



<p><em>“<strong>This moment is one we will remember a couple decades from now</strong>,” Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield said Wednesday during an appearance at Salesforce’s annual user conference. He <strong>likened the deal to the debut of Microsoft’s Windows 95 and the emergence of the cloud</strong>. “This is a pivotal moment and the opportunity to really transform the way that we work so we’re not relying on the physical office, so we can have a digital HQ,” Butterfield said.</em> (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-benioff-escalates-microsoft-rivalry-050100329.html">link</a> – did he say this with a straight face?)</p>


<p>Salesforce’s announcement it is acquiring Slack was just what you’d expect from a company that spends over 46 cents of every revenue dollar on marketing:</p>


<figure><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="500" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8.png 850w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-300x176.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-8-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"></figure>



<p>If there was a Magic Quadrant for Marketing Hyperbole, Swagger and Tchotchkes, Salesforce would occupy the highest and rightmost position in the entire history of Magic Quadrants. They would just redefine the entire Magic Quadrant in amazing ways (their language is remarkably Trumpian – just need ALL CAPS and a few typos…).</p>



<p>But the extravagant rhetoric did distract from several harsh realities:</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #1: SALESFORCE HAS BECOME A FINANCIAL ROLLUP</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce has become a financial play that is dependent on buying revenue to keep up its growth  and thereby valuation. The incremental revenue from Tableau just rolled off, so Salesforce’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/salesforce-pays-up-for-slack-the-informations-tech-briefing">growth rate dropped</a> in the quarter that was coincidentally reported concurrent with the acquisition announcement. And they are forecasting their <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/salesforce-q3-earnings-stock-price-slack-deal-weak-growth-guidance-2020-12-1029858085">slowest growth</a> since 2009 next quarter. Hence it is time for another deal. Timing may take precedence over price or strategic plausibility.</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #2: THIS IS A VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE ACQUISITION</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce is paying 33 times Slack’s TTM (trailing twelve month) revenue (as of the Dec 2 close). Salesforce itself trades below 10 times TTM revenue. Even the untethered to reality Telsa only trades at 19 times TTM revenue. They are paying a premium of over 50% relative to where Slack’s stock was trading before the deal leaked (which is spectacular for Slack shareholders). $27.7 billion is an awful lot to pay for IRC chat, without competitive video or audio, and not much of a developer platform. Wall Street, who can usually rationalize any valuation, are <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/salesforce-stock-drops-as-wall-street-questions-necessity-of-slack-purchase-11606930849">questioning</a> the price (and the strategic rationale). As Salesforce’s stock <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/salesforce-slumps-8-5-as-its-post-slack-selloff-continues/">wilts</a> due to a lack of enthusiasm in some circles for the deal, it becomes a bigger and bigger transaction for them, making it even harder to pay off. With Salesforce’s valuation down ~$35 billion since it leaked, this deal might not get consummated (Benioff previously backed off buying Twitter when investors failed to share his enthusiasm).</p>



<p>There are many better discussions of the financial aspects of this deal, but the key point is it is priced for absolute perfection. That means, among other things, they will have to generate a lot of revenue from Slack and can’t just give it away for free to existing customers to claim victory.</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #3: SALESFORCE HAS A TERRIBLE RECORD AT INTEGRATING ACQUIRED PRODUCTS</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce has bought a lot of companies (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-benioff-escalates-microsoft-rivalry-050100329.html">60+</a>), but has struggled to integrate them at the product level, or consolidate them onto a common platform. They even bought an integration product (Mulesoft), but it hasn’t helped. The glass-half-full take  is they have let their acquisitions “be” and instead focused on selling the hell out of each product (and Salesforce can sell if nothing else) versus integrating across the portfolio. But once under the Salesforce umbrella, product roadmaps evolve on geologic time.</p>



<p>Letting Slack just “be” is not an option for this deal, as the entire premise is Slack will be threaded through everything and provide a coherence across the entire Salesforce portfolio that has never existed. They even <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx">see</a> it as the common thread for <strong>all</strong> other business apps:</p>



<blockquote><p>“As the new interface for Salesforce Customer 360, Slack will transform how people communicate, collaborate and take action on customer information across Salesforce as well as information from all of their other business apps and systems to be more productive, make smarter, faster decisions and create connected customer experiences.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This is a big ambition for a company that has consistently struggled to do this kind of engineering (this is a company that is in its second decade of trying to figure out how to get off Oracle). Lets call it a major risk factor. Lets call it a major potential distraction from the real prerequisite for this vision, which is a singular, underlying data platform.</p>



<p>Benioff even almost <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-marc-benioff-acquiring-slack-brings-collaboration-vision-to-life-2020-12">acknowledges</a> they have not had the technical wherewithal to make this supposedly long-held vision real (but expects a couple of new hires will single-handedly get it done…):</p>



<blockquote><p>“I can’t even think about how many conversations Parker [Harris] and I have had on this vision,” Benioff said, “And then to see Stewart come in with Bret and make it all real. Well, that’s just awesome.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Salesforce seems to be hoping an IRC chat company can build out a broad enterprise platform for them, because they have not been able to do it themselves.</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #4: SALESFORCE IS NEITHER A BEAR NOR AN ALLIGATOR (MORE LIKE AMWAY)</strong></h2>



<p>There once was a <a href="https://25iq.com/2014/05/31/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-jim-barksdale-and-barksdaleisms/">folksy executive</a>, who was better at aphorisms than email (unfortunately, his company sold email). He said:“In a fight between a bear and an alligator, it is the terrain which determines who wins”. To this day, I’m not sure if he thought his company was the bear or the alligator (he lost regardless), but the battle for information workers is (to change metaphors mid-sentence) an away game for Salesforce. They simply don’t understand or have experience with this customer audience, and previous efforts like Chatter and Quip reinforce this.</p>



<p>Some skepticism has been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/25/slack-salesforce">expressed</a> at Salesforce’s ability to build software beyond that which you’re required to use if you want to get your commission check:</p>



<blockquote><p>“If there’s anyone who knows how to make great apps and artfully-crafted user experiences, it’s Salesforce.”</p></blockquote>



<p>More directly, as much as Salesforce wants to move beyond the back office, it takes more than desire to compete in new markets against entrenched competitors (most notably Microsoft Office).</p>



<h2><strong>REALITY #5: THE PANDEMIC TAILWIND ARGUMENT HAS A FATAL FLAW</strong></h2>



<p>Salesforce seems to say things are different this time because Slack has skills Salesforce doesn’t AND the <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx">pandemic changes everything</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The events of this year have greatly accelerated the move by companies and governments to an all-digital world, where work happens wherever people are—whether they’re in the office, at home or somewhere in between. They need to deliver connected experiences for their customers across every touchpoint and enable their employees to work seamlessly wherever they are.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The problem is we’ve already run this experiment. Slack is having to sell out because they “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/slack-missed-out-on-the-pandemics-zoom-boom-leaving-it-vulnerable-11606478401">missed the pandemic boom</a>”/”<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/how-slack-lost-the-pandemic">lost the pandemic</a>”, in stark contrast to their competitors Microsoft Teams and Zoom. The outcome of a Slack-led assault on the Microsoft Office franchise is not some future hypothetical – we have already seen how this battle plays out. Beyond Teams, Slack has also lost significant ground to Discord.</p>



<p>Which at long last brings me to my actual point…</p>



<h2><strong>UNSUSTAINABILITY OF SAAS SPRAWL</strong></h2>



<p>Regardless of whether the Slackforce deal makes financial sense or can be successfully executed, it is just one (overly dramatized) episode in the unfolding consolidation of SaaS business applications.</p>



<p>On the supply side, we have too many SaaS apps, with the ocean of venture capital fueled by zero-interest rates funding ever more SaaS companies on the assumption that what worked a decade ago will continue to work a decade hence (financiers also like SaaS because it models out nicely in a spreadsheet). Most new SaaS companies are chasing ever smaller markets (the more interesting opportunity is to go after the bigger, horizontal OG SaaS companies, many of which like Salesforce have settled comfortably into a product middle age).</p>



<p>But the demand side is the real impetus for SaaS consolidation. Companies simply have too many SaaS applications and collectively it’s gotten too hard to procure, manage, and get value out of a vast archipelago of siloed SaaS applications.</p>



<p>We’ll see consolidation that leverages existing customer relationships, expands product footprints, and integrates adjacent functionality. Salesforce is a consolidator if not necessarily an integrator. Twilio, with the acquisition of Segment, has shown it intends to be a consolidator. Others are (or should be if they’re not) wrestling with the question of whether they are predators or prey. Private equity will continue to buy up software companies, but have yet to show they can …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>With the recent outage on AWS last week, there have been a lot of discussions about various architectures and how effective they would've been to combat the downtime. Since these vary a lot in cost, complexity, and tradeoffs, I want to go through a couple of them at a high level, then dive into one that was unfortunately missing from much of the conversation.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cloud">Multi-Cloud</h2>
<p>First were comments made about the value of going multi-cloud. The idea of this is to run your application in… multiple clouds.
<img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-cloud.png" alt="Multi-Cloud">
By spreading the load across multiple providers, you are insulated in case one of them goes down. In theory, it sounds great! Surely two cloud vendors won't go down at the same time! In practice, this is horrible at the application level for a multitude of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The infrastructure is different for each cloud</li>
<li>Deployments gain a magnitude of complexity</li>
<li>Bandwidth charges to go between the two are outrageous</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, a multi-cloud architecture would not be a feasible option for high availability (outside a select few edge cases).</p>
<h2 id="multi-region">Multi-Region</h2>
<p>Next, there were talks about multi-region. An AWS Region is a group of multiple availability zones (AZ), with each AZ being one or more discrete data centers with independent power, networking, and connectivity. Operating in a single region across multiple AZs provides high availability, but doesn't provide DR. For that, you need multiple regions. A very simplified version of a multi-region setup looks like this:
<img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-region.png" alt="Multi-Region">
This fixes a couple of the issues of going multi-cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your application will stay in the same cloud, so the infrastructure will stay the same</li>
<li>Regions are completely separated, so you get the same availability benefits!</li>
<li>Region-to-region bandwidth charges are much lower than cloud-to-cloud fees!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the comments were around <em>Active-Active</em> multi-region. That is, distributing the load across multiple regions at the same time. This adds in a lot of complexities around keeping the persistence layer in sync. This also adds complexity around deployments and has a lot of places for things to go wrong. This can lead to more self-inflicted downtime than AWS has ever caused.</p>
<h2 id="multi-region-dr">Multi-Region DR</h2>
<p>This is the one that has been largely overlooked in recent days. It is the idea that only a single region is active at a time, and a secondary region is capable of taking over in the event of a disaster (hence DR). This shares the benefits listed above. However, it is able to largely mitigate the complexities of a full Active-Active setup. Under this setup, the secondary region doesn't need to be fully built - only persistent data needs to be replicated.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.forelse.io/multi-region-dr.png" alt="Multi-Region"></p>
<p>But wait, won't it take a while to deploy the full application stack in the event of a disaster? Yes… yes it will. And this is okay! High-Availability is achieved by using multiple AZs is sufficient for most common outages. If an entire <em>region</em> has issues, like we saw last week, spending &lt;1 hour standing up a new stack from backups is still preferable to a &gt;8 hour outage. This process can be streamlined via automation, but even if it's a manual (but practiced) operation, the fact that you <em>actually have options</em> is important.</p>
<p>So let's dive into this a little more to explore what it looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application is deployed as usual in the primary region</li>
<li>Using AWS managed services, backups and replication for persistent data is generally a configuration setting or two away:
<ul>
<li>Add a read replica to RDS in a different region</li>
<li>Create a Dynamo DB global table</li>
<li>Enable S3 bucket replication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the event of a fail-over, deploy the application in the other region (hopefully using Infrastructure-as-Code) and update DNS settings
<ul>
<li>This process should be regularly tested</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this a silver-bullet? Absolutely not. It won't work for every workload, and definitely won't work for every type of outage. However, it is a relatively simple solution that can also be cost effective. And last week, it could've allowed clients to be back up and functioning long before services in us-east-1 were fully restored.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In conclusion, outages happen. This does not diminish the value of AWS in any way, but it does make clear the importance of good architecture and planning. There are some very expensive and elaborate systems that can be designed to mitigate these outages, but which are overkill and impractical for most clients. Fortunately, there are other options that may offer an “effective enough” solution with reasonable tradeoffs, which should become “best-practice” when working in AWS.</p>

December 3, 2020 | https://www.snowpack.dev/posts/2020-12-03-snowpack-3-release-candidate | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.snowpack.dev/posts/2020-12-03-snowpack-3-release-candidate">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="grid-body">

      <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Snowpack v3.0 will release on January 6th, 2021 (the one-year anniversary of its original launch post). This is our biggest release yet with some serious new features, including <strong>a new way to load npm imports on-demand</strong> and skip the frontend <code>npm install</code> step entirely.</p>
<p>Best of all: it’s all available to try today!</p>
<h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-new%3F">What’s New?</h2>
<p>Snowpack v3 will focus on the polish &amp; official release of four features already available today in the current version of Snowpack (v2.18.0) under the <code>experiments</code> flag:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>experiments.source</code>- Streaming npm imports, no install step required.</li>
<li><code>experiments.optimize</code> - Built-in bundling, preloading, and asset minifying.</li>
<li><code>experiments.routes</code> - Advanced config for HTML fallbacks and API proxies.</li>
<li><code>import 'snowpack'</code> - A brand new JavaScript API for Snowpack integrations.</li>
</ul>
<video preload="auto" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">

    <source src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/snowpackskypack.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h2 id="new%3A-streaming-npm-imports">New: Streaming NPM Imports</h2>
<p>Snowpack has always pushed the limits of frontend development, and this release is no different. Snowpack v3.0 introduces an exciting new feature to speed up &amp; simplify your development workflow.</p>
<p>Typically, JavaScript dependencies are installed and managed locally by a package manager CLI like <code>npm</code>, <code>yarn</code> or <code>pnpm</code>. Packages are often bloated with unrelated files and almost never run directly in the browser. Additional steps are required to process, build and bundle these installed packages so that they can actually run in browser.</p>
<p><strong>What if we could simplify this? What if Snowpack could skip the “npm install” step entirely and just fetch the relevant, pre-built package code on-demand via ESM?</strong></p>
<pre><code><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'react'</span><span>;</span><p><br><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> React <span>from</span> <span>'https://cdn.skypack.dev/react@17.0.1'</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>That URL in the example above points to <a href="https://skypack.dev/">Skypack</a>, a popular JavaScript CDN that we built to serve every npm package as ESM. Importing dependencies by URL like this is well supported in Snowpack, Deno, and all major browsers. But writing these URLs directly into your source code isn’t ideal and makes development impossible without a network connection.</p>
<p><strong>Snowpack v3.0 brings together the best of both worlds:</strong> Get the simplicity of <code>import 'react'</code> in your own source code and let Snowpack fetch these dependencies behind the scenes, pre-built and ready to run in the browser. Snowpack caches everything for you automatically, so you can continue to work offline without relying on Skypack besides the first package fetch.</p>
<p>This has several benefits over the traditional “npm install” approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Skip the install + build steps for dependencies, and load your dependencies as pre-build ESM code directly from the Skypack CDN.</li>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> ESM packages are pre-built into JavaScript for you and never given access to <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-zimmermann.pdf">run code on your machine</a>. Third-party code only ever run in the browser sandbox.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> ESM packages are managed by Snowpack, so frontend projects that don’t need Node.js (Rails, PHP, etc.) can drop the npm CLI entirely if they choose.</li>
<li><strong>Same Final Build:</strong> When you build your site for production, package code is transpiled with the rest of your site and tree-shaken to your exact imports, resulting in a final build that’s nearly identical.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this all sounds too wild for you, don’t worry. This is <strong>100% opt-in</strong> behavior for those who want it. By default, Snowpack will continue to pull your npm package dependencies out of your project <code>node_modules</code> directory like it always has.</p>
<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/streaming-npm-imports">Streaming NPM Imports</a> to learn more about how to enable this new behavior in your project today. In a future release, we hope to open this up to custom ESM package sources and other CDNs as well.</p>

<h2 id="built-in-optimizations%2C-powered-by-esbuild">Built-in Optimizations, Powered by esbuild</h2>
<p><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> is a marvel: it performs 100x faster than most other popular bundlers and over 300x faster than Parcel (by esbuilds own benchmarks). esbuild is written in Go, a compiled language that can parallelize heavy bundling workloads where other popular bundlers – written in JavaScript – cannot.</p>
<p>Snowpack already uses esbuild internally as our default single-file builder for JavaScript, TypeScript and JSX files. Snowpack v3.0 takes this integration one step further, with a new built-in build optimization pipeline. Bundle, minify, and transpile your site for production in 1/100th of the time of other bundlers.</p>
<p>Snowpack is able to adopt esbuild today thanks to an early bet that we made on the future of bundling: <strong>bundling is a post-build optimization, and not the core foundation that everything is built on top of.</strong> Thanks to this early design decision, esbuild can be plugged in and swapped out of your Snowpack build as easily as any other bundler.</p>
<p>esbuild is still a young project, but it’s future looks promising. In the meantime, we will also continue to invest in the existing Webpack &amp; Rollup bundler plugins for a long time to come.</p>
<p>To get started, check out the <code>experiments.optimize</code> option in our newest <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/optimize-and-bundle">Optimizing Your Snowpack Build</a> guide.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-routes.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s new <code>experiments.routes</code> configuration lets you define routes that align your dev environment with production. This unlocks some interesting new use-cases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Proxies</strong> - Route all <code>/api/*</code> URLs to another URL or localhost port.</li>
<li><strong>SPA Fallbacks</strong> - Serve an app shell <code>index.html</code> to all requested routes.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Site Loads</strong> - Speed up your site and serve different HTML shell files for each route.</li>
<li><strong>Island Architecture</strong> - Serve HTML that renders individual components on the page, in parallel. (Made popular by <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit">Jason Miller</a> in <a href="https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/">this blog post</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Mimic Vercel/Netlify</strong> - Re-create your Vercel or Netlify routes in development. Or, create a Snowpack plugin to automatically generate these routes from your <code>vercel.json</code> or <code>_redirects</code> file at startup.</li>
</ul>
<p>While API proxying and SPA fallbacks have already been supported in Snowpack for a while now, this brings them all together into a single, expressive new API.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snowpack.dev/img/post-snowpackv3-jsapi.png" alt="js api"></p>
<h2 id="a-new-javascript-api">A New JavaScript API</h2>
<p>Snowpack’s new JavaScript API grants you more advanced control over Snowpack’s dev server and build pipeline, helping you build more powerful integrations on top of Snowpack to unlock new kinds of dev tooling and server-side rendering (SSR) solutions.</p>
<p>The Svelte team recently made news with <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit">SvelteKit</a>: An official, zero-effort SSR app framework for Svelte apps. SvelteKit is powered internally by Snowpack, using our brand-new JavaScript API to manage your build pipeline and build files on-demand. Snowpack speeds up development and helps to cut SvelteKit’s startup time to near-zero.</p>
<p>Check out our new <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/reference/javascript-interface">JavaScript API reference</a> to start building your own custom integrations on top of Snowpack. Or, read through our new guide on <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/server-side-render">Server-Side Rendering</a> to get started with a custom SSR integration for production.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>You can install the Snowpack v3.0 release candidate today by running:</p>
<pre><code>npm install snowpack@next
</code></pre>
<p>Since all v3.0 features already exist in Snowpack today, our existing documentation site applies to both v2 &amp; v3. At this point only very old, undocumented, legacy behavior has been removed from the <code>next</code> v3.0 branch.</p>
<p>Features under the <code>experiments</code> flag may continue to change as we get closer to the official release date. By the end of the year, you can expect that these features will move out from behind the <code>experiments</code> flag and into top-level config objects in the <code>next</code> v3.0 branch.</p>

<p>Modern languages like Python, NodeJS, and Go make it easy to handle
concurrent requests for multiple customers at the same time by using threads or goroutines.</p>

<p>Such services seem very cost effective because one process can handle hundreds or thousands
of tenants. However, this efficiency comes at a hidden, steep price. When language runtime
scheduling breaks down, one tenant can cause an outage for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-made-simple">Concurrency made simple</h2>

<p>Go makes it trivial to handle concurrency.</p>

<p>Here is an example from <a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1">A Tour Of Go</a> that
launches two goroutines that work independently of each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>say</span>(<span>s</span> <span>string</span>) {
	<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>5</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
		<span>time</span>.<span>Sleep</span>(<span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Millisecond</span>)
		<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>s</span>)
	}
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>go</span> <span>say</span>(<span>"world"</span>)
	<span>say</span>(<span>"hello"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Go runtime makes sure that each goroutine gets its fair share of CPU and memory.
It gives the impression that both run in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># GOMAXPROCS sets system threads to 1</span>
<span># This sets up the go language runtime to use one system thread across</span>
<span># all goroutines. Removing this setting will introduce some parallelism,</span>
<span># but will not solve the problems described in this article.</span>
$ GOMAXPROCS<span>=</span><span>1</span> go run main.go
world
hello
hello
world
...</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="language-runtimes-and-multi-tenancy">Language Runtimes and Multi-Tenancy</h2>

<p>Let’s implement a sample Go SaaS that fetches the contents of a URL
for multiple tenants in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>
)

<span>// fetch in our example performs some SaaS work for a tenant,
</span><span>// in this case it gets the URL contents from the internet
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>work</span>(<span>wg</span> <span>*</span><span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>, <span>tenant</span> <span>int</span>, <span>url</span> <span>string</span>) {
    <span>defer</span> <span>wg</span>.<span>Done</span>()
    <span>// Don't ignore errors in real code, folks, and close the response body
</span><span></span>    <span>re</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
        <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) error -&gt; -&gt;  %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>err</span>)
        <span>return</span>
    }
    <span>defer</span> <span>re</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) -&gt; %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>re</span>.<span>Status</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}
    <span>url</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"http://www.golang.org/"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>tenant</span> &lt; <span>3</span>; <span>tenant</span><span>++</span> {
        <span>wg</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>1</span>)
        <span>// 'go' starts a goroutine, a lightweight thread which is managed by the Go runtime
</span><span></span>        <span>// https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1
</span><span></span>        <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>url</span>)
    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span>.<span>Wait</span>()
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>My computer runs the program in no time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ go run simple/main.go 
Tenant<span>(</span>2<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>1<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>0<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK</code></pre></div>
<p>We can imagine that the Go runtime executes the program in the following order:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle0</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle0</span>, <span>goroutine0</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine0</span>)

<span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle1</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle1</span>, <span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>...</span>
<span>// main program waits until any function returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>...</span> 
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
<span>// main program waits until any other handle returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This parallelism and blocking call is an illusion created by a combination of the use of the asynchronous
<a href="https://kovyrin.net/2006/04/13/epoll-asynchronous-network-programming/">epoll</a> Linux function
and Go’s built in runtime scheduler. <code>epoll</code> can efficiently handle thousands of network sockets at once.</p>

<p>The Go runtime activates a smart scheduler to handle <code>go</code> statements - goroutines.
It makes sure that every goroutine gets its share of CPU time and suspends
execution when the function is waiting on network or file input/output.
It’s not unusual to have tens of thousands of goroutines in the system
and see the Go runtime handle the requests well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a more detailed intro to the Go scheduler, take a look at this article
from <a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part2.html">Ardan Labs</a>.</p>

<p>This makes Go a great language for handling concurrent network requests
that constitute the bulk of an average software as a service program that reads and writes to a database
or an external service.</p>

<h2 id="when-fair-scheduling-breaks-down">When fair scheduling breaks down</h2>

<p>Language runtimes do not have full control and visibility into
the resource allocation that is done by the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>This is where the multi-tenancy service promise of fair scheduling breaks down.</p>

<p>Take a look at this number-crunching service that computes factorials on demand:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>

)

<span>// This implementation has a problem, but our code review did not catch it -

        <span>b</span> <span>*=</span> <span>i</span>
    }
    <span>return</span> <span>b</span>
}

}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}

</span><span></span>        <span>if</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> {
            <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>10000000000</span>)
        } <span>else</span> {

    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish

}

<p>In this case, you would not observe the same efficient parallelism.</p>

<p>Because of the inefficient factorial implementation that took a lot of iterations
and number crunching, tenant 0 consumed all the CPU time and degraded performance for the others.</p>

<p>We can fix the factorial function and add code that limits the possible input numbers.
However, our service has just suffered an outage due to a bug in the code for all our customers,
<a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/workflow-access-pageduty-slack/">PagerDuty</a> is ringing and we are not sleeping again.</p>

<h2 id="a-real-world-example">A real-world example</h2>

<p>I made up our factorial example, but let’s create a real world one using
decompression bombs.</p>

<p>Decompression bombs are specially crafted archives that are small, but expand
into files ranging from tens to thousands of times their size.</p>

<p>They are specifically designed to take down your service. Anyone can download
one <a href="https://bomb.codes/bombs">from the internet</a>.</p>

<p>Some archives use simple techniques like compressing very large files
filled with zeroes. They take advantage of the fact that compression algorithms
represent a huge file with zeroes with a version of <code>repeat billion zeroes here</code>.</p>

<p>More <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_fifield_0.pdf">sophisticated approaches</a>
explore compression techniques in depth and craft evil files
that can explode to petabytes of disk space. The danger is real and lots of programs are
vulnerable on the internet right now.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the effect of such archive on a multi-tenant service.
Our new service unpacks the archive and counts the number of words in a file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<p>The recent success of neural networks has boosted research on pattern recognition and data mining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machine learning tasks, like object detection, machine translation, and speech recognition, have been given new life with end-to-end deep learning paradigms like CNN, RNN, or autoencoders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deep Learning is good at capturing hidden patterns of Euclidean data (images, text, videos).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But <strong>what about applications where data is generated from non-Euclidean domains, represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependencies between objects?</strong></p>



<p><strong>That’s where <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-graph-convolutional-networks-for-node-classification-a2bfdb7aba7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Graph Neural Networks </a>(GNN) come in</strong>, which we’ll explore in this article. We’ll start with graph theories and basic definitions, move on to GNN forms and principles, and finish with some applications of GNN.</p>





<h2 id="Graph">What is a Graph?</h2>



<p>The most fundamental part of GNN is a Graph.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In computer science, a <strong>graph is a data structure consisting of two components: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-graph-convolutional-networks-for-node-classification-a2bfdb7aba7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nodes</a> (vertices) and edges</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A graph <em><strong>G</strong></em> can be defined as <em><strong>G = (V, E)</strong></em>, where<strong> <em>V</em></strong> is the set of nodes, and <em><strong>E</strong></em> are the edges between them.</p>



<p>If there are directional dependencies between nodes then edges are directed. If not, edges are undirected.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="160" height="144" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Directed-graph.png?resize=160%2C144&amp;ssl=1" alt="Directed graph" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Directed Graph | <a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qpdwFvjH3LzyCUO9.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>A graph can represent things like social media networks, or molecules. Think of nodes as users, and edges as connections. A social media graph might look like this:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="438" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/social-media-graph.png?resize=500%2C438&amp;ssl=1" alt="social media graph" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/social-media-graph.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/social-media-graph.png?resize=300%2C263&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LGZFJIY4Wb_PJNPr.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Source</em></a></p>



<p>A graph is often represented by <em><strong>A</strong></em>, an adjacency matrix.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a graph has <strong><em>n</em></strong> nodes, <strong><em>A</em></strong> has a dimension of <em><strong>(n × n)</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes the nodes have a set of features (for example, a user profile). If the node has <em><strong>f</strong></em> numbers of features, then the node feature matrix <em><strong>X</strong></em> has a dimension of <em><strong>(n × f)</strong></em>.</p>

<h3><strong>Why is it hard to analyze a graph?</strong></h3>



<p>Graph data is so complex that it’s created a lot of challenges for existing machine learning algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason is that conventional Machine Learning and Deep Learning tools are specialized in simple data types. Like images with the same structure and size, which we can think of as fixed-size grid graphs. Text and speech are sequences, so we can think of them as line graphs.</p>



<p>But there are more complex graphs, without a fixed form, with a variable size of unordered nodes, where nodes can have different amounts of neighbors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also doesn’t help that existing machine learning algorithms have a core assumption that instances are independent of each other. This is false for graph data, because each node is related to others by links of various types.</p>

<h2 id="GNN">Graph Neural Network</h2>



<p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning methods designed to perform inference on data described by graphs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GNNs are neural networks that can be directly applied to graphs, and provide an easy way to do node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks.</p>



<p>GNNs can do what Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) failed to do.</p>






<h3><strong>Why do Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) fail on graphs?</strong></h3>



<p>CNNs can be used to make machines visualize things, and perform tasks like image classification, image recognition, or object detection. This is where CNNs are the most popular.</p>



<p>The core concept behind CNNs introduces hidden convolution and pooling layers to identify spatially localized features via a set of receptive fields in kernel form.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="514" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1" alt="Convolutional Neural Networks" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=1024%2C514&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?resize=768%2C385&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Convolutional-Neural-Networks.png?w=1052&amp;ssl=1 1052w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>CNN on an image | <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>How does convolution operate on images that are regular grids? We slide the convolutional operator window across a two-dimensional image, and we compute some function over that sliding window. Then, we pass it through many layers.</p>



<p>Our goal is to generalize the notion of convolution beyond these simple two-dimensional lattices.</p>



<p>The insight allowing us to reach our goal is that <strong>convolution takes a little sub-patch of the image (a little rectangular part of the image), applies a function to it, and produces a new part (a new pixel).&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>What happens is that the center node of that center pixel aggregates information from its neighbors, as well as from itself, to produce a new value.</p>



<p>It’s very difficult to perform CNN on graphs because of the arbitrary size of the graph, and the complex topology, which means there is no spatial locality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also unfixed node ordering. If we first labeled the nodes A, B, C, D, E, and the second time we labeled them B, D, A, E, C, then the inputs of the matrix in the network will change. Graphs are invariant to node ordering, so we want to get the same result regardless of how we order the nodes.</p>






<h2>Basics of Deep Learning for graphs</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-deep-learning/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">graph theory</a>, we implement the concept of Node Embedding. It means mapping nodes to a d- dimensional embedding space (low dimensional space rather than the actual dimension of the graph), so that similar nodes in the graph are embedded close to each other.</p>



<p>Our goal is to map nodes so that similarity in the embedding space approximates similarity in the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s define <strong><em>u</em></strong> and <strong><em>v</em></strong> as two nodes in a graph.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>x<sub>u</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>x<sub>v</sub></em></strong> are two feature vectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now we’ll define the encoder function <em><strong>Enc(u)</strong></em> and <em><strong>Enc(v)</strong></em>, which convert the feature vectors to <strong><em>z<sub>u</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>z<sub>v</sub></em></strong>.</p>



<p>Note: the similarity function could be Euclidean distance.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/similarity-function.png?resize=583%2C364&amp;ssl=1" alt="similarity function" width="583" height="364" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/similarity-function.png?w=777&amp;ssl=1 777w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/similarity-function.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/similarity-function.png?resize=768%2C479&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/similarity-function.png?resize=400%2C250&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p><strong>So the challenge now is how to come up with the encoder function?</strong></p>



<p>The encoder function should be able to perform :</p>



<ul><li>Locality (local network neighborhoods)</li><li>Aggregate information</li><li>Stacking multiple layers (computation)</li></ul>



<p>Locality information can be achieved by using a computational graph. As shown in the graph below, <em><strong>i</strong></em> is the red node where we see how this node is connected to its neighbors and those neighbors’ neighbors. We’ll see all the possible connections, and form a computation graph.</p>



<p>By doing this, we’re capturing the structure, and also borrowing feature information at the same time.</p>

<p><em>Neighborhood exploration and information sharing | <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Once the locality information preserves the computational graph, we start aggregating. This is basically done using neural networks.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?resize=744%2C345&amp;ssl=1" alt="Neural networks" width="744" height="345" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?w=992&amp;ssl=1 992w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?resize=300%2C139&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Neural-networks.png?resize=768%2C356&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Neural Networks are presented in grey boxes. They require aggregations to be order-invariant, like sum, average, maximum, because they are permutation-invariant functions. This property enables the aggregations to be performed.</p>



<p>Let’s move on to the <strong>forward propagation rule </strong>in GNNs. It determines how the information from the input will go to the output side of the neural network.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?resize=763%2C317&amp;ssl=1" alt="Many Layers" width="763" height="317" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?w=1017&amp;ssl=1 1017w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Many-Layers.png?resize=768%2C319&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p><em>Deep Model: Many Layers | <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/slides/08-GNN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a></em></p>



<p>Every node has a feature vector.</p>



<p>For example, (<strong><em>X<sub>A</sub></em></strong>) is a feature vector of node<em><strong> A</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The inputs are those feature vectors, and the box will take the two feature vectors (<strong><em>X<sub>A</sub></em></strong> and <strong><em>X<sub>c</sub></em></strong>), aggregate them, and then pass on to the next layer.</p>



<p>Notice that, for example, the input at node <em><strong>C</strong></em> are the features of node<em><strong> C</strong></em>, but the representation of node <em><strong>C</strong></em> in layer 1 will be a hidden, latent representation of the node, and in layer 2 it’ll be another latent representation.</p>



<p>So in order to perform forward propagation in this computational graph, we need 3 steps:</p>



<p><strong>1. Initialize the activation units: </strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CLARGE%20h_v%5E0%20%3D%20X_v%5C%3B%20%28feature%5C%3B%20vector%29" alt="" width="252" height="27" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<p><strong>2. Every layer in the network:</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clarge%20h_v%5Ek%20%3D%20%5Csigma%20%28W_k%20%5Csum%20%5Cfrac%20%7Bh_u%5E%7Bk-1%7D%7D%20%7B%5Cmid%20N%28v%29%7D%20+%20B_k%20h_v%5E%7Bk-1%7D%29%24%20where%20%24k%3D%201%2C...%2C%20k-1" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>






<p>We can notice that there are two parts for this equation:</p>



<ul><li>The first part is basically averaging all the neighbors of node <strong><em>v</em></strong>.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clarge%20W_k%20%5Csum%20%5Cfrac%20%7Bh_u%5E%7Bk-1%7D%7D%20%7B%5Cmid%20%7BN%28v%29%7D%7D" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<ul><li>The second part is the previous layer embedding of node <em><strong>v</strong></em> multiplied with a bias <strong><em>B<sub>k</sub></em></strong>, which is a trainable weight matrix and it’s basically a self-loop activation for node <strong><em>v</em></strong>.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CLARGE%20B_k%20h_v%5E%7Bk-1%7D" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<ul><li><strong>σ</strong>: the non-linearity activation that is performed on the two parts.</li></ul>



<p><strong>3. The last equation (at the final layer):</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CLARGE%20z_v%20%3D%20h_v%5EK" alt="" title="This is the rendered form of the equation. You can not edit this directly. Right click will give you the option to save the image, and in most browsers you can drag the image onto your desktop or another program."></figure></div>



<p>It’s the embedding after <strong><em>K</em></strong> layers of neighborhood aggregation.</p>



<p>Now, to train the model we need to define a loss function on the embeddings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can feed the embeddings into any loss function and run stochastic gradient descent to train the weight parameters.</p>



<p>Training can be unsupervised or supervised:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Unsupervised training:</strong><br>Use only the graph structure: similar nodes have similar embeddings. Unsupervised loss function can be a loss based on node proximity in the graph, or random walks.</li><li><strong>Supervised training:</strong><br>Train model for a supervised task like node classification, normal or anomalous node.</li></ul>



<p>To recap, in this section we described a basic idea of generating node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, I’ll discuss Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).</p>






<h2 id="GCN">Graph Convolutional Networks</h2>



<p>GCNs were first introduced in “Spectral Networks and Deep Locally Connected Networks on Graphs” (Bruna et al, 2014), as a method for applying neural networks to graph-structured data.</p>



<p>The simplest GCN has only three different operators:</p>



<ul><li>Graph convolution</li><li>Linear layer</li><li>Nonlinear activation</li></ul>



<p>The operations are usually done in this order. Together, they make up one network layer. We can combine one or more layers to form a complete GCN.</p>



<p>In Python, we can easily build a GCN using PyTorch:</p>



<pre><span>import</span> torch
<span>from</span> torch <span>import</span> nn

<span><span>class</span> <span>GCN</span><span>(nn.Module)</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(self, *sizes)</span>:</span>
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Linear(x, y) <span>for</span> x, y <span>in</span> zip(sizes[:<span>-1</span>], sizes[<span>1</span>:])
        ])

<h3><strong>GraphSAGE idea</strong></h3>



<p>GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al, NIPS 2017) is a representation learning technique for dynamic graphs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It can predict the embedding of a new node, without needing a re-training procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this, GraphSAGE uses inductive learning. It learns aggregator functions which can induce new node embedding, based on the features and neighborhood of the node.</p>

                <p>If you work in Silicon Valley, you’ve probably heard of The University of Waterloo (UW). And if you haven’t, the easiest way to explain it is that Waterloo is Canada’s answer to Stanford.</p><p>Located in Canada’s burgeoning tech hub, Kitchener-Waterloo, Waterloo has become famous for two things: its comprehensive STEM programs, and the increasing number of alums who are making a name for themselves in tech.</p><p>In an ecosystem full of famous drop-outs, when a university is able to compete in Silicon Valley, it stands out. As a Waterloo student myself, here’s why I think they’ve been able to.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/12/uw.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/uw.jpg 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2020/12/uw.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="the-co-op-program-or-what-makes-uw-s-stem-programs-different-"><strong>The co-op program, or what makes UW’s STEM programs different. </strong></h2><p>One of the most frequent criticisms about college you’ll hear in Silicon Valley is that it doesn’t give you as robust of a tech education as real life work experience does. The idea is that anything you learn in a classroom you could learn out in the field, and usually, not only better, but at no cost to you. &nbsp;</p><p>Waterloo’s Cooperative Education program, also known as the co-op program, solves for this issue. </p><p>At Waterloo, students can choose to alternate between academic terms and paid work. If they take advantage of this opportunity, they can graduate with up to two years of work experience. By contrast, in the United States, it’s a difficult dance between work and school—you’re often left with the choice of staying in college, or dropping out to pursue work.</p><p>The benefits of the co-op program extend beyond the hands-on learning experience, too.</p><ol><li>Students who participate in the co-op program can earn an average of $80,500 over their working semester. This gives students the opportunity, regardless of their socioeconomic status coming into school, to graduate with little or no debt.</li><li>Waterloo also has a phenomenal alumni network, with people like Chamath Palihapitiya, Vitalik Buterin, and David Cheriton among the list of notable graduates. Many of them return to join the pool of employers, creating a network that many students have access to before they even graduate.<p>The city of Waterloo has the highest start-up density in North America, only second to the San Francisco Bay Area. With entrepreneurship accelerators and incubators like Velocity and the Accelerator Centre, early-stage startups within the Waterloo region have created over 7,500 jobs, and generated $2.3 billion in revenue in a decade.</p></li></ol><h2 id="a-little-more-on-the-benefits-of-graduating-without-debt-"><strong>A little more on the benefits of graduating without debt.</strong></h2><p>Between the lower cost of Canadian education, and the opportunity to start earning an income while still in school, very few Waterloo students end up worrying about debt.</p><p>This detail might seem like a footnote, icing on the cake of an otherwise nurturing academic environment, but it’s a nontrivial component to why Waterloo students are succeeding. They simply have the freedom to.</p><p>Starting a business, working at a former classmate’s start-up, or really, taking any entrepreneurial risk at all, is much less of a gamble when you don’t have to worry about making your student loan payments on time. Having the freedom to experiment is invaluable, especially if you also have a strong foundation of technical skills.</p><h2 id="a-self-reinforcing-cycle-"><strong>A self-reinforcing cycle.</strong></h2><div><p>Waterloo has managed to strike the perfect balance. Students are able to build complex technical skills with institutional support while still fostering an entrepreneurial spirit, both of which are essential for innovation. With alum that have gone on to found companies like PagerDuty, Instacart, and Wish Shopping, it’s clear we’re doing something right.</p><p>Maybe the question Silicon Valley is asking shouldn’t be “to stay in school or to drop out,” but instead, “How can we make schools more amenable to technical innovation?” </p></div><p>Waterloo might just have an answer. </p><hr><p>This fall, I have been working as a Product Management intern at Arctype. We are building the modern SQL client, which is faster and more intuitive than many of the clients on the market, designed with your needs in mind as a modern developer.

                    <p>Tell me if this sounds familiar? You were introduced to docker-compose either by choice or by force. You’ve been using it for a while, but you find it clunky. I’m here to tell you, you are probably using it wrong.</p><p>Ok, that might be an exaggeration. I don’t think there’s actually a 100% right or wrong way to use it: home-grown build and dev setups tend to have all kinds of weird requirements and so the standard doesn’t always match the needs. Please take the article with the appropriate skepticism if your situation doesn’t quite fit.</p><p>I, myself, have been guilty of each of these in the past and I might be in the future as well!!</p><p>In any case, here is a rundown of some of the cardinal sins that I found myself making while using docker-compose.</p><p>In this article, I’ll be focusing on use-cases related to <strong>integration testing</strong> and using docker-compose as a <strong>development environment</strong>. For production use, I think docker-compose is usually ill-suited.</p><h2 id="problem-1-you-re-using-the-host-network">Problem #1: You’re using the host network</h2><p>One of the first things new-comers find cumbersome is the use of Docker networks. It’s yet another layer of knowledge to add to your repertoire after you get used to the basics of <strong>docker build</strong> and <strong>docker run</strong>… and frankly, why do you even need to understand these Docker networks? Everything works fine via the host network, right? Wrong!</p><p>Using the host network means that you have to reserve specific ports for the various microservices that you use. If you happen to bring up two stacks that collide on ports, tough luck. If you want to bring up two versions of the same stack, tough luck. You want to test the behavior of a certain service when it has multiple replicas? Tough... luck!<br></p><p>By default, docker-compose spins up its containers on a separate network called <strong>&lt;project-name&gt;_default</strong> (where <strong>&lt;project-name&gt;</strong> is by default the name of the directory). So really, you don’t need to do anything special in order to take advantage of Docker networks.</p><p>This network gives you a number of benefits right off the bat:</p><ul><li>It’s a network more isolated from your host network - so it’s less likely that the specifics of your system environment will cause the compose setup to behave differently. You have access to the internet, but any ports that you wish to be accessible from the host need to be declared with a port bind.</li><li>If a service starts listening on 0.0.0.0 (the way containers should), then a host network setup will open up that port on your WLAN. If you use a Docker network, it’ll only expose that port to that network.</li><li>You can talk between services by using their compose names as host names. So if you have a service called <strong>db</strong> and within it there’s a service listening on port <strong>5432</strong>, then you can access it from any other service via <strong>db:5432</strong>. This is typically more intuitive than <strong>localhost:5432</strong>. And because there is no risk of localhost port clashing, it has a greater chance to be more consistent when used across different projects.</li><li>Most ports don’t need to be opened up to the host too - which means that they are not competing on global resources, should you need to increase the replication via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/"><strong>--scale</strong></a>.</li></ul><h2 id="problem-2-you-re-binding-ports-on-the-host-s-0-0-0-0">Problem #2: You’re binding ports on the host’s 0.0.0.0</h2><p>I’ve seen it everywhere, you’ve seen it everywhere, everybody saw it everywhere: binding ports as <strong>8080:8080</strong>. At first glance, this looks innocuous. But the devil is in the details. This extremely common port bind is not just forwarding a container port to the localhost - it forwards it to be accessible on every network interface on your system - including whatever you use to connect to the internet.</p><p>This means that it’s very likely that your development containers are constantly listening on your WLAN - when you’re home, when you’re in the office, or when you’re at McDonald’s. It’s always accessible. This can be dangerous. Don’t do that.</p><p>“But Vlad, I use <strong>ufw</strong>, my ports aren’t accessible by default”.</p><p>That may be true - but if you use this docker-compose setup as a team, one of your teammates might not have a firewall on their laptop.</p><p>The fix is very easy: Just add <strong>127.0.0.1:</strong> in front. So for example <strong>127.0.0.1:8080:8080</strong>. This simply tells docker to only expose the port to the loopback network interface and nothing else.</p><h2 id="problem-3-you-re-using-sleep-to-coordinate-service-startup">Problem #3: You’re using sleep to coordinate service startup</h2><p>I have a confession to make. I’m 100% guilty of this.</p><p>The main reason this is such a complicated issue is that there is no support from Docker or Docker Compose to address this. Version 2.1 of the docker-compose format used to have a <strong>depends_on</strong> option called <strong>condition</strong> which could be set to <strong>service_healthy</strong>. And also, each service could have a <strong>healthcheck</strong> command which could tell docker-compose what “healthy” means. Well, this is <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#depends_on">no longer available in Version 3.0</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47710767/what-is-the-alternative-to-condition-form-of-depends-on-in-docker-compose-versio">no replacement</a> is offered for it.</p><p>Docker’s docs basically <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/">recommend</a> that your service is made resilient to other services not being around for a while because that’s what might happen in production anyway, if there’s a short network bleep, or if a service restarts. Can’t argue with that logic.</p><p>Where it gets a bit more cumbersome is when you run an integration test and the routines meant for initializing the test environment (eg pre-populating the database with some test data) end up not being resilient to starting before the other service is ready. So the argument about “it should be resilient in production anyway” doesn’t quite apply here, because the code to populate the DB with test data is never used in production.</p><p>For such cases, you need something that waits for services to be ready. Docker recommends using <a href="https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it">wait-for-it</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize">Dockerize</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Eficode/wait-for">wait-for</a>. Note, however, that a port being ready isn’t always a sign that the service is ready to be used. For example, in an integration test using a certain SQL DB with a certain schema, the port becomes available when the DB is initialized, however, the test might only work after a certain schema migration has been applied. You may need application-specific checks on top.</p><h2 id="problem-4-you-re-running-the-db-in-docker-compose-but-the-test-on-the-host">Problem #4: You’re running the DB in docker-compose, but the test on the host</h2><p>Here is a situation: you want to run some unit tests but those tests depend on some external services. Maybe a database, maybe a Redis, maybe another API. Easy: let’s put those dependencies in a docker-compose and have the unit test connect to those.</p><p>That’s great - but note that your tests aren’t exactly just unit tests anymore. They are now integration tests. Besides the nomenclature, there is an important distinction to take into account now: you’ll need to account for a setup of the test environment and a teardown. Usually, it’s best for the setup/teardown to be performed outside of the test code - main reason being that there may be multiple distinct packages depending on these external services. But YMMV.</p><p>If you do end up separating test setup and teardown, you could go the extra mile and containerize your integration test. Hear me out!</p><p>Containerized tests mean:</p><ul><li>You are on the same Docker network, so the connectivity setup is the same you would use for running your service in compose anyway. Configuration becomes cleaner.</li><li>You may be able to reuse the code used to wait for other services to be ready in your setup/teardown.</li><li>The integration test does not depend on any other local system configuration or environment setup, such as say… your JFrog credentials, or any build dependencies. A container is isolated.</li><li>If another team needs to run your tests against an updated version of a service the tests depend on, you can just share the integration testing image - no need for them to compile or to setup a build toolchain.</li><li>If you end up with multiple separate integration test containers, you can typically run all of them at the same time in parallel.</li></ul><p>A tip for using containerized integration tests is to use a separate docker-compose definition for them. For example, if most of your services exist in <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong>, you could add <strong>docker-compose.test.yml</strong> with integration test definitions. This means that <strong>docker-compose up</strong> brings up your usual services, while <strong>docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up</strong> starts your integration tests. For a full example on how to achieve this, see this excellent <a href="https://github.com/george-e-shaw-iv/integration-tests-example">docker-compose integration testing</a> repository from Ardan Labs.</p><p>Ok, ok - calling this out as being wrong isn’t entirely fair. There are many situations where not containerizing is preferable. As a simple example, many languages have deep IDE integrations which make inserting a container between the language and the IDE pretty much impossible. There are many valid productivity reasons not to do this.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Docker Compose can be an amazing tool for local development purposes. Although it has a few gotchas, it usually brings a lot of productivity benefits to many engineering teams, especially when used in conjunction with integration tests.</p><p>If you’re looking for more flexibility in defining containerized tests than docker-compose alone can provide, take a <a href="https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/0f48f14/examples/integration-test/Earthfile#L38-L44">look</a> at <a href="https://docs.earthly.dev/guides/integration">integration test support</a> in <a href="https://earthly.dev/">Earthly</a>.</p>

<div id="post-body"><p>One question I often ask potential software engineering candidates is to pinpoint the percentage of code coverage in an ideal project. Interestingly enough, many of them jump to the sky with numbers beyond 90%. They would start preaching how well-tested code is more reliable and brings more value to all stakeholders. When I ask about the current projects they work on, the reality looks a bit more down to earth.</p><p>Want to know my answer? I'd say it's <strong>around 66.7%</strong>.</p><p>The reasons for that vary, but allow me to be blunt and say that <strong>1/3 of the code every software project is irrelevant, buggy, overly complicated, or simply sucks.</strong> It has a reason to be where it is, but chances are, one year down the road, it will become a liability. Being dogmatic about tests and covering every line will only make it more difficult to get rid of it.</p><p>See, no two lines of code are equal in value and importance. Adding a new feature to an existing application affects its capabilities only marginally. However, it takes a proportionally large amount of time to develop and integrate due to the existing complexity. The bigger the complexity, the longer it takes to introduce new functionality. By the time the feature finds itself in production, it may as well be already irrelevant.</p><blockquote>The only sure-fire way to improve code coverage (and by that keep software relevant) is to identify and remove the unnecessary code.</blockquote><p>How do you identify irrelevant code? Don't search for it. Instead, let it reveal itself to you. One dimension of software that few teams make good use of, is its history. Git is a great analysis tool. Start using it not only to prevent future problems but also, to understand where and how often certain parts of the code change over time.</p><p>Chances are, you will find pieces of code that have undergone fewer changes than the rest in long periods. Those are the pillars of your application - the 2/3s that <strong>must be well-tested</strong>.</p><p>You will also find others where changes occur more or less every week. Ask yourselves whether those are still relevant, both from a technical and business perspective. Adding tests for the sake of coverage would have the opposite effect of increasing the code quality. In a perfectly-design software project, the part that is allowed to change most often is the configuration. A simple analysis of the code change frequency would show whether that is the case. If it isn't, try separating the moving parts from the core logic. If this is not feasible either, most probably those portions of the code don't belong to the codebase anyway. Turning them into interchangeable scripts (even stored in a separate repository) is one way of tackling them in their own right.</p><p>Let's not get too much into technical details. I have already alluded to the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill">Adam Tornhill</a> on code analysis in a previous post of mine:</p><figure><a href="https://preslav.me/2020/03/01/use-the-git-history/"><div><p>Use the Git History to Identify Pain Points in Any Project</p><p>Have you heard of Adam Tornhill [https://twitter.com/AdamTornhill]’s work?

<p>Universal basic income (UBI) is an odd duck. Proponents range from futurists to libertarians to social democrats. Why this weird range of people?</p>

<p>There are different versions of UBI, with different motivations. People don’t get how <em>contradictory</em> these are. Libertarians and social democrats might both support a fuzzy idea of “UBI” but they’d never agree on specifics.</p>

<p>I don’t think it matters though. I’m deeply skeptical of these <em>interesting</em> versions of UBI. The only realistic option is another, <em>boring</em> version. Why isn’t it discussed more? The more you think about it, the more of a riddle that is.</p>



<p>A libertarian argument for Universal Basic Income might go something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The government is stupid and inefficient. There’s medicare, medicaid, social security, food stamps, “other food stamps” (WIC), welfare, “other welfare” (SSI), and unemployment benefits, each with a bureaucracy. Did you know that each item in a supermarket has been classified as buyable with food stamps or not? (<a href="https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/Are-energy-drinks-eligible-for-purchase-with-Supplemental-Nutrition-Assistance-Program-benefits">Energy drinks are usually OK</a>, <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/facts">toothpaste is not</a>.) And there’s a <em>different</em> classification for the “other” food stamps? (No <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/wic-food-packages-regulatory-requirements-wic-eligible-foods">spices or drinkable yogurt</a>.) And that if you lose your job you need to provide evidence each month that you spent 80 hours looking for a new one? These expensive programs are often miserable for the people they’re supposed to help. Let’s stop micromanaging people’s lives, cut the fat, and <strong>just give people money</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see the appeal, and if you want to reorganize cash transfers like social security and call them “UBI”, that’s fine with me! But it’s very unlikely UBI can replace medicaid.</p>

<p>To see why, consider schools. Sometimes the government runs them. Sometimes the government merely pays for privately run “charter” schools. Sometimes the government pays for “vouchers” that subsidize a fraction of expensive private school.</p>

<p>Why do things this way? Why not give parents (or kids!?) the money and let them spend it however they want?</p>

<p>The answer is obvious, even if we don’t usually say it explicitly: We don’t trust people and we want to control them. Educating kids is an investment that benefits everyone in the future. If we just gave parents cash, I’m sure many would arrange for a better education than the government does now. But I’m also sure many would spend it on wacky religions schools, or crystal healing seminars, or beer.</p>

<p>To be clear, no real UBI proposals would change funding for schools! But that’s kind of the point. That this is <em>so obviously</em> a bad idea shows two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It’s sometimes valid to constrain how money is used. We can’t “just give people money” without looking at the details. The question is <em>how much</em> to control to assert in each case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Control isn’t free. Some kids might do better in larger classes with higher-paid teachers. Some might prefer individual tutoring and peer instruction. Some might learn to read at home but need more instruction on math. If parents had flexibility, they could probably use the money more effectively. Restrictions to prevent worst-case outcomes also prevent these gains.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Again, schools are just a hypothetical. What’s not hypothetical is <em>healthcare</em>. For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-guaranteed-income-for-every-american-1464969586">Charles Murray</a> suggests rolling all government entitlements and healthcare expenditures together into a grant of $12,000, with no tax increase.</p>

<p>This would never work. Say we stop subsidizing healthcare and just give people money. No matter what you do, some won’t save and won’t buy health insurance. (If you doubt this, you’ve met a different species than I have.) Then, you have this difficult question: When one of these people gets sick and shows up at a hospital, do you let them die?</p>

<p>Intellectually, this is a question I take seriously. Think about it like this: Suppose you can choose to be born into Safeland where everyone is secure but bored, or Dangerland where people have fun but risk getting killed. It’s totally reasonable for someone to choose Dangerland. A tough-love “buy insurance or risk death” policy allows people to optimize for their own <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/10/19/its-hard-to-use-utility-maximization-to-justify-creating-new-sentient-beings/">utility function</a>.</p>

<p><em>Practically</em>, though, there is no question. Society has decided: It’s not acceptable to let people die, and we need some kind of emergency backstop program. But now we’ve gotten back into the healthcare subsidy business. We’ve also abandoned <em>just giving people money</em>, since any funding for the backstop could have been an unrestricted grant.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, Murray suggests that $3000 of the $12,000 must be spent on health insurance. This is a compromise on the dream of <em>just giving people money</em>. It also reduces, but doesn’t eliminate the underlying problem. What if people need a treatment that wasn’t included in their insurance? Do you have “death panels” to decide what “essential” procedures need to be included? What happens if these can’t be offered for $3000? (The average person in the US uses <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet">$11,000</a> worth of healthcare.)</p>

<p>If you want to do UBI, it mostly has to come <em>on top</em> of targeted programs. That’s <em>increasing</em> the scope of government, not decreasing it. That might be a good idea, but it’s <em>not</em> the libertarian dream. If that’s what you want, you need a different argument.</p>



<p>Here’s a different argument for basic income.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Artificial intelligence is coming, and jobs going extinct. Without action, soon all income will go to the wealthy or to the rare people who work on robots/AIs. But jobs getting automated should be good news! There will be plenty of money. In a sane world, when an AI replaces a truck driver, we’d keep paying them without asking them to come to work. For all of history, people have spent their lives mostly scrambling to survive. It’s time for us to be liberated, to spend our time on art, science, politics, whatever. Let the human spirit soar.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have three responses to this.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, there isn’t plenty of money, yet. Giving 256 million adults the average truck driver salary of $67 thousand per year would cost $17 trillion. For reference, that’s 4 times the entire <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-04/56324-CBO-2019-budget-infographic.pdf">current federal budget</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/skeptical_ubi/budget_small.png" alt="budget"></p>

<p>It’s almost as large as the entire <em>economy</em> ($21 trillion). Giving everyone $12k per year would cost $3 trillion. That’s more than all benefit programs combined, but not impossible. Suppose we make some difficult cuts, add some new taxes and make it happen. Do we expect anyone who previously had a good job to be content with $12 thousand? I’m sure it’s <em>helpful</em>, but it’s no <em>substitute</em> for a job.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, this isn’t how economic revolutions worked in the past. Everyone knows the story: We moved from farms to manufacturing and services as each sector got automated. Keynes famously predicted 90 years ago that we would soon only need to work 15 hours a week. Why didn’t that happen? He was right that existing jobs would mostly disappear. What he missed was that we’d invent so much new stuff and then decide we couldn’t live without it. Are we <em>really sure</em> this time is different? A counter-response from a UBI fan would be that “every trend continues until it stops”. Previously, there were obvious productive things for people to shift their effort to. Now, that’s not clear. My counter counter-reply is: Are you <em>sure</em>?</p>

<p>Both of these responses boil down to “your argument for UBI is premised on some future that’s not here yet”. If 30 years from now the economy is 50x bigger and all the jobs are gone, these responses are moot.</p>

<p>A <strong>third</strong> response is that this argument for UBI assumes jobs are all about money. Joe and Jill Biden are worth around $10 million. So why is Jill Biden teaching English at Northern Virginia Community College? People get much of their identity and meaning in life from their jobs. We are sort of like border collies: Without a role to play, we go crazy. Most people don’t want a handout, they want to feel that they’ve <em>earned</em> what they have.</p>

<p>To be sure, <em>some</em> people, if their current job was replaced with a UBI, would devote themselves to other passions. (Can anyone doubt that a million rationalist-adjacent blogs would bloom?) But others would get bored and depressed. Don’t believe me? Check out fire Financial Independence / Early Retirement (FIRE) forums. There are tons of people who worked hard, saved money, and retired young. They find that relaxation and “fun” get old quickly. Some people occupy themselves volunteer work or creative projects. For others this doesn’t work and they spiral into depression until they eventually decide to take another job.</p>

<p>Maybe society shouldn’t be like this. I don’t really <em>like</em> this connection between work and value. Maybe social norms just need to adjust. Maybe FIRE folks would love retirement if their friends were also free to hang out in the middle of the day. Perhaps, but I think we also need to prepare for the possibility that this doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Here, a UBI proponent might object. “Well, look! Suppose this jobless world comes as predicted. What then? At least I’m proposing a solution! All you’re doing is claiming the solution won’t work. What would you actually suggest we do? Keeping the current world is not an option.”</p>

<p>I agree. We don’t have a stop button to stop the world shifting under our feet. If jobs really do go obsolete, we’ll have to figure something out. I’d support experimenting with UBI. But I’d suggest we <em>also</em> experimenting with how to make jobs stick around. It’s easy to open a building downtown with a “fake jobs for insecure people” sign, but this probably wouldn’t work. We’d probably need to really believe our jobs are valuable.</p>

<p>(As an aside: How to create jobs that look useful? In a future where AI is so powerful that normal human jobs are gone, shouldn’t we be worried about AI risk? Can we create bottlenecks in processes that have to be filled by humans? How to do this in a way that <em>actually</em> reduces AI risk is a hard problem. For our purposes, all that matters is it seems plausible.)</p>

<p><em>Is</em> the world changing under our feet, though? <em>Are</em> jobs …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div>

If this work is meaningful to you, I invite you to become a subscriber today</em>.</p><p>Last week, a prominent a co-leader of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence team at Google sent an email to her colleagues. Timnit Gebru had been working on a research paper that she hoped to publish, but ran into resistance from her superiors at Google. And so she sent a letter expressing her frustration to the internal listserv Google Brain Women and Allies. </p><p>A few days later, Gebru was fired —&nbsp;Google reportedly found the email “inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.” It details the struggles Gebru experienced as a Black leader working on ethics research within the company, and presents a bleak view of the path forward for underrepresented minorities at the company. </p><p>Gebru is well known and respected in the AI ethics community; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/google-s-co-head-of-ethical-ai-says-she-was-fired-over-email?sref=ExbtjcSG">here are Shelly Banjo  and Mark Bergen on her background at Bloomberg</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Gebru, an alumni of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, is one of the leading voices in the ethical use of artificial intelligence. She is well-known for her work on a&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212" title="MIT">landmark study</a>&nbsp;in 2018 that showed how facial recognition software misidentified dark-skinned women as much as 35% of the time, whereas the technology worked with near precision on white men.</p><p>She has also been an outspoken critic of the lack of diversity and unequal treatment of Black workers at tech companies, particularly at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US" title="Company Overview">Alphabet Inc.</a>’s Google, and said she believed her dismissal was meant to send a message to the rest of Google’s employees not to speak up.</p></blockquote><p>Platformer received the email Gebru sent; she herself did not have access to her account after Google terminated her. It is published in full below. </p><p>Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But on Thursday morning, Jeff Dean, the head of Google research, emailed employees with his account of what happened. Dean said Gebru had issued ultimatum and would resign unless certain conditions were met. <strong>Platformer</strong> obtained Dean’s email as well; you can find it below Gebru’s. </p><blockquote><p>Hi friends,</p><p>I had stopped writing here as you may know, after all the micro and macro aggressions and harassments I received after posting my stories here (and then of course it started being moderated).</p><p>Recently however, I was contributing to a document that Katherine and Daphne were writing where they were dismayed by the fact that after all this talk, this org seems to have hired 14% or so women this year. Samy has hired 39% from what I understand but he has zero incentive to do this.</p><p>What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.</p><p>Have you ever heard of someone getting “feedback” on a paper through a privileged and confidential document to HR? Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?</p><p>Imagine this: You’ve sent a paper for feedback to 30+ researchers, you’re awaiting feedback from PR &amp; Policy who you gave a heads up before you even wrote the work saying “we’re thinking of doing this”, working on a revision plan figuring out how to address different feedback from people, haven’t heard from PR &amp; Policy besides them asking you for updates (in 2 months). A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar (this popped up at around 2pm). No one would tell you what the meeting was about in advance. Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you “it has been decided” that you need to retract this paper by next week, Nov. 27, the week when almost everyone would be out (and a date which has nothing to do with the conference process). You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.</p><p>Then, you ask for more information. What specific feedback exists? Who is it coming from? Why now? Why not before? Can you go back and forth with anyone? Can you understand what exactly is problematic and what can be changed?</p><p>And you are told after a while, that your manager can read you a privileged and confidential document and you’re not supposed to even know who contributed to this document, who wrote this feedback, what process was followed or anything. You write a detailed document discussing whatever pieces of feedback you can find, asking for questions and clarifications, and it is completely ignored. And you’re met with, once again, an order to retract the paper with no engagement whatsoever.</p><p>Then you try to engage in a conversation about how this is not acceptable and people start doing the opposite of any sort of self reflection—trying to find scapegoats to blame.</p><p>Silencing marginalized voices like this is the opposite of the NAUWU principles which we discussed. And doing this in the context of “responsible AI” adds so much salt to the wounds. I understand that the only things that mean anything at Google are levels, I’ve seen how my expertise has been completely dismissed. But now there’s an additional layer saying any privileged person can decide that they don’t want your paper out with zero conversation. So you’re blocked from adding your voice to the  research community—your work which you do on top of the other marginalization you face here. </p><p>I’m always amazed at how people can continue to do thing after thing like this and then turn around and ask me for some sort of extra DEI work or input. This happened to me last year. I was in the middle of a potential lawsuit for which Kat Herller and I hired feminist lawyers who threatened to sue Google (which is when they backed off--before that Google lawyers were prepared to throw us under the bus and our leaders were following as instructed) and the next day I get some random “impact award.” Pure gaslighting.</p><p>So if you would like to change things, I suggest focusing on leadership accountability and thinking through what types of pressures can also be applied from the outside. For instance, I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus is the entity that started forcing tech companies to report their diversity numbers. Writing more documents and saying things over and over again will tire you out but no one will listen.</p><p>Timnit </p></blockquote><p>And here is the email that Jeff Dean sent out to Googlers on Thursday morning.</p><blockquote><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I’m sure many of you have seen that Timnit Gebru is no longer working at Google. This is a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.</p><p>Because there’s been a lot of speculation and misunderstanding on social media, I wanted to share more context about how this came to pass, and assure you we’re here to support you as you continue the research you’re all engaged in.</p><p>Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers). We’ve approved dozens of papers that Timnit and/or the other Googlers have authored and then published, but as you know, papers often require changes during the internal review process (or are even deemed unsuitable for submission). Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted.</p><p>A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why. It ignored too much relevant research — for example, it talked about the environmental impact of large models, but disregarded subsequent research showing much greater efficiencies.&nbsp; Similarly, it raised concerns about bias in language models, but didn’t take into account recent research to mitigate these issues. We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Timnit responded with an email requiring that a number of conditions be met in order for her to continue working at Google, including revealing the identities of every person who Megan and I had spoken to and consulted as part of the review of the paper and the exact feedback. Timnit wrote that if we didn’t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.</p><p>Given Timnit's role as a respected researcher and a manager in our Ethical AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has gotten to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re doing. I also feel badly that hundreds of you received an email just this week from Timnit telling you to stop work on critical …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re moving data in and out of Kafka, chances are you’re using Apache Kafka Connect. The strength of the Kafka community means we have a large catalog of available connectors for hundreds of different technologies, helping to accelerate the integration of Kafka with 3rd party systems. </p><h2>Adoption challenges </h2><p>As we often see in the world of open source, Kafka’s wide adoption across the community doesn’t make the technology easier to manage. In fact, it would be fair to say there are a number of challenges and design faults that we need to live to accept for the time being. </p><p>Probably the biggest challenge here is to put good governance measures in place for Kafka Connect, which does two things: </p><ol><li><p> <!-- -->Provides healthy &amp; productive data operations for a faster time-to-integrate</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Helps you meet IT and data compliance requirements to meet audits and get your projects into production. </p></li></ol><p>The good news is you can work around many of these challenges and provide Kafka as a Service within your organization using DataOps practices. Here we break down some of the biggest areas of compliance you may need to meet these best practices including:</p><ul><li><p> <!-- -->Confidentiality</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Availability</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Authorization</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Authentication</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Isolation &amp; multi-tenancy</p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Audit Reporting </p></li><li><p> <!-- -->Real-time monitoring</p></li></ul><p>Let’s have a look.</p><h2>Connector isolation for availability</h2><p>Applying good governance to Kafka Connect will require running connectors and pipelines across isolated clusters.&nbsp; This is both to protect availability of data and confidentiality.&nbsp; </p><p>Whilst deploying one connector, you risk others within the cluster restarting and triggering a rebalance, temporarily interrupting the service. This may be particularly painful whilst collecting data from a source with no guaranteed delivery (such as a UDP port).</p><p>Certain types of connectors may also consume heavy disk/memory or compute resources. Here we run the risk of impacting the performance or availability of other connectors housed on the cluster. </p><p>Of course your security policies may also dictate the isolation of connectors across different clusters. So a best practice would be to run them in complete isolation.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/41BWiqu1yM2U0KdBjSThR6/5f1955406b021ee9ba7f65758c4bfd20/lenses.io_kafka_connect_connector_isolation__1_.png" alt="lenses.io Apach kafka connect connector isolation "></p><h2>ACL Management for authorization</h2><p>ACL policies allow you to authorize principles (in the form of clients) to Kafka resources, including topics. They're an absolute must.</p><p>The question is how can ACLs themselves be managed and who should have the ability to operate them?</p><p>Here there is a significant gap in native Kafka.</p><p>If you're not already using something like Ranger to manage your ACLs, they can be operated and through Lenses and secured with RBAC and auditing.</p><h2>Assigning privileges with RBAC</h2><p>Service disruption can occur through a malicious or hapless user action.&nbsp; A user could interrupt a flow by compromising one connector, or leak data by deploying another connector.&nbsp; </p><p>Privileges to operate connectors should be assigned, not assumed. Kafka Connect doesn’t provide any role-based security or auditing. </p><p>You could control what connectors are deployed as part of your CI/CD workflows, but this isn’t always the best way of managing connectors since users require constant feedback loops and error handling when deploying them. </p><p>At Lenses we’ve built a security model over Kafka Connect. It’s the same model that provides data access to relevant users.</p><p>At its most basic, you can assign permissions to operate Kafka Connect.</p><p>Then, based on topic namespaces users may be entitled to perform certain actions on a topic level. The available operations extend beyond data access and assign the ability to manage connectors with the topic as the source or sink. </p><p>For example, if you are assigned to the *metrics* namespace only you can only view, create and operate connectors that source or sink on these topics.</p><p>If you were try creating a new connector consuming from <i>crm_customers</i>, the Lenses security model would identify that you are not entitled to that topic and prevent the connector from being deployed. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/6q7ldslrB4Cre91aPzHC5i/3c16c68c63a56b082551cb58fc2b005d/security_namespace_RBAC_kafka_connect__1_.png" alt="security namespace RBAC Apache kafka connect "></p><h2>Authentication with SSO</h2><p>Good management of identities is a security 101. </p><p>This ensures strong use (and rotation) of passwords, two-factor authentication and provides security teams with a centralized real-time monitoring of authentication event logs. </p><p>Chances are your organization has standardized on an Access Management &amp; SSO solution and requires all business applications to integrate with it.</p><p>For Lenses, the same RBAC model mentioned above can authenticate users through your SSO provider including support for Azure, OneLogin, Okta and Keycloak. </p><p>Access audits are logged and can be integrated with your real-time security investigation &amp; user behavior monitoring tools such as Splunk. </p><h2>Multi-Tenant management</h2><p>
If you’re managing multiple Connect clusters, there will be times when you should assign privileges to the clusters, not just the connectors or Kafka resources they access. </p><p>Let's say you can deploy the Elasticsearch connector for topics dev* but only on certain dev* clusters (as opposed to in production).</p><p>Neither Kafka Connect nor open source tooling support managing privileges across different Kafka Connect clusters.</p><p>With Lenses, we’ve recently extended the security model and introduced Kafka Connect namespaces. In the same framework that manages access to data and connectors now comes the ability to define how they are accessed, and what or who accesses them.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/5wo9H1TswETcsItVZybv4J/5cdbd832eefc04c739e7ce6d6742fb63/application_permissions_for_kafka_connect.png" alt="application permissions for kafka connect"></p><h2>Secret Management</h2><p>Avoiding secrets being exposed in code &amp; configuration can be especially tricky, and unless you use a Secret Provider plugin it will expose sensitive configurations via Kafka Connect's APIs.</p><p>Lenses allows you to delegate lookup of secrets, at runtime, to external secret providers such as Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager and <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/05/securing-kafka-connect-azure-keyvault/">Azure KeyVault</a> using a plugin. These are open source, Apache 2.0 licensed. Lenses can also act as a secret provider to reduce your tech stack further.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4aZgjhbqIrHpFoOI8ce2F/6122889cc32f97e29f820ee3c522ace5/kafka_connect_connector_configuration.png" alt="kafka connect connector configuration"></p><h2>Confidentiality through Data Masking</h2><p>
Encrypting and anonymizing data streams is a common and complex challenge with Kafka and often businesses need to re-architect their applications to accommodate for this.&nbsp; </p><p>There are plenty of arguments for encrypting or hashing data in transit or at source, but this may be a compliance requirement you need to fulfil in any case. </p><p>There are also times when data does not need to be encrypted or anonymized on the wire but certain fields should be masked for non-privileged users (such as IT Operators, developers etc.) This is particularly true for investigation or exploration of data.</p><p><a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/data-dump-real-time-data-catalog-apache-kafka/">Data Policies</a> allow fields across datasets to be masked based on defined rules. This does so without affecting the integrity of the data streams.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/7G4vuR8IiuQSOi1482KsCV/4b8424332d34f7dd3b65df73fc77c0d6/data_masking__1_.png" alt="Lenses.io - Data masking for Apache Kafka"></p><h2>Audit Reporting</h2><p>
Whatever controls are put in place, you should still expect and anticipate audit reports. You may be asked to report on which teams and users are processing certain datasets for example. Data catalogs provide a great way of discovering datasets that exist across an environment.</p><p>If using Lenses, the Data Catalog intelligently discovers metadata in real-time generated by your applications, making those audits much faster.</p><p>The combination of data masking and <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/life-of-pii-data-masking-and-compliance-for-apache-kafka/">Data Policies</a> also chip in to help during audits. The same rules that mask data can also detect and list those applications processing the relevant data. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3XVj5KeEz1NMrnqCOs3YWB/c2b465288b69a848515ec0eaeb0caa08/detected_flows_kafka_connect.png" alt="detected flows kafka connect"></p><p>Not forgetting a <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/08/introducing-kafka-app-catalog/">Topology view</a> which helps to address data lineage and data provenance questions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Real-time security &amp; user behavior monitoring</h2><p>
Getting production sign-off for critical projects may require having real-time security monitoring in place. </p><p>You can expect security operations teams to request audit logs for user behavior monitoring which can detect abnormal activity and insider threats. </p><p>OS level audit logs from your Kafka Connect infrastructure are a big requirement to cover and there are plenty of well-documented security logging solutions for this.</p><p>For application-level audits of Kafka Connect, however, things can prove more difficult.</p><p>With Lenses, we've made sure data operations leave an audit trail. Actions such as restarting a connector or changing configuration. </p><p>Audits can then be fired off into a SIEM or User Behavior solution with native integration into Splunk, or by using a webhook for other solutions. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/6GtVA7QJZdcGGug7ZprCPT/f5bcfb6734d2ed1d3fed0d94e1913a03/connectors_audit_log__1_.png" alt="audit logs for Apache kafka connect connectors"></p><h2>Next steps</h2><p>Many think of governance for Kafka Connect too late. 
</p><p>Getting on the front foot will put you in the good books with security and compliance. It will also avoid an audit that puts you in the eye of a massive storm.

Explore deploying connectors through Lenses in an all-in-one Kafka &amp; Kafka Connect environment available as a <a href="https://lenses.io/box/">Docker Container</a> or as a <a href="https://portal.lenses.io/register?version=demo">Cloud sandbox</a>.

      <div>
        <p>In this post we'll stumble toward a working emulator for a barebones C
program compiled for linux/AMD64. The approach will be slightly more
so based on observation than by following a spec; a great way
to quickly become familiar with a topic, and a bad way to guarantee
correctness.</p>
<p>The goal:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat tests/simple.c
int main() {
  return 4;
}
$ gcc tests/simple.c
$ go build -o main
$ ./main a.out &amp;&amp; echo $?
4
</code></pre>
<p>This may look ridiculously simple but when you don't know how to deal
with a binary or how instructions are encoded, it will take a few
hours to write an emulator that can generally handle this program!</p>
<p>Code for this project is <a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/go-amd64-emulator">available on Github</a>.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>AMD64, x86_64 or x64 are different names for AMD's widely adopted
64-bit extension to Intel's x86 instruction set (i.e. the encoding and
semantics of x86 binaries). AMD64 is a superset of x86 (introducing
64-bit registers and operations) and thus backwards compatible with
x86 programs.</p>
<p>
  A year and a half ago I first got into emulation with
  an <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/emulator-basics-a-stack-and-register-machine.html">AMD64
  emulator in JavaScript</a>. The JavaScript emulator interpreted the
  textual representation of AMD64 programs (e.g. <code>MOV RBP,
  RSP</code>, Intel's assembly syntax). A C program had to be compiled
  with <code>-S</code> to produce an assembly file that the JavaScript
  emulator could read (i.e. <code>gcc -S tests/simple.c</code>) This
  was a great way to get started with emulation by ignoring the
  complexity of encoded instructions and executable formats.
</p><p>If we dig into the binary file produced by gcc on Linux we learn that
it is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF
file</a>.</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc test/simple.c
$ file a.out

</code></pre>
<p>ELF is responsible for surrounding the actual binary-encoded program
instructions with metadata on exported and imported C identifiers and
program entrypoint. But for simple programs like this initial
emulator, we can ignore export/imports. We'll only use the ELF
metadata to find out where the instructions for our <code>main</code>
function start.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-main?">Where is main?</h3><p>If we use an ELF reader+disassembler on the binary generated by gcc
and search for <code>main</code> we can find its address.</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -d a.out | grep -A10 '&lt;main&gt;'
0000000000401106 &lt;main&gt;:

<p>This means that the function, <code>main</code>, starts at
address <code>0x401106</code> in memory. Furthermore, this implies
that the binary must be loaded into CPU memory such that the CPU can
jump here to execute our program.</p>
<p>In truth, <code>main</code> is not this program's entrypoint. If we
run <code>objdump -x a.out</code> we can see that the ELF entrypoint
is <code>0x401020</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -x a.out

<p>This is because the actual entrypoint gcc sets up is a function called
<code>_start</code>. The libc prelude beginning
with <code>_start</code> is responsible for initializing the libc
runtime, calling our <code>main</code> function and executing the exit
syscall with the return value of <code>main</code>.</p>
<pre><code>objdump -d a.out | grep -A10 '&lt;_start&gt;'
0000000000401020 &lt;_start&gt;:

</code></pre>
<p>But because all this libc initialization is relatively complicated
we're just going to skip the actual ELF entrypoint for now. Our
emulator will locate <code>main</code>, load the binary into memory,
jump to the start of <code>main</code>, and set the exit code of the
emulator to the result of main.</p>
<p>
  As you can see, this ELF binary has its own hard-coded view of where
  it will be in memory. What if our CPU were to run multiple process
  at once? We might give each process its own virtual memory space
  and map back to a real memory space so each process (and by
  extension, compilers) doesn't have to think about how they fit into
  memory relative to other processes.
</p><p>The last question to figure out is where to load the ELF binary into
emulator memory so that addresses in memory are where the program
expects.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there is a piece of metadata called section
headers that contain an address and a offset from the start of the ELF
file. By subtracting this we can get the location the file expects to
be in memory.</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -x a.out
a.out:     file format elf64-x86-64
a.out
architecture: i386:x86-64, flags 0x00000112:
EXEC_P, HAS_SYMS, D_PAGED
start address 0x0000000000401020

Program Header:
    PHDR off    0x0000000000000040 vaddr 0x0000000000400040 paddr 0x0000000000400040 align 2**3
             filesz 0x00000000000002d8 memsz 0x00000000000002d8 flags r--
</code></pre>
<p>That is: <code>0x400040 (vaddr) - 0x40 (off) = 0x400000</code>.
Judging from a Google search this seems to be a pretty common address
where ELF binaries are loaded into memory.</p>
<h3 id="elf-and-go">ELF and Go</h3><p>Binary file formats tend to be a pain to work with because, to enable
greater compression, everything ends up being a pointer to something
else. So you end up jumping all around the file just to stitch
information back together.</p>
<p>So the one third-party-ish library we'll use is Go's builtin
<code>debug/elf</code> package. With this library we can load an ELF
binary and iterate over symbols and sections to discover the location
of <code>main</code> and the start address for the binary in memory.</p>
<p>Editing in <code>main.go</code>:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
    "bytes"
    "debug/elf"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
    "os"
)

type process struct {
    startAddress uint64
    entryPoint   uint64
    bin          []byte
}

func readELF(filename, entrySymbol string) (*process, error) {
    bin, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    elffile, err := elf.NewFile(bytes.NewReader(bin))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    symbols, err := elffile.Symbols()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    var entryPoint uint64
    for _, sym := range symbols {
        if sym.Name == entrySymbol &amp;&amp; elf.STT_FUNC == elf.ST_TYPE(sym.Info) &amp;&amp; elf.STB_GLOBAL == elf.ST_BIND(sym.Info) {
            entryPoint = sym.Value
        }
    }

    if entryPoint == 0 {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Could not find entrypoint symbol: %s", entrySymbol)
    }

    var startAddress uint64
    for _, sec := range elffile.Sections {
        if sec.Type != elf.SHT_NULL {
            startAddress = sec.Addr - sec.Offset
            break
        }
    }

    if startAddress == 0 {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Could not determine start address")
    }

    return &amp;process{
        startAddress: startAddress,
        entryPoint:   entryPoint,
        bin:          bin,
    }, nil
}

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) &lt; 2 {
        log.Fatal("Binary not provided")
    }

    proc, err := readELF(os.Args[1], "main")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Start: 0x%x\nEntry: 0x%x\n", proc.startAddress, proc.entryPoint)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can test on a basic compiled C program:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat tests/simple.c
int main() {
  return 4;
}
$ gcc tests/simple.c
$ go build -o main
$ ./main a.out
Start: 0x400000
Entry: 0x401106
</code></pre>
<p>And verify against <code>objdump</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ objdump -d a.out | grep -A10 '&lt;main&gt;'
0000000000401106 &lt;main&gt;:
  401106:       55                      push   %rbp'&gt;'
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it for dealing with ELF. Now we can sketch out a virtual
CPU and how we deal with interpreting instructions starting at this
address.</p>
<h3 id="the-cpu">The CPU</h3><p>AMD64 counts on being able to store values in registers and memory,
sometimes through direct addressing and sometimes indirectly using
stack operations (push and pop). And userland processes count on being
loaded into CPU memory so the CPU can jump to the process entrypoint
and process.</p>
<pre><code>type cpu struct {
    proc    *process
    mem     []byte
    regfile *registerFile
    tick    chan bool
}

func newCPU(memory uint64) cpu {
    return cpu{
        mem:     make([]byte, memory),
        regfile: &amp;registerFile{},
        tick:    make(chan bool, 1),
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>tick</code> channel is so that later on we can wrap the
emulator in a terminal debugger. But by default we'll just set up a
goroutine to tick forever.</p>
<pre><code>func repl(c *cpu) {
  // TODO
}

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) &lt; 2 {
        log.Fatal("Binary not provided")
    }

    proc, err := readELF(os.Args[1], "main")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    debug := false
    for _, arg := range os.Args[1:] {
        switch arg {
        case "--debug":
            fallthrough
        case "-d":
            debug = true
        }
    }

    // 10 MB
    cpu := newCPU(0x400000 * 10)

    go cpu.run(proc)
    if debug {
        repl(&amp;cpu)
    } else {
        for {
            cpu.tick &lt;- true
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="registers">Registers</h3><p>To emulate a simple program like our <code>tests/simple.c</code>,
we'll only need to support a few common registers. The order is
important so that we can use the Go identifiers when we want to refer
to the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64_Instruction_Encoding#Registers">encoded integer value of the
register</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, someone asked us how you know you’re ready to succeed in a Facebook/Amazon/Apple/Netflix/Google (FAANG) interview.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="359" height="180" src="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c.png 359w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-300x150.png 300w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-200x100.png 200w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-30-faang-question-c-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px"></figure>



<p>It’s an interesting question, and one I’m sure many of you job seekers out there are wondering.</p>



<p>Internally, we have our own beliefs, but we wanted to see if we could answer this question more objectively. So we set off on a journey to acquire data to try answering it.</p>



<span>Methodology</span>



<p>interviewing.io helps prospective job candidates practice mock interviews with actual interviewers from the major tech companies like the aforementioned FAANG companies, as well as others like Dropbox, Uber, LinkedIn, and Slack. </p>



<p>After each mock interview, candidates are measured on a 1-4 scale against three criteria (technical ability, problem solving, and communication) and are also given an overall hire/no hire rating.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="699" height="618" src="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30.png 699w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-200x177.png 200w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-300x265.png 300w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-680x601.png 680w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-400x354.png 400w, https://blog.interviewing.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screenshot-2017-11-29-09.13.30-50x44.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"><figcaption>Feedback form filled out by interviewers after an interviewing.io mock interview</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our analysis, we used these scores to estimate a candidate’s overall skill level, which we would expect to be positively associated with “readiness”.</p>



<p>Additionally, we needed to know whether a job candidate’s skill level and preparation ultimately resulted in the candidate getting the job. Since most real world interviews happen outside of interviewing.io, we surveyed our users to learn how far through the hiring funnel they progressed at three popular tech companies: Google, Facebook, and Amazon. For each of these companies, at least 150 respondents reported participating in the company’s hiring processes. These were the hiring stages we asked for in the survey:</p>



<ul><li>Applied</li><li>Recruiter call</li><li>Technical phone interview</li><li>Take-home assignment</li><li>Onsite</li><li>Offer</li><li>Hire</li></ul>



<p>We also needed to consider variables that could affect a person’s chance of progressing through the hiring funnel, but weren’t necessarily related to “readiness”. In addition to the mock interview feedback ratings mentioned above, we grabbed the following data about users that we collect at interviewing.io:</p>



<ul><li>How many mock interviews completed on interviewing.io</li><li>Self-reported career experience level (e.g. junior, intermediate, experienced)</li></ul>



<p>Finally, we asked survey respondents to share data that our platform doesn’t collect but could be associated with a higher chance of landing a job. Here were those other attributes:</p>



<ul><li>Gender</li><li>Possessed a computer science degree?</li><li>How many real tech interviews they’ve attended as interviewee (excludes mock interviews)</li><li>How the person learned to code</li><li>How long ago did they last go through a job search</li></ul>







<span>Relationship of respondents’ technical scores to interview success</span>



<p>Intuitively, you would think that better technical ability would be associated with a higher chance of succeeding at interviews. To see if this intuition holds true, let’s look at the frequency of people passing a phone interview, bucketed by a person’s average technical rating on interviewing.io, and see if a positive correlation exists.</p>



<p>Based on 158 respondents who reported to have progressed at least as far as Google’s phone interview phase, we observed a positive-looking relationship, but maybe not as obvious a relationship as one might expect.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0Yx8qkjGSgv0uyzS1qHTKXEiqFYHhl2mjkqqrdgFdGltXAKMuIHQ1yVVEQNg6Lof8fT9eETUhG2s71ixmGfwtBCfLr9hn8T6mUsBfKWZfnLCoYpMZoYC6ZIDFAT7m_Zot4_cA6Y" alt=""></figure>



<p>Looking at respondents who went through the Facebook and Amazon hiring processes, the relationship seemed even less obvious:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CHx1zzmQtTUY9TfE0Y5gZpwK_atcjgFGNDkyb_lWkFycAAIkkNQP-rGh4bgOiSzurtStX8HWrH61BBuWWkJh53R06oCgnM2VV5PeaRpLGZNXDl23WkZHbQTPsInHZ1cu8-sz1sQ" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zIUpkgse1iOZmmSCUsxNZgWeAC124-d0sZlmFkl6Mkj4XiAOd_vFU_1GxA-34e-Td8VDD8MRpY0PE6bxb9bZvBl2pi74NXk4yNGzO7Mzg4jkm_75hMNheduI5G-KIwYWbGutGVk" alt=""></figure>



<p>While it would be simple to conclude there exists no relationship between technical ability and passing a phone interview, it seems more likely that we were experiencing selection bias. After all, 60-80% of people progressing past Google/Amazon/Facebook phone screens seems a bit high relative to what one might expect.</p>



<p>Compared to the population of all people on interviewing.io, survey respondents with high average technical scores between 3 and 4 were over-represented relative to those who scored between 1.5 and 2.75<sup><a id="footnote1" href="#footnote1-details">[1]</a></sup>. Maybe non-respondents with lower scores and who failed Google/Facebook/Amazon phone interviews happened to be less likely to respond to our survey.</p>



<p>So that’s pretty limiting. But let’s keep in mind that all models are wrong, yet some are useful, so perhaps it’s still possible to learn other stuff from the data. If the survey respondents’ technical abilities weren’t obviously associated with interview success, what about other factors?</p>



<span>More experience with real technical interviews is associated with future interview success</span>



<p>When digging further, the factor that stood out most was how many real technical interviews the candidate had done in the past. Across all three companies, people who had completed 5 or more real technical interviews tended to have higher rates of passing a phone interview than those who had less real interview experience.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y2MlAXnOdEb_5evno08aQnxD9i7mHv2-e2jjwg0PjdSE4TC-EuAgcy17b6_gPYjxHgz0aimKPq-TNcC6gdY6mgO_BCTC9dHS7O5BvQCrFlE-WhAVgeQumMaJnEV15xNNq9yCsY0" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dypDixrmeIx3LUZqjB-GuD0L91iSxOJgtEdp2ENhMZ53_UiHRKSZZ9d_vEX4KQC_4JEu7dxqT_gRMDM_rP5hcRj-a08GMaEqvXhWNGCthd7Jvf9159kNQIEt7vLFaWXsRqw-9ww" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/95fYSFE27TziZN1JrBDinxQMPiwt8Ny58_IuHvL52e00Z7kRF-lHmZSXdpr1ng0nMCQ3Zk-qZNFP8bu9CDqjTBw3IADshelLhdqPIiy2ZvpJEZC-o1kkLHKfzH9BEiQtOkDoyEk" alt=""></figure>



<p>It’s possible this large effect could have been confounded by other factors, so I iterated on the model to account for these factors, to see whether the effect of prior interview experience on interview success would continue to shine through.</p>



<p>Here were the factors considered:</p>



<ul><li>Average technical rating</li><li>Average problem solving rating</li><li>Average communication rating</li><li>Number of mock interviews completed on interviewing.io</li><li>Experience level</li><li>Gender</li><li>Did the person have a computer science degree?</li></ul>



<p>For 171 respondents who went through the Amazon hiring process, a statistically significant association continued to exist between prior technical interview experience and succeeding in a phone interview. Below were the predicted probabilities of passing a phone interview for a typical respondent in this survey (males with a computer science degree and 4+ years of experience, with average technical, communication, and problem solving ability), conditional on their prior technical interview experience.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prior Experience</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Amazon Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-4 technical interviews</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>5+ technical interviews</td><td>81%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>For Facebook we observed a similar effect:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Prior Experience</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Facebook Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-4 technical interviews</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>5+ technical interviews</td><td>71%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Finally, for Google applicants we observed that the number of interviewing.io mock interviews completed had the clearest association with interview success, not prior technical interview experience. While mock interviews aren’t exactly the same as real-world technical interviews, they are conducted by the same kinds of people asking similar questions and using similar assessment criteria. Because of this, it seems possible that the effects of mock interviews on interview success could be similar to the effect of real technical interview experience.</p>



<p>Below was the estimated chance of passing the Google phone interview for the typical survey respondent, conditional on the number of interviewing.io practice interviews attended.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Mock interviews on interviewing.io</strong></td><td><strong>Predicted Probability of Passing Google Phone Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>69%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>76%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Looking at the other variables we included in the model, we observed no other statistically significant relationships with success in phone interviews. It’s possible those relationships actually exist, but based on this sample, we did not observe enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that no relationship exists.</p>



<p>So even after accounting for other factors, more technical interview experience was still associated with greater success in phone interviews.</p>



<p>We also wondered whether similar effects might exist when you get further down the hiring funnel. For example, could prior technical interview experience also improve your chances of receiving an offer after an onsite? We performed a similar analysis to predict the chance of receiving an offer conditional upon attending an onsite interview, but we found no noticeable relationships between the predictors listed above and the probability of receiving an offer. Sample sizes are naturally smaller when looking this far down the funnel, and perhaps the differences between candidates are smaller, which could be harder to detect.</p>



<p>Based on an analysis of this particular group of people, it seems we have a pretty clear answer to the original question of “What metric should be used to know you’re prepared to succeed in a FAANG interview?” </p>



<p>The answer is to <strong>experience five or more real technical interviews</strong>. Simple, right?</p>



<span>Why more experience with technical interviews helps you succeed in future technical interviews</span>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I find that answer unsatisfying. That conclusion seems <em>really</em> questionable and self-serving, especially when the recommendation comes from a company that offers mock technical interviews as a product.</p>



<p>I don’t blame you, and quite frankly, this result wasn’t what we expected either. The metric of technical interviewing experience is probably just a proxy for some other phenomenon that does correlate with interview success in some explainable way. After all, it’s unlikely that just showing up to five interviews will magically bestow upon you new talents.</p>



<p>So what is it about having technical interview experience that might be associated with success in future technical interviews? To dig even deeper, we followed up with survey respondents who successfully received an offer with Google, Facebook, or Amazon, and asked what factors they felt contributed to their success.</p>



<p>As you’d expect, nearly all respondents said practicing technical problems was the foundation for their success. So yes, technical competency matters, and no, past interview experience doesn’t appear to be a substitute for it.</p>



<p>Beyond technical ability, respondents shared anecdotes that hint at why such a relationship might exist, as well as some possible underlying factors that could explain what technical interview experience might proxy for.</p>



<span>Direct feedback from other people helps you improve quicker</span>



<p>It’s one thing to get a question wrong in a practice environment, and it’s another thing to get a question wrong when you have an interviewer looking over your shoulder. …</p></section></div>

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-03</span>
<p>The combination of forth semantics and s-expr syntax makes the WebAsm text format (WAT/.wat) probably the most
powerful programming language extant today. Soon I expect it to obviate <em>all other languages</em>. <span>joke</span>
</p>
<p>There is a common myth floating around that webasm is just a binary format for a javascript AST (abstract syntax
tree). That is <em>really</em> selling webasm short.
</p>
<h2> forth</h2>
<p>webasm is like forth in so far as it is a stack machine. There are no registers in the webasm virtual machine.
</p>
<p>Unlike forth, webasm functions have explicit parameters, local variables and only return a single value (currently).
webasm also lacks forth's rich set of words for stack manipulation <code>[dup swap roll ...]</code>
</p>
<h2> lisp</h2>
<p>webasm's text format uses lisp/s-expr syntax. The language syntax also has many lisp style influences. Impressive!
<span>Finally, someone in a position of power has realized that we should be using s-expr's for everything and discarding xml and json.</span>
</p>
<h2> static typing</h2>
<p>All webasm globals, locals, parameters and functions are strongly statically typed. Only a few simple types (integer and float) and
a reference type are allowed. <code>[types::=i32,i64,f32,f64]</code>.
</p>
<p>Note the absence of strings or even arrays. No unsigned types either, although there are some instructions which can
be marked signed/unsigned <code>[right-shift, greater-equal ...]</code>.
</p>
<h2> memory</h2>
<p>wasm memory layout is like what you find on simple 80's computer or a <em>not-too-modern</em> microcontroller. The memory starts at zero
and proceeds to a specified max value (the max value is dynamically growable, cf. C's brk()).
</p>
<p>Not even malloc() is provided.
</p>
<p>Memory pointers are just i32/i64 integer offsets in the memory array (exactly the same as <em>real</em> pointers ...).
</p>
<h2> assembler</h2>
<p>wasm instructions are very much on the assembler end of the spectrum, with <code>i32.add, f32.neg</code> and the like.
There are some slightly higher-level (more controlled) control forms like (block) and (loop). Arbitrary jumps
are not possible [security feature]. Indeed code and data are <strong>not</strong> in the same address space, and code space is
completely opaque to the wasm programmer.
</p>
<h2> overall structure</h2>
<p>The top-level form is a <code>(module ...</code>) which can contain globals and functions.
<span>There are also import, export, memory size specs and even type definitions.</span>
</p>
<pre>(module
  (func $malloc (param $len i32) (result i32)
    ;; ... body returning an i32
    ))
</pre>
<p>Canonically instructions are laid out flat but the text format also allows for a much nicer nested s-expr syntax.
</p>
<p>flat syntax (making the stack machine more obvious):
</p>
<pre>global.get $dot
local.get $len
i32.add
global.set $dot
</pre>
<p>s-expression alternative (same code)
</p>
<pre>(global.set $dot (i32.add (global.get $dot) (local.get $len)))
</pre>
<p>Parameters, locals and even functions can all be accessed by index but they can be given optional labels too.
This and the s-expr option makes it a breeze to code directly in the language itself. <span>joke</span>
</p>
<h2> runtime environment</h2>
<p>The entire wasm code is called from javascript, which has an api designed to load and import functions from a wasm file
(see below for example)
</p>
<h2> import/export</h2>
<p>webasm functions can be exported to javascript like this:
<span>note how the wasm return value is implicitly whatever is on the stack at exit; wat compilers check stack arity and type.</span>
</p>
<p><span>[full code example at the end]</span>
</p>
<pre>(func (export "addNumbers") (param $a i32) (param $b i32) (result i32)
  (i32.add (local.get $a) (local.get $b)))
</pre>
<pre>// called from javascript like this (after some incantations)
var someNumber = 17;
const sum = wasm.instance.exports.addNumbers(12, someNumber);
</pre>
<p>Javscript can also export functions into wasm-space, using a 2-level object passed into the WebAssembly incantation.
</p>
<pre>// export a console.log(i32) function
var importObject = {
  console: { log: function(num) { console.log(num + " 0x" + (num&gt;&gt;&gt;0).toString(16)); } },
  };
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("malloc.wasm"), importObject)
&nbsp; .then(function(wasm){
      .... access wasm functions in here
      });
</pre>
<p>The javascript exports must be explicitly imported by the wasm module and given a local function signature (and name).
<span>unlike the js counterpart, the wasm function is strongly, statically typed, taking a single i32 parameter, only</span>
</p>
<pre>(import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
...
(call $js_log (i32.const 15)) ;; example of calling out to javascript
</pre>
<h2> externref - the part of the spec we wish we had</h2>
<p>It would be nice to have another wasm type, an opaque, read-only, javascript reference object which we could receive from javascript,
store and later pass back to javascript in our callouts/callbacks.
</p>
<p>You will miss this feature almost as soon as you write your first substantial <code>wat</code> program.
</p>
<p>Alas the <code>externref</code> spec is not part of the original webasm spec and is a newer addition. I am not sure how widely adopted it is.
</p>
<h2> a more substantial example</h2>
<p>(the full html/wat code is linked below, also as a live example)
</p>
<p>The WAT source code of for the (cheap) malloc() example function and another (even cheaper) dump_range() function which calls back
to javascript to write bytes into the debug console.
</p>
<pre>(module
  (memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
  (import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
  (global $memend i32  (i32.const 4096))
  (global $sbrk (mut i32)  (i32.const 0))
  ;; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
  (func (export "malloc") (param $len i32) (result i32)
    (local $newbrk i32)
    (local $mem i32)
    (local.set $newbrk (i32.add (global.get $sbrk) (local.get $len)))
    (if (i32.ge_u (local.get $newbrk) (global.get $memend))
      (return (i32.const 0)))
    (local.set $mem (global.get $sbrk))
    (global.set $sbrk (local.get $newbrk))
    (local.get $mem))
  ;; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
  (func (export "dump_range") (param $start i32) (param $len i32)
    (local $i i32)
    (local $end i32)
    (local.set $end (i32.add (local.get $start) (local.get $len)))
    (local.set $i (local.get $start))
    (block $break2 (loop $head1
      (br_if $break2 (i32.eq (local.get $i)  (local.get $end)))
      (call $js_log (i32.load8_u (local.get $i)))
      (local.set $i (i32.add  (i32.const 1) (local.get $i)))
      (br $head1))))
  )

<p>Compile it to <code>malloc.wasm</code> like so:

<h3>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h3>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

    <p>Browser vendors like Mozilla or Google have introduced new default values for
the <code>sameSite</code> attribute when setting browser cookies [1]. While this change is
great for preventing third-party tracking through cookies, it can make a
developer’s life quite frustrating when wanting to debug a local front end
pointing to a remote server.</p>
<p>Especially, when Chrome and Firefox give confusing or no warnings at all. Here’s
an example of Chrome complaining:</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/chrome_samesite.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In Firefox, there’ll likely be a small warning in the console:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>Some cookies are misusing the “SameSite“ attribute, so it won’t work as expected </span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2 id="The-Problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>For me the problem was the following: I had a staging server running online. It
contained sample data that I preferred using to test my front end over a local
backend server.</p>
<p>There’s a similar problem that developers run into with this type of setup:
CORS. I usually encounter it either when:</p>
<ul>
<li>I host front end and back end on different domains</li>
<li>I spin up a local front end development server and connect it to a backend
running online.</li>
</ul>
<p>That problem, I tend to prefer solving it by downloading a browser plugin that
temporarily disabled CORS. The recent <code>sameSite</code> cookie attribute change,
however, is different in that it’s recent. I only found limited information
about bypassing it online. There are no browser plugins yet either. Still, it
can be easily fixed by modifying some settings in your browser.</p>
<h2 id="Disabling-sameSite-policy-in-Google-Chrome">Disabling sameSite policy in Google Chrome</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <code>chrome://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies</code>.</li>
<li>Set <em>“SameSite by default cookies”</em>, <em>“Enable removing SameSite=None
cookies”</em>, <em>“Cookies without SameSite must be secure”</em> to <code>Disabled</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure to restart Chrome.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When trying your <code>Set-Cookie</code> request, the yellow overlay in the
request inspection tab should now be gone and your cookies should show up in
the “Application” tab.</p>
<h2 id="Disabling-sameSite-policy-in-Mozilla-Firefox-Developer-Edition">Disabling sameSite policy in Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition</h2>
<p>Go to <code>about:config</code> and make sure you have the following settings

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Issues with blocked <code>SameSite</code> cookies in local development environments can be
fixed by temporarily disabling sameSite policies in Firefox and Chrome. To

<li>Awareness (you are here)</li>
<li>Enablement (coming soon)</li>
<li>Enforcement (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p>Last week I published a post introducing three important phases of AppSec Engineering: Awareness, Enablement, and Enforcement. Over the next three posts I will dive into each of these topics to share best practices and guidelines you can roll out to optimize your security engineering practice.</p>
<p>In my experience, the best AppSec programs start with AppSec awareness training. The goal is to provide your product team with enough information to know when they need security involvement. That’s a broad statement, so let’s break it down.</p>
<p>AppSec awareness is different than security awareness. General security awareness protects the organization or enterprise by training employees in topics such as how to identify phishing attacks, how to choose good passwords, and understanding why TLS is important. Security awareness is incredibly important to any organization as most successful data breaches include a human component. AppSec awareness, however, is more targeted and it arms your engineering team members on how to identify risk, understand vulnerabilities, and to recognize when the security team should be brought in to enable good decision making (more on that in phase 2).</p>
<p>It should be stated clearly that the goal of this program is not to turn every person in your organization into a security expert. It is to give them the tools they need to know when they are about to take an action that may impact business risk and to “raise their hand” for support and guidance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this program is <em>not</em> to turn every person at your organization into a security expert</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goals during the awareness phase are to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What needs to be protected</li>
<li>What are sensitive components</li>
<li>What is risk</li>
<li>Security can be interesting and fun</li>
<li>Security doesn’t have to be time consuming</li>
<li>The security team isn’t here just to say no</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s break down each of the goals individually.</p>
<h2 id="what-needs-to-be-protected">What needs to be protected</h2>
<p>One of the first things I train a product team to do is to understand what assets are most important to protect. This can be Intellectual Property, regulated data (PII, PCI, HIPAA, etc.) , or what is most likely to be targeted by attackers. The ability to identify assets is a massive first step to understanding security, risk, and remediation.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-sensitive-components">What are sensitive components</h2>
<p>Components that handle sensitive data are inherently risky, but there are other components that can be difficult to build safely as well. Some components may give an attacker an advantage in the system, run as privileged accounts, or give access to other privileged data or components; these components should also be identified as risky as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-risk">What is risk</h2>
<p>Being able to have a meaningful conversation about risk is another key goal in the Awareness phase of AppSec Engineering. There are many ways to measure risk, many of them a complicated nesting doll of security jargon. However, I’ve found that most people inherently understand risk at a sufficient level for this awareness phase. AppSec professionals and leaders must understand risk deeply.</p>
<p><img src="https://rethinksecurity.io/post-images/risk.png" alt="Risk = Likelihood * Impact"></p>
<p>Defining risk as likelihood multiplied by impact is clear and understandable.</p>
<h2 id="security-can-be-interesting-and-fun">Security can be interesting and fun</h2>
<p>The best part of my job is watching the security “light-bulb” go off in people’s heads. Sometimes it’s when they understand how hackers think or sometimes it’s when they understand a specific threat or attack vector. No matter the precipitating event the discovery that security is fun and engaging is a key component of awareness. Making security fun will help the product security team return to security again and again and want to learn more about it organically.</p>
<h2 id="security-doesnt-have-to-be-time-consuming">Security doesn’t have to be time consuming</h2>
<p>When I started out in security, about 20 years ago, the focus was on “Security Gates” or checkpoints that the application would have to go through like a gauntlet of pain before deploying the product: Have you created a threat model? Did you do an architecture review? Have you performed the necessary code reviews, or code scans? Has the security team tested your system? Is there a review of the infrastructure impact and so many more things. Looking back it’s no wonder developers were cautious about security teams.</p>
<p>The current era of security focuses entirely on enablement&nbsp;The ProdSec team should be building libraries and tools that make development faster and easier for teams to build and deploy secure software. We will dive into the specifics of security enablement in the next article, but the key takeaway at this time is that the product team should understand working with security will not slow them down.</p>
<h2 id="the-security-team-isnt-here-just-to-say-no">The security team isn’t here just to say no</h2>
<p>Developers often think of the security team as unnecessarily obstructionist. With the security gates mentality this can absolutely be true. In fact security teams often get named “The office of no” and sometimes for good reason.</p>
<p>Many good security teams have evolved their thinking to enable development of great new features that are secure from current and future threats. Building software this way not only enables the development team to build software quickly and securely but also develops relationships between the teams and allows security to become a market differentiator for the product as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-security-implication-of-this">What is the security implication of this?</h2>
<p>If most of your Product Team is asking the question “What is the security implication of this?” during meetings, scrums, or feature discussions and that question spurs an engaging and lively discussion, then the goal of awareness has been achieved. The goal of this phase is to arm your team with the questions, passion, and curiosity to start these conversations, not necessarily to finish them.</p>

Recently, the YOLO name and architecture have been picked up recently by a number of computer vision researchers.</p><p><strong>YOLOv4 - </strong>Early this spring, <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyAB">AlexyAB</a> formalized his fork of the Darknet repo, publishing the state-of-the-art <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/a-thorough-breakdown-of-yolov4/">YOLOv4 model</a>. YOLOv4 was considered one of the best models for speed and accuracy performance, but did not top EfficientDet's largest model for overall accuracy on the COCO dataset.</p><p><strong>YOLOv5 - </strong>Shortly after the release of YOLOv4, Glenn Jocher (Github moniker <a href="https://github.com/glenn-jocher">glenn-jocher</a>) published his version of the YOLO model in PyTorch as <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov5-improvements-and-evaluation/">YOLOv5</a>. Comparing how YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 models stacked up against each other was nuanced – we wrote a bunch on the <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"></a><a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/">YOLOv4 vs</a>.<a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolov4-versus-yolov5/"> YOLOv5 </a>debate here.</p><p>The YOLOv5 PyTorch training and architecture conversion was the most notable contribution, making YOLO easier than ever to train, <em>speeding up training time 10x relative to Darknet</em>. </p><p>One of the main reasons Scaled-YOLOv4 is implemented in the YOLOv5 PyTorch framework is, no doubt, the training routines. Glenn Jocher notably gets a shoutout in the Acknowledgments of Scaled-YOLOv4.</p><p><strong>PP-YOLO - </strong>This summer, researchers at <a href="https://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> released their version of the YOLO architecture, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/pp-yolo-beats-yolov4-object-detection/">PP-YOLO, surpassing YOLOv4 and YOLOv5</a>.

In addition to these scaling factors, the authors also adjust the configuration of their model's architecture in the paper.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-2.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png 695w"><figcaption>YOLOv4-P5/P6/P7 architectures (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08036.pdf">cite</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="data-augmentations">Data Augmentations</h3><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-augmentation-in-yolov4-c16bd22b2617">Data augmentation in YOLOv4</a> was one of the key contributions to YOLOv4's impressive performance.

When we compare YOLOv4-CSP with the same accuracy of EfficientDetD3 (47.5% vs 47.5%), the inference speed is 1.9 times [that of EfficientDetD3]. When YOLOv4-P5 is compared with EfficientDet-D5 with the same accuracy (51.4% vs 51.5%), the inference speed is 2.9 times [that of EfficientDet-D5]. The situation is similar to the comparisons between YOLOv4-P6 vs EfficientDet-D7 (54.3% vs 53.7%) and YOLOv4-P7 vs EfficientDet-D7x (55.4% vs 55.1%). In both cases, YOLOv4-P6 and YOLOv4-P7 are, respectively, 3.7 times and 2.3 times faster in terms of inference speed. </blockquote><p>And notably for YOLOv4-tiny:</p><blockquote>In addition, if one uses TensorRT FP16 to run YOLOv4-tiny on general GPU RTX 2080ti, when the batch size respectively equals to 1 and 4, the respective frame rate can reach 773fps and 1774fps, which is extremely fast.</blockquote><p><strong>If you want to push the ceiling for performance or speed for your object detection task, Scaled-YOLOv4 is the new place to look.</strong></p><p>The authors provide myriad ablation studies and many more research insights than we have written here.

December 3, 2020 | https://staysaasy.com/product/2020/12/01/which-competitors-matter.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://staysaasy.com/product/2020/12/01/which-competitors-matter.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Enterprise SaaS is brutally competitive. Markets are crowded and zero sum: customers are buying your product, a competing product, or nothing. The industry naturally leads teams to obsess about competitors.</p>

<p>If you spend your entire day thinking about the competition, you’ll fail. The best companies succeed by building what their customers need, rather than analyzing their competitors’ actions. To stay focused (and stay sane), you need to relentlessly prioritize and only devote your team’s finite energy to your most significant rivals.</p>

<p>It’s a bit like running a football team. If you spend your entire time studying your opponents, you’ll lose because you didn’t practice your plays, work out, or prepare to play your game. But if you ignore your opponents and focus 100% inwardly, you’ll both miss out on opportunities to beat them and also risk having your weaknesses exploited. And unlike in football, you may have dozens or hundreds of opposing teams, and you don’t even know who your next opponent might be.</p>

<p>Inevitably, you need to decide which competitors deserve your attention. Taking the right steps to ward off serious competitors pays dividends when done early. Beat an established company enough and you can dissuade them from entering your market. Kill your startup competitors in the crib, and they’ll pivot or be unable to raise funds to survive.</p>

<p>Below is a quick-and-dirty set of criteria to determine how much mind to pay your competitors, in order from least worrisome to most.</p>

<h2 id="you-run-into-a-competitor-in-new-head-to-head-deals-but-you-always-win">You run into a competitor in new head-to-head deals, but you always win</h2>

<p><em>We’ve seen a new competitor, SnowDog, in 3 deals already. But don’t worry, we’ve beaten them every time. Their product is just not able to compete with ours at this point.</em></p>

<p>Running into a competitor in head-to-head deals is the first indication that they’re coming for your market. It means that their sales and marketing can access the same customers as you, and that their product positioning attracts the same buyers.</p>

<p>At this stage, if you’re consistently beating a competitor, one of two things can happen. In some cases, they’ll give up – pivoting or abandoning their product, or steering away from you in the market. But in others, this stage is just the precursor and they’ll persist in their efforts to compete. This is the first warning sign but is usually not worth reacting to.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-beats-you-but-for-bad-reasons">The competitor beats you, but for bad reasons</h2>

<p><em>We ran into SnowDog in 8 deal cycles last quarter, and they beat us in 3 of them. But it wasn’t for good reasons – they dropped their prices to just 20-30% of ours, added in tons of consulting services, and in one case even promised to build a one-off feature that the customer wanted.</em></p>

<p>When a competitor is desperate, they’ll pull all sorts of tricks in order to beat you. This is especially common when competing against early stage startups. They may win deals, but they’ll ultimately win because of “bad” reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dramatically undercutting you on price</li>
  <li>Offering to do tons of custom work</li>
  <li>Customizing their roadmap to close deals</li>
  <li>Simply being dishonest in the sales cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Losing to a competitor for bad reasons tells you that they simply aren’t yet ready to compete with you on a fair playing field. But it also confirms that they are planning to compete with you, and that you’ll need to deal with them in the future… if their business-weakening competitive tactics allow them to survive that long.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-beats-you-but-for-valid-reasons">The competitor beats you, but for valid reasons</h2>

<p><em>Hmm… We’ve continued to run into SnowDog, and they just beat us in the Jetblue deal even after we had dropped our prices to remain competitive. The buyer at Jetblue said that they just liked SnowDog’s offering more for their team’s particular use-cases.</em></p>

<p>There can be any number of reasons why a competitor beats you fair and square. They may have outsold you; they may have gotten to the customer first. They may have a better product overall, or may just have a better product for a niche situation that some customers care about.</p>

<p>When you lose for a “valid” reason, it indicates that your competitor’s pitch and ability to back that pitch up in a sales cycle are real. Their product might not actually be that great, but overall they have figured out the mix of product and positioning that gives them a foundation from which to build their go-to-market motion.</p>

<p>Most SaaS markets are competitive, so you should expect to lose some head-to-head deals for valid reasons from time to time. You certainly shouldn’t panic at this point, but by now you should be actively monitoring the competitor in question and preparing your sales team to combat them.</p>

<h2 id="you-cant-reliably-rip-the-competitor-out">You can’t reliably rip the competitor out</h2>

<p><em>SnowDog has been working with Southwest Airlines for a year and a half already. We tried to get them to switch to our offering, but we haven’t been able to do so yet – even though they aren’t huge SnowDog advocates, Southwest says that they’re satisfied enough with the offering and focusing on other projects in the coming year.</em></p>

<p>This is the first severe warning flag. If you can’t rip out a competitor – that is, you can’t pull them out once they’re installed – that means that their product is truly adding value in a sustainable way. Products with weak product/market fit aren’t sticky, and you’ll be able to rip them out easily. Products with strong product/market fit, even if expensive or not beloved, are surprisingly durable once customers are using them.</p>

<p>When you can’t reliably rip a competitor out, you’re dealing with a true adversary and beating them should factor into your company’s strategic roadmap.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-can-reliably-rip-you-out-but-only-in-a-niche-customer-segment">The competitor can reliably rip you out, but only in a niche customer segment</h2>

<p><em>It’s a bummer that American Airlines stopped working with us, and we just found out that they actually switched to use SnowDog. This is bad news but isn’t too surprising, however – SnowDog have really established that they’re strong in the airline industry. They don’t have a lot of ability to expand beyond that vertical… we think?</em></p>

<p>This is the most important stage, as it involves a fork in the road.</p>

<p>At this stage there is almost certainly trouble, but the question is how much? Perhaps a competitor is taking only your largest enterprise customers away, or your customers in one particular industry vertical. The company-shaping decision you must make at this point is whether you think that this is as far as they can go, or if they will come after you in another category next.</p>

<p>If you feel that a competitor won’t be able to attack your core business, you <em>may</em> not need to react. Perhaps your product was never really meant for the airline vertical (or wherever you’re losing customers) and this just speeds up your exit from the space. You must monitor the situation but it doesn’t yet need to dominate your field of view.</p>

<p>But it’s also possible that this is just step 1 of a comprehensive attack. Beating you in one customer segment is always the prelude to beating you across the entire market. If there is even a possibility that the competitor will have the incentive and ability to attack your core market, beware: beating this competitor should now be a key pillar of your roadmap, and it’s easiest to take steps to block them immediately.</p>

<p>One indicator that can help make this decision is actually the competitor’s own product marketing. Many companies will actually publicly declare the markets that they want to enter. It’s good PR for prospective future investors, whether public or private. Another clue can come from fundraising patterns - all else being equal, the more money a company has raised, the more markets they will feel compelled to enter in order to justify a higher valuation.</p>

<h2 id="the-competitor-can-reliably-rip-you-out-of-most-customers">The competitor can reliably rip you out of most customers</h2>

<p><em>Home Depot just churned to use SnowDog. What the f### is going on?</em></p>

<p>This is code red, drop everything. This competitor presents an existential risk to your business that you must deal with immediately if you want to keep your job. The longer you wait the worse the problem will become. Beating this competitor is now the core of your roadmap.</p>

<p>The trick is to never, ever get to this point – or at least, if you do get to this point, to see it coming early enough that you have a plan. You can do this by looking for the indicators above, and gradually increasing your defensive and offensive capabilities and counter-capabilities against top competitors to prevent them from rising up in the first place. The full story of how to combat competitors will be the topic of future posts!</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Prioritize the amount of time that you spend on the competition. When a competitor rears its head, consider where they fall on this spectrum to determine how concerned you should be. It’s easier to beat competitors when they’re small or before they get to your market, saving you months of work and heartache in the long run.</p>

<p>This book aims to explain Futures in Rust using an example driven approach,
exploring why they're designed the way they are, and how they work. We'll also
take a look at some of the alternatives we have when dealing with concurrency
in programming.</p>
<p>Going into the level of detail I do in this book is not needed to use futures
or async/await in Rust. It's for the curious out there that want to know <em>how</em>
it all works.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-this-book-covers" id="what-this-book-covers">What this book covers</a></h2>
<p>This book will try to explain everything you might wonder about up until the
topic of different types of executors and runtimes. We'll just implement a very
simple runtime in this book introducing some concepts but it's enough to get
started.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stjepang">Stjepan Glavina</a> has made an excellent series of
articles about async runtimes and executors, and if the rumors are right there
is more to come from him in the near future.</p>
<p>The way you should go about it is to read this book first, then continue
reading the <a href="https://stjepang.github.io/">articles from stejpang</a> to learn more
about runtimes and how they work, especially:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/25/build-your-own-block-on.html">Build your own block_on()</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stjepang.github.io/2020/01/31/build-your-own-executor.html">Build your own executor</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I've limited myself to a 200 line main example (hence the title) to limit the

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-9b788883e87ba2fce62c"><p>It’s easy as a marketer to get obsessed with&nbsp;<em>marketing</em> — organic reach, paid reach, impressions, lookalike audiences etc., whilst failing to answer the most important question a customer has; <strong>“why should I care?”.</strong></p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607079818241_6452"><div><p>First, what is brand positioning? The Business Dictionary defines brand positioning as:</p><blockquote><p>“A marketing strategy that aims to make a brand occupy a distinct position, relative to competing brands, in the mind of the customer.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Companies apply this strategy either by emphasizing the distinguishing features of their brand or they may try to create a suitable image (inexpensive or premium, utilitarian or luxurious, entry-level or high-end, etc.)”</p></blockquote><p>If there is a significant gap between marketing strategy and your brand positioning, then that gap is eating up sales and revenue. As this gap becomes smaller, your sales will increase further — its that simple!</p><p>For some context, I’ve worked in marketing for nearly 10 years, with a couple of years in Head of Marketing and CMO roles before starting <a href="https://rhealondon.com/">Rhea London</a> to help brands and businesses reach their goals.</p><p>One thing we pride ourselves on at the agency is generating maximum revenue for our clients in a short time frame. We’ve had good success with this for the first year we were operating, but sales for our clients increased&nbsp;<em>dramatically</em>when we stopped thinking like marketers, and starting thinking like brand managers.</p><p>Branding pioneer, Marty Neumeier (lived in Sillicon Valley since the 80’s and has designed for&nbsp;<em>Adobe, Apple, Hewlett-Packard&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Microsoft</em>) emphasises the need to pay attention to the order in which your customer will view your sales proposition (in our case, a Facebook ad). He’s spent decades refining his thinking on this, with the biggest brands in the world.</p><p>When a potential customer sees your ad, there is a moment when their eyes are looking right at you— this is your one and&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;time to shine. Neumeier calls this small window of opportunity ‘<em>the branding moment’.</em></p><p>Neumeier lays out 5 stages of how a customer views a product on a supermarket shelf, with each stage often being entirely subconscious.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607079818241_8798"><div><p>There are very few people reading this that will ever need to sell a product on a shelf, but this framework is<em>&nbsp;directly relatable&nbsp;</em>to advertising on social media (I’ll go in to why in a moment). First, the 5 stages:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Shopper notices packaging on shelf — notices strong colours, contrasting tones.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Shopper asks ‘what is it?’</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asks ‘why should I care’</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Looks for more information</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Shopper has decided if they are ready (or not) to consider price and features.</strong></p></li></ol><p>When translated to seeing your ad on Facebook/Instagram this translates to:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Your target customer stops scrolling when they see your ad — strong colours, contrasting tones grab attention.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Target customer asks ‘what is it?’ — your tagline (or headline) should answer this for them.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asks ‘why should I care?’ — this is where you can touch on their pain points and differentiate your product from your competition.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>This creates the desire for more info — you need to creatively peak their interest and pull them in with a clear why-to-buy message.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>They are now ready (and primed) to see your features, prices, guarantees, awards and whatever else will take them over the line.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Putting this into practice may seem straight forward, and you may be reading this thinking ‘but, I already do that’ — well if you take a look at one of your ads right now, with those 5 stages in mind, you’ll likely see a significant gap between points. And what’s important to remember is, if&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;of those points are weak, your brand positioning is weak — resulting in a breakdown in communication between your ad and your potential customer.</p><p>Okay, so how exactly did we use this methodology to generate <strong>over $100,000 in sales?</strong></p><p>The first step was to turn off all ads and start again.</p><p>We redesigned&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p><p>New copy, defined new USPs, new tone of voice, new images.</p><p>But for us, what was most important was to first understand what differentiated the products that we were selling, from their direct competitors so that we could effectively communicate this when considering point number 3 above.</p><p>There is one question that has been asked by designers and their marketing counterparts since the dawn of advertising; ‘what drives the customer to buy — logic or emotion?’. Well, it’s both, you just need to be use a clear methodology so that you can maximise sales.</p><h4><strong>Want to discuss how we can help your business?</strong></h4></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607079818241_11110"><div><div><p>We love generating sales &amp; revenue for brands, apps and software products.

<p>I’ve spent too many hours writing pages and pages of architecture docs that nobody ever read.</p>



<p>I’ve joined too many projects with gigantic architecture docs that were outdated and useless.</p>



<p>I’ve seen too many architecture docs that were mind-numbing prose descriptions of what should have been a diagram.</p>



<p>I’m sick of it. My rule nowadays is that <em>each team gets one diagram</em>. That’s the architecture doc. It can be as complex as it needs to be, but there can only be one per team.</p>



<p><strong>Why a diagram?</strong></p>



<ul><li>A picture is worth a thousand words. Never has that been more true than with architecture docs.</li><li>Nobody wants to sit there and read dozens of pages of prose when they could look at a diagram instead.</li><li>Maintaining all those pages of text is a nightmare as little things change gradually over time.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Why only one?</strong></p>



<ul><li>The chance of outdated info increases exponentially with the number of diagrams, rather than proportionally.</li><li>Eventually two “unrelated” things will need a connection between them that we didn’t foresee.</li><li>Onboarding and planning are easier when we can visualize everything<em> </em>in one place.</li></ul>



<p>You get one diagram. Use it well.</p>

<p>Those are the best sorts of days.</p>
<p>Somedays that leads to a new song.</p>
<h3>A loop pedal is a stack</h3>
<p>A loop pedal is a magical device that lets you record in stacked layers. It's almost like editing something in Figma or Sketch, except each layer is the same "shape" as the first or root layer. And by <em>shape</em> here what I actually mean is <em>length</em>.</p>
<p>Like other guitar pedals, a loop pedal lives somewhere between your guitar (the input) and your amp (the output). It receives the input from your instrument and "does stuff" with it, before sending it onwards. For example, maybe you want to add some <strong>distortion</strong> or <strong>flange</strong> -- OR BOTH. Your guitar pedals are like the world's simplest data flow pipeline. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Guitar -&gt; Distortion Pedal -&gt; Flanger Pedal -&gt; Chorus Pedal -&gt; Amp</code></pre></div>
<p>No cycles or braching in this DAG. I mean, maybe there could branching. Or cycles. I bet some guitarists do that, somehow. But that's beyond my pay grade.</p>
<p>Let's go back to our loop pedal and record something.</p>
<p>Imagine that I tap the loop pedal with my foot, play the following, and tap the pedal again.</p>

<p>Each X here might represent one "measure" or "bar" in music theory land, but that's mostly unfamiliar territory for me, too, so instead we can say that we've played the X chord (I wish there was an X chord) 8 times of some fixed duration.</p>
<p>This is now our root layer for our stack.</p>
<p>By default, the pedal will keep "looping" this layer. You can double-tap it to "stop the loop" (maybe you'd do this when you reach a new section of your song, like the chorus).</p>
<p>Otherwise, now it's time to add some more layers. Tap the pedal again and you add the following layer:</p>

<p>Maybe <code>y</code> is an awesome solo or something. Then you do it again.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, this pattern will keep repeating over and over, expanding to the right.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X --&gt;
  y   y     y y   y   y     y y --&gt;
z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z --&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>What happens if you are recording a layer that extends longer than the root layer? Good question. The recording simple wraps around to the beginning of the root layer and you can keep going. However you will notice that you are already hearing what you recorded for this layer, so that can sound strange. Let's show an example.</p>
<p>I'm going to add a layer that just plays ascending notes up the guitar neck (a really crappy solo) and have this layer wrap around.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X
  y   y     y y
z z z z z z z z
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</code></pre></div>
<p>So far, so good. Why not keep going...</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>X X X X X X X X

<p>As you can see, my latest layer wrapped around to the beginning, such that when I played the <code>9</code>, you would hear the <code>1</code> at the same time. This may or may not be what you want to do. I'm guessing.. no. Especially if you're playing some epic Type II guitar solo.</p>
<p>Thus, one of the more common use cases of the loop pedal is to lay down some repeatable groove that you can sing various verses or solo over. Instead of making the "unique" or "changable" a layer in your loop stack, you just keep that off to the side.</p>
<p>Reader beware that my loop pedal is relatively simple. There are other, better, more-intense loop pedals where you can have multiple different loop stacks going at the same time. For example, maybe you've got a loop going for the verses and another separate loop stack for the choruses in your song.</p>
<p>But I appreciate the simplicity of my pedal. The one thing I still haven't figured out is whether or not you can do the <code>pop</code> stack operation on it. The <a href="https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-1/">documentation</a> suggests that you can erase the top layer of the stack, but I haven't figured it out yet. For now, I've been living in a <code>push</code> only world, flubs included, which you'll hear in the next section.</p>

<h4>Uncle Mike's Tips for Running a Zoom-Based Open Mic Night</h4>
<p>Big thanks to Uncle Mike for organizing our second Zoom family open mic night. He runs a tight ship, mostly trying to prevent me from launching into a <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/bullet-train-to-merlins-grave">Bullet Train to Merlin's Grave medley like at Popestock</a>.</p>
<p>To paraphrase his tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each performer gets one song, of "normal song length" (so that means no Tubular Bells)</li>
<li>Announce the order in advance</li>
<li>Tune up your instrument when you're on deck or in the hole</li>
<li>Don't worry about messing up, start over if you need to, this is fun. Music is the best!</li>
<li>Change your zoom settings to "Original Sound"</li>
</ul>
<p>This last one is key. Zoom does some "stuff" to make things sound "good" during boring work meetings that are boring. It's not optimized for fun singalongs that are fun. So, it's pretty much essential to <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115003279466-Enabling-option-to-preserve-original-sound">follow these steps</a> when you're singing and strumming over Zoom, unless you're trying to incorporate cosmic waves of hollow nothingness into your jam. Maybe you are?</p>
<p>Oh, you should check out Uncle Mike's music podcast, <a href="https://www.tellyouwhatpodcast.com/">Tell You What! The Podcast</a>. He interviews young musicians and bands on the run and it's fun and great and keeps you on your toes with new upcoming artists.</p>
<p>As Uncle Mike says, music is the best!</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>The mysterious YouTube algorithm had me stumble upon an unlikely phenomenon. It seems like people from all over the world are migrating to the North of Sweden. Why? Is this the start of a trend?</p>

<p>When I was about 15 years old I did a 3-day internship at a renowned web agency in Stockholm. Quite a long trip. Because that’s about 900 km away from my hometown Piteå located in the great North where I’m born and raised.</p>

<p>My first day was spent in a joint-project meeting with a TV advertising agency. That was a wild experience. The dress code seemed to be scarf + blazer, indoors (wtf?). <a href="https://reklamaremedhalsdukinomhus-blog.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Apparently very typical for the ad industry in Sweden</a>. Another guy was extremely laid back with his shoes on the conference table, constantly doing pen-tricks. I later realized that this was my first “creative brainstorming meeting”.</p>

<p><img alt="Reklamare med halsduk inomhus" src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/reklamare-med-halsduk.jpg"> <img alt="Pen spinning" src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/pen-spinning.gif"></p>

<p>The project was divided into two parts, they did the TV ads and we would build some cool online social platform that went along with it. Probably in Flash, as usual back then. The client was a big Swedish food brand who wanted to find good use for the many sports stars they had signed.</p>

<p>One guy said (Yes. They were all men): “What if we create like a big fictive house where all the sports stars live together? Then you create a platform where the kids can log on and like, play games, read up about the sports stars, chat and do some trivia.”</p>

<p>Yes. This was around the year 2000, long before Facebook. Social platforms were very popular among kids already.</p>

<p>Another guy responded enthusiastically: “That’s a great idea. We can buy a disposable house up in the North. Then we shoot the TV ads there and you guys can use the exterior photos to make some cool-fantasy-interactive-house website. We can probably find a house for less than 150k that we abandon once it’s done. It’s dirt cheap up there.” (150k SEK is about $18k)</p>

<p>Me in my young mind: “Wait… what? 150k is a lot of money! Disposable house?”</p>

<p>After the meeting, my mentor said: “Yes, it’s a lot of money. For you. Considering they pay the same amount for every 15-second slot on prime time TV, it’s not that much money to them.”</p>

<p>That certainly brought new perspectives to the value of wearing scarves indoors. And to the value of money.</p>

<p>I never thought I would hear someone refer to a house in my home region as “disposable” again. But I was wrong…</p>

<h2 id="quick-history-lesson-very-simplified">Quick history lesson (very simplified)</h2>

<p>Back in the 16th century, when other countries successfully conquered land all over the world through colonization, Sweden realized that we could find similar resources in our own backyard.</p>

<p>Up until that point, nobody really paid much attention to the area called the Northlands (sv. Norrland) which makes up about 59% of the country (FIFTY-NINE PERCENT). It was even more sparsely populated back then. You would only find a lot of forest, some poor farmers, and Sámi people with their reindeers (natives).</p>

<p><img src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/norrland.jpg" alt="Norrland of Sweden"></p>

<p>Slowly Sweden started to colonize the North, following the coastline. But it wasn’t until late 1800 things really started to take off. First, an extensive sawmill industry was established. Utilizing the rivers as efficient transportation for driving logs down to mills at the coasts. Then some serious mining up in the mountains which established the need for better communications. Railroads ftw! Followed by the exploitation of hydropower in our numerous and powerful rivers (no pun intended).</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the success, here is the population growth in a neighboring city of mine:</p>

<p><img src="https://danielmarklund.com/assets/img/blog/pupulation-growth-lulea.jpg" alt="Growth in population, Luleå"></p>

<p>All cities along the coast followed the same exponential trend. Sweden experienced unprecedented growth because of this rapid industrialization.</p>

<p>Everybody was working hard for the benefit of a selected few. Unfortunately the Average Svenne was held back by old structures. As a result the wealth gap only increased as time passed. The situation was calling for a change.</p>

<p>Therefore in 1920, a successful political campaign was launched with the vision to create a more equal Sweden. Replacing a class society with a welfare state (sv. Folkhemmet). The recipe included workdays limited to 8 hours, paid vacation, pension, free healthcare, free dental care, free school, housing, and grants for having children.</p>

<p>The extension of this campaign is what made Sweden to one of the best and most equal countries in the world. <a href="https://index.goodcountry.org/" target="_blank">Their words</a>, not mine.</p>

<p>No matter where you lived in the country, you had the same rights. Construction of schools, libraries, health care, and supermarkets took place in the most remote places. Communities were established in unlikely places. The land was abundant. The resources as well. Do you want a house? Everybody gets a house!</p>

<p>Sweden was thriving, including the “small” colony in the North.</p>

<h2 id="the-situation-today">The situation today</h2>

<p>The same rights exists today and in financial terms Sweden is doing better than ever. But how is the countryside doing? Not so well.</p>

<p>Remote villages are on the decline as a result of urbanization. The jobs are moving closer to the cities along with the people. Schools, libraries, day cares, and supermarkets are closing down. It’s not as convenient to live in sparsely populated areas anymore. The North is no exception.</p>

<p>Result: The people are leaving, but the houses remain. That’s why you can find dirt cheap houses in the North of Sweden. Well. In some places at least.</p>

<p>Northern Sweden is extremely beautiful. It can be cold and harsh during the winter months, but the people here are skilled, tough, helpful, and welcoming.</p>

<p>The region is a hidden gem, often referred to the last remaining wilderness in Europe. Lush green and hot in the summers, where the sun never goes down.  Snow and northern lights in the winter. Let’s not forget the beautiful seasons in between.</p>

<p>Even people from abroad have started to take notice…</p>

<h2 id="cue-the-youtube-generation">Cue: the YouTube generation</h2>

<p>What do you get if you take the freedom of working from anywhere, throw in some existential crisis induced by “self-help gurus” / “life coaches”, combine this with tranquilizing nature and cheap ass housing?</p>

<p>You get: (Wait for it…)</p>

<p><mark><strong>YouTubers buying houses and moving to the North of Sweden!</strong></mark></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Renting in London for a year would be the same price (or more) as buying a property in Sweden. We basically bought a <strong>disposable house</strong>.”<br><small><em>Naomi &amp; Jack. Bought a house, forest and land for ~100k SEK ($12k USD)</em></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Disposable house”, eh? There it was again.</p>

<h2 id="the-list">The list</h2>

<p>Believe me when I say: I’m extremely grateful for these people. They are giving more exposure to this region than any tourist agency could ever hope for. So from the bottom of our hearts: Thank you!</p>

<p>I’ll try to keep this list updated, so make sure to send me any tips. Get inspired. Move to Sweden! Make more people move north. Catch you on the flip side.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I prepare for my talk at <a href="https://www.digitalwarriors.tech/speakerwall/">Digital Warriors 2020</a>, entitled "from office to remote in 48h", I want to share some thoughts about the process of moving a company from office to remote-first and then to remote-only. This post represents what I've learned over the past eight years working at the best remote companies on the planet.</p>
<p>It's important to clarify that there are different stages of adoption of remote work. As a company moves towards remote only, they will go through these, and knowing the advantages is essential. It is also necessary to understand the risks.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0BQj4dc.png" alt="On-prem vs. remote-first vs. remote only"></p>
<p>Initially, a company is mostly, if not wholly, on-premise. The fundamental dynamics at work are that there is no trust that people will perform at the required level unless they are present in person and supervised. On the other hand, people working in these dynamics will optimize to succeed in them. So they will make sure they are visible in the office, always appear busy, and do their best to be either diligent supervisors or competent executors. Of course, not all companies have these kinds of issues. This kind of company perhaps reserves the term "work at home" to describe days where people can work without coming to the office. Working from a holiday destination is unthinkable unless people are doing so during the holidays.</p>
<p>The next stage of going remote is remote-first. The idea is that the company can still be partially on-premise, but the processes change to accommodate remote workers, i.e., people who work remotely all year long. This stage has been accurately described by my old friend and <a href="https://twitter.com/df07/status/504677877544390656/photo/1">OK-est boss</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/df07">David Fullerton</a> in his excellent post "<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2013/02/01/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/">Why We (Still) Believe in Working Remotely</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no halfsies in a distributed team. If even one person on the team is remote, every single person has to start communicating online. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this point is accurate, it is not all that is needed to move from on-premise to remote first. What is required is that all the <em>tools</em> become remote. Today, it is much easier to accomplish this feat than a few years back (for example, many teams use GitHub as source control, and GitHub is already a remote tool. If a team has on-premise git, then access needs to be granted through a VPN. As many people are remote, but not all, there's a risk of having the company split culturally between remote and on-premise. Regular retreats or in-office rotations are necessary to keep the bonds straight. For example, we had one yearly remote and non-remote retreat at Stack Overflow. Still, other London-area remotes and I also went to the London office regularly, and this paid off handsomely in making everyone feel part of the same company.</p>
<p>The final stage is having fully distributed companies. While this seems like a no-brainer from remote first, it's another involved step. This step is tricky is because remote-first companies have the luxury of choosing which parts of the job will happen on-premise and which other areas can be remote. This possibility allows them to move to remote the "easier" 80% of the jobs and keep on-premise the part that is not easy to change. Logistics, such as sending off Christmas presents, is not easy if people are working remotely. Retreats become necessary to be able to know your teammates personally.</p>
<p>All in all, there's a clear path to move any company from the office to telework:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to trust your people and know that it is possible to have people working without being in the office.</li>
<li>Migrate the tools and affect your office's culture, so everyone works with remote-friendly applications and devices, even in the office.</li>
<li>Migrate people from the office to their remote locations while fixing and improving the tools and processes that need change to take these steps. </li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/10/17/arcan-versus-xorg-approaching-feature-parity/">‘Arcan versus Xorg: approaching feature parity’ </a>article which is recommended reading if you have not done so already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After that article, there was only one (and a half) real feature left to safely claim parity and that can be covered rather quickly. Thereafter we can nibble on the bites that are in Arcan, but not in Xorg — the reason for the difference in scope is best saved for a different time, although it is a good one.</p>



<p>First, let us not forget that there are more vectors for qualities that are significant to users than just features. Client compatibility is something that has been much lower on the list of priorities, yet is an important quality.</p>



<p>The reason is that prematurely adding support for something like a new display server backend to a toolkit, game engine or windowing library without both necessary and sufficient features in place will lead to a scattered <em>actual</em> feature set. There will be theoretical features, and then the features some clients actually might use some version or interpretation of. These two sets will slip further and further apart unless each affected project has exceptionally alert developers, and the reference implementation having basic hygiene in place regarding conformance verification and validation tools.</p>



<p>We have experimented with such implementations, of course, but that was mainly to test the design and current implementation; to find out where our APIs gets annoying to use, so that nobody else suffers.</p>



<p>The other reason for downplaying compatibility is that client applications has strong biases on how things are “supposed” to work, with the worst offenders being just ‘GUI toolkits’. Small changes can have large impact on application design and you are forced to adapt a certain worldview that lessens your perspective. As a trivial thought exercise, just consider something like a smartphone in a world where touch input was not invented, but eye tracking was flawless.</p>



<p>To re-emphasise the point of the Arcan project as such. It is not, and never was, to reinvent X. The principle program (<a href="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2020/08/10/principles-overview/">12 principles for a diverging desktop future</a>) say as much. The project is about showing that there were <em>other paths </em>not taken by the big players, and hint at what those paths offered when followed to their logical conclusion.</p>



<p>Most of the lessons in here are not amazing discoveries from diligent research. Rather, they are uncovering wisdom hidden inside the circuits of elderly arcade machines. It is the reason for header-bar image here still being a cropped PCB from that era.</p>



<p>Enough editorialising, towards the Xorgcism! This will again be painfully long and dry. Appy-polly-loggies in advance for that. Quicknav links are as follows:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#network">Network Transparency</a></li><li><a href="#drawing">Drawing API</a></li><li><a href="#migration">Migration and Recovery</a></li><li><a href="#hook">Hook Scripts</a></li><li><a href="#alternate">Alternate Representations</a></li><li><a href="#launching">Application Launching</a></li><li><a href="#state">State Blocks</a></li><li><a href="#audio">Audio</a></li><li><a href="#input">Advanced Input and VR</a></li><li><a href="#xorg_tui">Path from curses and terminals – TUI</a></li></ul>



<h2 id="network">Network Transparency</h2>



<p>The main missing feature was about network support. Luckily I do not have to cover that again — there are already two articles on the topic: one that digs into <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2018/11/16/the-x-network-transparency-myth/">the situation in Xorg</a>; one that covers <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2020/10/28/a12-advancing-network-transparency-on-the-desktop/">our solution</a>. If there is anything left to re-emphasise, it would be that the networking part is a completely separate process that <em>reinterprets</em> the networked client data.</p>



<p>There are three reasons for this – this first is that optimal local rendering and optimal remote rendering are incompatible ideas that were historically similar enough that the discrepancy could be tolerated. Nowadays we want <em>both</em> and that takes a different architecture where everyone involved adapts to which one of the two that is currently desired.</p>



<p>The second is for <em>security</em>; the client IPC is a privilege boundary. Network access is yet another privilege boundary. Mixing multiple privilege boundaries within the same process practically merges the two into one in this case, greatly reducing security. <em>Even if</em> you have a separate network process, should all it is doing be proxy-patching packets, you gain very little <em>actual</em> protection. This is because your ‘network process’ is just yet another router or proxy on the way to the real parser in the privileged process, and the only primitive often needed (writing to a file-descriptor) is hard or impossible to ‘sandbox’. </p>



<p>The third is for resilience. Recall the lengths we have previously gone to in order to have<a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/12/24/crash-resilient-wayland-compositing/"> crash resilience</a>. There has been much more work done in that direction since the linked article, and one of the final stages is to make sure client state can gracefully survive GPU loss and, should the circumstances permit, machine loss. These things do not work cleanly as an after-thought – the consequences permeate everything.</p>



<h2 id="drawing">Drawing API</h2>



<p>The other feature left was the fabled <strong>drawing</strong> API – to which I would also consider font management — as that lies somewhere in the middle; fonts were already covered in the previous article as part of the section on ‘mixed-DPI’ drawing.</p>



<p>The thing is, Arcan <em>started</em> with a<a href="https://github.com/letoram/arcan/tree/master/doc"> drawing API</a> – initially for specifying interactive animated presentations, documents and some ehrm, darker things of which only beer and cocktails in shady bars might, briefly, bring back to the surface. The display server angle turned into a detour and necessary evil after certain actors could not ‘leave well-enough alone’.</p>



<p>Anyhow, the ‘animated presentations’ bit brought in all kinds of input devices, as well as audio and video. Video parsing and decoding is a finicky process at the best of times, and the typical libraries for this were obvious exploitation vectors. This meant that process separation with least-privilege was clearly needed. With that you get a realtime/media IPC system, so clean that up, add buttons and there is your basic display server.</p>



<p>As a side-note: Having a ‘drawing API’ on the consumer side is not hard per se and, in fact, is the strategy that won, with local raster being a distant fallback. If you want accelerated rendering through OpenGL or Vulkan, it ends up being command buffers (hey, draw commands!) sent to the GPU that will actually turn it into a signal and/or pixels – the drawing won’t happen in-process through the grace of “put pixel”. You could add non-accelerated drawing to Wayland with a one line addition to wl_shm defining a buffer format as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>, wouldn’t that be interesting 😉</p>



<p>J’accuse! – I hear you zoladats triumphantly proclaim. That is not for the clients to<strong> </strong>use now is it<strong>‽</strong>. So lwa-ts me explain the two sides to this story.  A longer version with charts and code and everything can be found in the article on <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/10/05/awk-for-realtime-multimedia/">AWK for Multimedia</a>.</p>



<p>The big bit about a drawing API is the level of abstraction it provides. If it is at the low level of  “putPixel()”, you lose —<em> the framebuffer is dead, long live the framebuffer</em>. If it is about “bind set of uniforms, buffers, gpu program and supply commands” you get what the high end graphics libraries already provide. The real challenge is finding the right set of mid-level functions that provide something more without getting morbidly obese to the scale of whatever flavour ‘absorb all’ UI toolkit that is in fashion these days; to understand how, where and when the JS/HTML5/CSS/… soup fail.</p>



<p>Thus, a network friendly, compact, mid-level drawing++ related API is the target. One that can be used out-of-process and as an “intermediate language” (think LLVM-IR) for higher level UI components or document interpreters to render to, while at the same time having the feature set expected of ‘web-app’ like targets.</p>



<p>The “++” represents the process control, audio and meta-IPC routing that is also necessary to cover the span of what is expected of ‘a desktop’. The processing of these commands translate to another intermediate layer, ‘AGP’ which is a simplified subset of OpenGL that was needed as a decoupling mechanism to eventually switch to-/provide- Vulkan and Software rasterisation. It aims at at a network friendly level at about the quality of DOOM3/WebGL, not great, but thereafter video compression starts to win out.</p>



<p>The following figure illustrates the different ways of running Arcan to cover all combinations of ‘drawing API’:</p>



<figure><a href="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png"><img data-attachment-id="8006" data-permalink="https://arcan-fe.com/execmodes-1/" data-orig-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png" data-orig-size="952,676" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="execmodes-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=640" src="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=952" alt="" srcset="https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png 952w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=150 150w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=300 300w, https://arcanfe.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/execmodes-1.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></a></figure>



<p>So Arcan can be a client to itself, although it is a separate binary (arcan_lwa –  (<strong>L</strong>ight<strong>w</strong>eight-<strong>a</strong>pplication) marked as ArcanLW in the figure.</p>



<p>ArcanLW will connect to Arcan ‘as a display server’ and act like a normal client. The side benefit here is that if you know how to write an app with the one, you can write or patch the window manager in the other. You get one API to control, manipulate or inspect all the routing for the entirety of your desktop. It privileges separates by design, it has been stable for years.</p>



<p>The last piece to this puzzle is to be able to provide RPC like access to this API. Here is why Lua matters more.</p>



<p>For those not in the know, exposing a C API to the Lua VM is about as simple as it gets and it fits other low level calling conventions; register the symbol name and function pointer of the function in the VM namespace; pop arguments from the stack based on the desired types; process; push the function return to the stack. </p>



<p>It can get more involved than this, but not by much. That actually doubles as a protocol decoder, thus it can be used as a decoupling mechanism. Define a bytecode and t<em>here is your \out of process\ drawing/WM API to bind to other languages.</em></p>



<h2 id="migration">Migration and Recovery</h2>



<p>While we did brush upon crash recovery in the previous post, as well as a <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/2017/12/24/crash-resilient-wayland-compositing/">previous article on the subject</a> – there is still a lot to it. Enough work has been done since to warrant yet another article.</p>



<p>People aware of some GTK history knows that it actually has the underused ability to jump between X Displays. The ‘underused’ part can probably be blamed on the, ehrm, ergonomics of spinning up and maintaining multiple X servers to jump between. Politely put, it was not for the faint of heart. </p>



<p>It is a good idea in principle, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em>Don’t forget to&nbsp;<a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/reinvent2020">throw in your email address</a>&nbsp;to get an executive summary in your inbox from ACG each day of re:Invent!</em></p><p>AWS, you sneaky devils.</p><p>Look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/faqs/">FAQ for EKS Anywhere</a>, announced yesterday for a 2021 launch, and you’ll find plenty of references to “on-premises”, bare metal compute, and VSphere. AWS’s stated rationale for expanding access to their managed Kubernetes service is all about hybrid cloud, which traditionally has meant “your old busted servers plus AWS’s shiny goodness.”</p><p>But wait … EKS Anywhere<em>? </em>Does that really mean <em>anywhere</em>?</p><p>Could it mean … Azure?</p><p>Lo and behold, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/aws-multicloud-era">Protocol has obtained confirmation</a> that EKS Anywhere (and technically ECS Anywhere, but let’s be real, if you want to run on multiple cloud providers you’re using Kubernetes) <strong>will support workloads running on Azure and GCP as well as private data centers</strong>. AWS is giving you a single pane of glass that will let you roll out config updates, instrument monitoring, and connect other app services to container workloads on your cloud of choice.</p><p>That’s right: AWS just rolled out a multi-cloud container management service.</p><p>You are now permitted thirty seconds to pick your jaw off the floor.</p><h2 id="h-what-does-aws-gain-from-doing-this">What does AWS gain from doing this?</h2><p>This marks … shall we say … a bit of a departure from AWS’s classic “one cloud to rule them all” rhetoric. After all, at various other times in Tuesday’s re:Invent keynote Andy Jassy unleashed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/babelfish/">a frontal assault on Microsoft SQL Server</a>, dunked gleefully on archnemesis-turned-punching-bag Oracle, and found GCP so unthreatening that he closed his presentation, without comment, on a song lyric that used “Google” as a verb.</p><p>And yet multi-cloud is here to stay, and Jassy knows it.</p><p>Check out my recent piece <a href="https://cloudirregular.substack.com/p/aws-hearts-multi-cloud-its-gonna">“AWS Hearts Multi-Cloud”</a> for a full analysis of why, but here’s the gist. <a href="https://cloudpundit.com/2020/09/18/the-multicloud-gelatinous-cube/"><strong>Multi-cloud is a gravitational inevitability for enterprises</strong></a>. ACG’s recent <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/a-cloud-guru-unveils-state-of-cloud-learning-report">State of Cloud Learning Report</a> found that while about 75% of cloud shops still use AWS as their primary cloud provider, the same 75% also have at least some workloads running on Azure or another cloud. Could be due to acquisition, service envy, bet-hedging, or simple lack of coordination – or all of the above. Reality is messy and getting more so.</p><p>AWS has a huge head start on the rest of the cloud industry, but 75% of people won’t think of AWS as their “primary” cloud provider forever. Not when there are so many best-of-breed services to choose from, both on other clouds and on focused SaaS providers like Snowflake and Datadog. And certainly not given that plenty of industries have active incentive to avoid deep integration with a cloud provider owned by Amazon.</p><p>So AWS has a limited window of opportunity to keep that central status in cloud teams’ hearts. Providing higher-level, cross-cloud management tools is the easiest way to do it. The other cloud providers certainly get this; Azure isn’t hamstrung by an inability to admit the validity of AWS workloads, and they’re rushing into the breach with tools like Arc and Sentinel.</p><h2 id="h-this-is-only-the-beginning">This is only the beginning</h2><p>Really, the amazing thing is that AWS spun the “Anywhere” releases so adroitly, and described them so diffusely, that it took a day to confirm that multi-cloud was really their intent. And they can’t keep playing both sides much longer. They need to signal to large customers that yes, they get that Azure isn’t going away, and they’ll provide the tools to continue deserving the status of <em>preferred </em>cloud provider even if they can’t be the <em>only </em>cloud provider.</p><p>If you think that’s a bridge too far, you haven’t been paying attention to what makes AWS tick. I closed my last multi-cloud piece by pointing out that AWS created ECS because they have great engineers; they sell EKS because they are smart. As long as they are willing to cannibalize their own offerings in pursuit of customer value, they will remain hard to beat.</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My ears are perking up at <a href="https://twitter.com/ajassy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ajassy</a>'s comments about working with third parties, not being afraid of cannibalizing yourself, etc … are we revving up to the announcement of AWS's much-ballyhooed multicloud play? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/reinvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#reinvent</a></p>— Forrest Brazeal @re:Invent 2020 (@forrestbrazeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1333806720993333250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Lo and behold, Jassy echoed the same themes in his keynote. And while he never used the word “multi-cloud” (not yet!), you can be sure that EKS Anywhere isn’t a one-off or an accident. It’s the first glimpse of a massive strategic shift. Because once you realize what yesterday’s emphasis on “hybrid, open-source” rhetoric really means, it’s clear that AWS’s multi-cloud play is just beginning.</p></div></div></div>]]>

				<p>Today is as big day for us as we're launching the entirely newly designed &amp; developed 1.0 version of CoScreen for macOS and our private beta for Windows. A big thanks goes out to the hundreds of users who have helped us to iterate over the first versions as part of our private beta over the last 6 months!</p><p><strong>Get CoScreen for free here: <a href="https://coscreen.co/">https://coscreen.co</a></strong></p><p>These early insights and our own internal usage of CoScreen have been instrumental to our code and design reviews, bug fixing, stand-ups, and feature development since the pandemic hit. Now we want more teams to benefit from CoScreen and are therefore offering CoScreen entirely for free for the next six months.</p><blockquote><em>"CoScreen makes coding, pairing and video chatting as easy as a single click while keeping all our existing dev tools."</em><br><strong>M<em>ichaël Ohayon, Development Manager at Publicis Sapient</em></strong></blockquote><h2 id="the-struggle-of-remote-engineering-teams">The struggle of remote engineering teams</h2><p>Today's video chat solutions are great if you enjoy awkward full-screen conversations, but are a productivity killer for development teams. The pandemic has turned endless, boring in-office meetings into endless, boring video calls. It’s also just too painful for engineering teams to wrangle with complex pull requests using a brittle string of tools like Zoom, Skype, Tmux, GNU screen, and a variety of IDEs.</p><h2 id="the-solution-coscreen"> The solution: CoScreen</h2><blockquote>"<em>I am full time pairing with a teammate, and CoScreen is the best pairing tool we’ve used so far.” </em><br><strong>Camille Neuner, Software Engineer at a large insurance provider</strong></blockquote><p>CoScreen is a desktop app that enables multiple users to share application windows with each other at the same time. You can think of it like a shared desktop where any user can interact with any shared window as if it were their own via remote mouse and keyboard to allow them to collaborate like never before (they can even copy and paste code across windows of different users).</p><p>In addition to built-in video chat, and remote control, we're also launching <a href="https://coscreen.co/slack">a Slack integration</a> so that you can embed CoScreen into your daily workflow. Integrations with VS Code and other IDEs will follow soon.</p><p>CoScreen enables pair/mob/team programming like no other solution and we believe it can reduce the <a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching">cost of context switching</a> by up to 80% so you can focus on what actually matters - reviewing code, troubleshooting bugs, or building major new features.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b7a7fd9f-bf5f-440a-9ec5-7b23b15644bf/Screen_Shot_2020-09-14_at_4.20.50_PM.png" srcset="https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 600w, https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 1000w, https://blog.coscreen.co/content/images/2020/09/CoScreen-SevenDegreesOfCollaboration.png 1323w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>CoScreen introduces the 7th degree of team interactivity through multi-user screen sharing &amp; remote control</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-coscreen-gives-your-more-control-and-keeps-you-save">How CoScreen gives your more control and keeps you save</h2><p>CoScreen uses P2P whenever you and a second participant can connect directly (e.g. when no corporate firewalls or proxies are between the two of you) so none of your window and control data touches our servers.</p><p>Otherwise, up to a dozen participants can collaborate using our enterprise-grade, HIPAA-compatible video infrastructure with hundreds of servers around the globe that run the awesome open-source framework <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a>. All video data is encrypted using DTLS-SRTP during transmission and in addition, we’re planning to support end-to-end encryption soon.</p><blockquote><em><em><em>“CoScreen makes developing and debugging mobile apps much easier as a team than any other tool we've tried”</em></em></em><br><em><em><em><strong>Kevin Zhang, Senior Software Engineer at Salesforce</strong></em></em></em></blockquote><p>With the help of UX experts who originally designed Slack, we've also created a new, minimalistic UI that never gets in your way. We're making our new macOS version publicly available today for free. The Windows alpha is already in final internal testing and you can sign up for early access for it and our future Linux and web clients.</p><h3 id="can-t-wait-see-for-yourself-how-coscreen-works-">Can’t wait? See for yourself how CoScreen works:</h3><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/054wVitjVJ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>We’ll keep sign-ups open as long as our infrastructure allows and we’re working hard to support other platforms, offer the best performance in terms of latency and quality (it's already much better than Zoom’s), and further reduce CPU and memory usage.</p><blockquote><em><em><em>"CoScreen has turned 'meetings' into 'doings.'"</em></em></em><br><em><em><em><strong>Brett Bertola, UX Engineer at InMoment</strong></em></em></em></blockquote><p>Thanks again to everyone who has supported us with feedback and advice. Get the latest release of CoScreen at https://coscreen.co and keep telling us what you think - via the built-in feedback feature in CoScreen or via e-mail to hello@coscreen.co!</p><p><em>Max, Jason, Till &amp; the entire CoScreen team</em></p>

Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>(Muhammed Abiodun / Unsplash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">published an open letter to Microsoft in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13497766/slack-microsoft-teams-new-york-times-ad">New York Times</a></em>, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/25/13405200/microsoft-teams-slack-competitor-launch">Microsoft’s launch of Teams</a>, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.</p><p>In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats">took Teams from zero to 115 million users</a>. </p><p>That disparity helps to explain why <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html">Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce</a>. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/salesforce-acquires-slack-salesforces-reasoning-salesforces-opportunity/">offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack</a>.)</p><p>But it also feels like the end of an era — one where workers gained new power to bring their own tools to the office, and decide for themselves how they wanted to get work done. Slack first succeeded with small teams who wanted to accelerate their work, and was often dragged into organizations by early adopters. But today, waves of consolidation are leaving people with fewer real choices.</p><p>The rise of smart phones in the early 2010s brought with it a new surge of workplace productivity tools that made mincemeat of everything that had come before them. Box and Dropbox brought easy file storage and sharing. Evernote introduced the idea of ubiquitous, cloud-synchronized note-taking. Sunrise created a more social calendar, while Mailbox and Acompli reimagined email for the mobile phone.</p><p>Slack tiptoed into the conversation in the middle of the decade, and almost immediately became the fastest-growing enterprise software tool of all time. In 2015, just 18 months after it launched, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8836087/slack-1-million-daily-users">Slack reported having more than 1 million daily users</a> —&nbsp;a figure then unheard-of in enterprise software.</p><p>It had a great backstory —&nbsp;a last-ditch pivot from a failed video game called Glitch —&nbsp;and, in Stewart Butterfield, one of the tech world’s most charming founders. It also had a bold pitch: it was going to “kill email” —&nbsp;or, at the very least, reduce your reliance on it. And it would do so by integrating hundreds of other services into real-time work chat, creating a kind of all-knowing command console for your organization.</p><p>The company embodied the belief, so common in Silicon Valley, that the best product would win in the end. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” the company wrote in its open letter to Microsoft. “How far you go in helping companies truly transform to take advantage of this shift in working is even more important than the individual software features you are duplicating.”</p><p>And yet if there’s a lesson of the past four years, it’s that thoughtfulness and craftsmanship only got the company about 10 percent as far as Microsoft did by copy-pasting Slack’s basic design. In its open letter, Slack famously told Microsoft: “You’ve got to do this with love.” In 2020, looking at Slack’s size, the idea seems laughable. What’s love got to do with it?</p><p>The thing is, I <em>hate</em> that this was the outcome for Slack. I love good productivity tools, and was rooting for Slack to someday become as good as the company hyped it up to be. (And perhaps it still will: like most giants Salesforce has a mixed track record when it comes to the success of its acquisitions, but some seem to be thriving. When I asked about this on Twitter, people had <a href="https://twitter.com/caseynewton/status/1333891286185644032?s=21">a lot of good things to say about post-acquisition Heroku</a>.)</p><p>But Slack’s struggle to succeed as an independent company sadly mirrors that of many one-time innovators in enterprise productivity. Mailbox died and Acompli sold to Microsoft, where it became the mobile Outlook app. Evernote is a pale shadow of its former self. Of that early cohort, only Box and Dropbox became — and still remain —&nbsp;public companies.</p><p>Why is this the case? To get some insight, I called up Aaron Levie, Box’s affable CEO. In Levie’s telling —&nbsp;and he also wrote <a href="https://blog.box.com/salesforce-slack-and-future-work">a blog post about the Slack sale</a> — it all comes down to sales. The idea that workers would someday choose all their own tools was always a fantasy, he told me, in part because most workers don’t event want to think about their tools. In such a world, the winning app will almost always be one with a giant, er, salesforce behind it. </p><p>Microsoft had one. Slack didn’t. Enter Salesforce.</p><p>“The reality with the enterprise is that you can have the best product, but that’s not good enough,” Levie told me. “You need distribution. And what Salesforce has — they have the procurement officers, they have the finance people. They have all of the apparatus you need to interact with to sell software, and they have it for the top 100,000 corporations around the world.”</p><p>Levie is bullish on the acquisition, because it puts Slack and Salesforce on more even ground. </p><p>“The only advantage Microsoft has is distribution, and so now they’ve neutralized the advantage that Microsoft has had,” he said. “All of a sudden, they can actually fulfill the ultimate promise of the opportunity, because they have 10 times the amount of salespeople that can go distribute this thing into corporations around the world.”</p><p>Assuming Levie is right — and I wouldn’t bet against him — that means the medium-term future of work is increasingly a choice between three giants: Microsoft, Salesforce, and (in a distant third) Google. And with that, the golden age of worker choice in productivity tools seems to be coming to an end.</p><p>That’s not to say that the incumbents won’t always face new challengers. But I wonder whether the low ceiling that Slack turned out to have has implications for some of the other fast-growing productivity companies of the current moment. Should Slack’s sale diminish our expectations for Airtable, or Notion, or Coda? Don’t get me wrong — I’m confident their investors will all get their money back, and then some. But do they have a real future outside the arms of a monolith?</p><p>If not, then the productivity market will become as consolidated as any number of other spaces on the internet, from app stores to search engines to social networks. And as our government antitrust regulators begin to awaken after a long period of hibernation, I wonder if they’ll have anything to say about it.</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies</em></p><p>⬆️ <strong>Trending up</strong>: <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">Google</a></strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-news-showcase-paywalled-stories/">’s new paid deals with publishers mean that access to some paywalled content will now be available to readers for free</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>When I started my first full-time job as a software engineer out of college, I frequently had discussions with my fellow new-hires about our technical adventures up to that point. At one point, two of them mentioned something called a “monad” and went back and forth about it for a few minutes. My first thought was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Monad?? What is a monad? Am I supposed to know what that is?!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember just nodding along as I had this conversation in my head. The first thing I did when I got back to my desk was search “What is a monad”, as any curious programmer would. I was greeted with a plethora of articles, all of which made me scratch my head after reading. I had to get back to work but I decided to bookmark a few more articles and continue later. Safe to say the proverbial can of worms was opened.</p>

<p>I fondly remember this moment as the beginning of my foray into functional programming (I had a grand total of 2-3 weeks of scheme in college so I don’t count that). Up until now I had primarily programmed in C/C++, Python, Javascript, and some Go. Somehow I had escaped the pull of functional programming languages until then, and I’ve been spending a lot of my free time learning functional programming paradigms since that moment. I wouldn’t dare try to explain what a monad is in my inaugural post on functional programming, but I do hope to explain a bit about why I’m so excited to learn more about functional programming and how I think it will help me as a software engineer.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-functional-language">What is a Functional language?</h3>

<p>A very small number of companies actually use functional languages in a professional capacity, so how could learning about them help me? To answer that I think it would help to agree on some of the central tenants of functional programming.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One of the core principles of functional languages that stuck with me right away is that you cannot mutate data once it has been created. Instead of directly mutating the data like you would in an imperative language like C++, you just make a fresh copy with the desired update. This is also referred to as stateless programming. One benefit of stateless programming is that you do not have to worry about multiple threads modifying the same data because each thread gets its own copy.</li>
  <li>Referential transparency essentially means that you can replace an expression with its result. So instead of <code>1+2</code> you could simply write <code>3</code>. That’s a trivial example, but where it becomes more interesting is with functions. With referential transparency you don’t have to worry about the function producing side effects or mutating some global state that affects other parts of the program. You can legitimately replace the function call (an expression) with its result and be done. Functions are also repeatable which means they don’t depend on external state themselves. Some other phrases thrown around when describing functional programming languages are “pure” and “no side effects”, and I think referential transparency encapsulates both of those. This contrasts with imperative languages because if I call a function <code>foo()</code> in C++, I have no way of knowing if it updated some global state! It’s not always true that I can replace <code>foo()</code> with it’s return value and expect the program to behave the same way.</li>
  <li>Another major characteristic of functional programming is the fact that functions are first order citizens. Many object-oriented languages have begun to add this to their feature set, but higher-order functions are rooted in functional programming. This means you can do things like pass functions into other functions, receive new functions as the result of a different function call, and create anonymous functions (also known as closures). When we create a closure, we create a function on the spot and capture some data that we’d like to use in the function. This is useful because we can then pass that closure (which is just a function) into other functions and it will always have the data it originally captured to perform its task. For example, these constructs allow a language to implement the <code>map</code> function, which applies a function <code>f</code> to each element in a collection - you can’t do that without sending <code>f</code> in as an argument to <code>map</code>. In this case <code>f</code> could be a function we’ve already defined or it could be a closure we just created with some extra data. This provides an incredible amount of flexibility that I’m only beginning to understand how to wield!</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list, these are just the main concepts I think about when it comes to functional programming. The more I program in functional languages, the more I am learning about the implications of each of these principles as well as other core tenants of functional programming. Later in this post I’ll highlight how even just a surface level exposure to these principles has positively impacted my day job.</p>

<h3 id="learning-a-functional-language">Learning a Functional Language</h3>

<p>After reading about functional programming and how great it is, I just had to try it out! There are plenty of languages to choose from, but I decided to go with Haskell mostly because it’s a pure functional language (as opposed to impure functional languages, which support imperative style programming). I figured if I’m going to start learning I might as well go with the “most” functional one. I’m still not sure if that was the best decision or not but I don’t think it matters very much!</p>

<p>The first thing I realized is that the learning curve is pretty steep. I started by going through <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a> and <a href="http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/index.html">What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell</a>, among others. After getting through the basics, I started to get a little overwhelmed. I knew this was going to be different and I was excited for that, but I was utterly shocked at how many words I was reading for the first time! In my <a href="https://bitsbybrad.com/2020-09-29-learning-rust/">last post</a> I wrote briefly about how I learned Rust. I think part of the reason I was so shocked is because I was able to feel comfortable in Rust quickly. It has a similar syntax to C++ and other imperative languages I have used so it was not a huge adjustment. Additionally, there were only a few genuinely new concepts that I had not heard of before. Contrast this to Haskell where I felt like there were only a few concepts that I <em>did</em> recognize. I (naively) was not expecting that after ~6 years of programming, but hey that’s why I fell in love with coding in the first place!</p>

<p>Despite my struggles, I continued to read and write Haskell code. I firmly believe that learning new ways to solve the same problem can open your eyes and give you fresh perspectives which generally improve your problem solving abilities. I experienced this when learning Rust, and even though I am starting from scratch when it comes to functional programming and Haskell I have already noticed how it influences the way I write C++ code.</p>
<ul>
  <li>After spending just a brief amount of time coding in Haskell, I now know what it feels like to truly have no global state. Now, C++ obviously doesn’t enforce these rules like Haskell does, but having that experience has encouraged me to incorporate it into the way I write C++. Instead of a class method using a member variable to manipulate state, I may try to create a struct for inputs and a struct for outputs so each function call is acting on a separate piece of data. This allows me to run the code in parallel much more confidently. This is a huge plus for me since I deal with a lot of multithreaded code!</li>
  <li>I also have a new-found appreciation for const-correctness due to having truly immutable data in Haskell. It’s very helpful to think about whether or not you expect data to be modified in each C++ function and mark it as <code>const</code> accordingly. It’s not always obvious when variables are modified, so it’s much better to put that burden on the compiler.</li>
</ul>

<p>Granted, these may be habits I’d learn to gravitate towards anyway as I write more C++ code, but using a language that places such a strong emphasis on core tenants such as immutable data was a strong motivator to start incorporating them myself.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-catch">What’s the catch?</h3>

<p>After being introduced to functional programming, it seemed to be some sort of silver bullet that should be used for everything. I started asking myself a question that you’re probably wondering right now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If functional programming is so great, why doesn’t everyone use it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with anything, there are trade offs. For instance, in the example above when I mentioned creating input/output structs instead of using class member variables to pass between functions, I’m trading conciseness and a stronger thread-safety guarantee for space. If my function inputs or outputs are very large, it may be too costly to create fresh copies of the data structure on each invocation of the function based on the time and space constraints.</p>

<p>The main issue is that it’s impossible to do anything of value without having <em>some</em> side effects. Printing to the console, reading/writing to a socket, and creating a file are all forms of side effects. It seems to me that there is a sweet spot between a fully pure language and a language that can handle side effects, and therefore produce business value. Perhaps that sweet spot has not yet been found by many companies, which could explain why functional programming has not yet gained a foothold in the corporate world.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Despite the drawbacks outlined above, I’m optimistic about functional programming, and I think it’s only going to become more relevant. I’m excited to “start from scratch” with something brand new. Reading Greg Michaelson’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831">Introduction to Functional Programming through Lambda Calculus</a> and Bartosz Milewski’s <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/">Category Theory For Programmers</a> are providing plenty of difficult, new topics to think about while I program. It’s going to take a while to feel comfortable but I hope to write about more specific topics in the future and how they make me a better programmer. Thanks for reading!</p>

We’ll see here what that is and how it works but I promise it helps.</p><p>I recently introduced this idea at <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> where I’ve been working for almost 5 years now and I thought it’d be cool to share it publicly here as well.</p><h2 id="the-endless-cycle-of-software-development">The (endless) cycle of software development</h2><pre><code>1. Work on a new feature
2. Fix bug(s)
3. Go back to 1.
</code></pre><p>Sometimes you might focus on only developing new features or only fixing bugs but those are the biggest chunks of your work if you’re building software.</p><p>I think we focus a lot on the how to develop more effectively new features: using the latest framework, text editor or IDE, a new programming paradigm, etc. and when we build something new again, we try to apply the things we’ve learnt and improve.</p><p>On the other hand, when we fix a bug, we tend to do it as quick as possible and then move on to something else, almost like it didn’t happen in the first place. Very few people spend any time trying to learn new debugging techniques instead of learning the latest framework that came out.</p><p>If we spent more time reflecting on those errors, learning from them and understanding where they came from we could improve a lot.</p><h2 id="documenting-a-personal-mistake">Documenting a personal mistake</h2><p>I’ve started to document those bugs, only the ones where I was the only engineer who did it so I can totally understand the context and reflect on what I personally did.</p><p>There are many different ways to do this, but I thought it’d be cool to have one place where I can gather all of them and search in the future for references and patterns. I don’t know if the term already exist but I called it the “bug log”. 🤷‍♂️ 😅</p><h2 id="what-s-a-bug-log">What’s a bug log?</h2><p>A bug log is a collection of your past introduced bugs with different sections for each bug:</p><ul><li>The context where the bug was introduced and what you were trying to achieve (fixing another bug, adding a new feature, etc).</li><li>Why the bug happened. What was wrong in production that made you realize that there was a bug.</li><li>How you fixed it.</li><li>The lesson you learned afterwards. A summary of what you’ve learned in the process.</li></ul><p>These sections are the ones that work for me, but feel free to adapt them to your needs if you want to start a bug log.</p><h2 id="an-example-of-an-entry-in-the-bug-log">An example of an entry in the bug log</h2><div><pre><code data-lang="md"><span># Context

For example, a parser that compares the env. variables used in a new pull request with the ones that are in production.</p><h2 id="where-do-i-store-the-bug-log">Where do I store the bug log?</h2><p>I’ve become a big fan of <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a> and I’ve added it there so other team members can see it but it could be anywhere, any note-taking app or even a Github repo with some markdown files could work.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-with-the-lesson-learned-sections">What to do with the “lesson learned” sections?</h2><p>Something I’ve realized is that by summarizing in one sentence the bug I introduced and why I can easily reflect and learn the lesson. I’ve taken one extra step to not forget it for the future so I use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a>, a solution for reviewing cards from time to time, helping you learn what’s in the card.</p><p>I used it before for other purposes but I created a new collection for this. What I do is creating a card whose front is the situation I faced when I introduced the bug and the back is the lesson learned. For example, here it’d be:</p><pre><code>Front
--------
What should I do when I use an environment variable in the code?

Back
--------
Check by doing X/Y if it's set in the right environments.
</code></pre><p>Here’s how it looks in Anki:</p><p><img src="https://josemdev.com/images/anki-bug-log.png" alt="Anki Bug Log" title="Anki Bug Log"></p><p>This will reinforce my learning and it’s easier that I remember it in the future. It can also include some code samples so you associated the situation to new code that you’ll be modifying in the future.</p><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> and how it can help you improve as an engineer so I’ll write an article about it soon.</p><p>The other thing I do is before filling a new entry, I can try to search in the log something similar. Sometimes that helps me understand if I tend to make the same kind of mistakes.</p><p><br>I hope this was useful to you! Do you have any thoughts or feedback?

<p>Similar to last year, summer is always slow moving and with the added Covid, the team had to focus on work/family even more.</p>

<p>Nikos had 2 weeks of vacation, the first vacation he had in the last 5 years. well deserved, and really nice to spend time with the family. Ruud and Serghei also had vacations and Anton is getting ready for some time off.</p>

<h3 id="team-changes">Team changes</h3>
<p>Serghei is stepping down and cannot commit time to the project. He needs to concentrate on work and family of course. He was very nice to tell us that he will no longer be able to help - not fooling anyone or offering promises that he might not be able to keep.</p>

<p>A huge thank you to Serghei. He has learned C/Zephir on his own, trying to help the project as much as possible. He maintained both Phalcon and Zephir during the v3 latter versions, up until the end of 2018, when Nikos stepped up to help with Phalcon.</p>

<p>The team remains dedicated for the project as time permits.</p>

<h3 id="zephir">Zephir</h3>
<p>Now that Serghei has stepped down, we have an issue with Zephir. We no longer have any active maintainers for the project to assume the lead and help with development/bugs etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://zephir-lang.com/">Zephir</a> was invented to help with contributions for Phalcon - a much simpler language, similar to JS/PHP, that anyone can learn easily and contribute. Unfortunately, the language did not gain popularity, and therefore not many people wanted to contribute. The language became stagnant and difficult to maintain. A lot of bugs were discovered and ended up being very difficult to fix unless the whole language was redesigned.</p>

<p>With no other options available, we will put active development of Zephir on hold, and we do not expect it to be compatible with PHP 8. Maintainers are always welcome to step up and help with Zephir.</p>

<h3 id="phalcon">Phalcon</h3>

<p>Without Zephir we are not going to be able to properly maintain and enhance Phalcon. This leaves us with two options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>abandon Phalcon or</li>
  <li>take the brave step to move forward by switching to native PHP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The team decided to switch to native PHP for Phalcon 5. We will try to support Phalcon 4 as much as possible and try to release Phalcon 4.1. We will use our funds to fix some critical Zephir issues that are blocking Phalcon.</p>

<h3 id="phalcon-5">Phalcon 5</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pure PHP implementation</li>
  <li>Installable as <code>composer</code> package</li>
  <li>Backwards compatible as much as possible (it will depend on how easy we can translate the current C parsers for Volt, PHQL and Annotations)</li>
  <li>Support PHP 7.4 + PHP 8 (Currently in Beta)</li>
  <li>Phalcon goals and philosophy remain unchanged (performance, low overhead, ease of use)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/niden/cardoe">Cardoe</a> (side project by <a href="https://github.com/niden">niden</a> can be used as starting point</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pmjones/adr">ADR</a> (Action Domain Responder) pattern as scheduled around v4</li>
  <li>Will aim for 100% code coverage and tests</li>
  <li>Opens up the possibility for async (future)</li>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This is not a decision we wanted to make but we have to be realists. We cannot abandon the community and we do believe that Phalcon is a great project that adds value to the PHP community.</p>

<p>Although we will lose some of the performance that we had been accustomed to by using Phalcon, PHP 7 and (hopefully) PHP 8 managed to bridge the performance gap that we saw when using PHP 5.x and Phalcon.</p>

<p>Our main focus will always be to keep the framework as fast as possible. By switching to PHP, the community can now be more actively involved with the project and also help with addons, incubator and much more.</p>

<p>Thank you to all and looking forward to the new challenges that v5 will present us with.</p>

                    <p>This guide describes how Microconfig can help you solve common microservice configuration
                        problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>More details you can find in <a href="https://microconfig.io/documentation.html">Docs</a>. </p>

                    <section id="layout">
                        <h2>Simple Configuration Layout</h2>

                        <div>
                            <div>
                                <div>
                                    <h4>Problem</h4>

                                    <p>Other configuration frameworks can demand a specific configuration folder
                                        structure or specific filenames.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <h4>Solution</h4>

                                    <p>Microconfig only asks you to create folders for your services somewhere in
                                        <code>components</code> folder. You choose the names and folder structure. If
                                        you have different types of configuration just place them in the same service
                                        folder.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <pre><code>
                        components
                        ├── payments

                    <section id="include">
                        <h2>Reuse Common Parts</h2>

                        <div>
                            <div>
                                <div>
                                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                                    <p>Microservices have a lot of shared configuration parts that is copy-pasted
                                        between them. So you need to go through all services one by one to update this
                                        shared part.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                <div>
                                    <h4>Solution</h4>

                                    <p>Microconfig allows you to extract common parts of configuration to a dedicated
                                        component and reuse it with <code>#include</code>. This way service config is
                                        more focused on unique parts and all common parts are just included. In this
                                        case if
                                        you need to update your common part you just do it in one place and everyone
                                        gets
                                        this update via <code>#include</code>.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                        <h2>Reference Values</h2>

                                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                                    <p>Different services can depend on each other's configuration keys. For example
                                        frontend needs backend's api base path. You can just keep this value in two
                                        places but in this case you need to remember about this dependency and update
                                        them
                                        both.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                                    <p>Microconfig can reference a value from current or another component with a
                                        <code>${placeholder}</code>. This allows you to keep values only in original
                                        services and all who depend on them can just have an explicit reference. In this
                                        case you need to update the value only once.
                                    </p>

	<div>
		<p>Imagine you are building your dream house. Would you trust a general contractor who talks like this?</p>
<blockquote><p>First, we’re going to pick out the material for the kitchen counter and the glass for the windows. Let’s just guess the amounts of each to buy for now.</p>
<p>Then we’ve got to buy some of that new concrete everyone’s been talking about. I suppose a truckload will do it for now, but we could always order more later. I just can’t wait to try it out!</p>
<p>After putting the beams in place we should decide how many floors the house should have. And right at the end we should decide what style the house will be. Sometime before you move in we should get planning permission, and I’ll probably contact an architect for some drawings after you’ve settled in.</p></blockquote>
<p>It sounds ludicrous because there’s a well-established method for building houses, and it’s based on common sense. You start with a vision, get a set of plans, pour a foundation, build the framework, fill in the internal stuff, and finally finish all the little details.</p>
<p>Putting any step out of order would cause complete chaos. Finishing the walls before the electrical would mean you’d have to punch holes in all your walls in order to run wires around the house. Cleaning it before it is completely finished would be a wasted effort given the amount of dust builders cause while they work.</p>
<p>However many coders <strong>build their systems backwards</strong>. They become enamored with the latest whizz-bang framework or charmed by the reportedly speedy performance of the newest database. And they lead their thinking with those choices as they build new features, whether those technologies are appropriate or not.</p>
<p>More importantly, using a technology-first design typically means that the user experience (UX) will be left until last. And if you put your users last in your order of priorities, it will unfortunately be very evident in your system’s lack of usability.</p>
<h3>UX First</h3>
<p>The first order of business in application design is deciding what its users will experience. This should be a high-level vision sketched out on paper or in simple digital mockups, and it should express the flow of the system from the user’s perspective.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re building a web application for senior citizens or a system-level tool for serious computing nerds. <strong>The UX must be designed first.</strong></p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Then Comes The Architecture</h3>
<p>Once the UX has been designed and the vision of the system has been defined, an architecture should be laid out to make sure that the code that eventually gets written will actually meet the needs of the users. The choices made in the UX design radically shape and inform a system’s architecture.</p>
<p>A good UX design will cater for less obvious things that might be part of the overall user experience. A well-written specification might include requirements such as “the overall load time for page loads must be less than 200 msec” because the designers know the consequences of <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">slow page load speeds</a>. It might also call for close-to-zero downtime, so the architecture might end up requiring a <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/cloud-computing/infrastructure/amazon-outage-multiple-zones-a-smart-str/240009598">multi-datacenter deployment</a>.</p>
<h3>Last But Not Least, The Tools</h3>
<p>Now it’s finally playtime! Once the UX has been defined and the architecture has been laid out, the process of picking the right technologies, frameworks and libraries can begin. The crucial point is that now the tools are being chosen with the UX and architecture in mind, so any tool that doesn’t fulfill the needs of either can be quickly disregarded.</p>
<h3>This Does Not Mean “Waterfall”</h3>
<p>If you think that this design sequence requires an outdated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall-like</a> approach to accommodate it, think again! This is completely appropriate for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> development. The implementation of a whole new product, an <a href="http://agile101.net/2009/08/10/the-difference-between-agile-themes-epics-and-user-stories/">epic</a> or even a single user story should follow the UX -&gt; architecture -&gt; tools sequence. When beginning the development of a product or epic,&nbsp;<a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/06/design-spikes-fit-big-picture-ux-agile-development/">spikes</a> should be used to design the UX and the architecture. And individual user stories should include enough details for the engineer to know what the UX for that story should be once it is fully implemented, and the engineer should also estimate enough points to cater for architectural planning to be done once work on that story begins.</p>
<p>Tools are great fun to research and to experiment with. Programmers love discovering new ones and finding “The Next Big Thing” in the framework jungle, and having lots of tools at your disposal is wonderful when the time comes to build a system that satisfies the UX and the architecture. Just don’t begin the entire design process with them. So remember: UX first, then architecture, then tools.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>I've recently read a <a href="https://www.usehaystack.io/blog/we-cancelled-standups-and-let-the-team-build-heres-what-happened">rather popular blog post</a> about cancelling stand-ups and how it affected team's productivity. While I find the topic extremely interesting and I like experimenting with changing processes, the post lacked some long-term conclusion (hopefully a 2nd part is coming in a few months!). I thought I could share my experience with making stand-ups shorter and more effective. I do not have any hard numbers to show, what I have is experience and some rough estimations from 3 companies I worked with where I participated in daily stand-ups.</p><h2 id="15-minutes-or-1-hour">15 minutes or 1 hour?</h2><p>In the 1st company, I was a new employee and I had little say about team processes, so I followed the by-the-book style that the team implemented.</p><p>Every morning I arrived at work around 9:30am, I grabbed a cup of coffee, and in 5-10 minutes I was at my desk ready to work. However, at 10am I had a stand-up, so I spent the 20min I had on replying to e-mails and chatting with my coworkers.</p><p>Stand-up was in a separate room, where the whole team met at 9:55am so that we could connect with a few people who worked in another office. Ignoring random audio/video problems, we usually wrapped things up in 20 minutes, with occasional 10min follow-up after the call. Sometimes discussion took a bit longer, but usually I was back at my desk by 10:30am, an hour after coming to work.</p><p>I guess this is not exactly how stand-up looks like in your "Scrum for beginners" manual, but that's how it worked in practice, and trust me, that company is not an outlier. It worked quite well for some people, especially those who came to work just before 10am, while I found the lost hour a bit frustrating. I tried to change it, but everyone else felt ok with the way things were, so we kept it the way it was.</p><p>The total time I spent on stand-ups was around 30min a day, so 2.5h a week (5h if counting the 30min a day that were kind of wasted, but who knows, maybe I would be wasting them anyway).</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/bartosz-kwitkowski-OJ9E5C-hFJQ-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="how-to-scale-a-stand-up">How to scale a stand-up?</h2><p>In the 2nd company I was a team lead and we had a classic, quick stand-up. Next to our desks, all people standing in a circle, one by one saying what they did, what they are doing and what's blocking them. Anything to discuss? Do it in smaller groups right after the stand-up. It usually took 1min per person, 10, maximum 15min in total.</p><p>This was going well for a while, but over time it became more difficult to manage. First, as we were approaching 15 developers and we split into 2 teams, we needed a way to split the stand-ups as well, but how to do it when we all sit together? First goes one group and then another? That felt awkward, as did having everyone go to a meeting room for 10 minutes.</p><p>The 2nd challenge was that we expanded our team to a new office in another country. One of the things I wanted to prevent was separating all work and rituals by location - this alienates people working from new office and makes them feel less attached to the company. We considered having a call every morning, with 2 groups standing in front of the camera in their respective offices. It's not a bad solution, but having experienced it in the past I knew how awkward it feels, and how making sure the connection works can take longer than the meeting itself.</p><h2 id="good-morning-yesterday-i-">Good morning! Yesterday I...</h2><p>So what we did was to remove stand-ups. Or rather, we removed stand-up as a meeting, while keeping the update part. We moved it to Slack, so that every morning, every team member was supposed to write a short message when they started working. A short "good morning team!" followed by 3 bullet points. This provided a few benefits:</p><ul><li>scaling - each team has their own channel where they write the message</li><li>persistence - messages stay on Slack, so it's always easy to get back to something that I was supposed to follow-up on. Also, it made it possible to add links to tasks or documentation, and discussing any blockers was easy - just reply to the update message</li><li>flexibility - you come to work, you sit down, you check what you've got to do today and you write "Good morning everyone! Here's my update...". It's the first thing you do, and then you can start working. It takes 2-3 minutes and you don't need to wait for anyone. You can read other updates later when everyone's in, and if someone needs your help, they'll tag you.</li></ul><p>So in this case we didn't really save any significant amount of time (not that there was a lot of time to save in the first place). Writing and reading all the messages could even take a bit more than before. But we got a lot in exchange - and we never looked back.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/rizal-hilman-VbTcrQ-H8aE-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="rinse-repeat">Rinse, repeat</h2><p>This experience helped me in the 3rd company. When I joined it, stand-ups were happening over a call (around half of the team was remote) and usually took around 30-40 minutes. Yes, you're right, that's way too long. 30-40 minutes * 5 days means 2.5-3 hours a week spent by every team member on what's supposed to be a quick update.</p><p>I quickly realized the issue was that while a few people had short and concise updates, others were taking their time and often started longer discussions. I took various attempts to change it - tried to limit stand-up time to 15 minutes, reminding people to discuss other topics after the call in smaller group, etc. but I was not satisfied with the results. Finally I got a small win - we introduced Fridays without meetings and that meant no stand-up either. In order to stay in touch about the progress and blockers, we decided to just write updates on chat. What started as once a week initiative, after a couple of weeks turned into a daily practice, we moved to entirely asynchronous stand-ups and again we never looked back.</p><p>As I have mentioned before, the amount of time we saved was around 3 hours per person every week. For me, this was huge!</p><h2 id="not-perfect">Not perfect</h2><p>One thing I'm really happy about is that in both cases where I managed to introduce the change, after a while it gained essentially unanimous support - everyone told me they preferred the asynchronous updates.</p><p>There are a few aspects though in which this idea could be improved, and a few in which it will always be worse than a classic meeting. Seeing and hearing your peers is something that can't be replaced. Reading messages removes that human touch, it strips us of things that make us feel that we're talking to real people. In my case this wasn't a big issue as we had enough other calls each week anyway not to miss each other, but it might not be the case in every company.</p><p>Missing messages is another challenge - if you come to work first and write your message, then you need to make sure that later you read messages by other people who start work later. If people don't do that, then what's even the point of sending updates? I struggled a bit to follow all messages everyday, something that didn't happen during classic stand-up. This problem can be solved with a dedicated tool that will remind you to send a message each morning, and will compile all updates into one longer message when all team members provide their updates. Alternatively you can set a reminder to read all the messages at some point during day, when you expect them all to be there.</p><figure><img src="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.notonlycode.org/content/images/2020/11/fred-kearney-saJ060B-sz4-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="throw-out-the-book">Throw out the book</h2><p>One of the most common problems I have when trying to improve processes are people who specialize in certain system or methodology (often certified in it), who tell me that's not how things should be done. Whether they're fans of Kanban, Scrum or something else, I often hear "we should not do it, this is against Scrum guides".</p><p>I believe such attitude is against the principles of good team work. Whenever something doesn't work, I try to change it. If it gets better, I keep the good parts and keep improving. If it gets worse, I learn the lesson and change the direction.</p><p>Me and my teams in the past changed the daily stand-ups, because they didn't work for us. We wanted to stay updated, so we kept that part, and we improved the rest. I don't know if that's going to work in your team too, maybe not - only you can try it out and see if your team likes it. So go ahead, keep the good parts, throw out the rest of the book, try to make your way of work better. Good luck!</p><p>Comments and discussion: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25288137">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25288137</a></p><h2 id="credits">Credits</h2><p>Burning book photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@fredasem?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Fred Kearney</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/book-burn?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Paddleboard photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@kowalikus?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Krzysztof Kowalik</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/stand-up?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Scale photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@smee?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Bartosz Kwitkowski</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/scale?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Hand washing photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rzhilman?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Rizal Hilman</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hand-wash?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>We are delighted to offer this&nbsp;comprehensive guide to email deliverability, Having&nbsp;spent time building a targeted email list, and your creative team has drafted some awesome emails. The problem then is&nbsp;email deliverability. So this guide is designed to overcome all the problems which inhibit that..</p>
<p>If an email ends up in the junk folder, then did it ever even exist? For your customer, the answer is no. But don’t worry.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’re going to deep dive into <strong>email deliverability</strong>. And we’re going to show you how to <strong>keep your emails away from the dreaded spam folder.</strong></p>
<p>Ready to up your open rate and get more clicks to your website? Let’s get started.</p>
<p>So, what do you need to be doing to <strong>boost your email deliverability?</strong></p>
<p>First, the facts:</p>
<h2 id="what-is"><strong>What is Email Deliverability?</strong></h2>
<p><em>Email Deliverability</em> is the set of processes responsible for <strong>placing an email into your client’s inbox.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inbox placement and delivery</strong> is a complex subject. Many factors are taken into account by mailbox providers before placing an email into your subscribers’ inbox.</p>
<h2 id="email-reputation-impacts-deliverability"><strong>Part 1: How Email Reputation Impacts Email Deliverability</strong></h2>
<p>When you send an email campaign, <strong>mailbox providers run an initial set of vetting checks.</strong></p>
<p>These are known as<strong> reputation checks</strong>.</p>
<p>And they are a bit like credit checks for email, affected by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sender reputation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Server / IP reputation</strong> used to dispatch the email</li>
<li><strong>Domain reputation</strong> of links in the content</li>
<li><strong>Email engagement metrics</strong> including bounce and spam complaint rates for your sender, domain, and server</li>
</ul>
<p>Reputation checks are one of the most essential factors of <strong>inbox placement.</strong></p>
<p>A bad reputation will see your inbox placement and open rates tank.</p>
<p>Let’s look at all the factors that are bound to <strong>email delivery reputation. </strong></p>
<p>We’ll start with your sender reputation.</p>
<h3><strong>What is Sender Reputation?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Sender reputation is the reputation of the email address</strong> you are using to send out your email campaigns.</p>
<p>Usually, your sender reputation is calculated on <strong>a scale of 0 to 100 to give you your&nbsp;</strong><strong>sender score.</strong></p>
<p>But how exactly does sender reputation work? What factors increase or decrease your sender reputation?</p>
<div>
<p>Email Deliverability goes hand in hand with sender reputation. Here are five factors positively influencing sender reputation: consistent volume of email campaigns per week, few bounces, fewer complaints, no spam traps, no blacklists.</p>

</div>
<h3><strong>1. Be Consistent with Your Volume</strong></h3>
<p><em>Try to distribute your email marketing campaigns evenly.</em></p>
<p>A <strong>consistent volume of email campaigns</strong>, without major drops or spikes, plays a significant role in sender reputation.</p>
<p>For example, if you send out an email to your list twice a week, switching to three times a week will cause ripples.</p>
<p>There will be times when you will want to send out more emails than usual.</p>
<p>For example, over the busy Christmas period. But aim for a regular, consistent schedule where possible.</p>
<p>Your list will soon get to know your schedule, which will help you <strong>increase open rates and click-throughs.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>2. Keep Your Lists Clean to Crush Bounce Rate</strong></h3>
<p><em>Clean your lists.</em></p>
<p>At Moosend, we use <a href="https://neverbounce.com/">NeverBounce</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.datavalidation.com/">Data Validation</a>, <a href="https://www.emaillistverify.com/">Email List Verify</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Some other notable alternatives are <a href="https://www.zerobounce.net/">ZeroBounce</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://myemailverifier.com/">MyEmailVerifier</a>, <a href="https://debounce.io/">Debounce</a>, and <a href="https://clearout.io/">Clearout</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.moosend.com/hc/en-us/articles/211743305-Top-3-reasons-your-emails-could-Bounce">Bounces</a> are emails that fail to reach the subscriber<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Notwithstanding their impact on <strong>future email deliverability</strong>, they are a waste of resources.</p>
<p>There are two types of bounce,<strong> soft and hard bounce.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>What is Hard Bounce?</strong></h4>
<p>A hard bounce happens when you <strong>send a message to a mailbox that doesn’t exist. </strong></p>
<p>Perhaps someone used a fake email to sign up to your subscriber list, or have changed email providers.</p>
<p>Either way, you don’t want those email addresses on your list.</p>
<h4><strong>What is Soft Bounce?</strong></h4>
<p>A soft bounce occurs when you send to a:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mailbox that is full</strong></li>
<li><strong>recipient with an auto-reply / out-of-office message</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably don’t want to remove these email addresses from your subscriber list.</p>
<p>Usually, this will be a temporary issue. But if your messages are consistently bouncing, you might want to reconsider.</p>
<p>Mailbox providers, such as Gmail, monitor the bounce messages. They then return undelivered emails to the email service provider.</p>
<p>A high <a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/bounce-rate">bounce rate</a> implies a poor list hygiene process.</p>
<p>That could mean a list that is <strong>not contacted frequently or is purchased.</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, you need an&nbsp;<a href="https://snov.io/blog/how-to-check-if-an-email-address-is-100-valid-or-not/">email verifier</a> to check the email addresses and be 100% sure that they are valid.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Spam Complaints = Death for Your List</strong></h3>
<p>When your subscribers hit the dreaded “Mark as spam” button, mailbox providers like Gmail and ESPs receive a notification.</p>
<p>The bad news?</p>
<p>Mailbox providers automatically block even senders with a small number of complaints.</p>
<p>It’s for this reason that we strongly<strong> discourage the use of purchased lists </strong>as they will see your spam complaints rocket.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Steer Clear οf Spam Traps</strong></h3>
<p><em>What’s a spam trap?</em></p>
<p>It’s a fake email address that looks real, but it isn’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerobounce.net/spam-traps.html">Spam traps</a> are set by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and blacklist providers to catch unscrupulous email marketers who have been harvesting emails.</p>
<p>They’re like honeypots that are published in a hidden location on the web.</p>
<p>When spammers collect email addresses through harvester programs or purchased email lists, these fake email addresses often make it onto their lists.</p>
<p>Sending even a tiny amount of emails to those email addresses <strong>automatically marks the sender as a spammer. </strong></p>
<p>It’s clear that they built their list unnaturally.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Whatever You Do, Don’t Get Blacklisted!</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.swifterm.com/how-to-avoid-spam-filters/">Blacklists</a> are lists of sender domains (e.g. yourdomain.com) and servers or IP addresses that have been caught sending email spam.</p>
<p>Send an email from a blacklisted server or domain, and the chances are it will land in junk (or not at all).</p>
<p>There are<strong> over 100 blacklists for different purpose</strong>s, and you need to stay off of every single one of them.</p>

<h4><strong>What Gets You Blacklisted?</strong></h4>
<p>Falling foul of any of points 1-4 above.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you get blacklisted once, there’s a strong chance you will be able to <strong>de-list your site/server.</strong></p>
<p>Repeat offenders, though, will have more trouble getting off the blacklist. To avoid that, SwiftERM continuously monitors blacklists to keep users safe.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx">MX toolbox</a> to check if your server or domain is blacklisted.</p>

<p>As you’ve probably gathered by now,<strong> email deliverability is a complex topic</strong>. But it’s also an evolving one.</p>
<p>Spammers are always looking for new loopholes and tricks. New ways to abuse your email inbox.</p>
<p>On the flip side, mailbox providers like Gmail are catching up in keeping spam messages low, or out of sight altogether.</p>
<p>But now, let’s look at a tactic that has been used by spammers for years: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/spoofing/">email sender spoofing</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>How Spammers Use Email Sender Spoofing</strong></h4>
<p>Sending an email on behalf of someone like <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b2dfd3c0d9f2cbddc7c0d6dddfd3dbdc9cd1dddf">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> is easy. Change a few header values, and the ISP will think that Mark is trying to send out a message.</p>
<p>With email spoofing, <strong>spammers can easily impersonate your brand’s email</strong> and send campaigns on your behalf. Right?</p>
<p>Well, fortunately, it’s not quite as simple as that. And <strong>mailbox providers are getting better at catching this type of spam.</strong></p>
<p>Most providers – certainly all major ones – will <strong>perform an ID check</strong> when receiving a new email.</p>
<h4><strong>Here’s How It Works</strong></h4>
<p>A mailbox provider receives an email from an address (say <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="c0ada1b2ab80b9afb5b2a4afada1a9aeeea3afad">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>provider checks the IP address</strong> where the message originated.</li>
<li>Then, they <strong>check to see if that IP address has permission to send emails&nbsp;</strong>on behalf of yourdomain.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called <strong>authentication</strong>. But let’s clarify something:</p>
<p><strong>Sending emails on behalf of another address is not necessarily a bad thing.</strong></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because this is precisely what all email service providers (ESPs) do to deliver the campaigns you design and send.</p>
<p>After all, you want to be sending emails from your <a href="https://get.store/blog/find-retail-business-domain-name/">branded domain</a>.</p>
<p>Setting up authentication in your email marketing service of choice is highly recommended. It will hint to Hotmail, Gmail, and all other providers that you have given consent to send emails on your behalf.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to set up email authentication: <strong>SPF and DKIM.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at them</p>
<p>SPF and DKIM are an item. In fact, they are complementary. What SPF lacks in ownership authentication, DKIM, makes up for it in email validation.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Use SPF To Verify Your Sender IP</strong></h3>
<p><em>Setting up your SPF records is essential.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://dmarcian.com/what-is-spf/">SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</a> is an email validation system designed to <strong>prevent spam by verifying the sender’s IP address.</strong></p>
<p>An SPF record allows web administrators to <strong>designate which web hosts are authorized</strong> to send messages from a given domain.</p>
<p>So how does this work?</p>
<p>When an SPF record is added to your website’s DNS, servers use it to <strong>verify that you are allowed to send emails from <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="b2cbddc7c0dcd3dfd7f2cbddc7c0d6dddfd3dbdc9cd1dddf9c">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></strong></p>
<p>Simply put, <strong>SPF says you are the owner of the domain </strong>and are allowed to contact people using this domain name.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Use DKIM to Verify Ownership of an Email Message</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.mailtrap.io/dkim/">DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</a> <strong>indicates ownership of the email message</strong> by a particular organization.</p>
<p>While the message is still in transit to the recipient, the organization’s<strong> signature </strong>is added to the email headers.</p>
<p>Most email clients will check for a valid DKIM signature on incoming emails to identify who sent it.</p>
<p>This means <strong>DKIM is a working way to prevent email deliverability issues and increase your sender reputation</strong> with email services.</p>
<p>The receiving mail server can identify the origin of the email marketing campaign.</p>
<h4><strong>Should You Use SPF or DKM?</strong></h4>
<p>Quick answer: <strong>You should use both.</strong></p>
<p>Unless you are an email marketing nerd, you probably don’t need to know precisely how SPF and DKIM work.</p>
<p>But what you do need to know is that both authentication levers are required to <strong>reduce spam and improve email deliverability rates</strong>.</p>
<p>SPF and DKIM work together.</p>
<p>For instance, DKIM alone does not guarantee that the sender’s server is permitted to send outgoing emails in the name of your website (your domain).</p>
<p>Often, SPF on its own is powerless as many website owners research&nbsp;different web …</p></div></div>

<br/>
December 3, 2020 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/02/unused-private-member/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/02/unused-private-member/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The other day, I was asked whether we should worry about the space
taken up by unused functions in our codebase. My answer followed this rambling path:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unused function templates won’t even get instantiated, so they
  really have no existence at link-time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused inline functions <em>may</em> be codegenned, but if you have compiler
  optimizations turned on, you probably won’t see any codegen for
  inline functions unless they are actually called.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused static non-member functions, logically, should be codegenned,
  but since static functions aren’t visible beyond their own
  <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/08/02/the-tough-guide-to-cpp-acronyms/#tu">TU</a>,
  the compiler may be able to detect and warn about them — and
  with compiler optimizations turned on, the compiler may decide
  that there’s no reason to generate code for them either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unused non-static (external-linkage) functions, though, <em>must</em> be codegenned,
  because the compiler cannot prove that no other TU calls them.
  An optimizing <em>linker</em> might be able to prove that nobody needs
  those definitions, and eliminate them — I personally have worked
  on a linker that did exactly that optimization — but in general
  your mental model of a linker should be that it won’t do that
  optimization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The linker is likely able to prove that the function is unused;
but without some degree of help from the compiler, it probably won’t
be able to prove that it is safe to just snip that function’s bytes
out of the text section. That might mess up some relative offset that
the rest of the object file is secretly relying on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“What if they’re marked private?”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unused private (non-static) data members, logically, must take up space
  in the memory footprint of the class, so that every TU will agree on
  the <code>sizeof</code> the class. However, <em>if</em> in some specific TU the compiler
  can see the complete definition of every member and every friend of
  the class, then it can prove that the private member really is
  unused, and then it can give a warning. Clang does this.</p>

    <p>Hmm, but Clang does this <em>only</em> for private data members, not for
  private member functions! That’s interesting!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the complete list of non-temploid non-inline entities you might
encounter, and what the major compilers do with them if they’re provably
unused. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/cMWPE1">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<p>Options-wise, I tested <code>-W1 -W2 -W3 -W4 -Od -O1 -O2</code> on MSVC,
and <code>-Wall -Wextra -O0 -O1 -O2 -O3</code> on the other three.</p>

<p>I claim that there’s a fair bit of room for improvement here!</p>

<p>Or am I missing some subtle mechanism by which “unused” private members
might actually be referenced from other TUs?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Yes, I am! See my followup:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/12/03/steal-a-private-member">“How to use a private member from outside the class”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have placed “–” in table cells where this loophole makes the suggested optimization
technically impossible for a conforming compiler. All compilers’ diagnostics could
use improvement, but the new optimization table shows that everyone (except MSVC)
is doing the best they can, optimization-wise.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>23 Sep 2020 • 4 min read</p><p>There are dozens of ways to take notes, but they all seemingly end up with the same outcome: well-intentioned bullet points that quickly turn into vast swathes of difficult-to-memorise text, abbreviations that become uncrackable codes (even to those that made them in the first place), and mindless layouts with all the clarity of an inebriated housefly. If you frequently find your notes (be it from class, business meetings or online courses) in any way similar to the above then the Cornell Notes system is for you.</p><picture><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 1100px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes.webp, https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes@2x.webp 2x"><source type="image/webp" media="(max-width: 1099px) and (min-width: 421px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes-md.webp, https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes-md@2x.webp 2x"><source type="image/webp" media="(max-width: 420px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes-sm.webp, https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes-sm@2x.webp 2x"><source media="(min-width: 1100px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes@2x.jpg 2x"><source media="(max-width: 1099px) and (min-width: 421px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes-md.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes-md@2x.jpg 2x"><source media="(max-width: 420px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes-sm.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes-sm@2x.jpg 2x"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/cornell-notes/cornell-notes.jpg" alt="Illustration of person writing Cornell notes besides the table"></picture><p>Created in the 1940s by Walter Pauk, a prominent education professor from (you guessed it) Cornell University, the Cornell Notes method was devised so you can make better notes, and study more effectively. Many people find the Cornell Note system to be a transformative approach to note-taking, and you could too. In this article we’ll tell you what Cornell Notes are, why they are so effective and how to take them.</p><h2>What are Cornell Notes?</h2><p>Cornell Notes are an uncomplicated, structured way of taking notes on any subject. We’ll go into more detail below but all you’ll need to get started is a decent sized pad of paper (A4 is preferable, and can be lined, grid-lined or blank), a pen (obviously), and three lines across

possible. The beauty of Cornell Notes lies in the layout, and by employing this technique you will find yourself making more sense of the class material as the lesson progresses, and a better understanding of the content when it’s time for review.</p><h2>Advantages and Use Cases of Cornell Notes</h2><div><div><h3>It’s simple</h3><p>This is Cornell Notes’s most prominent feature, and its biggest advantage too: it’s simple. It’s such a straightforward method to implement that you don’t need much to do it. No coloured tabs or reams of dividers or post-it notes, just pen and paper. It also means that once you’ve read this article you’ll be good to go, and bringing big gains to your note-taking skills in no time.</p></div><div><h3>It’s flexible</h3><p>There are an abundance of subject-matters out there - luckily, Cornell Notes work with every single one. They can be applied to any number of scenarios, including those outside of the learning environment. Whilst the majority of people will use Cornell Notes within the context of classroom learning and university lectures, it works equally well with online courses, client meetings, and even business planning.</p></div><div><h3>You will retain information better</h3><p>Cornell Notes break lessons down into manageable chunks that are easy to remember. In this way you can keep track of the salient bits of information that also come to be better understood on later review. Additionally, the Cornell layout is designed for easy testing of the information on the page which will further improve study-productivity.</p></div></div><h2>How to take Cornell notes?</h2><p>To begin with, divide your paper into a few sections, essentially an off-centre “I” like the following:</p><p>To save time, it can be good to come to class or your meeting with a bunch of sheets that already have the layout. The basis of the Cornell Notes format involves separating the page into four sections: a space at the top for some specific topic details, a right hand column containing the main pieces of content we need to know (also known as the “Response Column”), with a column on the left called the “Cue Column”, containing keywords and questions. Finally the bottom space is a summary of the information above it.</p><h3>1. Top Space - Subject Particulars</h3><p>The first thing you will want to do is fill in some details like the specific topic that these notes are on, and the topic/objective to be covered. This top space will contain information that will organise your notes later, so noting the date, lecture number and so on could prove useful later.</p><h3>2. Right Hand Column - Main Notes</h3><p>The large box on the right hand side is for noting down key words, concepts and facts. As you listen to the information you’re learning, note down the salient points in this column. Make sure you skip lines between ideas so there’s a clear separation between them on the page (and in your mind when you go back to revise). If you find an online lecture going too quickly, also think about skipping a couple of lines to leave yourself some space in case you need to go back and add things later.</p><h3>3. Left Hand Column - Cues</h3><p>So far, this all seems pretty similar to regular note-taking. However, it’s when we get to the left column the magic really happens. We now want to cue on the left things that relate to the information we've just written down. The cue can be a question, keyword or phrase that refers to the material on the right hand side. In some cases the lesson might move on before we have time to fill it in and that's fine. Just come back later and write the cues when there's a pause in the session.</p><p>Once this section is filled in, you will be left with two columns consisting of cues and responses, with those cues on the left encouraging us to think of the more detailed information on the right.</p><h3>4. Bottom Space: Summary</h3><p>The final section to fill is the bottom space. This is your summary, essentially a few sentences outlining the key points of the information above. Pull out key ideas from the cue and response columns, maybe any vocabulary you're unfamiliar with, and just generally all the important stuff that you’d want to know if you were going to explain this topic to somebody else.</p><p>It can be good to wait at least a couple of hours before doing the summary, so as to give time for the content to sink in and let your brain sort things out in the background.</p><h2>Subsequent Testing and Review</h2><p>And that’s it! The last step of the Cornell Notes process is when you come back to the notes for review and revision. You’ll see a clearly structured representation of the class and subject-area, and have a ready-made testing system in front of you: cover the right hand column and you’ll have questions or keyword prompts to answer and expand upon for a really productive revision session.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>It almost sounds too simplistic to be effective, but it is in its simplicity that Cornell Notes work so well. This is a technique that not only helps you consolidate details of information better, but remember it too. Whilst Cornell Notes help you with taking notes in the moment, they help you when coming to revise those notes later, enhancing your study-time and improving your productivity.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Something I learned recently and I thought was <em>amazing</em> - you can create sockets straight from your shell! Well, assuming you use bash or zsh - from some surface level digging, I couldnâ€™t find anything for fish.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>

<h2 id="bash">bash</h2>
<p>Bash supports tcp and udp connections out of the box, and does so with an imaginary device in <code>/dev</code>. Enter</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"text!"</span> <span>&gt;</span> /dev/<span>$PROTO</span>/<span>$HOST</span>/<span>$PORT</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And youâ€™ll create a connection to <code>HOST:PORT</code>. <code>$PROTO</code> can be <code>tcp</code> or <code>udp</code>. If the connection canâ€™t be made, writing to/reading the file will fail.</p>

<p>Along with being easy to access from the terminal, itâ€™s <em>very</em> handy for scripts, especially if you donâ€™t have <code>nc</code>/<code>telnet</code>. For example, if a local build of a web app runs on port 8000, you can check if itâ€™s running with:<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>if </span><span>exec </span>3&gt;/dev/tcp/localhost/8000 <span>;</span> <span>then
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server up!"</span>
<span>else
	</span><span>echo</span> <span>"server down."</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And then use that information somewhere else.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re unfamiliar, <code>exec</code> without any arguments is used to redirect file descriptors and files. By associating fd 3 with <code>/dev/tcp/localhost/4000</code>, it attempts to create a file there and thus a connection. We use <code>&gt;</code> to open the socket for writing, although we donâ€™t need to write anything in this case.</p>

<p>By using <code>&lt;&gt;</code> we can open a file for reading and writing, and use it to create a super simple curl:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>exec </span>3&lt;<span>&gt;</span>/dev/tcp/<span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span>/80
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"GET / HTTP/1.1</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;3
<span>cat</span> &lt;&amp;3
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>$ ./simplecurl www.google.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:57:30 GMT
Expires: -1
....
&lt;google website&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Iâ€™m sure you can see the power of being able to open sockets with bash alone. Go play around with it!</p>

<h2 id="zsh">zsh</h2>
<p>zsh has an external module you can load in order to use itâ€™s socket capabilities. It doesnâ€™t support udp like bash, but itâ€™s more powerful in a few ways!</p>

<p>To load the module, put the following in your <code>.zshrc</code> or run it in your shell:</p>


<p>We now have access to the zsh networking builtin - <code>ztcp</code>!</p>

<p><code>ztcp</code> allows creating connections, like bash, but also allows listening for connections.</p>

<p>Straight from the zsh docs, we can create a connection between two machines with <code>ztcp</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine:</span>
ztcp <span>-l</span> 7128
<span>lfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
ztcp <span>-a</span> <span>$lfd</span>
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>

<span># client machine</span>
ztcp HOST 7128
<span>talkfd</span><span>=</span><span>$REPLY</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>$REPLY</code> variable here is a file descriptor returned by the last <code>ztcp</code> command, referring to the socket/connection it just created.</p>

<p>So, <code>talkfd</code> on both machines is a file descriptor for talking to the other:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># host machine</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"hello!"</span> <span>&gt;</span>&amp;<span>$talkfd</span>

<span># client machine</span>
<span>read</span> <span>-r</span> line &lt;&amp;<span>$talkfd</span><span>;</span> print <span>-r</span> - <span>$line</span>
<span>&gt;</span> hello!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, thereâ€™s a lot more you can do, especially with the ability to listen for connections.</p>

<p>Hope this was as interesting to you as it was to me!</p>

Left side is responsible for logical reasoning and storing the information (text and keywords) and the right side is responsible for creativity and visual interpretations (coloring and visual positioning of the elements). Both things enhance our ability to remember things. Thus, a mind map is a must-use tool for everyone who wants to learn, or remember concepts easily.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/870/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr" width="435" height="435" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/870/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr 435w" sizes="435px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*7xDdURIPArx_xeWr?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="ef1d">I’m currently using Miro for that, but there are a few things I don’t like about it.</p><p id="a698">So creating a mindmap of a book or some concepts that it presents is a great way to actively work and interpret the information.

So, we have to test ourselves.</p><p id="e452"><strong>Create a summary of each chapter</strong></p><p id="8cc8">To move the knowledge from short term memory into a long term understanding we should create concepts in our brain and try to interpret them.

That’s right, before you go to sleep, think about the topic and ask questions. I will be writing them down on a piece of paper.

I think it might be worthwhile trying.</p><p id="221c">Just ask a question before going to sleep. It’s that simple.</p><p id="6330">Organizing repetition is crucial. The best way to repeat something is when you are learning more on this topic, or when you need these thoughts for actions on your business and or other decisions. That’s why Tagging is important, and I must create a system of tag and Notes. I’ve been hearing a lot about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten" rel="noopener">Zettelkasten</a> method of note taking, and I want to explore how it works. Zettelkasten basically allows cross linking of various notes and entities, so you can tag practically everything, and make those connections around topics you are exploring and learning.</p><p id="a13d">Another good ways to understand and remember material, — is to present it to someone.

<p><strong>Status: 00:27 in the morning of December 4 my account was restored again.</strong> No words or explanations on how it happened – yet.</p>



<p>This morning (December 3rd, 2020) I woke up to find myself logged out from my Twitter account on the devices where I was previously logged in. Due to “suspicious activity” on my account. I don’t know the exact time this happened. I checked my phone at around 07:30 and then it has obviously already happened. So at time time over night.</p>



<p>Trying to log back in, I get prompted saying I need to update my password first. Trying that, it wants to send a confirmation email to an email address that isn’t mine! Someone has managed to modify the email address associated with my account.</p>



<p>It has only been two weeks since someone <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked my account</a> the last time and abused it for scams. When I got the account back, I made very sure I both set a good, long, password and activated 2FA on my account. 2FA with auth-app, not SMS.</p>



<p>The last time I wasn’t really sure about how good my account security was. This time I know I did it by the book. And yet this is what happened.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-03-Losenordsaterstallning.png" alt="" width="467" height="328"><figcaption>Excuse the Swedish version, but it wasn’t my choice. Still, it shows the option to send the email confirmation to an email address that isn’t mine and I didn’t set it there.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Communication</h2>



<p>I was in touch with someone at Twitter security and provided lots of details of my systems , software, IP address etc while they researched their end about what happened. I was totally transparent and gave them all info I had that could shed some light.</p>



<p>I was contacted by a Sr. Director from Twitter (late Dec 4 my time). We have a communication established and I’ve been promised more details and information at some point next week. Stay tuned.</p>



<h2>Was I breached?</h2>



<p>Many people have proposed that the attacker must have come through my local machine to pull this off. If someone did, it has been a very polished job as there is no trace at all of that left anywhere on my machine. Also, to reset my password I would imagine the attacker would need to somehow hijack my twitter session, need the 2FA or trigger a password reset and intercept the email. I don’t receive emails on my machine so the attacker would then have had to (also?) manage to get into my email machine and removed that email – and not too many others because I receive a lot of email and I’ve kept on receiving a lot of email during this period.</p>



<p>I’m not ruling it out. I’m just thinking it seems unlikely.</p>



<p>If the attacker would’ve breached my phone and installed something nefarious on that, it would not have removed any reset emails and it seems like a pretty touch challenge to hijack a “live” session from the Twitter client or get the 2FA code from the authenticator app. Not unthinkable either, just unlikely.</p>



<h2>Most likely?</h2>



<p>As I have no insights into the other end I cannot really say which way I think is the most likely that the perpetrator used for this attack, but I will maintain that I have no traces of a local attack or breach and I know of no malicious browser add-ons or twitter apps on my devices.</p>



<h2>Details</h2>



<p>Firefox version 83.0 on Debian Linux with Tweetdeck in a tab – a long-lived session started over a week ago (ie no recent 2FA codes used), </p>



<p>Browser extensions: Cisco Webex, Facebook container, multi-account containers, HTTPS Everywhere, test pilot and ublock origin.</p>



<p>I only use one “authorized app” with Twitter and that’s Tweetdeck.</p>



<p>On the Android phone, I run an updated Android with an auto-updated Twitter client. That session also started over a week ago. I used <em>Google Authenticator</em> for 2fa.</p>



<p>While this hijack took place I was asleep at home (I don’t know the exact time of it), on my WiFi, so all my most relevant machines would’ve been seen as originating from the same “NATed” IP address. This info was also relayed to Twitter security.</p>



<h2>Restored</h2>



<p>The actual restoration happens like this (and it was the exact same the last time): I just suddenly receive an email on how to reset my password for my account.</p>



<p>The email is a standard one without any specifics for this case. Just a template press the big button and it takes you to the Twitter site where I can set a new password for my account. There is nothing in the mail that indicates a human was involved in sending it. There is no text explaining what happened. Oh, right, the mail also include a bunch of standard security advice like “use a strong password”, “don’t share your password with others” and “activate two factor” etc as if I hadn’t done all that already…</p>



<p>It would be prudent of Twitter to explain how this happened, at least roughly and without revealing sensitive details. If it was my fault somehow, or if I just made it easier because of something in my end, I would really like to know so that I can do better in the future.</p>



<h2>What was done to it?</h2>



<p>No tweets were sent. The name and profile picture remained intact. I’ve not seen any DMs sent or received from while the account was “kidnapped”. Given this, it seems possible that the attacker actually only managed to change the associated account email address.</p>

        <small>2020-12-03</small>
        <p>This has been the most fun I’ve had with JavaScript in some time. A spiritual successor to the <a href="https://underjord.io/live-server-push-without-js.html">stupid solution</a> which allowed both me and my visitors to see the number of concurrent readers. It is also a piece of whimsy I’ve wanted to do for a while to add more magic and life to the site. The animations default to off to preserve CPU but do turn on the magic switch in the top right if you can and want to see the visuals. This is arguably less stupid.</p>
<p>What is it? Well, a live number of my readership for the entire site for one. If you turn on the magic you should also see the rough positions of other readers on the site that are on the same page as a small hovering geometric shape. I call them wisps.</p>
<p>It’s not often that you can see the footfalls of other people on the web unless they write a comment or something. I don’t want to expose my readers to one another in any privacy-sensitive way or in any fashion that requires moderation. This simply gives a rough indication of activity on the site and whether people are reading the same thing as you. And it moves around in fun ways.</p>
<p>Anyway, I enjoy it and I hope you will too. So how is this done? A small backend in Phoenix using Channels (basically just WebSockets), a small amount of Javascript to render new elements and update positions based on the state updates from the backend. The idle hovering of the symbols is CSS Animation and moving from area to area as the reader reads on is done via CSS Transitions.</p>
<p>I was hoping to default to on, but as I’ve found out with my sweet animated gradient lines, CSS aninmation can get CPU intensive. Right now my gradient lines pause after a period of inactivity and only run if there is activity. They hit 12% or so on my CPU which is dumb. A better fix to make them more lightweight is on the way, the idle-handling is a mitigation. So for these I wanted to avoid a big performance hit. They perform okay right now from my tests, they use the cheap-to-animate transforms so there’s nothing too heavy. But also, there’s not a known upper bound on the potential number of wisps active at the same time and if that scales poorly on some browsers I don’t want to default to setting someone’s phone on fire.</p>
<p>The number is available regardless since that doesn’t animate. I think showing this sort of thing is a fair way of both measuring concurrent visitors and sharing that with the visitor. I can see it, you can see it. I’ve also been considering a 90’s web visitor counter that is actually live. Could be fun. Just gotta find the right aesthetic.</p>
<p>I like this way of extending my site. I guess in a JAMStack fashion. The site is static but I can build small interactive parts and back them with minimal backends which for stateful applications Elixir does exceedingly well. If these backends go down the site will still work. All the important stuff is there. The fun stuff degrades to a connection error in the console.</p>
<p>Let me know how you like it, I do get and read responses to my posts and I appreciate when y’all reach out so try that via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or @ me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.

<p><strong>Paid partnership with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spartez-software.com/">Spartez Software</a></strong></p>



<p>Yep, you read that right. This week I am working with <a href="https://spartez-software.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spartez</a> to review their new <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1223211/whiteboards-for-jira-team-collaboration?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whiteboards for Jira App</a>. And before you get worried – no, I have no intention of letting that change how I do reviews. I’ll go over the general idea of an app and give you some use cases. Then I’ll take a deeper dive into the feature set and end with my usual analysis – including how the App can be improved. And you can always find a way to enhance any App. I should note now, though, that the App is for Jira and Confluence Cloud only. But we’ll get to that in a bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, the world has had a crash course in working remotely. I had a bit of a head start, with me starting a remote job at the End of September ’19, versus most everyone’s February to March ’20. However, there is one thing that I’ve missed most. Sometimes it’s just easier to get someone into a meeting room with a markerboard and collaborate while drawing out the workflow, feature, automation, or what-have-you. There isn’t a good analog in the virtual space. A slack meeting comes close, but *not* quiet there, and both Zoom and Webex don’t even come close.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Spartez has been thinking the same thing. If you are not familiar with them, they are often known for Apps like Agile Poker and Agile Cards. To me, it seems they are always a go-to pick when you need to bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital one for your Agile practices. I’ve used both of the apps mentioned above before and have rarely had a problem with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, they were facing a similar problem that most of us now face. How do we take some of the same practices we used to do in person together and take that online? One such challenge is Whiteboarding an idea out. And this was what Grzegorz Tańczyk was thinking about as he was preparing for Atlassian’s Codegeist 2020 hackathon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This concept isn’t a new idea, however. There are several similar products already on the market, including Gliffy and Miro. However, the key to this is that it is Jira Cloud Native. This fact means it can import and change your issues already in Jira and create new content on your whiteboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I saw the demo, I couldn’t help but think of all the potential use cases. There were the normal ones for sorting and updating issues. For example, you can set an “Update Issues” area to be a “Rank” Area and sort your issues there, and that new ranking will be updated on the Jira Issues. Or you can set an “Update Issues” Area to update the assignee so that any issues dragged there are assigned to that person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2678" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-170/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png" data-orig-size="1192,587" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=1024" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=1024 1024w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=300 300w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png?w=768 768w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image.png 1192w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>However, the idea that captured me was the ability to add Images to it. Imagine this – you are on a UI/UX Team. You need some feedback on a new design change you are working on. So you set up a Webex/Zoom, so everyone can talk, and set up a Whiteboard with the new design on it. Then people can comment on various parts of it on the whiteboard – in real-time. And once a comment is settled on, you can directly convert those comments into Jira issues to be worked on.</p>

<p>That’s the thing, though; this lets you collaborate in real-time. During the product demo, I was invited onto the board. So imagine, here I am in the US; meanwhile, the two people giving the demo for Spartez are in Poland. However, on the call, I could see the edits I was making show up on their board in real-time. That fact alone was amazing. And I didn’t even have to sign up to their Jira instance and take up a license!&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let’s drill down into some features and see what this App can do.</p>







<h2>Collaborate concurrently with all your team members</h2>



<p>I’ve already touched on this – but this is the whole point. An in-person whiteboard is fantastic for collaboration. And this App is one of the closest experiences I’ve seen to that experience. This App allows you and your teammates, stakeholders, or any interested party to get together and work on an idea or task quickly, all while being aware of what is in Jira.</p>



<h2>Easily populate the whiteboard with existing Jira issues or create new ones.</h2>



<p>This concept, I think, is where this App excels against its competitors. To my knowledge, no other integration allows you to inject your Jira issues directly to the board to be a part of the experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2681" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-2-17/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png" data-orig-size="1647,850" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=1024" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=1024 1024w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=300 300w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png?w=768 768w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-2.png 1647w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Edit, update, rank, or transition Jira issues – individually, in a bulk, or via update zones.</h2>



<p>So, in the “before times,” one thing I liked about using whiteboards is it allowed you to organize information in a 2D space. Jira Agile Boards comes close, but they only allow you to manage along one axis.</p>



<p>Here, you are free to set up 2D “Zones” that affect your Jira issues. This ability means you can have one area of the board for your backlog, where you rank your issues, then another for planned work, where you have different “Buckets” to assign it to users, then a third to represent your Agile board. All of this is managed on the same screen, as intuitively as “drag-and-drop.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2683" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-4-16/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png" data-orig-size="597,587" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=597" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=597" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png 597w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=150 150w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px"></figure></div>



<p>You can also drag and select a group of issues, edit them in real-time, give you a refined “Bulk Edit” option, or edit issues individually. The team leaned in because this was connected to Jira and really worked to make sure these capabilities were up to snuff, and it shows. Well done!</p>



<h2>Control the access using Jira permissions.</h2>



<p>This. 100% This. I consider permissions to be essential for any app. Yeah, you might want to keep this open and let everyone use it. Or you might not. Or some mix there-in. The fact is, having permissions that can easily be set gives you that control, rather than the App Developer.</p>



<h2>View in real-time what other participants do.</h2>



<p>They do mean real-time. As I said, this point was the one where most of my concerns lay during the demo. However, Spartez was willing to demonstrate it, granting me limited access to their demo board. And there was a slight delay – but that’s only because Physics is a cruel mistress. But honestly, I had to&nbsp;<strong><em>really&nbsp;</em></strong>pay attention to even notice it – most users probably won’t ever see it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Use post-it cards, images, videos, or draw anything.</h2>



<p>Sure, this can be a useful feature. I stated a use case for this above. But this feature can be fun. Yes, the App does support animated gifs. I checked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="2682" data-permalink="https://thejiraguy.com/image-3-16/" data-orig-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png" data-orig-size="365,493" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=222" data-large-file="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=365" src="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=365" alt="" srcset="https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png 365w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=111 111w, https://thejiraguycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=222 222w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px"><figcaption>You’re going to have to trust me that the hamster is dancing…</figcaption></figure></div>







<h2>What this App does Well</h2>



<p>Well, this App does what it sets out to do, which is enable collaboration by allowing users to work on a virtual Whiteboard. However, the ability to manipulate your Jira issues in real-time via the board is where this App shines. It’s intuitive, useful, and fun to use. And it’s not often I can say that in Jira.</p>



<h2>What this App could work on</h2>



<p>Well, the obvious needs to be stated here. Whiteboards for Jira is only available for Jira Cloud right now. I know for some of you out there, this is a deal breaker.  This situation is sufficient to start with, but I too would love to see this on a Jira Server or Data Center instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another feature I’d love to see is an option to “Snap to grid.” You can always snap things to other nearby objects, but the first object is always free-hand. I’d love to see some way to add an option to snap it to a grid – because, you know, some of us are perfectionists.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Would I recommend this App?</h2>



<p>First, given the current offering, I can only recommend this App if you are on Jira Cloud. I’m hoping that will change soon, but Cloud is the only place you can get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And honestly, this App is meant to solve a specific problem. Some teams prefer to use a whiteboard; some teams are fine using digital tools and don’t need it. So, if your one of the former teams who, in the “before-times,” would use a whiteboard, I say get it. Your Teams will likely thank you for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Whiteboard for Jira’s Tier Rank</h2>



<p>This one was hard for me. If I go on functionality alone, It’s an easy A. However, the limited availability is an essential factor. I maintain a free tier Jira Cloud system for testing, but it’s not my daily driver. Given the whole package, I need to give it a B+, with upgrade potential to an A down the road.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>If you trace the news in financial services (banking, insurance, etc.), it's hard not to be overly enthusiastic - the terms like <em>'digital disruption'</em>, <em>'fintech innovation'</em>, <em>'banking 3.0'</em>, <em>'blockchain-powered XYZ'</em>, <em>'transformative services'</em> are flying left and right in everyday announcements. Apparently, very conservative, highly regulated, traditional institutions are now in absolute avant-garde of user-focused, technological revolution, making Internet-era behemoths like Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook pale in comparison.</p><p>Or maybe it's <u><strong>utter crap</strong></u>?</p><p>Cheap PR? Buzzword bingo? Painting the dead grass green? A modern equivalent of H.C.Andersen's <em>"The Emperor's New Clothes"</em>? Hmm, what could be the easiest way to verify that?</p><p>How about performing a ... <strong>time travel</strong>? I mean: going back in time 10-15 years and comparing what banks (or other financial institutions) provided THEN with what they do provide NOW. Because that's what really matters - making a difference from the customer's perspective by providing better customer experience, more valuable products and services, etc. Updating the visual style to look like material design ain't enough.</p><p>Time travel sounds like something beyond our capacity these days, but ... luckily I think can help here. In this particular case, I can really make it happen! How come?</p><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVVy_x3Erg">Stay awhile and listen ...</a></em></p><p>In 2001 I've opened a bank account in a completely new bank which was (AFAIK - I'm not 100% sure here) the 1st true Internet bank (no physical branches, just the Internet access - you could do everything on-line, even opening the account) in Poland. It was named <a href="https://inteligo.pl/">Inteligo</a>, and you can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inteligo">here</a>. To be honest: those days it was a real game-changer (when compared to traditional banking with money transfers that required you to appear physically in the bank's branch or postal office ...).</p><p>But the very next year (in 2002) <strong>Inteligo</strong> was fully (100%) acquired by the largest bank in Poland - <strong>PKO BP</strong>. That institution was (and is) perceived as a very traditional one - aimed at retirees, elderly people - in general folks who are somewhat distrustful and reluctant to change. What a marriage, wasn't it?</p><p>Fast forward 18 years:</p><ul><li><strong>PKO BP</strong> didn't really "merge" with <strong>Inteligo</strong> at all - it's still a separate service (with a separate brand, pool of financial products, UI, etc.)</li><li>the development of <strong>Inteligo</strong>, which was unquestioningly one of the most innovative banks of its era, has ... pretty much ceased (except few meaningless details I'll cover later) - probably its owner didn't want to invest there and focused on its core e-banking offer (named <a href="https://www.ipko.pl/">'iPKO'</a>) instead; feel free to check the "evolution" of the infosite frontpage in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010601000000*/inteligo.pl">web archive</a>.</li><li>the development of iPKO has progressed steadily (backed up with shitloads of investment) throughout all the past years, bringing the new versions of the web user interface, mobile apps, etc.</li><li>nevertheless, I didn't terminate my <strong>Inteligo</strong> account - I still use it mainly to pay the monthly bills, like a small "sash" just for that purpose</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/header.png" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/header.png 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/header.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Oh, those gradients, so 90-tish :)</figcaption></figure><p>You've probably figured it out already, but I'll state it explicitly - that situation provides me a unique opportunity <u>to compare a banking experience straight from 2002 with the one of the 2020 industry leader</u> (here in Poland). And answer the following questions:</p><ol><li>how much did the banks really progress in the past 18 years?</li><li>what is easier/better/more convenient from the end-user's perspective?</li><li>... or maybe some things have actually worsened?</li><li>did the changes introduced by banks change my behaviors when it comes to finances?</li></ol><p>I can't wait to dive into the details, so let's not delay any longer!</p><p>Let's expand the context on how I do banking, just a bit. My financial behavioral profile looks like that:</p><ul><li>I have both private and company (as an individual entrepreneur) accounts - in a few currencies (usual suspects like EUR or USD, none of the exotics)</li><li>I use both debit and credit cards</li><li>I have used both cash loans and the mortgage in the past</li><li>I've bought car insurance via the bank's partnership once</li><li>I don't use direct debit, its paperwork is freaking cumbersome - I prefer to set subscription-based, regular payments out of the bank</li><li>obviously, I do money transfers, domestic and international</li><li>I've used a few forms of savings, but no investments like stocks or derivatives</li><li>No installment purchases</li><li>I've requested few atypical operations in the past: like early repayments or rebinding mortgage to a different current account - but nothing really fancy</li></ul><p>I don't think I'd call myself a heavy financial instruments user, but probably I'm still above the average. On top of that, I'm a tech-savvy, heavyweight Internet user - I avoid both physical branch visits and call-centers (both phone and video-call versions) at all cost.</p><p>When it comes to banking, I generally prefer browser over mobile apps (exception: Revolut, because they have really good, laser-focused mobile apps). The reason is simple: when I'm browsing my savings or making a transfer, I'd like to have some privacy. In my case, privacy usually means having one of my laptops within a hand reach anyway, so ...</p><p><em>To be continued (next week)</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Continuous integration services like <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines">Bitbucket Pipelines</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">Gitlab CI/CD</a> force extreme automation. They require your continuous integration flows to run non-interactively in remote environments. Most of these tools do not allow you to interact with the continuous integration environment.</p>



<p>All of these tools require users to define deployment workflows in custom definition languages. It is very common in my experience that users of these services can <em>only</em> run their deployment workflows using the service in question.</p>



<p>When something goes wrong with a deployment, debugging takes the form of a <strong>deployment death loop</strong>:</p>



<ol><li>Make changes locally (mostly to continuous integration configuration files).</li><li>Push to the appropriate branch on your git host (usually <em>master</em>).</li><li>Wait for a job to start on your continuous integration service.</li><li>Wait minutes or even tens of minutes following the logs to see if your changes fixed the issue.</li><li>Repeat this procedure until you have solved the problem.</li></ol>



<p>Things are even worse when you have to debug configuration that lives in a database or on a configuration management system such as <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html">Parameter Store</a>. If you can’t manually trigger a workflow, you are forced to push superficial changes to your git repository (like adding punctuation or white space to your README) to see if your changes worked.</p>



<p>How to break out of this death loop?</p>



<p>Two suggestions:</p>



<p>First, <strong>any developer should be able to deploy from their local environment</strong> (provided they have the required level of access). The continuous integration workflow definition should be secondary to this mechanism. If possible, it should make use of this mechanism.</p>



<p>For example, at <a href="https://alpha.bugout.dev/">Bugout</a>, our services are deployed by a bash script which can be executed on our servers via SSH. Even in production, if a developer has access to the production servers, they can run a deployment by simply running a git pull and then the deployment script over SSH. This is useful not only when debugging deployments but also when our continuous integration service goes down, <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/sxthxvdlljk4">which has been known to happen</a>.</p>



<p>Second, <strong>embrace </strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist"><strong>checklists</strong></a>. Have a checklist of external actions that must be taken before a change can be deployed. This checklist can include things like running database migrations, setting environment variables, or modifying a load balancer.</p>



<p>It’s okay to check items off such a checklist manually. Manual checklists may invalidate ideas of fully automated deployments. This is alright. Deployments that require manual steps should be performed with human oversight.</p>



<p>The general principle is to <strong>favor interactivity over automation</strong>. Make your deployments interactive by default. You will not regret it.</p>

<p>Last month saw the passing of Ruth Klüger, one of the most influential memoirists of the Holocaust, at age 88. Born to a Jewish family in Vienna in 1931, Klüger was deported to Theresienstadt with her family shortly before her eleventh birthday then transferred to Auschwitz and a women’s subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp. She survived Auschwitz by lying about her age, after a female clerk told her to say she was 15 when she was only 12 in order to be transferred for work in a labor camp. In her memoir, Klüger presents this moment, to which she owed her life, as neither heroic, nor redemptive, but human. “What more do you need for an example of perfect goodness?” (<em>Still Alive</em>,108). Klüger and her mother ultimately survived by escaping from a death march. Her brother and father were murdered. After the war Klüger studied in Regensburg and then in 1947 emigrated with her mother to the United States, where she graduated from Hunter College and went on to earn a Ph.D. in German from Berkeley. She became a professor of German literature and taught at a number of universities, including Princeton (where she became the first female full professor of German) and the University of California, Irvine.</p>



<p>At Irvine, Klüger oversaw a study abroad program in Göttingen, Germany, where she was struck by a bicycle in 1989. As she emerged from a days-long coma, she began to recall long-repressed memories and began to write. As <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Michael Rothberg</a> writes, “In her reconstruction of her thoughts as the bicyclist bore down on her, the bicycle and headlight are transformed into barbed wire and a spotlight” (130). Klüger’s memoir, <em>Weiter Leben</em>, published in German in 1992 (“German, strange as this statement may sound, is a Jewish language” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 205)), when she was 70, was a bestseller and won major awards. It can be said to exemplify what Freud called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354314530812"><em>Nachträglichkeit</em>, trauma delayed</a>. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttv6p4.9">Rothberg</a> praised her memoir for depicting “a site of extreme violence as a borderland of extremity and everydayness” and described it as a model of a literary mode he termed “traumatic realism,” which breaks through deadlock between “realist” versus “antirealist” Holocaust representation (109).The English version, <em>Still Alive</em>,was published in 2001. The book is widely taught in university courses and is used as an eyewitness testimony in major works of Holocaust historiography including Saul Friedländer’s <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/nazi-germany-and-the-jews-saul-friedlander"><em>Nazi Germany and the Jews</em></a>(1997/2007) and Peter Fritzsche’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nIUFQGN2y4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><em>Life and Death in the Third Reich</em></a>(2008).</p>

<p>Klüger stands out among survivors for her outspoken critical stance toward Holocaust remembrance culture. She <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">once said to the German Studies Association</a>, “the present memorial cult that seeks to inflict certain aspects of history and their presumed lessons on our children, with its favorite mantra, ‘Let us remember, so the same thing doesn’t happen again,’ is unconvincing. To be sure, a remembered massacre may serve as a deterrent, but it may also serve as a model for the next massacre” (GSA, 392). She called out Holocaust tourism, asking what the “carefully tended, unlovely remains” of former concentration camps could possibly communicate of the experience of being imprisoned there (<em>Still Alive</em>, 63). “I don’t go to these concentration camp memorial sites,” she once flatly told <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/holocaust-survivor-ruth-klueger-vienna-reeks-of-anti-semitism-a-435879.html"><em>Der Spiegel</em></a>, and she even asked the Auschwitz Museum to take down her poems, which were displayed there against her wishes (111). “I don’t hail from Auschwitz, I come from Vienna,” she wrote, and it seems that this attitude led her to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-and-author-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-dies-at-88/a-55188986">opt</a> to have the number tattooed on her arm removed in later life (112). She remained especially critical of German attempts to identify with victims from the Nazi era. “Defeat,” she reflected, “bred its own variants of nationalism”—a kind of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eATtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT416&amp;lpg=PT416&amp;dq=%22negative+exceptionalism%22+rabinbach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pF_fBLAbO7&amp;sig=ACfU3U39FqK-RnvEvVtrDkPULc064HmiFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgmt-RnpztAhXmGVkFHd6mCN0Q6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22negative%20exceptionalism%22%20rabinbach&amp;f=false">negative exceptionalism</a> about German crimes (163).</p>



<p>Writing in the wake of popular milestones like <em>Holocaust </em>(1978) and <em>Schindler’s List </em>(1993), Klüger echoed critics of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623529908413937">“the Americanization of the Holocaust”</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzj0m">“the end of the Holocaust,”</a> for whom brutal historical reality was displaced by redemptive and enjoyable kitsch. The problem of this oxymoronic “Holocaust aesthetics” became apparent to Klüger after a young woman approached her at a book signing and said, with a smile, “<em>I love the Holocaust</em>.” Klüger was taken aback. She understood that the woman loved not the event itself, but reading about it. “But her naïve and undisguised pleasure brought up the question: Should she love to read about the Holocaust? <em>Should</em> we in any shape or form feel positive and empowered or cathartically purged when we contemplate the extinction of a people? My impulse was to say to this woman: You shouldn’t. Stop reading these books, including mine, if you enjoy them” (GSA, 393).</p>



<p>This anecdote, Klüger reflects, validates continued discussion of Theodor Adorno’s famous <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">claim</a> that to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric, however much one may <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/488568">disagree with it</a>. She worried about <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43555106">Holocaust literature slipping into “kitsch”</a>&nbsp;and reflected about the popularity of Anne Frank’s diary, “it is easier to shed tears over an unfortunate little girl than to agree or disagree with an eminently rational Italian chemist with pronounced opinions that was Primo Levi” (GSA, 400). Telling are the two other survivor authors she praises: the Hungarian Imre Kertész, who reflected on the paradox that once the Holocaust is written about, experience is substituted by the “artefact” of narrative representation, and who was also critical of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=toS1uAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Holocaust+as+Culture+Thomas,+Kert%C3%A9sz,+Imre&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjlsqPEpprtAhUaRTABHVy6AqUQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg">“Holocaust culture.”</a> She also names the Polish writer Tadeusz Borwoski, whose acerbic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Way_for_the_Gas,_Ladies_and_Gentlemen"><em>This Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen</em></a>(1946) she criticizes for its antisemitism and fictional embellishments, while also recognizing “the starkness with which Borowski portrays the slide from indifference to depravity at the edge of human existence and endurance” (GSA, 402).</p>



<p><em>Still Alive </em>is also notable for its “feminist” discussions of <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/668607">nonconsensual sex work</a> in the camps that debunked popular “whorehouse fantasies” and “a thriving cottage industry” of Holocaust-themed pornography (184), while also problematizing Holocaust “photos as an instrument of sublimated voyeurism” (159). But <em>Still Alive</em> stands out most for its <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo25956860.html">bitter tone</a>. A reviewer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/ruth-kluger-dies.html">wrote</a> thatKlüger “unsentimentally redefined the conventional mythos of the heroic Holocaust survivor,” and indeed she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">rejected</a> the idea that suffering united victims as “sentimental rubbish.” Instead she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-kluger-author-of-searing-and-celebrated-holocaust-memoir-dies-at-88/2020/10/09/eeee3b16-0a2a-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">challenged her readers</a> to “rearrange a lot of furniture in their inner museum of the Holocaust,” <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kl%C3%BCger-germany-has-changed/a-19005242">reminding</a> them that “Surviving was not normal. Death was normal.” As the <a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/literatur/2077830-Autorin-Ruth-Klueger-gestorben.html"><em>Wiener Zeitung</em></a> fittingly titled their obituary, Klüger modeled “surviving relentlessly.”</p>



<p>As Klüger’s former colleague <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">Gail Hart reflects</a>, “I think she was a little bit too hard on those who, say, visited Holocaust memorials and Holocaust museums because she said that, you know, they were trying to admire themselves for hating the Nazis.” In <em>Still Alive </em>(as once <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v37/n03/slavoj-zizek/in-the-grey-zone">quoted by Slavoj Žižek</a>), Klüger recounts a conversation with German graduate students in Göttingen:</p>



<blockquote><p>One reports how in Jerusalem he made the acquaintance of an old Hungarian Jew who was a survivor of Auschwitz, and yet this man cursed the Arabs and held them all in contempt. How can someone who comes from Auschwitz talk like that? the German asks. I get into the act and argue, perhaps more hotly than need be. What did he expect? Auschwitz was no instructional institution…You learned nothing there, and least of all humanity and tolerance. Absolutely nothing good came out of the concentration camps, I hear myself saying, with my voice rising, and [the student] expects catharsis, purgation, the sort of thing you go to the theatre for? They were the most useless, pointless establishments imaginable. That is the one thing to remember about them if you know nothing else. (<em>Still Alive, </em>65)</p></blockquote>



<p>Klüger refuses to cast herself as a saint on account of her experience (unlike the <a href="https://time.com/4392426/ronald-lauder-elie-wiesel-holocaust/">canonized</a> but also <a href="https://www.tikkun.org/a-variety-of-perspectives-on-elie-wiesel">criticized</a> figure of Elie Wiesel). On the contrary, she even recounts a disturbing incident from the postwar years, while she waited in vain for her father and brother to return from the camps, in which she accidentally killed a little dog by forgetting to turn off the gas in the kitchen where he slept. “Of course I was mortified the next morning when I found his lifeless body and was despondent for days. Accident or symptom? And if the latter, symptom of what?” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 158). This fundamental recognition of moral fallibility led fellow Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi to coin the term “the grey zone” to describe how the camps generated <em>amorality</em>, not morality among victims. Yet while Levi similarly characterized Auschwitz as a <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Black_Hole_of_Auschwitz.html?id=VxbSTfGI638C">“Black Hole,”</a> he also, in sharp contrast to Klüger, called it his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf3FAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz+had+been+his+true+university.%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7mdLrkpztAhWhFVkFHVRWCmYQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CAuschwitz%20had%20been%20his%20true%20university.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">“true university”</a> for understanding human nature.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/11/07/surviving/">Gabriele Annan</a> spoke for many when she called Klüger “merciless” and “outspoken to the point of aggressiveness”: “She also resents all views on the Holocaust that do not tally exactly with her own, and gets indignant about everyone who criticizes her….Levi told a similar story without making one feel so hectored.” <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">Speaking</a> before Angela Merkel and the German Bundestag on Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2016, Klüger <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/documents/textarchive/speech-klueger-403862">called</a> her own approach “bitter and aggressive,” yet also positively connected her experience with the plight of other groups, praising the “heroic” act of welcoming refugees from war-torn Syria. (She similarly <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434/holocaust-survivor-ruth-kluger-would-not-accept-inequality-says-friend-1.5769532">opposed</a> inhumane treatment of asylum-seekers at the U.S.–Mexico border.) Hart, her former colleague, reflects of Klüger, “She is a very direct interrogator. She doesn’t have any of these conciliatory mechanisms that most women have. And she seeks argument. And at first I found that a little bit off-putting and I kind of avoided her.” As Klüger admitted herself, “Damn right. I <em>am</em> hard to satisfy” (<em>Still Alive</em>, 184).</p>

        <div>
            
<p>I enjoy challenging myself on some weird programming ideas. It's a good way to have fun and to learn new things. This time the challenge was to draw a cheeseburger in CSS using a single empty div.</p>
<p>After a lot of trials and errors, I ended up with this.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That's probably not the best looking burger ever. However I've been super impressed that it was actually possible to draw something as complex as this with a single div.</p>
<p>In this article we are going to make this cheeseburger, step by step. </p>
<h2>The HTML</h2>
<p>The HTML is very short: a charset, a title, a link to the CSS file, and a single div. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Cheesburger&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="burger"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Now we will focus our attention on the style.css file. </p>
<h2>The CSS</h2>
<p>The most basic CSS for our burger may look like this.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Contains all the parts of the burger */
  /* Bun, cheese, meat, lettuce, and sesame seeds */
}</code></pre>
<p>But that's too limited, we won't be able to fit a whole burger inside a single selector. To find more space, we should use the <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> pseudo elements. </p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* The cheese, meat, and lettuce */
}

.burger:before {
  /* The bun */
}

.burger:after {
  /* The sesame seeds */
}</code></pre>
<p>That might not seem much, but that will be enough for our purpose. </p>
<h2>The bun</h2>
<p>The bun is made of 2 parts: the top bun and the bottom bun. So we have to find a way to draw 2 different shapes in a single CSS selector, which is not that complicated.</p>
<p>We start by drawing 2 rectangles using the <code>border</code> property. </p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  content: ""; 
  display: block;

  /* Space between the buns */
  width: 400px;
  height: 55px;

  /* Top bun */
  border-top: 80px solid #f5b230;

  /* Bottom bun */
  border-bottom: 50px solid #f5b230;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we use <code>border-radius</code> to curve the bread nicely.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Same code as previously */
  content: ""; 
  display: block;
  width: 400px;
  height: 55px;
  border-top: 80px solid #f5b230;
  border-bottom: 50px solid #f5b230;

  /* New line */
  border-radius: 30% 30% 20% 20%; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/2.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>The ingredients</h2>
<p>Next, we will add the main burger ingredients: cheese, meat, and lettuce. This time it's 3 shapes that we have to fit in a single CSS selector. </p>
<p>Let's focus on the meat for now.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Size */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;

  /* Color and shape */
  background-color: #681f24;
  border-radius: 15px; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/2a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, that's not great. We have some meat, but it's not in the correct position. Unfortunately we can't use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to fix that, since it would move the whole burger and not just the steak.</p>
<p>Let's try something different: drawing the meat with a <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Same as previously */
  /* We just removed the background color */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 15px;

  /* New line */ 
  /* The parameters: margin-left, margin-top, color */
  box-shadow: 10px 85px #681f24; 
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That works! However we face another issue: how can we  add the cheese and the lettuce in the same CSS selector? To answer that we need to realize 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The meat, the cheese, and the lettuce may have the same shape as long as their color is different.</li>
<li>In CSS it's possible to use as many box shadows as we want.</li>
</ul>
<p>So... we simply add more box shadows! </p>
<pre><code>.burger {
  /* Same code as before */
  width: 380px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 15px; 

  /* Updated box shadow */
  box-shadow: 
      10px 50px #fddb28, /* Cheese */
      10px 85px #681f24, /* Meat */
      10px 120px #82af15; /* Lettuce */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that the shadows' order is important, since the first one will have a higher z-index and will appear in front of the others. </p>
<h2>The sesame seeds</h2>
<p>Our burger is taking shape, but it currently looks a lot like a hot dog. We should fix that by adding some sesame seeds to the top bun. </p>
<p>First we draw a single sesame seed with a <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:after {
  content: "";
  display: block;

  /* Size and shape */
  width: 10px;
  height: 6px;
  border-radius: 40%;

  /* Position and color */
  box-shadow: 100px -165px #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we duplicate it by using many box shadows.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:after {
  /* Keep same code as before */
  content: "";
  display: block;
  width: 10px;
  height: 6px;
  border-radius: 40%;

  /* Add new box-shadow */
  box-shadow: 
      /* Top row */
      100px -165px #ffffff,
      160px -165px #ffffff,
      230px -165px #ffffff,
      290px -165px #ffffff,

      /* Bottom row */
      60px -135px #ffffff,
      125px -135px #ffffff,
      190px -135px #ffffff,
      255px -135px #ffffff,
      330px -135px #ffffff;
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Better cheese</h2>
<p>It would be nice if we could make our cheese look more like cheese. For example by showing one of the corners of the cheese slice. This means drawing a new shape (a yellow triangle) even though we already use all our CSS selectors.</p>
<p>If we look carefully at our code, we will notice that there's one thing we haven't really used so far: the <code>content</code> property. Let's see what happens when we add the character <code>▾</code> in it.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Change the content property */
  content: "▾";

  /* Color and Size of the ▾ */
  color: #fddb28;
  font-size: 120px;

  /* Then keep everything else the same */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/5c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We do get a new shape displayed, but it's in the wrong position. And once again we cannot use <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> to solve that. </p>
<p>But with some CSS tricks, we will make this work. </p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  /* Add 8 spaces before the triangle */
  content: "        ▾";

  /* Actually display the spaces in the "content" */ 
  white-space: pre;

  /* Vertically position the ▾ */
  line-height: 25px;

  /* Then keep everything the same */
}</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.lesscake.com/tutimg/5/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And we finished our cheeseburger!</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>When emailing a friend about my challenge, she replied with this clever answer.</p>
<pre><code>.burger:before {
  content: "🍔";
  font-size: 100px;
}</code></pre>
<p>That's a lot less CSS for a better looking result. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm really impressed with what I managed to achieve with a single div and some CSS. Of course using SVG would have made more sense, but where's the fun in that?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unlike Django, Flask is not directly tie-up with any database. So we can use Flask with either SQL and No-SQL. And that makes the Flask framework superior among other web frameworks and most suitable for serverless architecture. In this article, I’m going to explain how to code the flask application and database as DynamoDB and deploy to AWS Lambda.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The application architecture will look like this, First I’ve created the file resources.py where I initiate the boto3 client. And I’ve created a models.py file that holds all the class references. And finally, I have the JSON file to create the DynamoDB table automatically from the script.</p><h2 id="table-json">Table JSON</h2><p>You can also create the table directly in the AWS console but my local development
I’m using DynamoDB local instance so I’ve to reply on other technique to create the
the table in my local and one of the methods is using the awscli command.</p><pre><code>{
    "TableName": "User",
    "KeySchema": [{ "AttributeName": "email", "KeyType": "HASH" }],
    "AttributeDefinitions": [{ "AttributeName": "email", "AttributeType": "S" }],
    "ProvisionedThroughput": { "ReadCapacityUnits": 5, "WriteCapacityUnits": 5 }
  }
</code></pre><p>Once you have the JSON file you can run the below command to create the table.</p><pre><code>aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file:////actual_file_path/models/create-user.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
</code></pre><p>You can remove the <code>--endpoint-url</code> if you’re creating the table in AWS console.</p><h2 id="models">Models</h2><p>I’ve created the class reference for each table. One of the benefits of having this Python object is to deal with DynamoDB response in your template and code.</p><p>Also, for authentication purposes, I’ve used the flask login so that you can create authentication with this code.</p><pre><code>from flask_login import UserMixin

class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self):
          self.email = None
           self.first_name = None
           self.last_name = None

   def get_id(self):
        return self.VE


    def init_user(self, response):
        self.email = response["email"]["S"]

        if "first_name" in response:
            self.first_name = response["first_name"]["S"]

        return self
</code></pre><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>In order to make the CRUD operation very easy i’ve created the prepare function.
That takes the args, kwargs and turn into the dict. This dict will be useful in
update operation.</p><p>And the get function nothing but make the DynamoDB call and convert into the
class object. And then you can use this class object in your template. Also you can
pass the class object to jinja2 template and use it in the template as you like.</p><pre><code>import boto3

dynamo_client = boto3.client("dynamodb")
dynamodb_resource = boto3.resource("dynamodb")
</code></pre><pre><code>def prepare_user(email, first_name=None, last_name):
    return {"email": email, "first_name": first_name, "last_name": last_name}
</code></pre><p>Main purpose of this prepare user is to create the dict that directly use in CRUD operation.</p><pre><code>def get_user(email):
    response = dynamo_client.get_item(Key={"email": {"S": email}}, TableName="User")

    if "Item" in response:
        return User().init_user(response["Item"])

    return None
</code></pre><p>you can also create the update_user and delete_user function and use it in your code.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>What we have seen is how to incorporate DynamoDB in our flask based project. First the
resources and the creation of the table from JSON file and then have the model class based
python reference and then finally the CRUD operation function.</p></div><p>This article published under

<p>Web-based applications face scaling due to the growth of users along with the increasing complexity of data traffic.</p>
<p>Along with the modern complexity of business comes the need to process data faster and more robustly. Because of this, standard transactional databases aren’t always the best fit.</p>
<p>Instead, databases <a href="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/dynamodb-vs-hadoop-vs-mongodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.theseattledataguy.com/dynamodb-vs-hadoop-vs-mongodb/">such as DynamoDB</a> have been designed to manage the new influx of data. DynamoDB is an Amazon Web Services database system that supports data structures and key-valued cloud services. It allows users the benefit of auto-scaling, in-memory caching, backup and restore options for all their internet-scale applications using DynamoDB.</p>
<p>But why would you want to use DynamoDB and what are some examples of use cases?</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll cover just that. We will layout the benefits of using DynamoDB, and outline some use cases as well as some of the challenges.</p>
<section>

<div>
<div>
<h3>Benefits of DynamoDB for Operations</h3>
<p>First, let’s discuss why DynamoDB can be useful.</p>
<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*1m1LAQYbGgEV4Rmu" data-image-id="0*1m1LAQYbGgEV4Rmu" data-width="700" data-height="300"></figure>
<h4><strong>Performance and scalability</strong></h4>
<p>Those who have worked in the IT industry know that scaling databases can both be difficult and risky. DynamoDB gives you the ability to auto-scale by tracking how close your usage is to the upper bounds. This can allow your system to adjust according to the amount of data traffic, helping you to avoid issues with performance while reducing costs.</p>
<h4><strong>Access to control&nbsp;rules</strong></h4>
<p>As data gets more specific and personal, it becomes more important to have effective access control. You want to easily apply access control to the right people without creating bottlenecks in other people’s workflow. The fine-grained access control of DynamoDB allows the table owner to gain a higher level of control over the data in the table.</p>
<h4><strong>Persistence of event stream&nbsp;data</strong></h4>
<p>DynamoDB streams allow developers to receive and update item-level data before and after changes in that data. This is because DynamoDB streams provide a time-ordered sequence of changes made to the data within the last 24 hours. With streams, you can easily use the API to make changes to a full-text search data store such as Elasticsearch, push incremental backups to Amazon S3, or maintain an up-to-date read-cache.</p>
<h4><strong>Time To&nbsp;Live</strong></h4>
<p>TTL or Time-to-Live is a process that allows you to set timestamps for deleting expired data from your tables. As soon as the timestamp expires, the data that is marked to expire is then deleted from the table. Through this functionality, developers can keep track of expired data and delete it automatically. This process also helps in reducing storage and cutting the costs of manual data deletion work.</p>
<h4><strong>Storage of inconsistent schema&nbsp;items</strong></h4>
<p>If your data objects are required to be stored in inconsistent schemas, DynamoDB can manage that. Since DynamoDB is a NoSQL data model, it handles less structured data more efficiently than a relational data model, which is why it’s easier to address query volumes and offers high performance queries for item storage in inconsistent schemas.</p>
<h4><strong>Automatic data managemen</strong>t</h4>
<p>DynamoDB constantly creates a backup of your data for safety purposes which allows owners to have data saved on the cloud.</p>

<h3>5 Use Cases for DynamoDB</h3>
<p>One of the reasons people don’t use DynamoDB is because they are uncertain whether it is a good fit for their project. We wanted to share some examples where companies are using DynamoDB to help manage the larger influx and of data at high speeds.</p>
<h4><strong>Duolingo</strong></h4>
<p>Duolingo, an online learning site, uses DynamoDB to store approximately 31 billion data objects on their web server.</p>
<p>This startup has around 18 million monthly users who perform around six billion exercises using the Duolingo app.</p>
<p>Because their application has 24,000 read units per second and 3,300 write units per second<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/duolingo-case-study-dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/duolingo-case-study-dynamodb/"> DynamoDB ended up being the right fit for them</a>. The team had very little knowledge about DevOps and managing large scale systems when they started. Because of Duolingo’s global usage and need for personalized data, DynamoDB is the only database that has been able to meet their needs, both in terms of data storage and DevOps.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that DynamoDB scales automatically meant that this small startup did not need to use their developers to manually adjust the size. DynamoDB has simplified as well as scaled to meet their needs.</p>
<h4><strong>Major League Baseball&nbsp;(MLB)</strong></h4>
<p>There’s a lot we take for granted when we watch a game of baseball.</p>
<p>For example, did you know there’s a Doppler radar system that sits behind home plate, sampling the ball position 2,000 times a second? Or that there are two stereoscopic imaging devices, usually positioned above the third-base line, that sample the positions of players on the field 30 times a second?</p>
<p>All these data transactions require a system that is fast on both reads and writes. The MLB uses a combination of AWS components to help process all this data. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/major-league-baseball-mlbam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/major-league-baseball-mlbam/">DynamoDB plays a key role</a> in ensuring queries are fast and reliable.</p>
<h4><strong>Hess Corporation</strong></h4>
<p>Hess Corporation, a well-known energy company, has been working on the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil.</p>
<p>This business requires strategizing different financial planning which impacts management on the whole. To streamline their business processes, Hess turned towards DynamoDB by shifting its E&amp;P (Energy Exploration and Production) project onto AWS.</p>
<p>Now DynamoDB has helped the company in separating potential buyers’ data from business systems. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/how-hess-has-continued-to-optimize-the-aws-cloud-after-migrating-ent218-reinvent-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/how-hess-has-continued-to-optimize-the-aws-cloud-after-migrating-ent218-reinvent-2017">operational infrastructure of DynamoDB</a> helps them to handle data effectively and get optimized and well-managed results.</p>
<h4><strong>GE Healthcare</strong></h4>
<p>GE is well-known for medical imaging equipment that helps in diagnostics through radiopharmaceuticals and imaging agents.</p>
<p>The company has used DynamoDB to increase customer value, enabled by cloud access, storage, and computation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EQchAPyroE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EQchAPyroE">GE Health Cloud</a> provides a single portal for healthcare professionals all over the US to process and share images of patient cases. This is a great advantage for diagnostics. Clinicians can improve treatments through access to this healthcare data,</p>
<h4><strong>Docomo</strong></h4>
<p>NTT Docomo, a popular mobile phone operating company, has built a reputation for its voice recognition services, which need the best performance and capacity.</p>
<p>To cater to these requirements, Docomo turned towards DynamoDB which has helped the company scale towards better performance.</p>
<p>With their growing customer base,<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ntt-docomo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ntt-docomo/"> Docomo has brought a voice recognition architecture into use, which helps them perform better even during traffic spikes</a>.</p>
<p>Along with all these cases, advertising technology companies also rely heavily on Amazon DynamoDB to store their marketing data of different types.</p>
<p>This data includes user events, user profiles, visited links and clicks. Sometimes, this data also includes ad targeting, attribution, and real-time bidding.</p>
<p>Thus, ad tech companies require low latency, high request rate and high performance without having to invest heavily in database operations.</p>
<p>This is why companies turn towards DynamoDB. It not only offers high performance but also, with its data replication option, allows companies to deploy their real-time applications in more than one geographical location.</p>
<p>However, despite all the benefits DynamoDB isn’t always the easiest database to use when it comes to analytics.</p>

<h3>Challenges of Analyzing DynamoDB Operational Data</h3>
<p>DynamoDB’s focus is on providing fast data transactions for applications. What makes DynamoDB fast on a transaction level can actually hinder it from the perspective of analyzing data. Here are a few of the major roadblocks you will run into once you start analyzing data in DynamoDB.</p>
<h4><strong>Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)</strong></h4>
<p>Online analytical processing and data warehousing systems usually require huge amounts of aggregating, as well as the joining of dimensional tables, which are provided in a normalized or relational view of data.</p>
<p>This is not possible in the case of DynamoDB since it’s a non-relational database that works better with NoSQL formatted data tables. Besides, the general data structures for analytics aren’t always well supported in key-value databases. In turn, it can be harder to get to data and run large computations.</p>
<h4><strong>Querying and&nbsp;SQL</strong></h4>
<p>Along with OLAP processes being difficult to run on DynamoDB, due to the focus of DynamoDB being operational, DynamoDB does not interface with SQL.</p>
<p>This is a key issue because most analytical talent is familiar with SQL and not DynamoDB queries. In turn, this makes it difficult to interact with the data and ask critical analytical questions.</p>
<p>The consequences of this can be the requirement to hire developers solely to extract the data, which is expensive, or being unable to analyze the data at all.</p>
<h4><strong>Indexing is expensive</strong></h4>
<p>Another qualm when it comes to analytics is processing large data sets quickly. Often this can be alleviated with indexes.</p>
<p>In this case, the problem is that DynamoDB’s global secondary indexes require additional read and write capacity provisioned, leading to additional cost. This means that either your queries will run slower or you will incur greater costs.</p>
<p>These challenges can sometimes be a hindrance to some companies deciding whether or not they want to take on the risk of developing on DynamoDB.</p>

<p>This is where analytics engines like <a href="https://rockset.com/sql-on-dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://rockset.com/sql-on-dynamodb/">Rockset</a> come in. They not only provide a SQL layer that makes it easy to access the operational data but also provide the ability to ingest the data into their data layer — which supports joins with data from other AWS data sources, like Redshift and S3.</p>
<p>We’ve found tools like this to be helpful because they can reduce the need for developers and data engineers who can interface with DynamoDB. Instead, you can do your analytical work and answer the important questions without being held back.</p>
<p>For those who have ever worked on an analytical team, it can be very difficult to explain to upper management why data exists, but you’re still unable to provide insights. Using layers like Rockset can take the complexity away.</p>

<p>One of the points that Braben makes in <a href="https://nintil.com/review-scientific-freedom">Scientific Freedom</a>, and one that others have made elsewhere, is that science is not as welcoming of new ideas as it may seem. The process of peer review stands in the way of new breakthroughs, and one man's crankery is another's brilliant insight, or so goes the story.</p>
<p>The examples of this that probably come to mind are old: Galileo and heliocentrism or perhaps Semmelweis and hand washing and in general the germ theory of disease. So one may think that science <em>used to</em> be like that and now it is self-correcting to the point where it's not an issue: Peers are now fair judges; great ideas are immediately recognized by domain experts.</p>
<p>But this is not true. It's hard to say if the situation has changed relative to how it used to be, but here I want to make the smaller point that <strong>a non-trivial number of key discoveries have been at some point rejected, mocked, or ignored by leading scientists and expert commissions</strong>. Sure, eventually they succeeded, this is why we know about these cases. But <em>they could have succeeded earlier, faster</em>.</p>
<p>The point I want to make here is not the precise examples themselves; rather what the examples reveal about science. In many of these cases the papers were eventually published when one or two journals rejected them. In others, the ideas were ignored for decades, or were vigorously debated.</p>
<p>The most worrying thing is not peer review in the context of publications, after all there are a lot of journals and while publishing in <em>Cell Structure and Function</em> looks not as nice as a <em>Nature</em> publication, it's still something, especially if it's actually important. The issue is when giving grants. The examples illustrate that very important feats of science weren't judged as such by peers in a journal context; so it is not unreasonable to assume that the same peers when handing out grants in a study section at NIH may decide to bin a proposal to do research they consider of little consequence.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be unreasonable to ask of a system with non-infinite resources to be able to do perfect filtering of what gets funded or published. A number of false negatives is to be accepted. But <em>If</em> one could do better than the peer reviewers in a given discipline, or at least rate proposals differently, then one could find those false negatives and get them funded. This is again what Braben did with Venture Research.</p>
<p>I'd be great to collect even more examples, if you have some send them to <a href="https://nintil.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7812170b1d381611160c1114561b171556">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>

<h3 id="the-ornithine-cycle">The ornithine cycle</h3>
<p>Source: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1016/0307-4412(73)90048-4">Krebs (1973)</a>, <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/405199">Krebs (1970)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0364021388900201">Kulkarni &amp; Simon</a> (1998)</p>
<p>Hans Krebs is most famous for his discovery of the Krebs cycle aka the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) aka the citric acid cycle (CAC) which lies at the heart of cellular energy production. Prior to his discovery of the TCA, Krebs was working on the ornithine (or urea cycle). Back then in his early thirties, Krebs was working in the lab of Otto Warburg and his research involved suspending slices of liver with various reagents to see what the liver would do with them (Ultimately, uric acid is what they were searching for). Well turns out that Warburg - who had pioneered the liver slice technique - thought that it was only useful for catabolic processes like respiration or glycolysis. But not the synthesis of new proteins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warburg did not support Krebs’ idea</strong>, perhaps because he thought that energy-absorbing reactions (as contrasted with oxidation reactions) would not go forward in tissue slices. <strong>When Krebs got freedom to initiate a major research enterprise of his own, in 1931, he decided to begin experiments of the sort he had conceived.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The great majority of scientists accepted the evidence presented in 1932 as convincing and commented enthusiastically. Warburg arranged a formal invitation for me by the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft, signed by Max Planck, the President, to speak on the subject in Berlin. [...] <strong>But there were also adverse criticisms.</strong> [...] As late as 1956 Bronk and Fisher reported ~ from my own Department at Oxford that under certain conditions citrulline is less effective than ornithine in promoting urea formation from ornithine and they concluded that citrulline cannot be an intermediate. The results of London and of Trowell were due to inadequate perfusion technique. The conclusions of Bach and Williamson were based on the wrong assumption that arginine and ornithine readily penctratc livcr slices. In fact the rates of penetration are relatively slow. While the observations of Bronk and Fisher were correct their interpretation was mistaken. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My idea was that the in vitro system of liver slices, incubated in a saline medium, provided a novel and easy method for measuring accurately the rate of urea synthesis under a variety of conditions. As one small rat liver supplies numerous samples, it is possible to carry out many parallel tests. No comparable method had been available before. <strong>Many biochemists and physiologists—including Otto Warburg—were quite surprised to learn</strong> that slices are capable of performing synthetic energy- requiring processes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another driving force, especially in my earlier days, was my ambition to justify my choice of career as a scientist vis-à-vis <strong>those who were doubtful about my ability to make a success in this field</strong>. These included my father, a surgeon who had inspired me to take up medicine, <strong>my teacher Otto Warburg (I believe)</strong>—and myself.</p>

<h3 id="jet-engines">Jet engines</h3>
<p>Sources: <a href="https://nintil.com/is-war-necessary-for-economic-growth-a-review-and-some-aviation-history-love/">Ricon (2015)</a>, <a href="https://nintil.com/aircraft-progress-before-and-after-world-war-ii#:%7E:text=In%20its%20present%20state%2C%20and,stringent%20weight%20requirements%20imposed%20by">Ricon(2016)</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vernon-Ruttan-Procurement-Technology-Development/dp/B01FMVMQ1M">Ruttan (2006)</a></p>
<p>Jet engines were simultaneously invented by von Ohain and Whittle (in 1937). While von Ohain got immediate buy in from Ersnt Heinkel (owner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel">eponymous</a> aircraft manufacturer), Whittle did not. He faced initial pushback from the the Air Ministry in the UK while research in the US was stalled by NACA (NASA's precursor) as well as the National Academy of Sciences' very pessimistic assessments of the technology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While serving at the Royal Air Force (RAF) Staff College in the late 1920s, Whittle developed a proposal for jet aircraft development. <strong>Both the Air Ministry and the aircraft industry found Whittle’s proposal too radical</strong>. In 1935, with financial assistance of two ex-RAF officers, he formed a private firm, Power Jets, to exploit his ideas. With the assistance of the Thompson Huston Company, Whittle had an engine ready for testing in February 1937. Although the test was only partly successful, the Air Ministry made a small grant to Power Jets to continue the tests. After successful tests in October 1938, Whittle received a contract from the Air Ministry to build a flight engine. [...] The initial lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Air Ministry was due to reluctance to divert funds from efforts to improve the performance of the piston-propeller engine (Cook 1991, pp. 97–114; Bobo 2001).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even as Germany and Britain were pursuing advanced jet aircraft research and development in the late 1930s, <strong>the NACA staff and board remained skeptical of the technical and economic viability of gas turbines for aircraft propulsion</strong> (Hunsaker 1952).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In its present state, and even considering the improvements possible when adopting the higher temperatures proposed for the immediate future, the gas turbine engine could hardly be considered a feasible application to airplanes mainly because of the difficulty in complying with stringent weight requirements imposed by aeronautics.</em> The present internal-combustion engine equipment used in airplanes weights about 1.1 pounds per hp, and to approach such a figure with a gas turbine seems beyond the realm of possibility with existing materials.</p>
<p>National Academy of Sciences, Committee on Gas Turbines (June 1940)</p>

<h3 id="mrna-vaccines">mRNA vaccines</h3>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/">STAT</a> (2020)</p>
<p>Very recently thrown into the spotlight by their application for COVID, when research first started, Katalin Kariko, the key scientist involved, had trouble getting funding and almost quit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Katalin Karikó spent the 1990s collecting rejections. <strong>Her work, attempting to harness the power of mRNA to fight disease, was too far-fetched for government grants, corporate funding, and even support from her own colleagues</strong>. [...]</p>
<p>It was a real obstacle, and still may be, but Karikó was convinced it was one she could work around. Few shared her confidence.</p>
<p>“Every night I was working: grant, grant, grant,” Karikó remembered, referring to her efforts to obtain funding. “And it came back always no, no, no.”</p>
<p>By 1995, after six years on the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania, Karikó got demoted. She had been on the path to full professorship, but <strong>with no money coming in to support her work on mRNA, her bosses saw no point in pressing on</strong>.</p>
<p>She was back to the lower rungs of the scientific academy.</p>
<p>“Usually, at that point, people just say goodbye and leave because it’s so horrible,” Karikó said. [...]</p>
<p><strong>That discovery, described in a series of scientific papers starting in 2005, largely flew under the radar at first</strong>, said Weissman, but it offered absolution to the mRNA researchers who had kept the faith during the technology’s lean years. And it was the starter pistol for the vaccine sprint to come.</p>

<p>Airplanes are boringly safe and widespread these days. But not that long ago you had people writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It might be assumed that the flying machine which will really fly might be evolved by the combined and continuous efforts of mathematicians and mechanicians in from one million to ten million years, provided of course, we can meanwhile eliminate such little drawbacks and embarrassments as the existing relation between weight and strength in inorganic materials. No doubt the problems has attractions for those it interests, but to the ordinary man it would seem as if effort might be employed more profitably.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    
<p>Over the years I've noticed some images (not diagrams or graphs) that are recognizable to programmers. These images also often have backstories that contain educational information, so here they are! </p>
<h3 id="lena">Lena<a href="#lena" aria-label="Anchor link for: lena"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/lena.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lena is a Swedish model and this photo of her is from a Playboy cover. Her name is sometimes spelled "Lenna" to encourage her name to be pronounced as "leh-nah" instead of "lee-nah", which is a mildly amusing parallel to classification tasks. The full image has her mostly nude. </p>
<p>The photo was first used six months after release in 1972 because of the mixture of textures and colours for testing an image compression algorithm. This eventually led to JPEGs (first released 1992). It's was standard to use the image to showcase differences between image compression algorithms .</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, having a nude model be the face of all image processing has raised concerns. Still there are blog posts, papers and websites that still use Lena for image processing, though recently it's been about computer vision, style transfer, etc. </p>
<h3 id="the-cornell-box">The Cornell Box<a href="#the-cornell-box" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-cornell-box"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/cornellbox.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyone who has taken a graphics course has seen this box as it was first presented at a SIGGRAPH in 1984. It consists of five planes, an overhead light, a rectangular prism and cube. Variations are often seen with spheres of different materials such as dielectrics (glass),  and metals instead of lambertians (the matte texture). </p>
<p>For a raytracer (or pathtracer) this tests a lot of important features. The shadowing of the rectangle onto the wall, contrasting wall colours that should emit some colour onto the white (this is called diffuse reflection). </p>
<p>As shown below, it can also showcase (or rather, suffer from) tone mapping, which is a technique used to map a set of colours to another to make the range look "dynamic" or at least correct. The image below has a bug where the lack of tonemapping causes the image to bug out where it tries to make the colour brighter than a pure white pixel. </p>
<p>Another issue with the image below is the noise, which can be fixed by more sampling in this specific case as it's a monte carlo ray tracer, so it uses some brute force and randomization as computers can't actually simulate light going in infinite directions. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/badtracer.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Other classic rendering images include the Stanford bunny and the Utah teapot. It's been a meme to hide the Utah teapot into random scenes, and the teapot is the graphics version of "Hello World". It appears in Toy Story, the Simpsons, a Windows screensaver, and the Sims. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIxt9guMbXo">2.5 minute video about the teapot from Tom Scott</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/bunny.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="the-big-red-mobile">The Big Red Mobile<a href="#the-big-red-mobile" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-big-red-mobile"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/bigred.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>CLRS! The iconic graphic on the textbook is obviously representative of a tree, but it's actually based on a piece of art. It was made by Alexander Calder in 1959. If you don't already know about mobiles, they're really cool, carefully engineered to work with equilibrium and air currents. Big Red, made from sheet metal and steel weird, can be found at the Whitney Museum of American Art! </p>
<p>Fun fact, Cormen (the C in CLRS) and co wanted to recolour the depiction to use red and black, but the Calder estate would not allow it. You can also purchase <a href="https://www.hangingmobilegallery.com/big-red-mobile/">similar versions of the mobile</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-dragon-book-cover">The Dragon Book Cover<a href="#the-dragon-book-cover" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-dragon-book-cover"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/dragon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This popular compilers textbook is often referred to as the "Dragon Book" because of the 🐉.The Dragon's shirt says "Complexity of Compiler Design", the shield says "Syntax Directed Translation" and the sword says "LALR Parser Generator". The older edition also has the knight riding a horse labeled "Data Flow Analysis". </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/greendragon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="syntax-directed-translation">Syntax Directed Translation<a href="#syntax-directed-translation" aria-label="Anchor link for: syntax-directed-translation"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The shield describes a method where the compilation is guided by the parser, and describes a more simpler subset of compilers. Syntax directed translation is a method of implementation used on context-free grammars (there's a whole linguistics thing behind this, but it's mostly what it sounds like) as a Type 3 language (on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#Type-2_grammars">Chomsky Heirarchy</a>) could not be driven by the parser. There aren't too many commonly used languages that would be described as completely context free though there are languages that only have small caveats to become CFGs (not to be confused with control flow graphs, another compilers concept). If you want to read more, this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">Stack Overflow question</a> is a good start. </p>
<p>Anywho, this is likely the shield because it prevents any blurring of "execution" and "compilation" by not having any ambiguities embedded in the grammar. </p>
<h4 id="lalr-parser-generator">LALR Parser generator<a href="#lalr-parser-generator" aria-label="Anchor link for: lalr-parser-generator"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>LALR is a type of parser (look ahead left to right) that is simpler than an LR parser (left to right, rightmost derivation) but more powerful than LL parsers (left to right, leftmost derivation). Parser generators greatly improve the pains of writing a parser. GCC started off with a parser generated (it's handwritten as of 2004), CPython makes their own LL* parser generator (*it's a bit variant, CPython devs may correct me), Haskell+OCaml+Ruby are on LALR generators. </p>
<p>Writing a nice parser that works, is fast <em>and</em> surfaces nice syntax errors is a difficult design task, and a bit tedious after designed! Hence the dragon will be slayed by a LALR parser generator (YACC is taught in the book). </p>
<h4 id="data-flow-analysis">Data Flow Analysis<a href="#data-flow-analysis" aria-label="Anchor link for: data-flow-analysis"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Data flow analysis is what it sounds like, tracking the movement of variables or other stored memory through a program. It is represented as the horse the knight is riding probably because it powers most things. I tried to think of why it might be removed from the cover, but there's no obvious answer and everything I came up with just sounded like a conspiracy theory. </p>
<h3 id="o-reilly-animals">O'Reilly Animals<a href="#o-reilly-animals" aria-label="Anchor link for: o-reilly-animals"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/animals.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Iconic meme-able book covers! But who draws them? Who picks the animals when the book is not just called Python? Why are they pictures of animals?</p>
<p>O'Reilly claims that this originated in the weirdness of Unix terms like awk, sed and yacc, and really the rest of it was "it just clicked". Many of them were drawn by one Lorrie LeJeune, and were done with pen and paper! There are also amusing stories of complaints from the arachnephobic who had to deal with spiders on covers. You can find a list of all the books and animals <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/animals.csp">here</a>.</p>
<p>Edie Freedman, the creative director who saw over this claimed that there's meaning to how all the animals that were selected though they aren't revealed. But here are some of the answers. </p>
<h4 id="the-obvious-ones">The Obvious Ones<a href="#the-obvious-ones" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-obvious-ones"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Many (but not all) of the Python books have snakes, Rust has a crab, OCaml has a Camel, GNU has a gnu. </p>
<h4 id="oracle-bugs">Oracle Bugs<a href="#oracle-bugs" aria-label="Anchor link for: oracle-bugs"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>"Oracle Essentials" has a cicada, "Oracle Regular Expressions" have spiders, "Oracle 8i Internal Services" has a bumblebee, dragonfly, dung beetle, lady bug, lantern fly, leaf insect, ants, praying mantis, etc. <em>Very</em> consistently bugs. The speculation is often "oracle software bad" but its likely just a meaningless theme (with each animal having a deep meaning) and not meant to piss off Oracle. It is special as even Python is not consistently snakes, and other groups of books like Google, Regular Expressions, Javascript, etc, do not have any themes. </p>
<h4 id="perl-camel">Perl Camel<a href="#perl-camel" aria-label="Anchor link for: perl-camel"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Here's a weird one, as the obvious choice would be an oyster for the pearl. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB870061922836237000">Wall Street Journal claims</a> that Larry Wall, creator of the language, wanted a camel because like Perl it's ugly but can go a long way without water. Some also claim it's a reference to the proverb "a camel is a horse designed by a committee" and how Perl is easily identifiable as a mixture of other languages. It's cool as the camel as adopted as Perl's mascot after the O'Reilly book. </p>
<h4 id="python-entirely-my-conspiracy">Python (entirely my conspiracy)<a href="#python-entirely-my-conspiracy" aria-label="Anchor link for: python-entirely-my-conspiracy"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Not all of the Python books have snakes! "Data Wrangling with Python" has a lizard, which seems to be a reference to giving Python "legs" to work with data. "Python Programming On Win32" is a crocdile, which to me just screams "PYTHON BUT MAKE IT SCARY". "Learning Python" is a rat and "Python Coobook" is a rabbit, which may be a reference to them being more introductory Python books as they're snake food. </p>
<h3 id="macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper">MacOS Powder Explosion Wallpaper<a href="#macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper" aria-label="Anchor link for: macos-powder-explosion-wallpaper"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>MacOS has always had some iconic wallpapers, especially of California views so this one stood out to me as "this should be generated". This isn't related to programming but I thought I'd investigate it since I've always wanted to know. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/explosion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Apple explicitly scrubs EXIF data, which is all that microchip tracking metadata that are automatically attached to your images for location, time, device, shutter speeds, etc. The one time the EXIF was leaked on one image it had a bunch of nitpicking notes like "fill in this area close to the edge with more tree so it doesn’t create awkward negative shapes" and "darken some of the stars that are a bit smaller and darker, so there is a little more difference in the starfield" which I guess could be expected for the quality of the Apple wallpapers and the anxiety that comes with being the photographer for a MacOS wallpaper. </p>
<p>Spoiler alert, I didn't actually figure out if these were generated or photographed, but I did figure out <em>how</em> one would generate/photograph them, and that they are <em>very</em> probably photographed. Here is the precedence: photographed ethereal Apple productions. </p>
<p><img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/cs_images/applefancy.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="how-to-photograph">How to Photograph<a href="#how-to-photograph" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-to-photograph"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>As expected, making these powder explosions would be a pain. One must first have the space, the high speed camera (powder flying through the air like that lasts less than a second) and cover all of the equipment. The powder is typically flour, and mixed with "holi" powder which is just high pigment powder for photoshoots/parties/crafts. It seems that many photographers actually have people in suits to throw the powder and those shots tend to look more like powder clouds than explosions. I found someone who did something a bit more clever, which involves a simple canon mechanism (silicon tubing and a pump) and sound triggered. </p>
<h4 id="how-to-render">How to Render<a href="#how-to-render" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-to-render"> <i></i></a>
</h4>
<p>3D animation software of course would also enable you to do this, and in my opinion produces better results. </p>
<p>The general approach is to start with a sphere, create some noise outwards like a spiky ball. Turn those vectors into dots going out, then configure those …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Over the last decade there has been some really great software products that
have been shut down with little to no warning. This is getting so common that
someone created a website called <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Killed by Google</a>.
After Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">shutdown Reader in 2013</a>, I spent months trying to find a replacement.
During this research I determined I should try to find solutions to services
I use everyday that wouldn’t be shut down in some board room over profit
margins.</p><p>About five years ago, I started researching smart home products and services
as well as automation software to use in my next home. I started to notice the
following trends:</p><ul><li>Software products and services being shutdown with no notice</li><li>No software updates for promised features or security fixes</li><li>Software updates that remove out of the box functionality (features/bricking)</li><li>Free software that suddenly requires a paid subscription</li><li>Companies are selling or hording your data.</li></ul><p>For the sake of relevancy let’s just cover what’s happened since the start of
2019.</p><h2 id="2019">2019</h2><h3 id="ecobee">ecobee</h3><p>When ecobee launched the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-Switch-Smart-Amazon-Built/dp/B0798LCLJ5?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee Switch+</a>
I became super interested in them due to the shear amount of sensors in a small
device. They had also stated there would be API support as well as it would be
integrated as a remote temperature sensor for an
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee4-Thermostat-Built-Sensor-Included/dp/B08BZTPMW1?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee smart thermostat</a>.</p><p>It took most of 2019, before 15 of my ecobee switches got the firmware update
to be added to my thermostat but the delivered promise of api support never came.</p><h3 id="best-buy-insignia-shut-down">Best Buy Insignia shut down</h3><p>Best Buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20853671/best-buy-connect-insignia-smart-plug-wifi-freezer-mobile-app-shutdown-november-6">quietly announced on <strong>September 6th</strong></a>
that it was shutting down it’s Insignia brand of smart home devices on
<strong>November 6th</strong>. App access would no longer be available rendering most of the
products unusable.</p><blockquote><p>The announcement has already been purged from the Best Buy Insignia website.</p></blockquote><h3 id="lowe-s-iris-shut-down">Lowe’s Iris shut down</h3><p>Lowe’s Iris platform first launched in 2012, offered free and paid subscription
options. An <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208407/lowes-iris-smart-home-platform-shutting-down-march-2019">announcement on <strong>January 31st</strong></a>
that it was shutting down on <strong>March 31st</strong>, rendering devices dead.</p><p>I’m happy they offered a program to trade in any purchased devices for a
prepaid credit card so users could migrate to a different solution.</p><blockquote><p>The announcement has already been purged from the Lowe’s Iris website.</p></blockquote><h3 id="chamberlain-myq-breaking-api-changes">Chamberlain MyQ Breaking API Changes</h3><p>When it comes to automating garage door openers there are few out of the box
solutions that work and are as popular as the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8?tag=niemyjski-20">Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener</a>.</p><p>An open source project created a python library that many other open source
projects use to integrate with MyQ using the MyQ Api. Unfortunately the MyQ
team has broken this <a href="https://github.com/arraylabs/pymyq/issues/27">api multiple times</a>
in 2019 causing automations to break.</p><blockquote><p>I hesitate a little bit every time I see an MyQ app update on my phone. as
I’m always wondering if this will trigger my opener firmware to be updated
and break my home automations.</p></blockquote><p>It’s been a cat and mouse game between smart home developers and the MyQ team.</p><h3 id="stringify-shut-down">Stringify shut down</h3><p>Stringify was launched in 2014 and bought by Comcast in 2017. Fast forward 18
months later to <strong>April 8th</strong>, Stringify <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/410576/stringify-is-shutting-down-after-five-years/">announces via email</a>
it will be shutting down new sign ups immediately and all data will be deleted
on <strong>July 8th</strong>.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Stringify has announced that it will be shutting down in the upcoming months. <a href="https://t.co/VFshmwCeKK">https://t.co/VFshmwCeKK</a></p>— Stringify (@StringifyIt) <a href="https://twitter.com/StringifyIt/status/1115370840353202177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2019</a></blockquote><h3 id="sonos-bricking-devices">Sonos bricking devices</h3><p>In <strong>December</strong> it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042871/sonos-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-controversy">uncovered</a>
that Sonos was bricking devices upon agreeing to recycle your device or by
upgrading the speaker.</p><blockquote><p>Recycle Mode is a state your device enters 21 days after recycling
confirmation in the Sonos app. In Recycle Mode, all data is erased and the
device is permanently deactivated so you can safely and securely dispose of
it. Once a device is in Recycle Mode, it cannot be reactivated.</p></blockquote><p>This decision was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166777/sonos-ending-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-sustainability">overturned</a> in <strong>March 2020</strong>.</p><h3 id="works-with-nest-shut-down">Works with Nest shut down</h3><p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/helpful-home/">announced</a> on
<strong>May 7th</strong> that it would be shutting down <code>Works with Nest</code> on <strong>August 31st</strong>.
It was only after massive backlash that they <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/updates-works-with-nest/">announced</a>
that they would continue to support integrations until they were available in
the new API’s backed by a single Google Account.</p><p>Current users have to be super careful not to migrate their existing Nest
accounts to the new Google account for fear of losing integrations. I believe
this migration and integration support for various hubs will be completed in
2021.</p><h3 id="wink-product-availability">Wink product availability</h3><p>For over five months users in the Wink ecosystem couldn’t purchase any new
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wink-WNKHUB-2US-Smart-home-White/dp/B01KW8WGZQ?tag=niemyjski-20">Wink devices</a>
due to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/409925/why-we-cant-recommend-wink-hubs-anymore/">product availability issues</a>.
This lasted from <strong>November 2018</strong> through <strong>March 2019</strong>.</p><h2 id="2020">2020</h2><h3 id="august-connect-firmware">August Connect firmware</h3><p>In early 2020, I received a firmware update that caused all five of my
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0752VPHVK?tag=niemyjski-20">August Smart Lock Pro Connect Hubs</a>
from connecting to my Wi-Fi. Slowly but surely they’ve came online but every
now and then I’ll have one drop offline. Thankfully I have the Z-Wave version
and access the locks that way.</p><h3 id="dark-sky-shut-down">Dark Sky shut down</h3><p>On <strong>March 31st</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios">Apple acquired Dark Sky</a>
and announced it would be shutting down it’s API at the end of <strong>2021</strong>. A lot
of smart home users used the API to power weather automations.</p><blockquote><p>Apple did the right thing by giving users plenty of time to move off of the API.</p></blockquote><h3 id="ecobee-1">ecobee</h3><p>As stated in the 2019 section, when remote thermostat sensors support was
rolled out to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-Switch-Smart-Amazon-Built/dp/B0798LCLJ5?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee Switch+</a>
via an firmware update. A few months later it was removed with a second firmware
update. Now only some of my switches are paired as a remote sensor to my
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee4-Thermostat-Built-Sensor-Included/dp/B08BZTPMW1?tag=niemyjski-20">ecobee smart thermostats</a>.</p><p>To make matters worse there is an unresolved server side bug that keeps
renaming any switch that has a custom defined name back to the serial number of
the device. This should never happen to a consumer device paired with cloud
outages leaves a lot to be desired from ecobee when it comes to software.
I recommend using ecobee’s HomeKit support to get around these limitations
where possible.</p><h3 id="home-assistant-breaking-changes-and-os-changes">Home Assistant breaking changes and OS changes</h3><p>In <strong>May</strong> the Home Assistant team <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/05/26/installation-methods-and-community-guides-wiki/">announced</a>
that they were dropping support for generic linux installs without consulting
the community. This was a major change that left many users frustrated. It makes
sense that users should be using the managed Home Assistant operating system,
but a large portion of users installed it on Ubuntu and other linux operating
systems of which may have been used for other purposes.</p><blockquote><p>As the platform matures there will be less churn and breaking changes.</p></blockquote><p>As we near the 1.0 release of Home Assistant, we’ve seen more integrations
be removed as well as changes to the API surface. Although these are good
changes they still require work by end users. This is to be expected of pre
version 1.0 software.</p><blockquote><p>Although breaking changes do happen from time to time. You control the
updates on your own time, helping to limit breaking changes.</p></blockquote><h3 id="chamberlain-myq-breaking-api-changes-1">Chamberlain MyQ breaking API changes</h3><p>For the second year running the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Garage-Opener-Chamberlain-MYQ-G0301/dp/B075H7Z5L8?tag=niemyjski-20">Chamberlain MyQ Smart Garage Door Opener</a> has had issues due to MyQ trying lock out users
from using the MyQ API. It has been a cat and mouse game between smart home
developers and the MyQ team.</p><h3 id="tuya-firmware-locking">Tuya firmware locking</h3><p>I love <a href="https://blakeniemyjski.com/blog/securing-smart-home-devices-with-esphome-and-home-assistant/">flashing retail devices</a>
from the stock firmware to ESPHome. I do this mainly for privacy and to ensure it
can be brought into Home Assistant easily. It appears there is a
<a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/wiki/Collaboration-document-for-PSK-Identity-02">new firmware</a>
on some Tuya devices that is preventing flashing causing vendor lock in to
unknown third party services. I can’t blame companies for wanting to lock down
the firmware, it just leaves little options for smart home integrations when
the company leaves the space.</p><h3 id="logitech-harmony-express-remote-shut-down">Logitech Harmony Express remote shut down</h3><p>On <strong>July 9th</strong> Logitech <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360048494053">announced</a>
it was discontinuing the 15 month old smart remote control that cost $250. It
would also be shutting down the Alexa service on <strong>September 30th</strong>, rendering
the device useless to control by it’s main selling feature.</p><blockquote><p>Logitech is offering a free upgrade if you bought this product!</p></blockquote><h3 id="wink-subscription">Wink Subscription</h3><p>On <strong>May 20th</strong> Wink <a href="https://blog.wink.com/wink-blog/2020/5/6/introducing-wink-subscription">announced</a>
that it would start charging all users $4.99 a month. Failure to subscribe
would result in severely limited functionality, pretty much forcing users to
upgrade in order to add or edit devices, add automations, or use voice control.</p><h3 id="ifttt-subscription">IFTTT Subscription</h3><p>On <strong>September 10th</strong> IFTTT <a href="https://ifttt.com/explore/introducing_ifttt_pro">announced</a>
a pro plan that costs $9.99 a month. The existing free plan would be severely
limited to 3 applets.</p><h3 id="smart-things-classic-shut-down">Smart Things Classic shut down</h3><p>On <strong>June 24th</strong> SmartThings <a href="https://community.smartthings.com/t/update-on-smartthings-classic-shutdown/213037">announced</a>
that SmartThings classic will be shutting down on <strong>December 1st</strong> . All users
who haven’t migrated to the new SmartThings API will have major disruptions
(e.g., your integrations will be deleted).</p><h3 id="wemo-cloud-only">Wemo cloud only</h3><p>On <strong>May 26th</strong> Wemo <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/26/wemo-is-replacing-its-awful-network-based-smart-home-management-with-online-accounts/">announced</a>
<code>Wemo Accounts</code>, a new way to manage all of your devices with an online account.</p><blockquote><p>The new account system shifts all of the device management away from your
local network and onto cloud services, which should reduce problems with the
Wemo apps and integrations with third-party services. However, account
creation is currently broken, which is very on-brand for Wemo.</p></blockquote><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>It’s worth looking at all the services and products that were shut down and
disappeared like they never even existed. Some of these products and service
had amassed hundreds of thousands of users. Is there an emerging pattern? Would
you ever trust this company again?</p><p>I recommend buying devices that can be controlled locally though ESPHome, mqtt,
Thread, Zigbee or Z-Wave. Stay away from products that use a vendor specific
protocol especially if the company has a history of shutting down services or
products. I’d also avoid large investments in new products by any company
unless they have a positive track record or can be controlled via a standard.</p><blockquote><p>If an online service doesn’t charge you a monthly fee, you are the product.
Products that have a free cloud dependency have to find a way to turn a
profit or they will shut down. Someone has to pay for the cloud services.</p></blockquote><p>I do feel comfortable sticking with HomeKit supported devices as I can control
them locally and Apple has a good track record of privacy, supporting devices,
and part of HomeKit was <a href="https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK">open sourced</a> too.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The story I am going to share below has so many variations, but the lesson is always the same. This specific version I got from <a href="https://twitter.com/Shadaya_Knight_/status/1327881911214157825">Twitter</a>:</p><p>A father said to his son: "You've graduated with honors, here is a car (Nissan Skyline R34) that I bought years ago, it's old. BUT before I give it to you, take it to the USED CAR STORE &amp; tell them you want to sell it &amp; see how much they offer you. The son went to the USED CAR STORE, returned to his father &amp; said: "They offered me $1000 because it looks very worn out". The father said, "Now take it to the PAWN SHOP"...</p><p>The son went to the PAWN SHOP &amp; returned to his father &amp; said: "The PAWN SHOP offered $100 because it's a very old car". Then the father asked the son to go to a CAR CLUB &amp; show them the car. The son took the car to the CAR CLUB &amp; told his father: "Some people in the club offered as much as $100 000 for it since it's a NISSAN SKYLINE R34, an ICONIC car &amp; sought after by many"...</p><p>Then the father replied: "I wanted to let you know that the right place values you in the right way. Don't find yourself in the wrong place and get angry if you are not valued. Those that know your value are those who appreciate you, don't stay in a place where nobody sees your value. KNOW YOUR WORTH"</p><p>...</p><p>Immediately after graduating from college with a CS degree, I was on the hunt for a developer job. Lucky enough and through some personal connection I was able to land a front-end developer role.</p><p>I was so happy to have gotten that job that I did lowball myself when asked how much do I want to get paid...At that time I was interning and I was being paid $20 an hour...so I said to myself let's just say anything between $22/hr to $25/hr ...Guess what! That's exactly what I got paid. I met the president of the company after an interview, and after reviewing my offer he said...something like... what I said for my offer is around the same salary range people at the company start with ...They sent me an official offer letter just a few days after that...and I was offered $45k a year...You can imagine what was going through my mind...I lowballed myself...Why did I say $22/hr? ...I was happy to get the job but was kinda sad that I didn't capitalize on the opportunity. The reason was mainly that after graduation I was kinda desperate to get a job...I was out of the school dorms, I needed to have my own place, I needed to take care of my own expenses. So I was just ready for anything that would pay me.</p><p>After like 5 months of working in this job I wasn't so happy...I felt as if what I was doing did inspire me enough...That, plus a few other personal reasons led me to quit my job. Where I was interning when I was in college...by the time I was ending my time before my full-time job, the boss had upped my salary to $30/hr. What I was doing to my boss at the internship place was valuable enough for him to increase my salary without even asking and just after 5 months of working for him. This was one of the greatest lessons I learned...that Know Your Worth...There will be places where your skills are valued higher than other places. Find those places and people who value your skills.</p><p>...</p><p>Here is another story I had read a few months ago...it goes like this...There was a marathon in one of the US cities, and two people put their table stands where the runners would pass. One of them had oranges and another one had donuts...Almost all runners passed by the oranges station to grab the oranges and continue their race. Almost none grabbed the donuts. The reason is plain clear...the tired runners wanted some refreshing fluid in their body at the time...you really can't imagine a marathon runner grabbing a donut in the middle of the race, it's just not fitting. A fresh orange was a better offer to the runners. While the donut person had good intentions...he/she wasn't there at the right moment. Actually, at the finish line of the race, most of the runners wished there were some donuts there to greet them...but unfortunately, a donut person was nowhere to be found. So while a donut would be so valuable once the race was over, the oranges pretty much saved the day in the middle of the race. Again, know your value...know where you will be valued.</p><p>Are you a designer in a company that thinks design work is not as important as developing (programming) ...just get out...and find a place where designers are valued. Are you a developer that think they're not as valued as the business side of the company...you have an opportunity to go somewhere where your skills will be valued and you will be compensated accordingly.</p><p>So folks that's the lesson of the day...KNOW THY VALUE</p><blockquote>Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid</blockquote>

December 2, 2020 | https://www.science4all.org/article/the-triangle-of-power/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.science4all.org/article/the-triangle-of-power/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The web is full of amazing and surprising creations. One such creation that has caught my attention lately was a video by 3Blue1Brown on the so-called “Triangle of Power”.</p>
<p><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sULa9Lc4pck" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Apparently, the ideas originated on <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/30046/alternative-notation-for-exponents-logs-and-roots" target="_blank">a Math Stack Exchange thread</a> asking for more unified notations for exponents, logarithms and radicals. Indeed, while these formulas $2^3 = 8$, $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$ and $\log_2 8 = 3$ are all discussing the same relationship that holds between 2, 3 and 8, they look so different that a student may not witness their commonality.</p>
<p>I see. So, the question is whether there could be a more explicit notations to unify and better visualize this relationship…</p>
<p>Yes indeed. One alternative notation has gained much interest. It is the so-called <strong>Triangle of Power</strong>. In our case, this triangle of power can depict the relationship between 2, 3 and 8 in a wonderfully compact and harmonious way, namely by denoting $_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8$.</p>
<p>And that triangle $_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8$ is a formula?</p>
<p>No! It’s more like an identity in itself. To perform computations, it might be useful to move one of the entries of the triangle to the other side of an equal sign as follows:<br>
$$_2\overset{3}{\Delta}_8 \Longleftrightarrow \; _2\overset{3}{\Delta} = 8\Longleftrightarrow \overset{3}{\Delta}_8 = 2\Longleftrightarrow \; _2\Delta_8 = 3.$$</p>
<p>3Blue1Brown argues that this beautiful notation greatly simplifies the understanding of the mathematical underlying objects, namely exponents, logarithms and radicals. This claim is quite disturbing at first. Indeed, again and again, I had to translate the equations of his video into equations in terms of the notations I am more familiar with. I could not think in terms of the triangle of power.</p>
<p>So you think it’s a bad notation…</p>
<p>Actually, no. This just helped realize how dependent on current flawed notations my mathematical thinking was! That’s not good! Moreover, I did get stunned by some of the many artful equations that this new notation yielded, e.g.<br>
$$_x\overset{y}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{y}{\Delta}}, \; _x\overset{_x\Delta_z}{\Delta}_z, \; _{\overset{y}{\Delta}_z}\overset{y}{\Delta}_z, \; \overset{+}{\Delta}_\times, \;  _\times\Delta_\times, \; _\times\overset{\oplus}{\Delta}, \; _x\overset{y}{\Delta} = \overset{1/y}{\Delta}_x, \; _{_x\overset{y}{\Delta}}\overset{z}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{yz}{\Delta}}, \; _x\Delta_y \; _y\Delta_z = \; _x\Delta_z, \; _e\overset{i\tau}{\Delta}_1, \; _e\overset{i\tau/4}{\Delta}_i \ldots $$</p>
<p>By the end of the video, I got hooked.</p>
<p>Even though you couldn’t follow the computations…</p>
<p>That’s true. And it would have been hypocritical of me to claim that they were indeed the way to go, if I had not yet experienced the actual benefaction of using and thinking in terms of this triangle of power. Following 3Blue1Brown’s advice, it seemed that the only way for me to do so is to go explore and play with the triangle of power. So I gave myself homeworks.</p>
<p>What homework?</p>
<p>I’ve decided to redefine and rederive well-known results about exponents, logarithms and radicals. And since I love the web, I couldn’t not share it with you.  Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Defining the Triangle of Power</h2>
<p>Let us start from the bottom. We’ll assume that integers and real numbers have been well-defined, as well as the addition and the multiplication. In this section, we’ll redefine the triangle of power $_x\overset{y}{\Delta}_z$ for all $x,z &gt; 0$ and $y \in \mathbb R$. It won’t be straightforward though. The first step is to define the triangle of power for top integer values of $y$, then for top rational values, and finally we shall use continuity to generalize it for real tops.</p>
<p>OK… Let’s start with integer tops.</p>
<p>Let’s define $_x\overset{n}{\Delta}$ for all $x &gt; 0$ <a href="http://www.science4all.org/article/proof-by-induction/" target="_blank">by induction</a> on $n$. For $n=0$, we define $_x\overset{0}{\Delta}_1$, and we consider the induction $_x\overset{n\pm 1}{\Delta}_{x^{\pm 1} \times \overset{n}{_x\Delta}}$. We indeed use the “+” sign to define induction over positive integers, and the “-” sign for induction over negative integers.</p>
<p>Wait… Are you sure you’ve given an actual inductive definition?</p>
<p>Getting used to the meaning of the compact triangle-of-power notation is likely to be troublesome at first. What we really mean in terms of equations is that we define respectively $_x\overset{0}{\Delta} = 1$ and $_x\overset{n\pm1}{\Delta} = x^{\pm1} \times\; _x\overset{n}{\Delta}$. More generally, we have<br>
$$_x\overset{n}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{n}{\Delta} = y\Longleftrightarrow \overset{n}{\Delta}_y = x\Longleftrightarrow \; _x\Delta_y = n.$$ From this definition, it follows straightforwardly that $_1\overset{n}{\Delta}_1$, $\;_x\overset{m+n}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \times\, _x\overset{n}{\Delta}$, $\; _x\overset{-n}{\Delta} = \;_{1/x}\overset{n}{\Delta} = \;\left( _x\overset{n}{\Delta} \right)^{-1}$ and that $x \mapsto \;_x\overset{n}{\Delta}$ is strictly increasing for $n \geq 1$ (and thus injective).</p>
<p>I think I follow…</p>
<p>Take your time. These notations can be very troubling.</p>
<p>Sure. You can move on.</p>
<p>Let us now a prove our first beautiful theorem. For $x&gt;0$ and $n,m\in \mathbb Z$, we have $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{mn}{\Delta}}$. I cannot help to comment on how cool I think that this elegantly structured notation is a theorem! We prove this by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ boils down to the definition of the triangle of power for zero top value. Assuming that the result holds for $n$, we now have, using the induction definition of the triangle of power, $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n+1}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \; \times\, _{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m}{\Delta} \times\, _x\overset{mn}{\Delta} = \;_x\overset{m(n+1)}{\Delta}$. This equality can be equivalently rewritten as $_{_x\overset{m}{\Delta}}\overset{n+1}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{m(n+1)}{\Delta}}$, which concludes the induction proof.</p>
<p>There is elegance in the notation indeed…</p>
<p>I know! Here’s another beautiful theorem. For all $x,y &gt; 0$ and $m,n \in \mathbb Z$, we have $_x\overset{n}{\Delta}_{y} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{mn}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. Using the previous result, we see that the right-hand side is equivalent to $_{_x\overset{n}{\Delta}}\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. For the left-to-right implication we can replace the left of the main triangle by $y$, yielding $_y\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$, which is equivalent to $_y\overset{m}{\Delta} = \; _y\overset{m}{\Delta}$, which is clearly true. To go from right to left, we notice that $z = y$ is a solution of $_z\overset{m}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{m}{\Delta}}$. Yet the map $z \mapsto \; _z\overset{m}{\Delta}$ is injective, thus it is the only solution. Thus $_x\overset{n}{\Delta} = y$, which concludes the proof for positive integers $n$. </p>
<p>Cool! And I guess that the case for negative integers $n$ is dealt with similarly.</p>
<p>Yes! The theorem we’ve just proved can now be used to define the triangle power for rational tops. For $p \in \mathbb Z$ and $q \in \mathbb Z^*$, we define $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_{y}$ if $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}}$. To prove the consistency of this definition, we need to make sure that it holds for any $p’,q’$ instead of $p,q$, whenever $p’/q’ = p/q$. To prove this it suffices to show that $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_{y} \Longleftrightarrow _x\overset{kp/kq}{\Delta}_y$, i.e. $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{kq}{\Delta}}$. But this boils down to applying the two previous theorems. Indeed, $_x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow\; _x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}}\overset{k}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \;_x\overset{kp}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{kq}{\Delta}}$.</p>
<p>Cool! Top integers, checked. Top rationals, checked. All we have left to define are top reals!</p>
<p>Yes. But to get there, we’ll need to first prove another beautiful theorem: $_x\overset{p/q}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{p}{\Delta}_{_y\overset{q}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _x\overset{p}{\Delta} = \; _y\overset{q}{\Delta} \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{q}{\Delta}_{_x\overset{p}{\Delta}} \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{q/p}{\Delta}_x$. In other words, by fixing $r = p/q$, we obtain the reflection theorem. For $x,y &gt; 0$ and $r \in \mathbb Q^*$, we have $_x\overset{r}{\Delta}_y \Longleftrightarrow \; _y\overset{1/r}{\Delta}_x$. This is so pretty! Moreover, by continuity, in the next section, we’ll see that this holds for nonzero real tops as well.</p>
<p>Are we now ready to define the triangle of power for top reals?</p>
<p>Almost! We now need to prove that for any $x\geq 1$, we have $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \rightarrow 1$. Notice to start with that $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \geq 1$. Now we consider $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Then it is easy to see that $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{n}{\Delta} \rightarrow \infty$. In particular, there exists $N$ large enough so that $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{N}{\Delta} \geq x$. Moreover, for $n \geq N$, we have $_{1+\epsilon}\overset{n}{\Delta} \geq x$. By montonicity of the triangle power, this means that $1+\epsilon \geq \overset{n}{\Delta}_x = \;_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \geq 1$. This corresponds exactly to saying that $_x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \rightarrow 1$. Using $_{1/x}\overset{1/n}{\Delta} = \left(\; _x\overset{1/n}{\Delta} \right)^{-1}$ and monotonocity, we can generalize this result for all $x&gt;0$ and rational top. Namely, for any $x&gt;0$ and $\epsilon &gt;0$, there exists some $\delta&gt;0$ such that for any rational $r \in (1-\delta,1+\delta) \cap \mathbb Q$, we have $\left|\;_x\overset{r}{\Delta} – 1\right| \leq \epsilon$.</p>
<p>In other words, the right side of the triangle of power is sort of continuous with respect to rational tops.</p>
<p>This is almost what we’ve proved, and exactly where I’m going with that! Let’s show that if a rational sequence $r_n$ converges, then, for all $x &gt; 0$, the sequence $_x\overset{r_n}{\Delta}$ converges too. We have $ \left| \; …</p></div></div>

That's why blockchains are built to enable censorship-free financial access.</p><p>As CoinDesk noted <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-wallet-regulations-industry-pros">in a recent analysis of the situation</a>, there exists a revealing difference in the language used to refer to crypto wallets by regulators and crypto investors.</p><p>Regulators call crypto wallets <em>unhosted wallets,</em> whereas investors refer to them as <em>self-hosted wallets</em>. The difference here is all about privacy — crypto users believe in financial independence, freedom from oversight, and digital asset autonomy.</p><p>On the other hand, an unhosted wallet points to the view that such wallets lack hosting — a situation that should be remedied by regulation and the cooperation of centralized institutions.</p><p>This seemingly small difference in language does indeed point to a large divide in exactly how each side views the purpose of storing crypto assets.</p><p>As Armstrong noted in his original Twitter thread, the crypto industry has been preparing for this eventuality for at least a few months. In fact, they've known long enough to form a lobby, and have responded to the rumors by sending the US Treasury a plea to leave crypto alone.</p><p>The regulation is expected to come into effect before the year's end, mostly owing to the US election results and the impending changing of the guard. As such, the rush is on for Mnuchin to push through regulations before time is up.</p><p>Does data-collection on self-hosted crypto wallets amount to the US government declaring a ban on cryptocurrency wallets we know them?</p><p><strong>Not really</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, can the government enforce these regulations and push people onto the centralized platforms decentralized blockchains were built to avoid?</p><p>The answer there is clearer: <strong>certainly not.</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606858594054_28135"><div>
